      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the reports appearing in certain foreign daily newspapers to the effect that permission has been granted by the Government of Eire to Air France Transatlantique to carry out test flights from the Shannon airport, he will state whether such permission is of a temporary or permanent nature, and whether the consent of the other parties entitled to use the airport was obtained; furthermore, if he will give an assurance that no foreign power will be allowed to use the Shannon air base or any of the Irish territorial waters for any purpose except with the permission of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>An application has been received for permission for Air France Transatlantique to fly over and land in Ireland in the course of a number of experimental flights over the North Atlantic in 1938.  The Irish Government have informed the French Government that they are prepared to accede to this application.  The permission to be granted to Air France Trans-atlantique to carry out test flights from the Shannon airport will be of a temporary nature, and apply only to certain experimental flights this year. As provided for in the arrangements made at Ottawa in November, 1935, agreement between the Governments concerned has been obtained for these experimental flights.  I assume the second part of the question refers to the use of Irish territory by foreign <Col N="792" /> Government aircraft.  This matter is dealt with by Regulation 75 of the Air Navigation (General) Regulations, 1930, which provides that no foreign Government aircraft shall fly over or land in this country save on the express invitation or with the express permission of the Government.</P>

      <P>With reference to what was under discussion last night, <Col N="797" /> I want to impress on the Minister that there is a duty imposed upon him, because of what he and the Taoiseach have told the House from time to time, to keep those officers in the Army for some time at least.  From what we heard from the Minister and the Taoiseach, it seems that we are day after day preparing for war.  If we are I think that those men who have spent their lives in the Army, and spent some time previously in the service of the country when there was urgent need for such men, ought to be kept on.  I ask the Minister to consider the matter seriously before he shoves those men out with a pension of two-thirds or something of that sort.  The whole trend of what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence have said is that we are fast preparing for war.  What are we going to defend?  Are we going to defend this country, and against whom?  These are questions I would like the Minister to answer.</P>
      <P>What is going to be the cost in the future?  We have no idea; we have not even got a plan from the Minister; there is nothing in detail as to what is going to take place in regard to defence during the next 12 months. We would like to know what is in the Minister's mind so far as defence is concerned.  I should like him to tell us whether there is going to be co-operation with the British forces.  I am sure that no one on this side of the House will blame the Minister if he tells us the truth now, before there are any further commitments.  One must assume from the existing position that there are going to be many more commitments, and we should like some definite assurance on the matter from the Minister.  I should like to put some questions to the Minister with reference to the Military Service Pensions Act of 1934.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I shall ask the Minister to keep in mind the welfare of the country.  Think of the country and forget about political matters. The people in the country have to live, and that is the point that should be foremost in the Minister's mind.  If the Government think along those lines, perhaps they will do better than in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if it would be apposite for a person who, in this matter, primarily represents the tax-paying community, to say a word?  This Estimate is naturally one in which technical knowledge plays no small part.  Nevertheless, apart from the technical interest that soldiers and military men may take in the defence problems that present themselves at the present time, the people of the country must ultimately pay, and we must keep in our minds, when we are looking at these problems, the fact that in certain countries in Europe to-day the people are being required to choose between guns and butter.  In some of those counties it is regarded as high treason to choose butter.  If you choose butter you go to an internment camp.  Now, we are all aware, whether we are technicians in this matter or not, of the modern development in armaments and of the immense growth of armaments in the last five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary problem of defence in this country is what we would do if our territory were threatened by a foreign invader.  I would be very much obliged to the Minister for Defence if he would tell us now what is the general policy of the Government in that contingency. Is it to resist invasion?  Is it to build up armaments here which would give an invader a formidable fight before he got in, because, speaking purely as a citizen and as one inexperienced in military technique, I submit that is an entirely unattainable objective and that our attitude before the world should be that we have no desire to <Col N="799" /> invade any country, that we have no desire to acquire any territory, that with our resources, we are not in a position to resist any invader who proposes to enter our territory, but that we fix all and sundry with notice that no matter how powerful they are, if they invade Ireland they embark, not on a 100 years war, but on a 700 years war, if necessary, and fix them with notice also that we were invaded by Britain in the year 1172 and that though it took some time to get them out, we shifted them finally in 1921.  Accordingly, we should inform them that if anybody wants to invade us in 1938, we do not propose to bluff or pretend for a moment that we have resources effectively to resist the modern army of a powerful State, but that by invading us they start a 700 years war, that we will start mobilising the Irish race from one end of the world to the other, that we will use our immense spiritual empire all over the world to assail them from every quarter we can and that we are prepared to take our chances in the long run.  It may take time, it may involve suffering, but by the time they have digested us they will have indigestion, and they will be well advised not to undertake the invasion of this country at all.</P>
    <P>Now, in my judgment&mdash;and I submit this with respect to the Minister who is a military man&mdash;in the existing state of the world that is a far more effective defence for this country than for us to be blustering round and suggesting that we are able to repel an invader fully equipped, because we are not.  We have not got the money or the resources to purchase the requisite materials to repel such an invader.  I think we are standing on the soundest defence that any small nation could have if we are able to say to an invader: &ldquo;If you want to invade this country you are going to start a war, not only in Ireland but in every country all over the world where there are Irishmen.  It is a war that will be carried on, on the economic front, on the propaganda front, and on every front on which we think we can carry it on.  We have demonstrated very cogently before the world our ability <Col N="800" /> to carry on such a war against a most powerful military Power located 30 miles away.  If any Power, 500 or 600 miles away tries the same game they will find it much more difficult and even less profitable, if that were possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A second situation arises.  If we take up that position I believe that we are in a very strong position, because we immediately discharge ourselves from the obligation of spending countless millions on futile defences, because the best that we could afford would be futile in the face of a wealthy nation's attack.  We deliver ourselves from the deplorable obligation of ever having to ask our people to choose between guns and butter. We simply turn to the big guns and we say: &ldquo;We decline to enter that race; it is a race we cannot win; it is a race we do not want to win, and it is a race we do not have to win, because we can fight any war that starts, and we will last longer than the other fellow in the heel of the hunt.&rdquo;  But then a second consideration arises. The Prime Minister has said here, and said, I think, with the approval of all sides of the House, that this territory will not be used as a jumping-off ground for attack on Great Britain. He said that very explicitly.  That undertaking has been very warmly received in Great Britain.  It made a great impression in Great Britain and I have no doubt contributed to the improved feelings that exist between the two countries at present.</P>
    <P>Suppose Great Britain comes to us and says: &ldquo;While we admit that your best defence is to fix the world with notice that anyone who invades your territory embarks on a 700 years war, that is not going to be convenient for us.  If one of our potential enemies is waging that 700 years war on you, we shall feel the breeze through our back-door and we do not want to feel that breeze.  We do not want any powerful nation to get a foothold in your territory.&rdquo;  Our reply, it seems to me, should be: &ldquo;Neither do we, but we cannot stop them.  We should get them out sooner or later, but we cannot stop them coming in.&rdquo;  Great Britain then says: &ldquo;Well, we want you to stop them.  We want you not only to concern yourselves with the <Col N="801" /> ultimate vindication of your own sovereignty, but we want you to concern yourself with the interior protection of our flank.  It would greatly jeopardise that flank of ours to have this foreign enemy on your territory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we are entitled to say to Great Britain in these circumstances: &ldquo;We have made our plans for defence. We have considered our resources.  We have made up our minds that the only effective way to defend our territory is by a combination of arms, propaganda, economic pressure and a mobilisation of the Irish race throughout the world.  You want for your protection an entirely different line of defence, but it is for your protection, and if you ask us to equip an immensely expensive armed machine, immensely expensive gun emplacements, immense stores of ammunition, in fact, an adequate force to repel an invasion until such time as your army can come to our aid and drive the invader out, then you ought to pay for it.  That is a scheme of defence primarily concerned with your safety and not with ours.  We are quite prepared to help you in pursuance of the Prime Minister's undertaking that this country will not be used for a jumping-off ground.  We are quite prepared to help.  We are quite prepared to enter into some kind of negotiations with you but we are not prepared to authorise you to come in and take over the defence of this country under any circumstances, any more than France would permit you to come in and take over the defence of her country.  But, if you say to us, `In addition to the plans you have in mind for the protection of your territory, we want you to equip yourselves to repel an invader, we want you to create an Irish Army and Irish bases from which to conduct resistance to a foreign invader, our reply is, `We are quite prepared to do it, but you must pay for it because that part of the defence would be primarily designed for your protection and if that part of the defence is an essential part of any joint plan that may emerge from consultations between your general staff and our general staff, then, while we are quite prepared to finance the expense of the <Col N="802" /> defence that our general staff think requisite for the protection of our territory; if there are further measures that the joint general staffs consider requisite for the protection of your territory, albeit that they are to be taken by the Irish Army and Irish Government and that their maintenance and development are to be an Irish responsibility, if they are to be done for your protection then you ought to pay for them.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that that is not a chiselling or mean or unreasonable attitude for this country to take up.  Our obligation is to defend our own territory.  I think, very wisely, we realise that it is not in the interest of this country, nor in the interest of democracy, nor in the interest of individual liberty anywhere in the world, to see Great Britain or the Commonwealth of Nations destroyed. I say quite definitely and plainly that the interest of the Commonwealth of Nations is Ireland's interest.  I say quite definitely and plainly that the preservation of the sovereignty, independence and integrity of the Commonwealth of Nations is Ireland's interest.  But in the joint problems of defence there should be joint responsibility for expense.  Each of the sovereign States-members of that Commonwealth has the obligation to defend its own territory.  If any one of those States-members turns to a fellow State-members to ask for its aid, then it should be prepared to finance at least part of the cost.</P>
    <P>So far I have referred to the defence problem arising out of the possibility of invasion&mdash;a remote possibility, not completely remote, not so completely remote as some Deputies might perhaps imagine.  But there is another aspect of defence upon which I should like to hear the Minister when he comes to reply.  Apart from the actual prospect of invasion, there is the modern technique of demoralising the community by aerial attack, striking at vital points by aerial attack.  We are in future going to have in this territory the Rhynana air base, we are going to have the oil refinery in Dublin, we are going to have Ardnacrusha, and we may have one or two <Col N="803" /> other tactical factories of that kind which might become military objectives which a foreign Government at war with Great Britain or at war with this country might be seriously concerned to destroy.</P>
    <P>What do we propose to do to meet that?  I think we ought to face that problem for ourselves.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister what the Government's view is, first, on the cost and feasibility of adequate anti-aircraft defence.  I am told of a new gun which the British Government have just evolved and are at present equipping their vital centres with&mdash;I think it is called the 3.7&mdash; which is a great advance in efficiency on any anti-aircraft gun yet produced. I will be interested to know whether the Minister has entered into negotiations with the British Government in order to secure supplies of that gun for our defence here and if he thinks we will be able to get supplies from the British manufacturers, or a licence to manufacture, if he proposes to establish the munition works here of which he was speaking some months ago.  Secondly, I should like to ask the Minister, if we contemplate any expansion of our armed forces at all, whether we should not concentrate on our aerial arms rather than on infantry or land forces.</P>
    <P>It is manifest, with our population, that if it becomes a question of mere numbers we cannot compete with any European nation at all.  But, if it be a question of courage, daring, and skill, such as is involved in aerial warfare, then I think we can put up as good a show as any of them, and I would be happy to think that our anti-aircraft defences were supported by an adequate air force.  After all, if we had a fairly good air force in this country, we could advance to meet any invading fleet of bombers that was advancing upon our territory and put up a very good show; put up so good a show that we might make it extremely difficult for any advancing air fleet, which had to cross Great Britain to reach this country at all.  If, having treaded its way over the British defences, it had to meet a really <Col N="804" /> formidable Irish air fleet over our own coast, I think we might reasonably hope to repel that type of aggressor who was trying to violate the integrity of our territory.</P>
    <P>I do not think that can be done overnight, but if we plan to do it ultimately, the sooner we put our hand to the task the better.  Aeroplanes take time to get, but difficult as it is to get supplies of aeroplanes, it is infinitely more difficult to train pilots.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's expert view, but I should imagine that the really vital difficulty about building up an air force is not so much getting machines as training the men and having supplies of well-trained pilots. That will certainly take time, but I am sure the material is there, and if we approach it in the same way as the British Government has done and make it an attractive profession which would draw the best type of men, I do not see why we should not have as good an air force here, in proportion to our resources, as any country in the world.</P>
    <P>There is one small matter and another matter of wider import to which I should like to refer before concluding.  How much importance should we attach to the appearance of troops who are not on formal parade? All of us are jealous of the high reputation of the National Army.  All of us would be anxious that the Volunteers would present a creditable and dignified appearance.  No one expects men to come off manoeuvres as neat as a pin; no army could, and they probably would not have done their duty at manoeuvres if they did.</P>
    <P>But, ordinarily, when troops on the move, not at manoeuvres, but on the move from barracks to barracks, are walking in uniform, they are generally appearing as members of the State forces.  Is it a desideratum that their appearance should be as neat and tidy as one would expect the appearance of a member of the Gárda Síochána to be?  I suggest that it is, and I would be interested to hear from the Minister if, in his judgment, the troops and the Volunteers recently have come up to his expectations in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> I know, and am glad to say, that one does meet fellows wearing both uniforms who arrest one's attention by their admirable appearance, and I am sorry to say that the way they look causes one sometimes to think how much better others might look if they took as much care of their external appearance as these fellows do.  It may be that the Minister will reply that that is not a primary consideration in the Army: that the men in the Army have more to think of than keeping themselves as neat as pins.  But I think it does matter.  I think that from the general point of view of morale and discipline it must help them.  I admit that I know little of the internal affairs of an army.  On that matter, the Minister is qualified to speak where I am only fit to ask the questions.</P>
    <P>The last thing I am interested to hear the Minister on is this: if we are to turn our backs, as I think we must turn our backs, definitely on the proposal to build up a vast army in this country simply because we could not pay it, maintain it or equip it, should we not concentrate on building up an immensely efficient army of small units which would excel in their particular sphere.  If we are to do that, can we afford to dispense with some of the officers who have helped to build that army up, hold it together and establish its morale during the difficult years through which we have passed? I would very much like to see our army of the future built up into a small efficient organisation, consisting of a number of units, each one specialising in its own particular sphere&mdash;there are now so many spheres in ordinary army life&mdash;and each one being the very best of its kind.  I think that would be an ambition worthy of the country.  I think that is the kind of army of which we might be legitimately proud.  We can never stage military reviews like Berlin, Rome or Moscow, and I do not think that we want to.  I do not think that we should be proud to be able to do so, but I do think it would be something of which we might be legitimately proud if we had a comparatively small body of technicians who would be equal to any military problems that might be propounded to <Col N="806" /> them, and from whom could be drawn a general staff second to none in Europe.  That would take time, and involve some difficulty in giving them the kind of training requisite to reach that degree of efficiency.  But, unless we set some objective before us, we will get nowhere at all.  We will simply be running round in circles and wasting our time.</P>
    <P>I would be interested if the Minister could tell us what exactly he envisages as the ideal towards which the Irish Army should aim.  My ideal would be to see a series of small units, the best of their kind in the world, concentrating on the technical sides of military science, and proving themselves to be a body from which a general staff might be drawn that might compare favourably with the general staff of any army in the world.  I do not think that is impossible.  In fact, I think it is quite possible if we put our minds to it.  That is the road along which, I think, we should travel, definitely rejecting as technically and politically unsound all &ldquo;ballyhoo&rdquo; and &ldquo;hullabaloo&rdquo; about building up a mighty defence force in this country calculated to repel all-comers.  That should not be the line of country that we should travel.  If, as a result of consultation, it becomes desirable to meet the threat of invasion by forces adequate to repel it until such time as our allies are in a position to throw irresistible assistance into the field, then our allies should be consulted as to what they are prepared to do to foot the bill.  If that is not the plan, then we should turn our back on that kind of thing altogether, realising our impotence to resist violence by violence in the existing state of the world, and take refuge in the absolute safety that we ultimately have by our record as being able to carry on a war of independence for ever, if that were necessary, but, in fact, to the point of exhaustion of anybody who attempts to conquer this country.</P>

      <P>The Chair deprecates the use of the designation <Col N="807" />&ldquo;Prime Minister&rdquo; in debate. Article 28 of the Constitution, Section 5, sub-section (1º), runs:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Head of the Government, or Prime Minister, shall be called, and is in this Constitution referred to as, the Taoiseach.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Throughout the rest of the Constitution, the Head of the Government is so styled.  In accordance with that Article Standing Orders were considered at a meeting of the Committee of Procedure and Privileges.  The Standing Orders were amended, submitted to, and approved of by the House.  Taking a few examples at random, Deputies will find in Standing Orders Nos. 16, 22 and 81 that the Head of the Government is referred to as the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the appeal made by Deputy Hurley to the Minister for consideration for those sections of the civilian population now disemployed by the change over.  The Deputy referred to Crosshaven, at the extreme end of the constituency which we both represent. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle have now been taken over.  It was the procedure with the British when they held these forts to carry on work of very considerable importance.  They carried on works of maintenance on which large numbers of the civilian population on the mainland were employed.  As a result of the change over, these people are now very seriously affected, apart altogether from the loss of the very considerable sums of money which used to be spent by the officers of the British forces in Cobh and other places abutting on the forts.  That represents a considerable loss.  If the Minister is to disregard the position in which these people, already severely hit, have been placed, their position, of course, will become very much worse.  A number of widows and other members of the civilian population are seriously affected.  It is urgent that consideration be given to their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also say that there is a very well-equipped hospital on the island, and that up to the time of the change over skilled medical services <Col N="808" /> were provided.  I would like to know from the Minister if it is the intention to maintain that hospital. If there is to be a considerable number of the national forces stationed there, then I think this well-equipped hospital should be maintained.  I would also like to know if it is the intention of the Minister to spend money on the upkeep of works of maintenance at the forts.  The forts must be considered, I suppose, as a national asset from the point of view of defence.  It would be advisable, I think, to keep them in a state of repair.  One of the things I should also like to know is if our Army authorities have acquired the steamers and other equipment necessary for carrying on communication with the mainland or if they will have to provide new equipment if the British remove the equipment that was there. The provision of such equipment would involve considerable expenditure and it would be interesting to know whether the expensive equipment there has been acquired by the Defence Department.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in his speech, described our relations with Great Britain.  Although his references were very vague, I hope for the best, having regard to the cordial send-off to the British Troops when the No. 2 Army Band played the British national anthem.  These are courtesies which one section of a brave people pay to a section of another brave people, and it indicates cordial relations.  I sincerely hope that these cordial relations will be maintained and that the fears of the Taoiseach&mdash;that we would have a dispute with Great Britain and that we might have to contemplate the defence of our shores against a British invasion&mdash;will not be realised.  In the event of our having to face a foreign Power, the co-operation of Britain would, I take it, be assumed by this country.  It is probable that some division of the expenses would have to be arranged in such an event.  I take it that this division would be somewhat on the lines of those in relation to the Great War as laid down in the Act of 1920.  The expenses of this country would then be about £18,000,000 a year.  I do not think that <Col N="809" /> any of us would feel happy at the invasion of this country by a very large Power if we had not the co-operation of a neighbour with whom we hope to have friendly relations.  The Taoiseach left the position in a very vague way, and perhaps the Minister would be more precise.  The Army is, as a general rule, looked upon by a large section of the taxpayers as a rather expensive luxury.  In time of war, its numbers would probably have to be considerably increased in the same way as the British regiments were strengthened by the addition of a number of battalions.  In any event, we must expect a greatly increased Vote for the Army in future as we are taking responsibility for extra equipment for the ports.  We must also, to a certain extent, rule out the possibility of co-operation from Great Britain which we would, undoubtedly, have if they possessed these ports and if they had their gun-boats in our harbours.  We do not know what the future of the navy will be in this country, and a little more explicit information would be appreciated by the general public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that most of the old soldiers of the Republican and National Armies took part in this debate.  The debate should be taken very seriously because we are really at a turning point in Irish history.  In the past, we had the cry that England's difficulty was Ireland's opportunity.  That day has gone.  Britain and Ireland are friends and, in the future, England's difficulty will be Ireland's difficulty, so that in our present position we have a grave responsibility.  I believe it is the duty of the whole House to combine in putting up a plan of defence so that we shall all be able to move together.  We cannot have our defence plans properly defined until Ireland is united.  I think that a united effort should be made in the near future&mdash; at least before a European war breaks out&mdash;to have Ireland a nation once again.  I think that the goodwill between Britain and Ireland will bring that about and that we will have an Ireland strong and vigorous, friendly <Col N="810" /> with our neighbour across the water and able to help her in her difficulties, because her difficulties in the future will be our difficulties.</P>
      <P>In the past, England behaved brutally to this country, but we would prefer to-day to see England where she is, to seeing Germany, France or Russia there.  The safety of these islands&mdash;the British Isles and Ireland&mdash;depends on definite co-operation and agreement, and I think there is no reason why we should not have that co-operation and agreement.  If England goes down, we will certainly go down with her.  I should like the Taoiseach to declare openly that he is part and parcel of the British Commonwealth of Nations&mdash; that he is out to get what he can out of it, and to give what he can to it. That is the attitude I should like to see him adopt in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>If we knew where we were, a good deal more could be done. I think we all do agree that we are part and parcel of the Commonwealth, and, that being so, must take our part in Imperial defence.  However, Ireland is a poor nation, and is not able to contribute very much to that defence scheme.  If we are to share in Imperial defence, it is Britain's duty to give us the money to defend the country&mdash;to give us back some of the £400,000,000 which the Taoiseach said she had robbed us of.  She should give us at least £50,000,000 of that sum, and thus give us the means of putting our country in a state of defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing the country should do is realise what it owes to one man&mdash;a man who lies in his grave to-day, the first Commander-in-Chief, General Michael Collins.  His name is not heard to-day, although he served the country nobly, faithfully and well.  He was the friend of members of the Fianna Fáil Party as he was of us.  He died while going on a message of peace to comrades in the country.  We have had a civil war since then, but I am glad to <Col N="811" /> say that the bitterness of that war is over.  We are united in declaring General Michael Collins our great Commander-in-Chief, and his anniversary should be properly celebrated because of the great work he did for the country.  Due respect should be paid to his memory in that way.  If we did that, we would be uniting the old Republican Army and encouraging them to serve Ireland as they served her in the past.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the old Republican Army, or the remand of it in the country to-day, should be consulted on this matter of defence, because we must realise that we are sitting in this House solely by reason of these endeavours and the deeds of these great men.  They are to-day a scattered force.  Some of them belong to my side and some of them to the other side.  Nobody seems to want them, but we should remember that we are sitting here because of their valour.  I think they should be brought into a united body and asked to assist in the defence of this country.  We have seen that we can agree on several things.  Why not agree on giving this remnant the lights which are its due?</P>
    <P>With regard to the Army, I think that what is necessary at the head of the Army are seasoned and veteran soldiers.  I understand that the Minister has a plan whereby he is going to get rid of the old warriors who have reached the age of 45 or 50 years.  That would be the most serious blunder the Minister could make because recruits are useless in wartime.  What you want, then, is the seasoned soldier, the man who will stand up to his responsibilities, and, if necessary, die facing his responsibilities.  We have in our Army lieutenants and captains, veteran and seasoned soldiers who went through many campaigns in the Republican Army and the National Army, and who did their duty fearlessly and well.  When we had a change of Government here, many thought that the Irish Army would be shaken to its foundations, but it was the army of the people, and at the change-over, it stood loyal to the people and they will stand loyal to-morrow.  I think it <Col N="812" /> unfair that the Minister should think of changing those men at this stage in our history.  I tell him to leave them there and, in addition to bring in more seasoned soldiers, so that he may build up a proud little army that will do credit to itself and will always be loyal to the Government in power.  It is a grave injustice that the Minister should put these men out on a small pension at this hour of their lives.  They are men who are too old to make a start in private life and their pensions will be small, and, like the old Republican Army, they will be thrown on the scrap-heap.  I ask him to keep them on for five or 10 years more until we have built up an army that will defend this country, and I appeal to him to withdraw the order he is about to issue and allow those men to continue to serve their country, as they have served it, faithfully and well.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the ports but, to my mind, they mean nothing.  We all know that they are useless for defence, but they are of vital importance to Britain and if Britain wants those ports we will man them, but let her pay for them.  The most serious problem in this country in the event of a European war would be the Shannon scheme works.  It is the pivot of the entire industry of the country, and one bomb from a Hitler aeroplane could blow those works sky-high and disable every industry depending on them.  If we want a proper defence scheme we must first see that the Shannon scheme works are properly defended.  Another matter which we must seriously consider is the position of our civil population.  I am not satisfied that we have made any headway in the matter of their protection.  There is no use in saying that we can keep neutral in the next war.  We cannot, because if it suits Hitler to attack England through Ireland, or England to attack Germany through Ireland, that attack will come.  To-day you have an imperialist world, as you had in the old Roman days, and mighty nations care not a snap of the finger about small nations.</P>
    <P>We are glad to-day to be able to say that we are free after 700 years, but how long are we going to be free? <Col N="813" /> We do not know if we are going to hold our freedom for another 12 months, but while we have our freedom let us make the best use we can of it and devise means for keeping that freedom in the future.  The only means of getting our position of freedom properly established is by friendly relations with England, and you will never have those friendly relations and real co-operation until Ireland is united, free and strong, and definitely taking its part in the Commonwealth of Nations.  We are in the Commonwealth of Nations, whether we like it or not.  We can give something to it and we can also get something from it.  I think it a good place to be at present and I say that as an old Republican soldier, because there seems to be no other hope for this country except in a combination of those people who stand for the Cross and Christianity, and you have that in the Commonwealth.  You have Britain, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and Ireland&mdash;all people who are proud to fly the flag of Christianity.  We should endeavour to retain that combination, because with out it the Hitlers, the Stalins and the Mussolinis will certainly sweep across Europe and swallow us all.  The Minister need not be ashamed to say that he is in the Commonwealth and proud to be in it, and that he will do his part to build it up as a great Christian empire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to this debate yesterday evening, I was struck by a statement made by Deputy O'Higgins in reference to confused ideas.  I have listened to speakers from the Front Opposition Benches who have totally disagreed in their ideas as to what should constitute our defences.  I have listened to other speakers who would like to turn back the hands of the clock of history to zero hour, to the time when we should buckle on our armour and go out attacking other countries.  I listened to another speaker who was more concerned with settling Spanish quarrels than with fighting our battles at home.  I think the Taoiseach introduced a note of practical sanity into the debate when he stated that the job in front of the <Col N="814" /> Dáil was to discuss and make practical arrangements for the building up of an efficient defence force.  It is my opinion that the most practical work we could do would be to organise our manhood so that it could be most easily converted into a weapon of defence in times of national stress.  I have a few practical suggestions to make as to the lines along which this development should take place.  In connection with my first suggestion, I want to draw attention again to the fact that Deputy O'Higgins advocated a navy, while Deputy Dillon advocated concentration on our air force.  I am in agreement with Deputy Dillon rather than with Deputy O'Higgins on that point.  I think it is commonsense to face the fact that an air force in modern days is more important than a navy, and I think the countries which have had very powerful navies are also evidently of the same opinion.</P>
      <P>On the technical side of our defence forces, I suggest that such services as air and artillery services should be increased.  There should be intensive training in these special services by all ranks, whether officers of the regular Army, the reserve or the Volunteers. I was glad to see that provision is made in the Estimate for an increased Volunteer force, and I think the time is now opportune for an intensive drive towards a Volunteer force which would be worthy of the manhood of our country.</P>
      <P>I am afraid, in this connection, we have to recognise that in modern days it is not sufficient to appeal to the patriotic instincts of our youth in order to have them join the armed Volunteer forces.  Modern enticements have brought about that state of affairs, and I believe it will be necessary to make that force more attractive. I will come to that point in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the actual training of Volunteers I do not think that the present arrangements whereby you have weekly drills and annual training for a fortnight or a month is sufficient to make effective soldiers of the Volunteer force.  I think that the leaders of industry in the country and employers in general should be induced to <Col N="815" /> realise that facilities should be granted to the members of their staffs who are in the Volunteer forces.  They can, I am sure, realise that the possession of an efficient defence force is the greatest insurance policy which they could have.  In addition to that whatever loss they sustain by reason of the absence of these Volunteers during their period of training will be more than compensated for by the increased efficiency of these men when they return to work.</P>
    <P>In regard to training, I think it would make for more efficiency if when the annual camps are being established officers who have had intimate acquaintance with Volunteer units, and preferably Volunteer officers themselves who know the <i>personnel</i> of these units, were in charge.  The officers certainly should be in these camps, say, for a couple of days before the Volunteer units arrive to make sure that adequate arrangements are made for their reception.  I think, further, when Volunteer troops are under canvas, especially in inclement weather&mdash;and the weather is very inclement at times&mdash;that there should be boarded floors provided.  So far as food for the Volunteers is concerned, it is generally good, but I think there could be improved arrangements for the serving of the food.  In addition to that a bounty on the most generous scale possible should be granted to the Volunteers.</P>
    <P>There is much work that an increased Volunteer force could carry out.  The previous speaker, Deputy Giles, touched on the fringe of air-raid precautions.  I think the person would be an optimist who would expect immunity for this country, especially for the South-east and eastern parts of the country in the event of a European conflict.  I am glad to see that the taking of precautions has been recognised in the Estimates.  A sum of £1,000, which, of course, would not be adequate to deal with the problem, is being provided. At all events the existence of the problem has been recognised. The most suitable force for taking charge of anti-air-raid precautions <Col N="816" /> appears to be the Volunteer force because that force is scattered throughout every part of the country. That force can co-operate with other people in carrying on the precautions necessary whether these precautions will be dug-outs or the training of the people to deal with air raids when they occur.</P>
    <P>An increased Volunteer force will naturally require an increased number of officers to carry out their training. There are officers being trained in the Volunteer force.  There are other officers also.  I am aware that the officers in the Reserve have offered their services for the training which goes on at the moment in the Volunteer forces.  Many of these units are members of the old Officers Training Corps. These are highly distinguished graduates of our universities.  They are efficient soldiers and they are efficient also in the use of the Irish language. They are available and I take it when the question of promotions arises that they will get equal treatment with the other officers.</P>
    <P>There may be objections to the cost of an increased force of the type which I suggest.  On this question of cost I put it that if even more than the £600,000 which is being debated here on this Vote is required in order to provide an adequate defence force, the House should consider that problem of defence as not one for this generation alone.  This generation has done quite a lot and has made many sacrifices in order to achieve the position which we have achieved, a position which we must now guard, not alone for ourselves but for posterity.  We will not only maintain the position which we have attained but we will go the rest of the road.  I put it that if money is required for that type of expenditure, posterity could fairly be asked to bear their fair share.  At any rate whatever capital is expended at the present time on the Defence Forces and especially on increasing the Volunteer forces, will, in my opinion, return generous dividends to this nation. These dividends will be in disciplined youth who will be stronger in body and saner in mind perhaps and will be able to increase production in their <Col N="817" /> ordinary avocations in life.  In the next place, they will give us a defence force which will make it decidedly costly for any enemy that may at any time in the future attack us.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Taoiseach speaking on the defence policy yesterday, one could not help being struck with the air of artificiality, make-belief, hedging and attempting to hide the real conviction in his mind by his talk of the necessity to tackle a defence policy for this country.  We got no notion whatever of the Government's policy or plan for the defence of our territory in the light of the new situation that has arisen under the Agreement.  One could understand from Deputy Childers' speech that he knew a little about modern European history, particularly the history of the European small nations.  But he lacked completely the necessary application to tackle that question in a sound and practical manner.  What is the position here? This country since the Treaty seventeen years ago has been protected from outside attack by the British Government, not because of her interest in this country but because of the fact that in order to defend herself she must defend us.  I think, independent of our taking over the ports, that that policy is going to continue.  In so far as this country is in any danger from outside attack in the future, I think we will have to rely to a very large extent on the protection that the British Government can afford us.  Any sensible man must realise that we are not in a position to defend ourselves from any big European power.  We lack man-power; we lack national resources; we lack the financial capital to build up sufficient forces to defend this country of ours.</P>

      <P>There is little or no danger of our country being attacked here by a big European Power for the sole purpose of keeping this country as a possession, because no one is going to attempt to take this country so long as Britain remains one of the strongest Powers in Europe.  I think <Col N="818" /> that the only danger of attack here would be because of the geographical position of our country in relation to England.  As I have said, we will not be attacked by any country merely for the sake of taking this country as a possession, because so long as England is strong enough no other country would attempt to take our country merely for the sake of possessing it.  Therefore, the only danger of attack that we may anticipate here would be an attack for the purpose of attacking England.  On that account, I say that if any money is to be spent here on defence at least 90 per cent. of that cost ought to be borne by the British Government.</P>

    <P>We were told by the Taoiseach that in the Agreement there was no understanding whatever, no undertaking of any sort, nor any commitments as to the equipment of the three ports that had been handed over.  Now, I think that behind the mind of the Taoiseach yesterday, all the time, was a definite appreciation that we must have a definite understanding with the British Government with regard to defence, that we must have co-operation in defence with the British Government, and that we must have expert advice. A number of Deputies, in speaking here, have anticipated that those ports that have been taken over during the week are going to be equipped.  What purpose can those ports or those forts serve now that they have been taken over if they are equipped?  What sort of equipment is going to be put in, and what is the purpose of the equipment?  I remember reading a book a couple of years ago by a man who commanded Spike Island during the War.  He described the importance of that fort, and I came to realise that it was probably one of the most important forts under the British flag, because it commanded the big shipping and the big trade routes across the Atlantic.  There was a tremendous amount of submarine activity on that particular route during the war, off Spike Island, and the British Government maintained that fort for the purpose of sheltering a section of the Navy that operated for the protection of her shipping and <Col N="819" /> trade routes across the Atlantic.  Ships were brought in there for refuelling and for minor repairs that were carried out there, and thus these ships were enabled to go to sea again, and thus I realised that these ports were not for the purpose merely of coastal defence, but really for the purpose of sheltering the British Navy, and for the purpose of serving as an operating base for the British Navy.</P>
    <P>Now, do we propose to have a navy of our own here, and to use these ports as an operating base, or are we going to have an understanding with the British Government which would allow the British to operate their Navy from those bases?  If that is the intention, then I submit that 90 per cent., or even more, of the cost of equipment and maintenance of those forts, ought to be borne by the British Government. What other purpose can these forts serve?  If we are not going to have that understanding with the British Government, or if we are not going to have a navy of our own, then I believe that the three ports concerned are absolete.  If we are to regard the ports merely from the point of view of coastal defence, they are worthless or useless, and should not be equipped, because I do not see what other purpose they will serve.  Even if you were to man them with guns, I do not see how they could have any effect on our shipping.  One of these ports might be able to command the seas within, say, a few miles of our coast, but it would certainly not be able to protect us against any submarine menace against shipping connected with this country, and certainly would not protect this country from an attack from outside if an attack is contemplated from outside by a big Power, because, after all, three-fourths of our coast are unprotected, and these particular forts would only command a short distance along the coast.  For that reason, I believe that, unless there is a definite understanding and co-operation between the British Government and this country, any money spent on the equipment of these forts would be money wasted.</P>
    <P>Now, as I said, the only danger of attack on this country, to my mind, is the danger that we may be made the <Col N="820" /> medium of attack on the British, and the weakest point in British defence is her food lines that stretch across the world, and her most vulnerable point of attack is her food lines.  Britain is a big manufacturing country, and she is not able to supply her own requirements in food, and, therefore, has to import annually huge quantities of her food requirements. Hence, in time of war, the importation of food into England is a very serious problem for the British Government, and the necessity for the equipment and maintenance of a powerful Navy can be recognised on that account.  That Navy is equipped and maintained largely for the purpose of controlling the food lines of the world.  Britain's Navy must protect her food lines if she is to remain supreme.  Any Power, then, that succeeds in blockading England and destroying her food supplies, would immediately starve her out and bring about her defeat.</P>
    <P>Now, I agree with the policy, or the suggestion, that has been made here to the effect that, if any money is to be spent on defence, it ought to be spent on defence from aerial attack, and I think that where we are open to attack here is through our ports of embarkation&mdash;not the three ports that we are talking about now, but ports such as the ports of Dublin, of Cork, and all the other ports from which we export live stock and food to England.  I think that, in a time of war in which England might be involved, if there is any attack on England, there would be a corresponding attack on us, because we are a supplier of food to England, and that attack would be made directly in order to paralyse the possibility of this country supplying food to England during the war.  If England is involved in a war, it will be to our interest to maintain that supply of food to the British.  I think it will be acknowledged that it has been a great asset to this country in the past.</P>
    <P>On all sides of this House we have realised the importance of keeping that market.  The value of that market would be enhanced and increased during any war in which the British are involved.  Hence, I <Col N="821" /> realise that our one vulnerable point, the one place in this country which will be open to immediate attack if England is involved in a war, is our ports, our ports through which we send foodstuffs to England and through which we supply the British market with live stock and other products.  They would immediately, I think, be open to an aerial attack by an enemy country.  I think if we are going to spend any money on defence the first thing we ought to spend that money on is the defence of our ports, the defence of the ports of Dublin, Cork, Waterford and so on.  There ought to be some anti-aircraft guns erected at those ports to defend them from aerial attack.  We ought to have better means of defending ourselves from an aerial attack than we have at the present time.  We ought to have an improved air force.  In that way we are weak, as well as in probably every other branch of defence.  We cannot possibly hope to improve our strength in any other line of defence.  I believe we can greatly improve our strength in the air, and that it would be quite possible for us, within our financial power and our man power and our resources generally, to stave off an aerial attack. I think money spent in that direction would be money well spent in the interests of the country.  I believe that there ought to be definite understanding and co-operation between this country and the British Government as far as the equipment of the ports of Berehaven, Lough Swilly and Cobh, which have been taken over in the last few days, is concerned.  I think it would be wild foolishness to think of building up and equipping a navy here.  I think from the point of view of the taxpayer in this country it would be money wasted.  The burden of taxation on the country at the present time is a very serious one. Due consideration ought to be paid to any money that is going to be spent in the defence of this country.  We ought to have expert advice on the matter.  We must have the co-operation of the British, and we probably must have their advice as well in regard to any defence policy which we may adopt.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that there has been greater provision made for the Volunteer force in the present Estimate, because I consider that the Volunteer force will play a very important part in the future defence of this country, and I think it is the natural line of the Army to develop.  I have heard it suggested here that the Volunteer force is politically partisan; it has been suggested in this House that there is nobody a member of the new Volunteers unless he is also a member of Fianna Fáil.  Well, I can definitely state that, as far as I know, the Sluagh Committees in the West are comprised of people of all shades of political opinion.  The Volunteer force, as far as the West is concerned, has absolutely no political affiliations whatsoever, and is comprised of members with all shades of political opinion.  I think the Volunteer force is not large enough at present.  I should like to see it spreading. I would even suggest that the Minister go further and establish a younger force.  I do not suggest that the Minister should go so far as to establish some of those Hitler Youth Movements or anything like that, but I do suggest that if there were some movements started in co-operation with the schools, whereby the youngsters would get some idea of military training, it would certainly be no burden to them.  It would help to develop them physically, and when they came to a certain age they would be eligible for admission to the Volunteer force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see wherein lies the logic or the weight of the argument I have heard advanced in this House that because we are a small country we have no business making any attempt to defend ourselves.  I cannot see wherein lies the logic of the argument which says: &ldquo;Scrap your ports, because we are so small any of the great Powers could wipe us out. Scrap your Army, because we are so small it would be absurd for us to try and fight anybody.&rdquo;  If that argument had been used by the people of this country for centuries past there never would have been no I.R.A. force, and we never would have achieved the amount of freedom we have achieved.  If the people believed <Col N="823" /> in 1916: &ldquo;It is ridiculous for us to try to fight the British Empire; the British Empire is too great for us to break,&rdquo; would they ever have gone out and fought?  If the Irish people believed in all those years during which they struggled against that Power that simply because we were so small and weak, and they were so great and had such military strength behind them, we could not fight them, if they had listened to and believed the kind of argument we had here in this House, where would we be still? I suggest that during the last Great War we had a shining example of what small nations can do.  We all know of one small nation which held up possibly the greatest military Power on earth for quite a number of days, and I know that military experts believe that that may have been the turning point of the German fortunes, and may have been the cause of Germany losing the Great War.  It may be suggested that we have not a lot of man-power or a lot of wealth with which to defend ourselves.  It can also be suggested that we have not a big lot of territory to defend.  Surely it is our duty and should be the policy of the Army to defend our country as well as possible from all invaders. There have been suggestions here that nobody would attack us except some outside Power trying to get at England. I did not hear any Deputy dealing with the possibility of England coming back here again.  It may be suggested that that would never happen.  Possibly it might never happen, but I would remind the House that if England were involved in a great war in the morning she might consider coming back here again and stopping us from doing anything we might possibly be doing, or thinking of doing.  Is there not as great a possibility of this country being attacked by her, to protect her own interests, as there is of our being attacked from any other side in order to attack England?</P>
    <P>I suggest that our Volunteer force should be developed as strongly as possible, and that we in this country should, at all events, make as strong an attempt as lies in our power to <Col N="824" /> render it unprofitable for anybody to try and come in here.  If the Government say: &ldquo;We will not try to re-arm; we will not try to build up our forces,&rdquo; we are simply inviting invasion from every quarter.  It is all very fine to use propaganda, to rely on the fact that we are defenceless and ask all the nations to respect that position, but everybody will realise that, in the past, the guns were much more effective than propaganda.  I am sure everybody here will realise that in our age-old struggle it had to come to the guns; propaganda failed in this country.  I suggest that propaganda would fail in the morning if we had another war.  I suggest to the Minister that he should proceed with the Volunteer force, in particular, and make it as effective an army unit as it can possibly be made.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon's vision of a 700 years war is very alarming, and I think it must remain a vision, but the aspect on which he turned later is the right aspect, as to what war can be to-day, because we must remember that this country could be very severely dealt with without a single individual ever landing on any part of our territory.  With present high-speed bombers and heavy bombs, it is possible to do such damage as to make the country practically a wilderness. Deputy Dillon referred to Rhynana and to the oil refinery, but I am more inclined to agree with Deputy Hughes, that the first objective of any foreign power that desired to attack Great Britain would be the ports in this country.  We must remember that in the last war Germany spent considerable time and money on a U-boat campaign in an attempt to starve Great Britain.  If, by dropping a few bombs, they could deal with the ports here, so as to prevent any considerable quantity of food being exported to England, that would be very much more effective than the U-boat campaign, and less costly.  To my mind one of the difficulties about this Estimate is to discuss it intelligently, because we seem to have so very little knowledge of what the policy of the Government is going to be in these matters.  We do not know whether they have provided, or are about to provide suitable anti-aircraft defences <Col N="825" /> for the ports.  As far as I am aware we have no knowledge of the Government's policy on the question of mechanisation, a policy which is being carried on in practically every other army in the world.  Certain information can be had from the Estimates, which show that some £2,000 is to be spent on the purchase of horses, while £14,000 is allowed for the purchase of armoured cars.  There is more in mechanisation than armoured cars.  I am not at all sure that we should proceed too far with mechanisation.</P>
      <P>If guns are to be used it is probable that horse transport will be as effective as mechanised transport.  After all this country has a certain reputation for its horses, and the Army should do everything possible to maintain that reputation.  The Army jumping team is doing its part. Deputy Dillon referred to the appearance of the troops when off duty.  I wish to refer to the appearance of the troops at a Castle ceremony some two or three weeks ago.  I was very impressed by the appearance of the few horses that were there, but two or three of them did not seem suitable. I hope there will be an increase of ceremonial displays.  The position has been very drab in that respect, and there is plenty of room for such displays. If there is to be an increase in ceremonial displays, steps must be taken to train the cavalry horses, so that they will become accustomed to noise, shouting and flag-waving, as some of them on that occasion were extremely restless.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear what we have to defend ourselves against from the military point of view, but I am quite clear that the first thing we ought to make some attempt at defending is our intelligence. There is no use in frightening the lives out of people in an impoverished country, where the position is already bad enough, by making us convince ourselves that we can be half blown out of the sea by a foreign fleet, or that we can be half bombarded out of the country by aeroplanes bombing the City of Dublin and other places.  I take the other extreme, <Col N="826" /> whether as a matter of tactics or not, and I say that I do not believe this country runs any danger of being bombarded by a foreign fleet, and I do not believe the City of Dublin runs any danger of being bombed by foreign aeroplanes.  If that is pure, dangerous ignorance on my part, I submit that, as we are paying £1,700,000 yearly for the Army at the present time, and promising to pay more for it, we ought to get, at least, some return for that £1,700,000 and, the first thing we ought to receive is information.  From persons whom we may regard as the best technically informed people to give advice, we ought to receive it, as to what our dangers are.  We have no such information at present.</P>
      <P>If the Army is to be congratulated on anything or, if we, as a nation, are to be congratulated on anything in connection with the Army, it is on the fact that the men in the Army and their officers have kept their morale and their intelligence during the last few years, because the Army has been prevented being trained, and has been prevented being equipped and, so far as the higher officer ranks are concerned, they have been prevented thinking professionally, and educating themselves in the way that they ought to be educated, by the political susceptibilities of the present Government.</P>
      <P>I do not think anyone would claim that a real defence staff has been developed in this country.  The reasons for that go back a certain number of years and we do not want to place the blame anywhere but, as far as this House is concerned, we get as little information as to what our defence problems are as we get, say, on the question of our foreign affairs problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the first thing we want in the new circumstances&mdash;and we can all welcome the new circumstances&mdash;is to be assured that general officers are being developed in the Army.  There is no use talking about your Volunteer scheme.  There is no use in saying: &ldquo;Thanks be to God, we are spending more money on our air services.&rdquo; There is no use saying: &ldquo;Thanks be <Col N="827" /> to God we have recovered the forts, and can now defend the freedom of this country.&rdquo;  All these are simply costly toys, unless we have in this country men who are soldiers of general rank who are capable of advising us as to what our problems are and capable of using whatever resources we are able to gather together to meet any of these dangers when they arise. I would almost like to confine myself on this Estimate to pleading with the House not to believe that you have any defence dangers, but to realise that you are paying £1,700,000 for being advised as to possible dangers and the means of meeting them.</P>
    <P>In a country where the consumption of bread is going down and men and women are flying the country and unemployment is as rife as it is, any responsible member of an Irish Parliament should halt for a moment before in these circumstances he rushes blindly into an expression of gratitude to the Lord that we are spending more money on our defence problems.  Let us find out what is worthy of defence in this country, what we are defending this country for; then what we are defending it against.  I sympathise with the Minister in the problem he has in front of him, but I do not think that the Minister should be satisfied to face his problems by simply saying he is going to spend more money.  It is all very well to say the citizens of Dublin would like to be protected from attack by air, that we would like to get instructions as to what we are to do if there is an air attack on this country. The Minister may feel he would be blamed if in a year or two's time anything went wrong and there was no preparedness.  I do not think anybody is going to blame the Minister, and the only thing that in my opinion he could be blamed for is that he would go along spending increasing amounts of money on an army that was not facing its real problems and, therefore, was not either making any arrangements for defence against attack or was simply wasting and frittering away the country's money at a time when it could be used for other things.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy has suggested that we <Col N="828" /> want more discipline, and that the Volunteer scheme would be a fine place for disciplining our people.  I do not want to criticise the Volunteer scheme, but I do say it is no addition to our military strength.  It might perhaps be an addition to our military strength if it had direction and guidance, but I do not think it has that at the present time, and I think the absence of that is reflected in the very small percentage of the Volunteers who actually come up for their training.  I do not think that the solution of either the disciplining of our people or the adding to our military manhood strength lies in the Volunteer scheme, but I do not think it is worth discussing until we know what our military problems are. If our people want to be disciplined, and I agree a little of it would do a lot of good, instead of spending additional money on the Army to give our men the discipline, I would spend additional money on increasing the staff of primary teachers in the country, many of whom, particularly in the cities, are smothered even in their educational efforts under classes of an enormous size that would not be tolerated in any other country.  I would use some of the money to increase the teaching staffs, and give us a chance of getting a sense of discipline in the place where it best can be given, and that is in our schools.  It is wasteful and unproductive, and it is a cure rather than a prevention to be looking for the creation of a disciplined nation by bringing our people into the Army.</P>
    <P>I do not think, when our military problems are looked at by people qualified to look at them and qualified to look at them without any political bias, but simply in a detached and professional way, that our defence problems are going to be great, and I do not think the expenditure that is necessary for our Army need or should be increased.  I feel, in fact, that not being able to provide an odd war to give our people something in return for their expenditure on the Army, the people in this country will look rather askance at a continuation of the present expenditure on the Army without some greater understanding of what the Army is going to contribute to this country in peace time.  It is <Col N="829" /> when you compare the amount of money that is spent on the Guards and the daily services that are rendered by the Guards, with the amount of money that is spent on the Army, and the small contact that the Army has with the national life, that that question is definitely going to arise.  When our people really know what their defence problems are, they may consider that we are spending too much on the Army. That danger is likely to arise.  I think it is very necessary that the prestige of the Army should be saved.  It is absolutely necessary as a national institution, but it stands out pre-eminently as a national institution that could contribute something to the intellectual and the cultural life of the country and the Army itself because of the number of educated and disciplined men who man the officers' ranks, and the amount of leisure they necessarily have.</P>
    <P>The machinery of the Army, if it is going to be the real machinery for gathering the strength of the nation together, cannot be as much out of touch with the life of the people as the Army is to-day.  There are many ways in which in the past it was attempted to keep the Army in touch with both the ordinary life of the people and the cultural development of the people.  The Irish-speaking battalion was a thing that it was thought might be used to contribute to the rapidly growing use of the Irish language in the normal daily life of the people.  I do not believe the Irish-speaking battalion has ever been a battalion in the real sense.  We have never had a report as to how it is recruited or what its position in the Army is or whether it is in fact a real contribution to the use of Irish in the living everyday way.</P>
    <P>There was a time when an attempt was made to have the Army School of Music effect musical development in the country, but the Army School of Music is no longer a school of music. It is a band.  There are a certain number of bands in the country, but any idea of their making any definite contribution to increased appreciation of music in the country has gone by the board.  There have been developments of one kind or another that <Col N="830" /> have been choked off or have choked themselves off or have failed.  The Minister has done something to develop the physical culture side of things in the Army, but physical culture developed in the Army alone is not going to do anything for the country generally.  What we do want to have is a contribution made by the Army so that it will send properly instructed physical culture men to our schools.  When the primary programme conference sat in 1925, one of the things pointed out was that there was a rather good and thorough medical inspection beginning in the country.  But it was very little use to take adenoids, teeth and tonsils out of children to a given age if something was not done through the regular machinery of school life to set these children up.  One or two attempts were made in the past to set up physical culture schools, such as were set up through the Carnegie Institute in Leeds, but nothing has materialised in any way, and in ordinary circumstances the country would look to the Army to provide such a machinery of instructors as would enable physical instruction of a sound kind to impress itself on the primary schools system. It is there it is badly wanted.  The secondary schools are doing something. The Army engineering and medical services are away entirely to themselves.</P>
    <P>The point I should like to make here is that no case at all is made in a technical, a professional or really convincing way that this country has any defence problem worth the expenditure of £1,700,000 a year.  There were reasons why in the past we did not get full and complete advice on what our problems were.  That time has passed.  It was understood there were six or eight positions in the Army that might be filled by men who might be regarded as capable of attaining general rank.  It was suggested there should be a periodical rotation of the men occupying these ranks, the positions going from one to the other.  Unhappily, again, for particular reasons the plan for changing the Chief of Staff and the members of the Defence Council <Col N="831" /> every three years in a rotational way was never carried out.  There is in the defence scheme an arrangement for having an Inspector-General who, for the time being, would be a designate Commander-in-Chief, and that position has been let fall into abeyance.  It is not occupied at all.</P>
    <P>I would strongly recommend to the Minister the facing of the question of how and where his general officers are going to be trained, and in what way they are going to be induced, after the passage of so many years, to regard themselves as people on whom this Parliament relies for the last word in technical advice.  I say that is our main defence problem at the present time and, if that problem is not faced, then we are only toying with money and wasting money by spending even the amount of money we are spending at present on maintaining an Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not keep the House very long.  I am only impelled to make some observations on this Estimate by the remarks that fell from Deputy Childers last night.  It appeared to me, listening to this debate, that it was being carried on very largely in an unreal atmosphere and that that unreality arose from what Deputy Mulcahy has called the political susceptibilities of the Minister, and also from the fact that we were very largely discussing theoretical matters of constitutional law and the constitutional position.  The high light of unreality was given to the debate by Deputy Childers' speech.  The more experience I have of political life, the more I am convinced that the ordinary people will believe anything, and it is in case anybody might believe the remarks thrown out by Deputy Childers last night that I propose to make some observations on the matters he referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understood Deputy Childers, he made the point that, by reason of the recent taking over of the forts under the London Agreement, we had acquired some sort of an additional characteristic as a small nation which rendered us less susceptible to attack from big nations than we were before the taking over of these forts.  That particular type of argument was rather <Col N="832" /> of the debating society type, and more or less of an academic description. In my opinion, as a realist, there are only two types of small nations. Deputy Childers seemed to think there were several types of small nations and, according to whichever category you happened to fit into, in international law, you were more or less immune from attack or more and more susceptible to attack from the large nation. He appeared to me to suggest that because we had acquired some additional measures of outward sovereignty, we had therefore come within some, category of a small nation which rendered us less liable to attack.  I cannot find in international law or practice, or in the facts of life, anything to justify such a contention.</P>
    <P>There are only two types of small nations from the point of view of international law and from the point of view of war.  In one respect, it is such a small nation that it is not worth while for the big nation to attack it.  In the other respect, because of the existing circumstances it might be well worth while for the big nation to attack the small one.  So far as we are concerned, we may fall into one or other of the categories.  For instance, it may be well worth while for some nation at war with Britain to say: &ldquo;We recognise the wording of the Irish Constitution, that they are entitled to remain neutral and they cannot engage in a war without the consent of Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;  If that occurs, it will occur because it happens to suit the cards of the big nation that is attacking the Commonwealth of Nations.  On the other hand, if it suits any big nation that is making war on the British Empire or the Commonwealth of Nations to attack us, they may say that they are not obliged to consider our constitutional position; that no matter what is in our Constitution we are part of the Commonwealth of Nations and, therefore, we must be regarded as at war.  Then they will attack us and bomb us from the air and sea and land, if it suits them.</P>
    <P>We have to face that position when we are considering the question of the defence of this country.  We have to <Col N="833" /> face the position that we are going to be attacked if it suits some big nation to attack us, and we are not to be attacked if it does not suit them.  No amount of waving our constitutional provisions or talking about the type of sovereignty we have is going to prevent us being attacked if a big nation thinks it is expedient to attack us.  If we were seriously to consider Deputy Childers' extraordinary observation, we must visualise a preliminary sort of hearing by constitutional jurists, who would consider the Treaty of 1921 and the present constitutional provisions, and we could make the argument that was made, and that is in the records of the Government, that on the construction of the Treaty itself once this country decided to take over its own coastal defence the provisions in the Annexe to the Treaty no longer become operative and they are entitled to take over these forts.  It could be said: &ldquo;We have these forts now and, therefore, you have to recognise that we have some sort of sovereignty and, therefore, do not attack us, because we are a particular type of small nation.&rdquo;  Visualising the facts as they exist to-day, such a situation is absurd.</P>
    <P>I think that is the first consideration that we have got to bear in mind when we are considering problems of defence, that we are going to be attacked if it suits a stronger country to attack us, and that we shall not be attacked if it does not suit such a country to attack us.  If a country wants to attack us, it will find ample reasons for doing so, and if it does not suit it to attack us, it will find equally cogent reasons for not attacking us.  It may decide, as has been urged here, that we are a sovereign and independent member of the Commonwealth of Nations, and that therefore we should not be attacked.  On the other hand, if it is expedient for a country to attack us&mdash; and expediency rules in war&mdash;we are going to be attacked.</P>
    <P>The second consideration, in my view, is the fact that we are not able adequately to defend this country by reason of the expense necessarily involved in equipping the country with <Col N="834" /> modern armaments.  We simply cannot complete against the big nations, who are arming themselves with all sort of engines of war, and expending colossal sums of money in preparing for defence or in preparing for offence, as the case may be.  The taxpayers of this country cannot bear very much more taxation than they have to bear at the present moment.  The taxation that would be necessary to equip this country with any sort of a defence machine whatever would be beyond the capacity of the Irish taxpayer to bear.  The real fact of the matter is that, just as Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are dependent on the British taxpayer to provide the money to defend them, in the last resort that is our position.  We are, as Nature put us, close up beside England.  I think the Prime Minister himself has said very frequently that England, in order to defend herself, must defend us.  We have got to take advantage of that position, and if we are to co-operate at all, we should co-operate in a measure of defence best suited for our purposes.  I believe myself that is the policy of the present Government, that we are going to co-operate with the other nations of the Commonwealth in the matter of defence.  I think that that is the realistic view of the situation, and that the Government, if they were not so afraid of the peculiar electorate we have in this country, would frankly say so.  That they have been converted to that policy I am convinced.</P>
    <P>The facts of the situation are perfectly clear, and while we may have a certain sympathy with them from a political point of view, one cannot see the force of the arguments that there is a theoretical right to remain neutral, or that that right will save us from attack if England happens to be attacked.  If Britain is at war with another country, we shall want to supply food to Britain, and we cannot remain neutral in that event for very long.  We can, of course, if we like, remain theoretically neutral, but we are going to have our ships bombed and our harbours attacked.  We have not sufficient resources to enable us to put up an adequate defence against these attacks.  We have got to face the <Col N="835" /> practicalities of the situation, the fact that we are going to be attacked if it suits another country to attack us, that our resources are small, that we cannot afford to equip ourselves for modern warfare, and that therefore we shall have to depend on some nation which has a common defence policy with us, to assist us.</P>

      <P>One would think from Deputy Costello's speech that somebody has suggested that we are in a position to beat the world.  His solution for our not being in a position to beat the world militarily, I suppose, is the same as that offered by a number of other Opposition speakers, that we should have some sort of offensive and defensive alliance with the British Government.  Now, I do not propose to go into the whole matter of external relations.  That was debated on the Vote for External Affairs.  Somebody, however, said that there was one natural strategic unit for defence in Great Britain and Ireland.  Well, I think there is one very much more natural strategic unit for defence and that is the whole of this country and until we get to the position when that military strategic unit is also a politically free unit we cannot exert the full strength of our people, either for our own defence or for the defence of any interests we may have in common with any other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I am not going to debate external relations at all.  My duty as Minister for Defence is to try to make the best possible use of the money which the Dáil gives me in order to see that there will be as effective a military force as possible to carry out any scheme of defence the Dáil imposes upon it from time to time. The attitude of the Dáil will change from year to year, as Governments <Col N="836" /> will change from year to year, on the question as to what is the most important military situation that is likely to arise.  As far as I can see, there are three possible contingencies against which the Army should provide.  I put them in a certain order.  Anybody else can put them in whatever order he pleases.  First of all, I think the Army should use the money that the Dáil gives it in order to put its best foot forward in case the Dáil should call upon it to defend the neutrality of this portion of the country.  It should also put itself in a position to put its best foot forward in case the Dáil should call upon it to co-operate with some other country, say with England, in the defence of common interests. It should also be prepared in another contingency.  In case our near neighbour attempted to attack us, it should be in a position, or should try to put itself in a position to put up as good a resistance as possible.  Those are the three contingencies for which the Army should be prepared, and for the number of years I have been in charge of it I have done my utmost to try and utilise every penny we got from the Dáil in order to make the Army an effective military force, as effective as possible for the carrying out of any policy the Dáil might impose upon it in that regard.</P>
    <P>General Mulcahy spoke as to the advisability of having a good sound training among the higher Army staff officers.  I think that is being done. For the last seven or eight years, since the Military College was established, practically every senior military officer has gone through the staff college. A very big number of the junior officers have also gone through it. That college is carried on by men who studied in foreign staff colleges and, as far as I am advised at any rate, officers get as good a training in our own staff college as they get in any other country in the world.  As well as our own staff colleges, our own military colleges, Deputies will see even in the Estimate this year, that there is a certain amount of money allotted for officers going abroad for courses.  Every year for the last six years at any rate, a certain number of officers have gone abroad.  This <Col N="837" /> year some of them are already abroad and others are going abroad in the near future.  Every effort is being made to ensure that, in the unfortunate event of the Army being called out on active service, it will be controlled by officers who know their job. I think that we need not have any inferiority complex about the Army at all.  For its size and equipment, if it were called out, I think it would give as good an account of itself as any similarly trained or equipped army in the world.  It is not very big, but it can be bigger.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies put forward various views as to what branch of the Army we should concentrate upon. Deputy O'Higgins thought we were foolish not to have a navy, and others thought we should concentrate upon the Air Corps.  Personally, I vote for the Air Corps.  This year, even in the normal Estimate, we have a certain amount extra for the Air Corps. Over a number of years we have been trying to get a number of officers trained through our instructors in case we decided to expand the Air Corps. We are in the position to-day that, if we decided to expand the Air Force five or six or ten-fold, we have a nucleus of highly-trained officers who will be able to instruct the pilots required.  We can pay more attention to that part of the matter when the Supplementary Estimate is being considered. But I can say this, that it is quite possible that a very big proportion of the £600,000 will be spent on the development both of the Air Corps and of anti-aircraft defence.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins also alluded to the retiring ages fixed for officers of the Army.  He painted the lily, as he said, and, as far as I remember, laid it on pretty thick about the disastrous consequence that were going to follow the application of the retiring ages. We had to draw the line somewhere. It is true, as he said, that practically all the Army officers, with the exception of those who came in during the last few years, are about the same age, and if no steps were taken to retire them, according to rank and in rotation, we would reach a situation in five or ten years when they would all be <Col N="838" /> elderly.  Something had to be done in order to make way for young men coming along.  It is just as true of this country as of any other country that a big number of officers in the junior ranks could not find vacancies in the higher ranks. That obtains in England and in every country in the world, except where you have a very rapidly expanding Army during a time of war or of active preparation for war.  We found ourselves in the position, as I say, that all the Army officers were growing old together and that, if we did not take steps to make room for young men, they would all be elderly men and not suitable to give an active lead to an army in the field.</P>
    <P>Before these retiring ages were brought into force, I got several lists prepared showing the operation of the retiring ages on the various ranks in order to see how it was going to affect all the officers and at what point there would be new blood coming into the lower ranks.  After every consideration was given to this problem it was decided that the retiring ages decided upon were the best we could do in the interests of the Army and in the interests of providing this country with as effective a defence force as was possible with the money that the Dáil provided.  I do not think that the retiring age terms can be called harsh, and I have not the slightest doubt that Deputy O'Higgins knows they are more favourable than the terms suggested six or seven years ago&mdash;the terms that were agreed upon at that time.  They are not princely, but they are fair, having regard to the general situation in the country and the average standard of income of the country.  Deputy Norton joined Deputy O'Higgins in criticising these retiring age terms and said that we were doing something frightfully harsh with the men whom we were retiring.  I wish to goodness we could retire a lot of people in other walks of life on £4 or £5 a week when they come to 45 years of age.  I think it would not be bad at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Even at double the pension, it would pay the country sometimes. I do not think that, having regard to the general economy of the country and the standard of life of its people, we are doing any hardship to the officers whom we propose to retire at 48, 50, 54 years of age, and so on, according to rank, on the pensions outlined. That is not to say that the retiring pay is princely or anything like that, but, having regard to the general standard of life in the community, I think it is fair and it is much more favourable to them than the scheme which I found when I took over the Defence Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton also alluded to the marriage quarters and I think also the marriage rates.  Deputy Norton gave the impression that I was the greatest rack-renting landlord in the country in my capacity as Minister for Defence. He said that we were charging 10/6 a week for three rooms.  But the 10/6 a week is not for three rooms; it is for three rooms with light, fuel, furniture, repairs and everything included, and a plot as well.  Back in 1929 there was an examination of the problem as to whether the 5/3 per week that was charged for these facilities was sufficient. A committee went into the whole matter, and it decided that the economic price to charge for the facilities that were being given was 10/6&mdash;that is for a free house, free fuel, free furniture, free light and free water. If we want to put our married soldiers in a better position, I think the honest way would be not to go back to the 5/3 per week, but to increase the marriage allowance.  It must be realised that for this 10/6 they are getting good value for their money, very much better value than the vast majority of the people get in regard to rent, fuel or heat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the marriage allowance.  Up until very recently the marriage allowance here was more favourable than the marriage allowance given to British soldiers across the water.  I am <Col N="840" /> quoting the British Army because I have the figures and because it is always held up to us as an organisation that is very generous to its members.  But up until quite recently, until the British Army failed to get recruits, and had to go out and increase pay and allowances all round, our marriage allowance here was more favourable, and even to-day, after the British Army authorities in an effort to get recruits have increased their pay and allowances very much beyond what they were, in certain respects our marriage allowances are better than the British.  The British, for instance, only give an allowance in respect of four children.  If there are more than four children in a soldier's family no allowance is payable for the number above four.  We make no differentiation.  If there are more than four children in a family we continue to make the allowance in respect of the number above four.  Again, while the marriage allowance is not princely, I think that having regard to the general standard of life for artisans or other skilled men throughout the country, by comparison our standard of marriage allowance is not bad. I wish we could say that the same thing applied to other people who are working for their living throughout the country.  As regards our marriage allowance, a soldier, when he gets married, gets 1/- per day for his wife; he gets 1/- per day for the first child; 6d. a day for the second child; 3d. per day for the third child, and 3d. per day for every other child that may be in the family.  They are not the sort of allowances that a millionaire would make to his son on his marriage.  I wish to goodness that we had as good marriage allowances for a lot of the farm workers and other workers throughout the country.  I think that, in our circumstances, they are far from bad.  These were the two points that Deputy Norton spoke on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey says that we cannot provide an adequate defence against Germany, France, Italy and all the rest of them.  I agree with him, but we can, within our resources, in my opinion, provide a defence that will make any of those countries hesitate <Col N="841" /> before attacking us if they are engaged in attacking anybody else.  The last straw breaks the camel's back, they say.  We can, without any undue burden on the country, on the standard of life, on education or anything else, provide, in my opinion, such finances for the Army that, If properly used, they will provide the country with an Army which will make anyone hesitate about attacking us if they are in trouble with anybody else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hurley referred to the maintenance staff in Cobh and in the ports there.  Deputy Brasier and Deputy Corry also alluded to that.  The position is that we are keeping, as far as we can, as many of the Irishmen who were there as we require.  We have already employed 67 men who were formerly employees of the British.  If any vacancies arise, then the men alluded to by Deputy Corry will have their cases considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers said that the new Agreement, and particularly the abolition of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty had created a new defence situation for this country.  Notwithstanding what was said by Deputy Costello, I agree with Deputy Childers.  The abolition of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty, and the getting back of the possession of our ports, have created an absolutely new situation altogether.  Up until the present time the whole defence situation was a nightmare to the Minister for Defence and, in general, to the staff as regards making any defence plans, in view of the fact that the British might utilise their legal rights to demand any portion of our country. The abolition of these two Articles, and the getting back of our ports, leave us in a position to plan as to what we are going to do in regard to the Twenty-Six Counties at any rate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Linehan alluded to air-raid precautions.  This was a matter that was also referred to by a number of other Deputies.  He asked, in reference to the £1,000 for air-raid precautions, as to what was actually being done.  Up to the present what we have been doing is to try and get a staff trained that will be able to handle any air-raid precaution scheme&mdash;when the <Col N="842" /> Dáil gives us the money&mdash;that is to be put into operation.  We set up a civilian section about a year ago.  It is in charge of a principal officer.  We have a major on the Army section with a doctor and a number of other officers. They have been going into the whole problem.  They have been studying the problem in other countries and have been drafting schemes to put into operation when we get the money from the Dáil.  I anticipate that we will be asking the Dáil for money for that purpose, and that a Supplementary Estimate will be laid before the House. The £1,000 is merely a token sum to indicate that, while we are not doing as much as a number of people might wish in regard to air-raid precautions, at least we had not overlooked the matter, and were making preparations to meet that particular problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Linehan also alluded to the custody of civilian prisoners and said we were this year providing £5,400 for that purpose.  As a matter of fact it was last year that we provided £5,462 for expenses in connection with the Constitution (Amendment) Act.  That related to the custody of civilian prisoners.  When the old Constitution went out of operation, the title of the sub-head was changed to &ldquo;Custody of Civilian Prisoners,&rdquo; and we proposed to spend £1,600 in respect of that this year.  We shall not spend half that amount as we have no civilian prisoners at present.</P>

Deputy MacEoin indignantly denied that such men in his district were members of that organisation.  Some men were dismissed from the Army in 1934 because their services were no longer required, and if, as Deputy Linehan says, they were members of the League of Youth, then they were definitely breaking an Army regulation, a copy of which every one of them had received.</P>

Certain of these papers want to get the world to believe that the dirty Irish do not know how to behave themselves, and this is the sort of stuff they give to their readers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very mixed in his information.  A couple of Deputies, including Deputy Dowdall, raised the question of the pay and expenses of the officers of the Equitation School.  The expenses of the officers of the Equitation School have been the subject of some comment in the daily papers, and often by some of the Deputies.  As a matter of fact, their expenses have been continuously under review and subject to change since the Equitation School was set up. It is not very long since certain increases were made, and I think that, taking it all in all, and from the case I saw put up by the officers themselves, they are pretty fairly met.  I know that the country owes a good deal to the energy and good spirit of the officers of the Equitation School, and of the soldiers who attend the horses, and the country as a whole has acclaimed them as heroes for the many awards they have obtained.  I think we dealt with them pretty fairly, but for the information of Deputies, I am going to give the details, and I should like to hear from any Deputy afterwards if he thinks the arrangements are not fair.  Whether a man is at home or abroad he gets his pay and his marriage allowance If he is married.  If he goes abroad on normal <Col N="849" /> Army purposes or State purposes he gets a subsistence allowance amounting to about 25/- a day.  In some places it is 22/6, and in other countries, where the rate of exchange is lower, it goes up.  It also varies according to rank.  In addition to pay and allowances which he would normally get at home, when the equitation officer goes abroad, he gets free hotel accommodation if it is not given by the country to which he goes. He is given 25/- a night from the Army authorities for that purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>He gets his pay and allowances as at home and he gets 25/- a night if his hotel expenses are not paid by the country to which he goes. In most cases the officers are the guests of the country from the moment they set foot on shore and their hotel expenses are paid.  In addition to that, when an officer goes to the United States he gets from us 35/- a day for expenses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Over and above the 25/-, but he does not get the 25/- if his hotel expenses are paid by the country to which he goes.  In America and Canada he gets 35/-; in Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, Milan, and Berlin he gets 30/-; and in Brussels and Switzerland he gets 25/-.  The grooms get, over and above their keep and their regular pay, 7/6 per night.  To make matters clear in regard to the officers, the subsistence allowance they get if they do not have hotel expenses is 35/- in America and Canada; 30/- in Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, and the other cities I have mentioned, and 25/- in Brussels and Switzerland and, in addition to that subsistence allowance, where it is payable, they get 35/- in United States and Canada and £1 on the Continent, but that £1 on the Continent is exclusive of taxis and other things which are given in addition. <Col N="850" /> In America the 35/- is to cover taxis and tips.</P>

      <P>From time to time the matter of their allowances was discussed with the officers.  Particulars of their expenses were got from them, and it was in view of these particulars that the allowances were fixed.  They are fixed on a different basis in America from the basis on which allowances are made when on the Continent because <Col N="851" /> things are dearer in America.  Deputy Dillon said in effect that we should fight no more wars; that we are to tell everybody who comes along to fight us that they will get the hell knocked out of them for 700 years from to-day.  I do not think that will stop anybody from attacking us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about that.  If we think anything of our freedom we should be prepared to defend it.  I think that Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Higgins who expressed more or less the same idea said that we should not make life not worth living by making costly preparations for defence.  Yes, but we should have a balance about the whole thing.  If we have freedom and if it is doing us any good and if we think anything of it, then we should be prepared to put some of our national energy into defence.  We are not putting a pistol to the people's heads, telling them that they must choose between guns and butter.  We want them to have a fair complement of both.  It is the Government's policy that while not disregarding the needs of social service or the general economic wealth of the country to make such general provisions for defence as we think will serve the national purpose.  The national purpose to be served is to make foreign countries hesitate before they interfere with us in our business here.  No matter how big foreign countries are, they will hesitate before they will attack a virile people though only a people of three million.  Foreign countries will not be very ready to engage in trouble with us.  I do not believe in the policy of threatening any foreign country with another 700 years' war.  We had one 700 years' war and we do not want another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is coming towards its close, I think.  There is another part of Deputy Dillon's policy in which I do not believe, that is when he says that we should only be prepared to defend ourselves if Great Britain pays for it. We want our defence against all comers.  As I say, if we think anything <Col N="852" /> of our freedom we should be prepared to defend it and pay for it ourselves.  I think the people of this country are prepared to pay a fair sum as an insurance against foreign aggression.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be heavy weights only that we may have to defend ourselves against.  Deputy Dillon said that the most likely form of attack that we would have to meet would be air attack.  What we have been doing in the way of air raid precautions, in preliminary training and the sum of money that the Dáil will be asked to vote in the near future, will indicate our policy for increasing our defences in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon alluded to the appearance of the troops off parade.  I think, generally speaking, that the regular Army troops off parade are quite smart.  I do not think the Deputy could have been alluding to them.  It is a very much more difficult problem in regard to Volunteers who live at home and who have their uniforms at home.  In the regular Army the men have two uniforms, one for service and one for walking out.  In order to keep down expenses we have provided these Volunteers with only one uniform and when they use that for a few months in training it is not as smart and as spick and span as the uniform of a man who takes his out of a box.  However, we are trying to encourage the Volunteers to keep themselves as neat and tidy as possible.  As for the regular soldier, first of all if his buttons are not up to the scratch he will not get past the military policeman at the gate, and if caught down town in a uniform that is not all right he will be marched back to barracks.  It is not possible to exercise the same discipline in the case of the Volunteers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>These may be old uniforms, not their ordinary wearing uniforms.  Deputy Dillon also wanted to know what, in my opinion, was the ideal type of army.  I do not know what the ideal type of army may be. The army that we are trying to develop is an army in which the regular troops will be composed of technicians who are highly trained in the technical branches, supported by the reserve forces who would also be highly trained and supported again by the Volunteers, who are as well trained as possible under the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mullen spoke about the Volunteers and said that the employers should be got to realise that they should facilitate the Volunteers when these men are going for their training. Well, I should like to see more support given to the Volunteers in that regard. It is sometimes difficult to get employers to release them for training and it upsets the work of training very much when men are held back and will not be released for training.  I wish we could get some such system of pre-Volunteer training, as has been suggested. I do not know that I would go to the schools with it at all, but if it were possible to reduce the age limit for joining the Volunteers and thus give a longer initial training, then the annual training might not be so long, and it might even reduce it by eight or nine days and so fit it into the ordinary holidays that men get in factories and all sorts of employment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran also alluded to the same subject, and on more or less the same lines.  I think that I have dealt with practically all the questions that were raised by the various Deputies, and all I can say is that we will be in a better position to deal with some of the bigger questions of policy that have been raised when the Supplementary Estimate comes along.  I hope that that Supplementary Estimate will not be very long delayed.  We are trying to get out the facts and figures for it, and as soon as they are available, we will bring the Supplementary Estimate along.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount which we want under this Estimate can be divided as follows: (1) Cost of administration, £17,701; (2) Incidental expenses, £4,682; (3) Cost of awards, £681,345; giving a total of over £703,000.  The cost of awards is made up as follows: (1) Wound and Disease Pensions and Gratuities, £101,410; (2) Allowances and Gratuities to Dependants, £30,000; (3) Military Service Pensions, £545,000; (4) Retired pay and Gratuities £3,672; (5) Connaught Rangers Pensions, <Col N="855" /> £1,263; making a total of £681,000 odd. All told, we are administering ten Acts of Parliament, eight of which confer statutory rights to pensions&mdash; including allowances&mdash;or gratuities on those persons who qualify under them. Running through the whole of these Acts there is a broad distinction between awards in respect of Service and awards in respect of Disability&mdash; that is, wound or disease&mdash;and the total figure of £681,345 in respect of awards may be said to represent £131,410 for Disability awards and £549,935 for Service awards.</P>
    <P>These figures, however, need interpretation. In the first place, it is necessary to distinguish between awards already made and those which may be made during the year; and, secondly, as many of the new awards are payable from various dates in 1932, 1934, and 1937, it is necessary to distinguish between the recurring amount of those awards and the arrears which they carry for first payment. Looked at from this two-fold aspect, the statutory liabilities included in the Estimate which have already matured in respect of disability awards are:&mdash;</P>

    <P>All told, under these disability awards there are 1,395 awards, and the total amount is £94,203 annually.  In addition to this, we are providing £37,000 for new awards, including arrears. The estimate on which that sum is based is: new awards (recurring), £14,958; arrears (non-recurring), £15,419; gratuities (non-recurring), £6,830&mdash;making a total of some £37,000.  Hence, of the total sum of £141,410 provided for disability awards, the recurring annual charge will be approximately £109,161, made up of: liabilities already matured, £94,203; liabilities in respect of new awards, £14,958&mdash;making a total of £109,161.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Service aspect of the Estimate and applying the same distinctions, we find that of the total <Col N="856" /> net sum, £549,935, required, no less than £293,921 is required for liabilities already incurred under the Acts. That sum is made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>From time to time, criticism has been directed towards showing that the administration of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, is unduly slow, and it may not therefore be inopportune to deal with the criticism at this juncture by comparing the administration of the Act with that of the 1924 Act of which it is in a real sense the complement.  Now under the 1924 Act there were 21,121 applications, of which only 13,537 were referred to the board of assessors because the remaining 7,584 were clearly persons to whom the Act did not apply.  The board was set up on 4th October, 1924, and having completed its work resigned on 1st October, 1928.  It was, therefore, administering the Act for a period of four years, and during that time it issued 3,850 qualifying reports.</P>
    <P>The difficulties confronting the referee and Advisory Committee set up under the 1934 Act are far more serious than those which faced their predecessors. <Col N="857" /> For one thing, the 1924 board had documentary evidence on which to rely for post-Truce service and rank, and as regards pre-Truce activities the events and the applicants were fresher in the minds of the certifying officers.  No such documentary evidence exists for applicants under the 1934 Act.  Records had to be compiled of the various ranks held in the organisations at critical dates, the memories of the certifying officers have naturally been dulled with the passage of time, and the applicants have been for many years out of contact with these officers.  Now, under the 1934 Act it has been found necessary to refer all applications, totalling 57,752, to the referee who, with the committee, was appointed and began the work of administering the Act on 5th October, 1934.  The committee has, therefore, been only three and a half years in existence and, despite the serious difficulties just referred to, the referee has issued 5,581 qualifying reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, referred to the fact that under this grouping of Army pensions we were dealing with several separate Acts.  That is one of the things which make it difficult for a Deputy or anybody else to follow the matter.  It is one of the things which create in the minds of the public the impression that the ex-Army men are over-pensioned.  I think it is rather a pity, from the point of view of understanding the real position and facilitating the applicant, that the Department of Defence would not prepare some simple handbook containing the important points in those various Army Pensions Acts.  Many of them are amendments to previous Acts, and, as the Minister knows, it is extremely difficult for any interested party to find under what particular Act an applicant should claim.  Even a lawyer finds it difficult.  Take the case of the ordinary applicant living down the country.  It is impossible for that individual to frame his application in a proper way, and it is very often nearly as impossible for him to grasp the real significance of the reply he gets to his application when it reaches him. Deputies on all sides must have experience <Col N="858" /> of that.  A man applies, and he is told that his application cannot be considered under such-and-such an Act: that it is too late.  It is true that it is too late for that Act, and it is equally true that in many cases the unfortunate individual is applying under the wrong Act.</P>
      <P>I urged on the Minister previously the advisability of having some small office, such as is known elsewhere as &ldquo;The Soldier's Friend,&rdquo; to which an individual who considered he had a claim for a pension would go.  It would then be the function of that office to take up his case and fight it from that point onwards.  As things are, you have the ordinary, simple individual faced with the full weight of the officialdom of a great Government Department.  No matter how generously disposed they may be, all Government Departments are mainly controlled by finance, and the dice is loaded against the individual from the word &ldquo;go.&rdquo; Every one of us, not only recently but all along, has seen genuine cases turned down because they were not properly presented.  Subsequently, when somebody who was more familiar with the Acts came along, took up his case for the individual and presented it in a better manner, the original finding was upset and justice was done to the individual.  But it is only one applicant out of 100 who can get his case competently looked after.  The other 99 are the victims of circumstances, circumstances due to the fact that it is nobody's express duty to look after the case of the applicant, to present it properly, and to fight it along through its various stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that there is throughout the country a grave and growing discontent with the delays in administering those Pensions Acts, particularly the Pensions Act of 1934.  The Minister falls back on the line of defence that it is very much on a par with the Pensions Act of 1924, and that the speed of dealing with the cases in the last four years is equal to the speed with which cases were dealt with between 1924 and 1928.  That is a case of special pleading.  It is a misleading case unless the Minister gives us the pensions staffs that were there in <Col N="859" /> 1924 and the pensions staffs that are there at the present moment.  I would venture to say at a shot that there are five times as many people in the Pensions Department to-day as were there in 1924.  If you are to judge work against work, on a case or capitation basis, there should be five times as many cases turned out per annum now.  If I were to present the case in that manner it would be just as unfair as the method in which the Minister attempted to present it to the Dáil. The circumstances are different; the types of cases are different; the records are different, and there is a lot more difficulty nowadays in getting a proper statement of each case.  I could quite understand the 1934 Act operating with far less speed than the Act of 1924 if the staffs were equal, but even that does not explain to my mind&mdash;nor to the minds of people closer to the Department of Defence&mdash; why it is that individuals who made their applications four or five years ago have not since heard anything about those applications.</P>
    <P>If any of us write to the Department with regard to So-and-so's application, which was forwarded in 1934, we never get any satisfactory answer.  We are told it is under consideration, or that it will receive early consideration.  It is unreasonable that the unfortunate applicant, who lodged an application four or five years previously, should be left so long without any knowledge as to how the claim was progressing.  I want to be candid on this question.  In the Act of 1934 were included pensions provisions for men who had been engaged in opposition to this Parliament.  I was opposed to that measure.  If a similar measure was proposed to-morrow, I would be equally opposed to it but, from the day that Act became law, I never even criticised it.  From the day it became the law it was the law of this land and we have always stood for everybody getting their rights according to the law, whether we agree with it or not. We have never got from the Minister anything like a straightforward statement as to the order in which cases are taken.  It is not done in any <Col N="860" /> geographical order.  Apparently they are not taken by rank, or by the date on which a claim was lodged.  The prevailing belief is that the priority of a claim is decided by the amount of political influence behind it, and by the political importance of the particular claimant.  It is, at least, true to say that those of political importance got their claims through very early, while others are still waiting. If the Minister is prepared to tell the House that there is a reasonable and a fair method of procedure with regard to the order in which claims are taken then, at least, we would be in a position to convey that message to people who are bothering Deputies with questions as to what happened to their claims.  No one can understand the delay; no one understands in what order claims are considered, and no information worth while is given in reply to communications addressed to the Pensions Department.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with that Act to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister. Under the Acts some very small pensions are given.  I am not saying that the pensions given are not the legal entitlement of those who got them, according to the services rendered, but there are pensions as low as £6 or £7 a year, and from 12/- to 14/- a month. A pension of that size is of very little use to the individual.  The real effect of drawing 10/- or 12/- a month is to put that man further back in the queue waiting for employment.  His draw from the Unemployment Fund is less by that amount and, consequently he is lined up for employment later than his neighbour.  Under the first Army Pensions Act the question of very small pensions was met, pensions for disabilities less than 20 per cent. being met by lump sum gratuities, rather than giving pensions of £5 or £6 a year.  I do not know why that precedent was departed from in subsequent Acts.  The departure was unwise and, I think, at this stage provision should be made to allow pensioners to commute their small pensions.  Let the Minister decide the amount.  Say that the pension is less than £12 a year, the applicant, if he so <Col N="861" /> desires, should be allowed to commute that pension for a stated sum.  I cave forwarded applications from individuals &mdash;and I am sure other Deputies have done so&mdash;who are in receipt of very small pensions of £8 or £9 a year offering to surrender them for small lump sums of £30 or £40.  In some cases they wanted to buy their homes under the recent scheme for the purchase of labourers' cottages.  That was a reasonably sound commercial enterprise and, in my opinion, should be encouraged. In other cases, the applicants wanted to start as hackney-drivers and required the purchase price of cars.  The purchase of a cottage, the paying off of arrears on an old cottage, or the launching a man in life as a taxi-driver would be much better for the persons and their families than pensions of 12/- a month, because these pensions are merely a disability when men are unemployed.  The fact that they are drawing 12/- a month means that they draw 12/- less by way of unemployment money, and they are put further back in the line for employment when it arises.</P>
    <P>With regard to the machinery for operating later Pensions Acts, there is a system by which units elect a representative officer who speaks for all in the case of appeals.  That is perfectly sound in theory but, in practice, it does not work out fairly in every case.  The Minister is aware of the fact that the Act of 1934 is an addition to the Act of 1924.  The latter Act applied to men who were in the Volunteers and subsequently in the National Army.  The Act of 1934 applied to people who were in the Volunteers, but who subsequently were not in the National Army. Under the Act of 1924 the main body of one group was catered for.  Ninety per cent. of the applications under the 1934 Act belonged to one political brand, naturally, because of the circumstances. A group of these in any area met and appointed a representative officer, and he, being human like the rest of us, will look after his friends before he will look after his foes.</P>
    <P>The claims of those who do not belong to his political camp are very often left last and, in some cases, very inadequately presented.  I know of a case, <Col N="862" /> to which the Minister's attention was drawn, where there is an individual drawing a pension for service over a period of two years in a Leinster county when during those two years that individual was a soldier in the British Army, and a man who is at home holding that rank is denied his pension according to his rank because somebody else has already got the pension in that rank and position.  I am not raising that here without taking very full and proper steps to ensure that the Minister would be made aware of the facts ten months before I raised it and so that there will be no mistake I will give the Minister and his secretary the name in private.  So that there would be no mistake, I saw to it that the letter went by registered post. I expected, when that statement reached the Minister, giving day and date, that at least there would be a very full investigation carried out, and that, as part of the investigation, the person who signed that statement, namely the disappointed applicant, would be called on to give evidence before some committee.  I am not prepared to take the word of everybody that comes along with a statement. When that case was put to me I said, &ldquo;Write it all down there.  Sign your name to it.  Put it in a registered envelope and send it to the Minister.&rdquo; Up to a month ago that man had heard nothing.  It may be that in the ordinary course that letter came along and was referred back to the board or department or committee that had previously given the pension to the other man and that it was never followed up any further, but it is the type of case that should be closely looked into.  If the statements contained therein are untrue or inaccurate then that is that, but, as long as that statement is there, over a signature of a fairly well known individual, and no inquiry is carried out, it is hard to expect any of us to have complete confidence in the administration of these pension schemes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the pension scheme for serving officers and soldiers, some 12 months ago we discussed that fairly fully here.  Since then the Minister had 12 months to reconsider his position. <Col N="863" /> I was hopeful that between then and this certain amendments would have been introduced.  The principle on which the whole scheme is based for officers and for men is the principle of pensioning officers and men not according to their pay but according to their rank.  If, we will say, in an asylum the attendants were all equal in rank and the pay of one was four times as high as the others because he happened to have particular diplomas or particular qualifications, there would be an outcry if they were all pensioned, according to their rank and not according to their pay.  In every pension scheme in the world there is a direct relation between pension and pay and everybody's pension is a definite proportion of his pay.  In this particular pension scheme the Minister departed entirely from that principle and he made the condition of pension depend on rank. Influential and representative people outside of politics entirely and detached from the Army, but in a position to put up impartially and fully the complaints of some of the people in the Army who were affected applied respectfully to the Minister for an opportunity to discuss the matter with him.  The door was banged in their face and they got back a curt note to the effect that the Minister did not see that any useful purpose would be served by even meeting them.  It is a very bad headline for a Government Department. Those men did not engage in any propaganda or in any publicity.  The leaders of the Irish medical profession, before a line was written or a word spoken, thought the fairest course was to see the Minister and put their case in private to him.  That was the treatment they got.  It was an act of discourtesy that was entirely undeserved. It was an act of discourtesy that does not reflect any credit on the Minister's administration.  It was an act of discourtesy that showed not only a lack of consideration for the people who made the application, but a callous lack of consideration for the individuals on whose behalf the application was made. <Col N="864" /> That is in the past.  That was 12 months ago.  The Minister has since had 12 months to reconsider that action as well as others and I would urge very strongly on the Minister that, if a similar application is made to him in future, whether he agrees with the case put up or not, at least he should extend the courtesy of an interview to properly authenticated representatives of groups in his forces who want to discuss with the Minister the future position of members of his forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Deputy Dr. O'Higgins in his reference regarding the delay there has been in dealing with these military service pensions. I do not want to occupy the time of the House in going further into that particular point, but I would like to make an appeal to the Minister on behalf of those pre-Truce I.R.A. men, or what are better known as the men of 1916.  I do so because I know at the moment there are quite a number of them who are in very distressed circumstances. I think it is a lamentable thing that at this hour of the day, having regard to all the trials and troubles we have gone through in the meantime, this particular group have not got the attention to which, in my opinion, and I think in the opinion of the Government itself, they were entitled.  The delay that has taken place in dealing with them first of all before this pension board is one side of it, and the other side is that the wheel of time having passed around, many of them who appear before the board have not the opportunities afforded them now, after so many years, of giving sufficient evidence in order to bring their case to the point that would show they had a substantial claim to whatever is allowed under the Act.  For that particular reason I would suggest that the Minister might wisely consider at some early date the possibility of being more generous to them in that respect.  I think that they in particular are entitled to far more consideration than has been given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise on this Estimate the general policy of the Department in respect of the claims which have been submitted under the <Col N="865" /> Pensions Act of 1934.  I understand the Minister stated that approximately 5,500 cases have been certified out of approximately 57,000 cases.  Of course, I understand a larger number than 5,500 have actually been investigated and that where certificates of active service have not been issued and entitlement to pension acknowledged, it means that the applications have been deferred for further consideration. I do not know whether the deferment for further consideration is calculated to raise any greater hopes in the minds of applicants whose cases have been deferred, or whether it is just a convenient method of putting aside cases in which there is no intention of granting a pension, and subsequently issuing unfavourable decisions in a large batch of these cases. I am afraid that unfortunately the latter is the intention.</P>
      <P>What I want to complain of is this, that although the Army Pensions Board has been functioning over four years, a relatively small number of claims has been decided, having regard to the total number of applications received.  Can the Minister give us any indication as to how long it will take before all the claims are decided?  At the present rate of consideration it is going to be many years before the last of these applications is reached.  If the policy of deferring cases for further consideration is pursued it may mean that it will be a great many years before some applicants will know whether or not they are entitled to a pension, whether there is any prospect of obtaining a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come across cases in my own constituency and elsewhere where persons who have sought pensions under the 1934 Act are still living in a kind of pathetic hope that one day they will receive an intimation from the Army authorities that a pension has been granted them and that the arrears will be paid them.  Many of these applicants have approached me and have asked whether it would be possible for them to get an early decision on their claims so that they may obtain some money with which <Col N="866" /> to stock land, purchase implements for land operations, or finance some type of trading or undertaking calculated to increase their means of existence.  I have had to point out to many of them that the average pensions granted to persons in category E amount to aproximately £19 a year, 8/- a week, and I have told them that it is not wise to imagine that they can have a well-stocked ranch even if they get a pension at that rate.  That is the average rate of pension, according to the figures supplied by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think the applicants for pensions whose cases have been considered ought to be told definitely whether there is any prospect of their getting a pension in order not to buoy them up with hopes which, I am afraid, in a lot of cases, will not be realised.  I think it would be a better policy on the part of the Department to let the applicants know definitely what the intention is.  The cases have been considered and at this stage there is very little likelihood of fresh evidence being produced, and I think the board could decide definitely whether or not the applicant, will get a pension.  It might be better for an applicant to be aware that he had no chance of getting a pension; in that way he would be saved a good deal of disappointment and disillusionment later on.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the administration of the Act to which I would like to make reference. A considerable number of persons have been called before the board for examination.  They have attended there and produced their own evidence and have also submitted evidence from corroborating authorities supporting their claim for a pension.  Many of the applicants have been before the board as long as 12 months ago and they are apparently unable to obtain any decision on the applications dealt with in person by the board.  Could the Minister give the House some indication as to the cause of the delay of six, nine and 12 months in communicating a decision to an applicant?  I know cases in which pensions have been granted and cases in which men with service at least <Col N="867" /> as meritorious as the service rendered by those who have got pensions have had their cases dealt with by the board, 12 months have elapsed, and yet there is no decision.  Delay of that kind is inexplicable and unjustifiable.  There should be some relationship in point of time between the date upon which an applicant appears before the board and the date upon which he gets the decision.</P>
    <P>I think a good deal of the disappointment and dissatisfaction which have been caused over the administration of the Act is due to the delay in deciding claims, the abnormal delay which takes place between the appearance of a person before the board and the decision on his claim.  It is not possible to discuss here the manner in which claims for pensions are assessed, but there is dissatisfaction at the small amount of pension granted to persons in categories D. and E.  When one sees the average of these pensions one can have grounds for expressing sympathy with the dissatisfaction that is so manifest.  It is not possible, either, to discuss on what basis the Army authorities proceed with the allocation of service and the assessment of pension.  While dissatisfaction will probably continue under any type of Pensions Act that is passed, I think the matter of delay in deciding pension claims gives ground for a very genuine grievance.  Some effort ought to be made by the Minister's Department to accelerate the consideration of pension claims and decisions on the claims which have been considered.  If, after four years, certificates have been issued in only 5,500 cases, we ought to know how long it is going to take before all the claims are decided.</P>
    <P>We should have some indication as to when those who are not likely to get pensions under the board's method of assessing their entitlement to pensions, are likely to be informed of the unsatisfactory nature of their applications.  It is a mistaken policy to buoy people up with hopes which are not likely to be realised.  If the Minister would make a statement on that matter, it will help to dispel some <Col N="868" /> of the dissatisfaction and it would enable a large number of applicants to measure their chances of securing pensions.  It probably would enable them, realising that their applications might not be so successful, to make other arrangements for financing some of their activities.  At present in many cases they are relying upon the prospect of getting a pension as a means of extricating them from some financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will deal with matters of that kind.  Every Deputy is aware of the interest taken in this subject throughout the country, and I am sure every Deputy will welcome an authoritative declaration from the Minister which will enable claimants to know precisely where they stand in respect of their claims for pensions.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that a good deal of dissatisfaction exists throughout the country with reference to the slowness of the Department of Defence in dealing with applications under the 1934 Act.  There are a few points that I want to raise. One has been stressed by Deputy Norton&mdash;that is the delay in dealing with claims.  That is one of the principal grievances we have throughout the country.  I suggest to the Minister that after four years he should seriously consider changing the methods that he is adopting in administering the Act.  I was wondering if it had been suggested to the Minister before, or if it ever occurred to him, to send the Military Service Pensions Board on circuit down the country into the different brigade areas or to divide the board up in sections and send these sections on circuit throughout the provinces.  I am sure it would take only a short time to deal with all the applications in these brigade areas. Failing that, the Minister might consider some other method of speeding up the hearing of applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one type of applicant who at the moment is very uneasy as to what is going to become of him under the Military Service Pensions Act of 1934. <Col N="869" /> I understand that the Military Service Pensions Board are dealing only with applicants who have qualified service or who in other words took part in major engagements prior to the truce such as a barrack attack, an ambush or something of that kind which could be considered a major engagement.  The company man in country areas who had a very good service, who was carrying despatches or barricading roads by day, and who, at night, was protecting active service units and laying land mines or engaging in other activities which the local units were called upon to perform, is in a very uncertain position. I should like the Minister to make some statement as to whether the service given by men like those is going to find recognition under the 1934 Act. At the moment I believe such cases are not being dealt with and I should be glad if the Minister would make a statement on that point.  If the present Act does not permit the Minister to deal with those cases, I would suggest that he should introduce an amending Act which would enable him to do so.  I know what those men suffered during the struggle even though they were not actually members of flying columns or did not take part in major engagements. They helped very considerably in bringing about the position which we enjoy to-day, and I think it would be unfair if their services were not recognised under the Act.  I understand, of course, that active service has not been fully defined by the Minister or the Military Service Pensions Board. Perhaps, by broadening the definition of active service, the applications of those men could be considered.  I should like the Minister to make some pronouncement on that particular point.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of cases in which no decision has so far been given, and I would ask the Minister to take steps to speed up a decision in those cases and to let the applicants know whether they are entitled to an award or whether their cases will come up at a later date, and that they will then be entitled to an award.  The present position is very unsatisfactory and a source of uneasiness to such applicants.  They <Col N="870" /> believe themselves, and I believe too, that the majority of them are entitled to pensions.  Still, after four years, they cannot get anything definite from the Department to show where they stand.  I should also like to refer to the position of men who were in the I.R.A. prior to the truce and who took part in no major engagements, and, further, to the case of men who joined the I.R.A. at the truce or at the commencement of the civil war.  Those men had good service with the I.R.A. during the civil war, and I think as the 1934 Act stands at present they are not entitled to recognition.  I think that is unjust.  I would suggest to the Minister that something should be done to amend the Act so that the claims of those men could be considered.  A number of them had very good active service during the civil war and the least that should be done is to recognise that service under the Act.</P>
    <P>Another point on which I would like to have some information from the Minister has reference to the attitude of the Military Service Pensions Board in asking brigade committees throughout the country to segregate the men who are entitled to pensions from the men who are not.  I think it should not be the duty of brigade committees down the country, who have done a good deal by way of compiling records of the applicants, to decide on that matter.  I think the responsibility should not be placed upon them of asking them to state who is entitled to a pension and who is not.  I am referring to the A and B lists sent out by the board.  In my opinion, no brigade committee should be asked to state what applicant is entitled to a pension and what applicant is not.  That is a matter for the board and the board only.  Each applicant, I hold, should be entitled to give his evidence and it is then a matter for the board to decide whether he is entitled to a pension.  Finally, I should like to ask the Minister, if he can see his way to do so, to increase the allowances given to relatives of those Volunteers who lost their lives from 1918 to 1923.  A number of those cases have been dealt with under the 1924 Act, but the sums awarded have <Col N="871" /> been very small and entirely inadequate. I would urge the Minister to provide larger allowances in these cases and I should be glad if, in his reply, he would give some definite information on the other points I have raised.</P>

      <P>I am not going by any means to oppose this Vote.  We have so much sympathy, so much generosity and so much compassion especially from Deputy Morrissey that I cannot oppose it, although I doubt if it was advisable in this country ever to have a pensions scheme.  In many other nations people served their country and they did not serve it for the sake of gain.  During the past five or six years it appears as if everybody, especially the people on the opposite side, who in former years shouted the loudest about pensions, have been working all their lives for gain.  That is the awful prospect facing us.  For the past four or five years you have a queue of people round you day after day looking for something.  Taking the Military Service Pensions Act as it stands, as an addition to the 1924 Act, perhaps it was a good thing, coming as it did after the Civil War and after all that trouble, but then that Act should be administered in the ordinary way and each and every man should get the benefit of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who were called by this board first? People on the Government Benches opposite who are drawing £360 a year. These were the people who were the first to get pensions.  Who were the first men from the country to be called before this board?  The pivotal men here, there and everywhere in the Fianna Fáil organisation were sent for and got pensions and as I can prove to the Minister and tell him in the House here in public, men who had not a day's service either pre-truce or post-truce in my county are getting pensions of £100 and £110 a year.  I will prove that men from my county were brought before that board to certify that other men had given service when they themselves were not there on the occasion at all.  Those people who were brought here to certify in that way were never <Col N="872" /> on a &ldquo;job.&rdquo;  Can the Minister deny that?  I want him to deny it.  I will give him the facts and I am prepared to stand over the facts.</P>
    <P>What I want is fair play for all.  In fact, I have had more supporters of Fianna Fáil coming to me within the last few months, asking me to see that they should get fair play, than I have had of supporters of any other Party. I have had practically nobody from my own Party or from the Labour Party coming to me, but I have had people who supported Fianna Fáil through thick and thin for the last four, five and six years, some of them pretty good gunmen.  Perhaps it is not a great boast to make about them, but at least they did their &ldquo;job&rdquo; so far as the Act is concerned.  Those men cannot get a pension.  I could give the Minister half-a-dozen such cases, but I have a specific case in mind.  Anybody who was ever in the headquarters of the Volunteers in Tipperary from 1916 onwards should know that man.  He was in engagements and under fire.  He was ordered, I think by George Plunkett, to keep quiet.  That man was brought out on the road and riddled with bullets.  Nine bullets were put through him.  Two officers who were brought from my county could not certify that that officer had military service.  Luckily, his em&mdash; ployer was very decent, and he was sent to a home in Waterford and, although every part of his body was riddled with bullets, he recovered, but had to disappear again, until the Black and Tans left the country.  Yet that man is said not to have had military service.  Why not ask somebody who knows something about the work of the Volunteers during these periods to certify in these cases?  Why ask men who were never on a &ldquo;job,&rdquo; who took no part in the movement, who just came in at the truce and made themselves kings.  I should like to say a lot more, but I will not.  Things have been bad enough in the past, and the sooner we forget them the better.  These men made themselves kings.  They shouted &ldquo;Up the Republic,&rdquo; and went out to fight, but did not fight.  These are the people in my county to whom I am referring as having got big pensions, and who had <Col N="873" /> not a day's service, either pre-truce or post-truce.  I will prove that to the Minister.  If he wants the names, I will give them in the House.  I can give half-a-dozen from memory.</P>
    <P>The reason I mention this is because I want the Minister at least to see that fair play will be given.  It is the Minister's job to see that a fair show will be given by the Pensions Board to every applicant regardless of his position in life.  I am sure the Minister is honest enough to see that that will be done, because the smallest man in the street is as much to me or the Minister as the biggest man, no matter what Party he may work for.  The time has gone for bothering about what Party a man works for.  I asked the Minister to see that the board gives a fair show to everybody.  I have often written to the board and I have never told them a lie.  Under the 1924 Act I think I have helped to deprive more people of pensions than I helped to get pensions.  Every time the present Pensions Board wrote to me I told them the truth about each applicant. Yet, what has taken place?  Men who knew nothing about the applicants were brought up and certified for certain people and did not certify for others.  I hope the Minister will look into that matter.</P>
    <P>There is another matter, and that is the delay in dealing with applicants for pensions.  Other Deputies have dealt with this, and I think it is rather a serious matter.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, the staff is about five times larger than the staff who dealt with pensions formerly, and they are making ten times more inquiries.  You have a big staff, and yet you keep a lot of people waiting for pensions.  In each area, as I am sure the Minister is aware, there is a committee of some kind. You may call them regional committees if you like, but they call themselves Old I.R.A. committees.  All these are seemingly working for the Pensions Board, and because of that it should be much easier to deal with the applicants for pensions than it was under the 1924 Act, because there were no committees then.  I think the Minister and his colleagues on the Front Bench are a good deal to blame for all this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> When the 1934 Act was passed, I think it was at their instance that these committees were set up and they called them Old I.R.A. committees.  It did not matter whether a person was born in 1920 or before it, so long as he paid a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; to the Old I.R.A. committee he became a member.</P>
    <P>In many districts where we had not even a company of the Volunteers at all, where perhaps there were only one or two men in touch with the I.R.A., an Old I.R.A. committee was set up when this pension scheme came into existence.  Perhaps I am wronging the Minister and his colleagues, but I believe that it was at their instance these committees were set up in order to create a big body of opinion around them by promising them all pensions. That ought to be stopped.  The people of the country have been fooled long enough.  We have had enough of trouble from the truce up to the present day, and it is nearly finished now.  Let this thing be stopped.  The Minister should not encourage these committees except they are really committees of the Old I.R.A.  Do not encourage a lot of people to go into an association in order to get something out of the country and to bleed the people white. The country has been bled long enough. Let the Minister stop that.</P>
    <P>We are all anxious that every person who gave service should get something. I am not concerned as to whether a person fought in 1918, 1919, 1920, or in 1922 and 1923.  I do not blame the people who fought in 1922 and 1923 because I believe they were merely fooled.  I believe they are just as much entitled to a pension as I am when there is a pension scheme in existence, but I say to the Minister and the Government, do not continue to fool the people any longer, do not have these committees that we have in every parish throughout the country.  They are the bane of our existence, they are a terrible nuisance.  You have not real Old I.R.A. committees.  You have dozens of them which were set up at the instance of people on the Government Benches.  They are becoming a nuisance to men in public life and to the people.  All this should be stopped and the pensions work should be completed. <Col N="875" /> There are 50,000 applicants for pensions.  With ordinary efficiency, the Pensions Board should be able to do their work more quickly.  If necessary, the staff should be augmented so that the work can be finished within a year or two.  I should like to know from the Minister if I send him the names of the people whom I mentioned here as receiving pensions, and who had not either pre-truce or post-truce service, will he look into the matter and deal with it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will deal with that matter when he is replying.  There are dozens and dozens of men who have not complied with the provisions of the Act.  Only yesterday I was down in the bar and I met there a dozen men who had come up to Dublin about their pensions. It cost them a couple of pounds to come up, and some of them found it very hard to get the money.  They were very sceptical as to whether their claims for pensions would be successful or not.  They were told by the committees to which I have already referred, set up at the instance of the Minister, &ldquo;Go and tell the board anything and you are bound to get a pension.&rdquo;  That kind of thing ought to be stopped.  I will not say anything more about these cases for fear I might jeopardise the claims of these men. But it is a terrible thing to have that happening.  Under the 1924 Act a big number of claims were thrown out. That was done in a decent way.  The applications were not kept hanging over, but were thrown out right away, and the applicants were not put to the expense of coming up to Dublin.  You have many decent men being brought up before the Pensions Board and nothing is being done for them.  They are decent men who would not take a false oath.  At the present time you have a lot of people looking for pensions who, in their own estimation, are so-called kings.  They became kings when the Truce came, but they never cared a straw about the country.</P>
    <P>In the early stages of this pension business there was a good deal of argument as to who was a captain of a company, or as to who was a battalion officer at a certain period.  During the struggle men had been shot and others <Col N="876" /> were put in jail.  Nearly 13 years later this Pensions Act was passed, and then a lot of argument arose.  You had people who never gave a day's service in the pre-Truce period going around and forming companies in 1933.  They were forming companies and battalions in order to get pensions as battalion officers, a position that they never occupied until after the Truce.  They were forming companies in places where there never was a company.  I would ask the Minister to go into all this, because it is awful to see what is taking place in the country to-day.  I know what I am talking about, and can give the Minister the facts, figures and the names.  I am sorry that some of the Deputies from Tipperary are not in the House, because if they were they would know what I am talking about.  The whole thing is a terrible shame.  The chairman of the Pensions Board certainly knows that men got pensions in the early stages who were not entitled to them.</P>
    <P>I gathered from the Minister's speech this evening that there is not much hope of retaining in the Army those officers who have reached a certain age.  I would appeal to the Minister, in the case of officers who were connected with the national movement in any way from 1916 to 1921, to give them the fullest pension possible when they are going out.  As I said last night, these men gave good service to the country during the Volunteer period, and there ought to be some recognition of that now when they are going out of the Army under the present regulations.  I hope the Minister will do all he can for them.</P>

      <P>About ten years ago, when sitting in this House, I listened to the then Minister for Defence state that, in his opinion, there were not more than 3,000 men actively associated with the Irish Republican Army in pre-Truce times.  We had the statement from the Minister for Defence to-day that 57,000 applications were sent in under the 1934 Act and 21,000 under the 1924 Act; that under the 1924 Act 3,801 pensions are being paid, and that under the 1934 Act 5,500 odd qualifying certificates have been issued.  The Minister, in <Col N="877" /> his introductory speech, did not deny the fact that justifiable complaints are being made regarding the delay, and attempted, as he did last year, to advance reasons why the rate of progress in dealing with these 57,000 applications is so slow.  He compared the work done under the 1934 Act, with an increased staff, with the work done under the 1924 Act under the Cosgrave Government.  I join with Deputy Norton in protesting against the delay that takes place in advising applicants as to the result of the hearing of their cases before the board.  I can state definitely that I am aware of some cases where applicants appeared before the board one and a half years ago, and a year ago.  These applicants are still awaiting a decision from somebody in authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be something in that, because while the Government were hanging on to office by the skin of their teeth, as they thought, there might be some justifiable reason for refusing to ask the postal workers to carry too heavy a load of letters on any particular morning in advance of the general election, informing a large number of the 57,000 applicants that they were not going to get what they had been repeatedly promised.  I want to say quite frankly that, while I would not associate the Minister for Defence with this, the opinion does prevail in the country that unless you are actively associated with the Fianna Fáil Party you have very little chance of getting a pension under the 1934 Act.  Again, I want to say quite frankly that I have no evidence that the Minister is in any way associated with that kind of propaganda.  But that kind of propaganda was carried on within the last five weeks in my own constituency.  People there were told that if they did not want to lose their pensions they should vote for Fianna Fáil, and those waiting for a hearing before the board were told that if they wanted to have any hope of getting a hearing before the board and a pension they would have to give a clear majority to Fianna Fáil by <Col N="878" /> voting for the Fianna Fáil candidates. I want the Minister to say quite definitely&mdash;the Minister is a very blunt man&mdash;whether anybody except the Fianna Fáil Deputies sitting behind him, or the local leaders of Fianna Fáil in the country, have any right to make representations on behalf of those who are seeking pensions.  If the Minister says that members on the Opposition Benches have no right to make representations or that any representations they make will have no effect, I shall gladly accept that decision and pass over to those sitting behind the Minister the responsibility for carrying out some of the possible and impossible promises they made in the last election and in previous general elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been invited within the last year to attend a meeting of members of a certain brigade in my constituency. I replied that if the other four Deputies for the constituency were invited to the same meeting and were willing to attend, I should go there but that I was not willing to go as an individual Deputy if the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Deputies were to be absent, seeing, that the five of us had equal responsibility.  I never heard any more about that matter.  Those 5,500 persons who are in receipt of pensions are all right.  There is no fear that their pensions will be taken from them by this Government or any succeeding Government, no matter what may have been said by the local agents of the Fianna Fáil Party in the course of recent electioneering activities.  Pensions authorised by the Cosgrave Government, by this Government, or by any succeeding Government are not going to be taken from those to whom they have been awarded.  People who believe that sort of silly story, circulated for election purposes, are very foolish.  I should like to know from the Minister how many cases have been heard by the board, particularly during the last year; how many of the cases heard during the last year have been decided, and how many of the cases heard are still waiting for decision.  I should like to know how many applicants who appeared before the board during the last year, nine months or six months, are still waiting for a <Col N="879" /> decision.  I hope I am not putting the Minister to too much trouble in asking for that information.  I am sure that the officials who are sitting by his side will be able to get him that information in five minutes.  If the information is available and if the Minister is willing to give it, will he say why the decisions are held up in these cases.</P>
    <P>I have here a list of 78 names sent down by the Pensions Board seven months ago to a certain brigade officer in my area stating that in the opinion of the persons responsible&mdash;I presume the Service Pensions Board&mdash;these applicants did not appear to have the necessary qualifications for pension. In these cases, the individuals had not been called before the board and, so far as I know, have not yet been before the board.  Officers of the local brigade were invited to agree with the decision of the Service Board.  I want to know from the Minister under what statutory or other authority any officers of a brigade area are authorised to help the board in deciding issues of this kind, especially where applicants have not been given an opportunity of appearing before the board.  I should like the Minister to quote the section of the Act or the regulation under which brigade officers are invited to interfere in the administration of the Act.  I ask him to quote the section of the Military Service Pensions Act or the regulation under which certain local people are allowed to come up here and consult with the referee and, in some cases, with members of the Pensions Board as to whether certain applicants were right in the statements they made before the board.  I understand that these individuals are brought up here officially and I should like to know under what section of the Act or what regulation they are entitled to recover their expenses.  I should like to be enlightened on these matters because I am not aware that authority was given to anybody to administer the Military Service Pensions Act except the Service Pensions Board and the officers appointed to assist them by the Minister. In the case of these 78 names sent down seven or eight months ago, the Brigade officers concerned refused to <Col N="880" /> agree with the opinion of the authorities up here.  Unless it has been done quite recently, these persons have not been called before the board and have not received notice that their applications have been turned down.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the administration of the Military Service Pensions Act which one could deal with at length, but I think it would be useless to do so under present circumstances. I understand that there are three or four sections in the office where these applications are at present lying. In one section there are the applications which have been dealt with, and in respect of which pensions have been granted and are being paid.  In another section there are the applications which have been before the board and still await consideration.  In another section there is a very large number of applications which have been examined&mdash;in a cursory way or otherwise&mdash;and respecting which the opinion has been expressed that these people have not made a prima facie case or advanced on paper any justification for consideration of their applications or for their appearance before the board.  When will the people whose cases have been turned down and are lying in such large heaps in the Department of Defence be informed that their applications have been rejected?  The Government has now, in its own opinion, five years' security of tenure.  They have behind them a band of men who will pass anything they are prepared to put before the House.  These people to whom I refer should not be compelled to wait longer for intimation from the Pensions Board as to whether their applications have been granted or not, or whether they are to be brought before the board.</P>
    <P>It is time that the Ministry made up their minds to be honest in dealing with the majority of the 57,000 applicants and not have Fianna Fáil Deputies, as some of them are doing, passing over the applicants to Labour Deputies or members of the Opposition to listen to their cases and make representations to the Department in support of them.  That is the obvious duty of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, who say that nobody but themselves will <Col N="881" /> be listened to in connection with matters of this kind.  I invite Fianna Fáil Deputies to take over their responsibilities now and do their duty without further delay.  There is no justification for a delay which will involve years in dealing with the remainder of the 57,000 applications. In four years, 5,500 applications have been disposed of out of 57,000.  At the present rate of progress it will take 35 years to deal with the remainder of the applications still lying in the office of the Department of Defence. Deputies on the Government Benches have only five years of safety, and I hope they will make up their minds to encourage the Minister to deal with these applications in a more effective way and tell the applicants what their punishment or their pension is to be without further delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to speak on this Vote, but I was so impressed by the change of attitude on the Fine Gael Benches in regard to pensions that I thought it only right that I should express my view.  During the past year we heard a lot of sneers with regard to Army pensions from the Fine Gael Benches, and I am very pleased to find that their attitude to these pensions has changed this evening. They are all worried and troubled about the delay in the administration of the Act and the delay occasioned to applicants who are compelled to wait until their case is gone through by the Pensions Board, as it is usually called. I agree that there is a long delay, and I regret that such is the case.  I am also aware that, owing to the Act not coming into force until 16 years after these applicants had completed their service, it is not to be expected that their cases could be dealt with in a short space of time.  I think Deputies opposite must agree that if it was unjust to have a delay from 1934 to 1938, it was far more unjust to have a delay of ten years, from 1924 to 1934, before an opportunity was given of doing some semblance of justice to men who had served their country conscientiously and well and as they thought best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Pensions Act was, of course, a good thing, and while I am sure that it <Col N="882" /> is scarcely necessary to do so, I would impress on the Minister the necessity of doing everything possible to facilitate the hearing of pension claims, and also draw his attention to the fact that as the Pensions Act is administered at present, one section of the Irish Republican Army forces are not being dealt with in the manner they deserve. I refer to the ordinary volunteers, the type of men to whom Deputy Morrissey has referred.  As matters stand at present, in order to have qualifying service applicants must have taken part in some major engagement, but you have through the country, and particularly in the constituency I represent, a very large number of men who gave yeoman service, particularly at the end of 1920-21.</P>
    <P>If these men did not take part in an actual major engagement it was not their fault.  I know hundreds of men who during the latter months of 1920 and the early months of 1921, right up to 11th July, spent day and night at the post of duty&mdash;smashing railways, cutting enemy communications, trenching roads, demolishing bridges, carrying despatches and guarding the flying columns from arrest, and also guarding the rest of their comrades.  If this had not been done, and done efficiently, at that time, those of us who were lucky enough to get service pensions would not have got them, as the fight would never have been won.  I appeal strongly to the Minister to take these men into consideration and to give them the same service as was given their comrades who happened to take part in the various fights.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Ryan some minutes ago, and the more I heard of him, the more I was convinced that he knew absolutely nothing of the subject on which he was speaking.  He made allegations about the Old I.R.A. committees, the parish committees and about this, that and the other thing. I think that the Deputy must have considered that his audience must not be very intelligent.  If he knew the least thing about the procedure that obtains in regard to the granting of claims under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, he would not have made some of the statements he did <Col N="883" /> make.  He made allegations that parish committees had the granting of pensions.  The fact remains that, in brigade areas, you have a brigade committee, set up and recognised by the Pensions Board and composed of men who, beyond yea or nay, had both pre-truce and post-truce service, and who were responsible officers in the Volunteer and I.R.A. forces.  When these men are brought before the board they are brought to give evidence in the cases which have preceded them from their respective areas, and in doing so, I can assure you, Sir, and the House, that a man's creed or politics are not taken into account. Men are granted service on the amount of service they gave, and not on whether they were Blueshirts, Green-shirts, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael&mdash;or even Labour, as Deputy Kennedy reminds me.</P>

      <P>From what I know of the position here and in the country, I am quite satisfied that this whole pension scheme, which no doubt was brought in with the best intentions, has really more or less demoralised the national spirit of this country.  I know that pensions were due to many of the claimants.  They were needed, but latterly there seems to be nothing in this country but the one idea to grab all, take everything, but give no service. Try and get something for nothing seems to be the idea.  To my mind the sooner this pension scheme is got through, finished with, and all the claims decided one way or another the better it will be for the whole country.  I am aware that the Pensions Board has a huge task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one realises that when the <Col N="884" /> Republican Army was fighting here we could not get 8,000 men in the whole of Ireland to do any sort of work, and when one finds that under the 1934 Act there are 56,000 men applying for pensions and that 3,500 got pensions under the 1924 Act, one can see that out of these 56,000 claimants there can be no more than 5,000 entitled to a pension. In view of these figures any reasonable man must have sympatry with the board.</P>
    <P>I think the most pressing need at the present time is for the Old I.R.A. from all sides to come together as honest men and help to weed out bogus claims. In the County Meath we have all parties solidly united with the determination to see that every man in Meath who was entitled to a pension will get that pension, and that every scrounger looking for a pension, without being entitled to it, is going to get short shrift.  When we united in County Meath we found that in some districts where there had been only 10 or 11 or 12 men in the old Volunteers, we were presented with lists of 50, 60 and 70 Volunteers in these very places. We called together the old comrades. We went through the names and got them down to what they really should have been.  Meath is one of the most hardly treated counties in Ireland as regards pensions.  I raised the question here before.  I was informed of five men from Meath who were drawing pensions.  I got the names of these men and found that not one of them was a Meath man.  There were loyal and good men in the ordinary rank and file who were entitled to pensions and they were not even called before the board.  Before the election in 1937 rumours were sent round the country that all claimants to pensions were going to be given pensions.  That is all these men heard about it.  The same thing occurred before the 1938 election.  The number of applicants was so great that the claims of honest men could not be reached.</P>
    <P>I think now, after the election, when Fianna Fáil have a five years' period in front of them, the time has come when a number of the Truceliers, who destroyed the chances of decent men getting a pension, should be given short shrift.  We are all hoping they <Col N="885" /> will.  I do believe that the Pensions Board will go into this matter now more quickly.  Of course, the old procedure was a very good one for the Fianna Fáil Party, because as long as the cases of these men were undecided the Fianna Fáil Party had a sure hold of them.  They kept them in their ranks.  But as soon as these men are called before the board and their cases turned down, as they ought to be turned down because they have no claim to a pension, these men will turn against Fianna Fáil and be a thorn in their sides.  But Fianna Fáil is now firmly fixed in the saddle and does not give one damn now who is thrown out and who is not thrown out.</P>
    <P>I think the time has now come when the old I.R.A. should openly sit up. They should come and see after themselves. They have been let down by the whole country.  Men who really did serve in the old I.R.A. are to-day the most down-trodden people in the country.  I am speaking of what I know.  The men who were the warriors of the Irish people in the Black and Tan fight cannot to-day even get work on the roads from the county councils. There is no one looking after them. The only hope they have is to come up and have a say themselves in the national Government.  I think it is a shame that the Irish Governments, past and present, did not do more for the old I.R.A. than they did.</P>
    <P>The old I.R.A. men should be planted on the land, given a house and farm and put into the position of earning a decent living.  Some of these men got a pension of 6/-, 7/- or 8/- a week.  That is of very little use to them.  They should be allowed to exchange those pensions and realise £300 or £400, which would give them a chance to make a start in the country.  Again, very many of them have gone to Australia, the United States or Canada.  They are a national loss.  We should have seen to it that these men should have been given land in this country.</P>
    <P>From what my colleague, Deputy Jerry Ryan, has said there must be something wrong in the manner in which these pension claims in Tipperary <Col N="886" /> have been dealt with.  We have men there drawing pensions of £100 a year who were not entitled to them. In the face of that someone should be made suffer.  I do not believe there is an honest man in Tipperary who would stand up and say that any man should get a pension if that man were not entitled to it.  In the same way there is no honest man who would be ready to stand up and say that a man who is not entitled to a pension should get it.  Daily the ranks of the old I.R.A. are diminishing.  Look at the Press any day and you read the death of an old warrior leaving a wife and perhaps five or six children in poor circumstances.  Some of these men waited five or six years for pensions which did not reach them.  Now the I.R.A. man is gone and his wife and children are left almost destitute. Surely with only about 8,000 men in the whole country entitled to pensions the Minister, now with the old I.R.A. organised as they are, should be able to fire out those 40,000 odd applicants who have no claim at all to pensions. The old I.R.A. will be very proud and happy at seeing the Minister taking his courage in his hands and writing to those 40,000 Truceliers, who have damned the chances of honest men getting a pension, and telling them that they will get no pension.  If the Minister takes his courage in his hands and does that he will have earned the respect of the old I.R.A. and the justice which should have been done ten years ago to our old comrades will have been done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>During this debate it has been suggested from every side of the House that there had been considerable delay in the administration of the Pensions Act.  Deputies should realise that with the large number of claims to be dealt with there is bound to be delay.  If Deputies will compare the length of time it took the courts in this country to deal with claims under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, they will be given some idea of the amount of work that the pension claims entail.  Now under the Damage to Property Act every court in the country was constituted <Col N="887" /> as a court for hearing the claims.  Under this Act you have only one Board, so it is quite natural that there must be a large amount of delay.</P>
      <P>There is one particular type of claimant that I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  It is that of the man who time and again volunteered for active service and was prepared to go on active service but, for various reasons, was not called upon to do so.  Perhaps there was not sufficient equipment in the particular column and the man was not given his chance to give the service that he was prepared to give.  Active service is not defined in the Act.  Now I say that it is unfair that men should be brought up long distances before the board here in Dublin if there is not a probability that they have a good claim.  This is a heavy expense on the claimants.  I think, if possible, the Pensions Board should go down to each particular area.  It should sit at least in each county so that those claims could be dealt with expeditiously on the spot.  If the board were to sit in each county in the State I think the work could be got through more quickly and, in addition, these poor people should not be put to the expense of having to travel to Dublin. That is an expense they can badly afford.  Sometimes men are brought up here and then it is found that they do not qualify for a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another type of applicant under this Act which I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  I refer to claimants who are now living in the United States, Canada and Australia.  These men, if they were here, could qualify for a pension but being away they have great difficulty in getting their claims through.  I suggest that there should be some procedure whereby a board might be set up in the State in which they live, or our Consulates in those countries could be used for the purpose of taking evidence to prove their claims.  Numbers of these men would qualify for a pension if their claims could only be heard. Quite a number of them are in the United States owing to their health, and I think those are people who should be dealt <Col N="888" /> with first, if possible&mdash;certainly, I think their claims should have priority over the others.  I suggest that the Minister should establish some means by which such people could have their claims heard and dealt with over there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moran has raised the question of both disability and service pension-applicants in the United States, and he says that some machinery should be set up there to deal with their cases.  Well, machinery has been set up already to deal with such cases; and a very large number of service pensions have been issued to men who are in the United States. The same applies to disability pensions also.  In the case of disability, we get doctors over there to examine the applicants; these doctors furnish a certificate and, on the acceptance of the certificate by the people here, these men get their disability pensions.  Deputy Moran raised another point that was raised by some other Deputies, and that is that the Military Service Pensions Board should go down the country. Well, I am satisfied, at any rate, that the board and the referee can work very much more expeditiously in Dublin.  They have their staff there, note-takers and so on, and it would be very difficult indeed to shift these people around the country and find suitable accommodation for them.  I think it is much better in every way that they should be left where they are and allowed to get on with their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of speakers here complained about one portion of the work being put on the local people, and at the same time they complained about the slowness in letting people know whether or not they were entitled to a pension.  I may inform those Deputies that, almost a year ago, the referee and the board sent out two lists to all the local brigade committees, and on those lists&mdash;at the moment I do not know whether it was (a) list or (b) list&mdash;they said, in effect: &ldquo;It appears to us, from a look at the forms, that those on list (a) are not entitled to a pension at all, and that those on list (b) are very doubtful cases&rdquo;&mdash;and they asked the assistance of the committee in stating whether or not that was so.  With regard to one list, the applicants made <Col N="889" /> no case at all, and it was the intention of the referee and the board to put these people out of pain by saying: &ldquo;You have not made any case, and it seems to us that you are not entitled to a pension.&rdquo;  They were going to give these people that warning, but the local committees would not take the responsibility of saying: &ldquo;Well, that is so,&rdquo; or even of disagreeing.  They were not asked to pass final judgment upon the matter at all.  They were simply asked. &ldquo;Is this, roughly, the case, or have you any objections with regard to those on the list who have been notified that they have not made a case?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>But would it not make them very unpopular locally, if they did that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the referee is not all-knowing.  He has to get information and evidence from somebody or another, and in these particular cases the applicants did not state, even on paper, that they were entitled to claim.  They made no claim at all for service, and the referee wanted to notify them that such was the case.  I think it was a wrong policy of the local brigade committees to refuse to pass on those (a) and (b) lists.  However, I suppose it is one of these things that cannot be cured, and we have got to take the inconveniences that go with the carrying out of our duty.  One of these inconveniences is that it is going to take a bit longer to get the job finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Davin who alluded to the (a) and (b) lists and asked for the legal authority.  Well, the referee is entitled to get whatever assistance he can, and that was one way in which he sought assistance from the local people.  Deputy Davin also asked for the legal authority for paying expenses of verifying officers who came to town to verify for applicants.  Again, the referee is entitled to call witnesses to certify or disprove claims that have been made, and if the Deputy looks up the Estimate I think he will see that that is a sum that is probably vouched for.  Deputy Morrissey wanted the Act extended so as to provide for those <Col N="890" /> who had civil war service only.  Well, the Act of 1924 did not provide pensions for those who had civil war service only, and neither did the Act of 1934.  Certainly I have not the slightest intention of introducing an Act to provide for that service alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton and others asked how long it is going to take to clear up the whole matter of the military service pensions cases, and also asked about the deferred cases.  I have not got the figures Deputy Davin asked for as to what proportion of those whose cases were heard during the last 12 months were deferred, but we can get them later on.  The fact of the matter is that the referee and the board have a terrifically difficult job to do, and, as I explained in my opening statement, it is 17 years after the event and that makes it all the more difficult to get proper verification and get through the job.  The board and the referee, however, are doing their utmost. Roughly, they have dealt with and passed awards on 5,881 claims, and they have heard a large number of thousands of others.  Notwithstanding anything that you may do, however, it is difficult to speed up the cases in order to make awards quickly, but the board and the referee are doing their utmost and I think that another couple of years should see the matter completely cleaned up, particularly if we can get the co-operation from the local people that we are entitled to expect.</P>
      <P>Some people condemn the local committees, but without them we could not do the work.  We have to have somebody who will verify for service, and the referee simply asked the local old I.R.A. men to agree on somebody who could talk for them.  There was no other way of doing the business.  Deputy O'Higgins asked in what order the cases are heard.  The referee and the board try to hear the cases that are really entitled to pensions&mdash;that is, those who have made a good case for pensions&mdash;and they have also asked the opinion of the local brigade committees in that regard and asked them to send a list of the best cases in their areas which they thought might be heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> Every effort is being made to deal first with those who have really good, clear cases for pensions.  I think it is the best order in which to proceed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins alluded to the appointment of some official called &ldquo;The Soldier's Friend.&rdquo;  He based his case for the appointment of such an official on the grounds that all the correspondence with regard to pensions was dealt with by finance officials in the Department of Defence.  The Department of Defence, of course, have to look after the public purse in regard to pensions and so on, but they also have the duty of looking after the rights of those who have claims under the various pensions schemes.  If correspondence comes in showing that a man is entitled to some sort of pension, his claim is not turned down because he has made his application under the wrong Act; he is told under what Act to apply.  Again, it is a wrong impression to give that any of the Disability or other Service Acts are being dealt with by what you might call &ldquo;dyed-in-wool civil servants.&rdquo;  If you take the Service Act, the referee is not a civil servant.  He was set up there specially by the Government to give every applicant a fair crack of the whip.  He is assisted by two men who are not civil servants.  If you take the case of the Wounds and Disability Act, you have there three men on the Registration Board and three men on the Wounds and Disability Board who are not civil servants, and who are administering those Acts.  I do not see any case in the world for the appointment of any such official as Deputy O'Higgins calls for.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins and others raised certain cases where pensions had been wrongly awarded.  Deputy O'Higgins said that as far as he is aware somebody sent in a letter to the Department of Defence 12 months ago making an allegation that an award was wrongly made.  That letter may have come in; I do not know.  I have no recollection of seeing it, but if the Deputy gives me the name and address of the person concerned I will have the case looked up.  The Department of Defence is more concerned than anybody <Col N="892" /> else could possibly be to prevent fraud, because if in any district one applicant who is not entitled to a pension gets his case through it causes a considerable lot of trouble.  If any Deputy can help to prevent fraud in regard to any of the pension cases we would be very grateful indeed.  I have power as Minister for Defence to reopen any case where a <i>prima facie</i> case is made to me that fraud has been practised.  There is no use in people coming along, as Deputy Ryan and Deputy O'Higgins have done, and making an allegation here that they can give evidence.  They can do the devil and all when they are here in the Dáil at the time of the Estimates debate, but that is not the time to do it.  If they have any evidence which will enable us to detect fraud, the time to give it is during the year and through the ordinary channels.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to just one other matter which I think will clear up a lot of the points made.  Deputy O'Higgins and others talked of commuting small pensions, and said that he wondered why the precedent which was established under the Wounds and Disability Act, 1924, was not applied to the Service Pensions Act of 1934. Neither was it applied to the Service Pensions Act of 1924.  For some reason or other there seems to be general disapproval of commuting even the small pensions.  It is a matter which can be examined again to see whether there is the same objection to it now as there was in the past.  I remember raising that question once, and for some reason or another everybody seemed to be against it.  However, I will have that matter examined again.  From the Departmental point of view it would be preferable to take a lot of the small pensions off the list, but I think the old argument against it is that if you start commuting pensions the people to whom you have given lump sums will be back on your doorstep; it often holds. There may be something to be said for commuting the very small ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  Is there any prospect of considering claims in respect of 1916 service in priority?  There is also another point which I want to put to <Col N="893" /> the Minister in regard to &ldquo;The Soldier's Friend&rdquo;.  I raised that question a couple of months ago, and advisedly, because I had experience of the necessity for it myself.</P>

      <P>As I say, I am not at all convinced about the necessity for &ldquo;The Soldier's Friend&rdquo;.  Setting one up, in my opinion, would be simply sending the fool further and encouraging people who have no case under the Acts.  In regard to the 1916 men, Deputy Peadar Doyle also raised that matter.  As far as I am aware, the referee and the board are doing their utmost to clear up the 1916 cases, and I think there are very few of those cases left outstanding.  If any are left I will be glad to hear of them, and will bring them to the attention of the referee.</P>

      <P>A statement was made here by Deputy Kelly, when the House was discussing the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce. It appears in the Official Debates of July 7th, column 485, and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Then we heard the Roscrea factory being brought up again. There was another factory which got money from the Government, and I read their balance sheet the other day.  The statement occurs in the balance sheet that they are not using the money given to them by the Government for the purposes for which it was given to them.  I had that balance sheet in my pocket during the last election, in case anyone might stand up and accuse Deputy Briscoe of acting in any way dishonourable. If so, I would have something to say about it.  He had to go through the election just as I had.  We were colleagues in that campaign, and I was fortified with that document....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know, if the Minister for Finance paid that amount of money, what the Minister for Agriculture would have to say to insinuations like that.  The actual facts are that we put up a factory costing £18,500 for the Government.  We had an agreement with the Government that they were to pay us a certain amount of compensation. I will not say how much we lost during the first two years carrying on their business.  That money was paid to us by agreement.  It was our money.  I want to know if the insinuations made, which, to a certain extent, were joined in by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, are about our money.  It was our money and we could throw it into the Suir if we liked. It was given to us for no purpose but as compensation and for the equipment we put up for the Government. Deputy Kelly said that he took the document around in his pocket.  I think <Col N="895" /> it was a fitting occupation for Deputy Kelly to act as &ldquo;botheen&rdquo; boy to Deputy Barrabas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objects of this Bill are to implement Section 11 of Article 12 of the Constitution, which provides that the President shall have an official residence in or near the City of Dublin; that he shall receive such emoluments or allowances as may be <Col N="897" /> determined by law, and that the emoluments shall not be diminished during his term of office.  The Bill is intended to make provision for the maintenance of the official residence, and for the expenses of the office of secretary to the President, certain other facilities and services, and, finally, to make provision for the granting of pensions to persons who have held the office of President.  Section 1 (1) has been drafted to show separately the amount represented by the personal remuneration of the President which will be included in the total of the emoluments and allowances payable in pursuance of the Article in the Constitution to which I have referred.  The balance of the amount to be provided under sub-section (1) of Section I will represent the allowance to the President in respect of the general expenses of his establishment, his household staff and the maintenance and running of a motor car or cars.</P>
      <P>In determining the amount of the emoluments and allowances to be paid to the President, the Government have been guided by the recommendations of the majority of the Committee of Inquiry into Ministerial and Other Salaries and Allowances.  The following are the relevant extracts from the report of that committee:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are aware,&rdquo; the report states, &ldquo;that the holder of the office of the Presidency will be the first citizen of the land; that high and responsible functions are vested in him under the Constitution, and that he will be debarred from holding any other office of profit or emolument.  Consequently the remuneration for the office should be such as to place him in a position of complete independence financially, and to enable him to maintain with dignity the high position of head of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the terms of the Constitution,&rdquo; the report goes on to say, &ldquo;the Uachtaran will have an official residence in or near the City of Dublin. We have assumed that the expenditure involved in the provision of the residence, of furniture and equipment and of the maintenance and upkeep of the house and any grounds attached thereto, including wages of the labouring and gardening <Col N="898" /> staff, will be defrayed directly by the State.  Such arrangements, however, though to some extent they may be regarded as part of the emoluments or perquisites attaching to the office of Uachtaran and should therefore not be left out of consideration in assessing the total provision that might properly be made for that office, also impose upon the holder an obligation to maintain himself and his private establishment upon a commensurate scale.  Due note must be taken of this factor in determining the personal salary of the Uachtaran.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have also assumed,&rdquo; the report states in paragraph 85, &ldquo;that the Uachtaran will, from the remuneration or allowances provided for him, be obliged to defray the cost of the domestic staff necessary for his residence and of all other charges involved in the maintenance of his private establishment on a considerable scale.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are of opinion,&rdquo; the report states in another paragraph, &ldquo;that the emoluments and allowances of the Uachtaran might properly be divided into three parts&mdash;personal remuneration, allowances towards entertainment and towards the cost of his official establishment, and the provision and maintenance of his official residence.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Bearing in mind that the expenditure by the State on the office of the Uachtaran should neither be altogether disproportionate to the provision which we have recommended might suitably be made for ministerial salaries, nor be too great a burden on the public purse, we think that it would be proper for us to recommend that the total cost to the State of providing for the residence, establishment and expenses of the office of Uachtaran na h-Eireann should not exceed £15,000 a year approximately, of which £5,000 a year would be payable to the holder of the post as personal salary, fully subject to taxation.  Some of our number, however, were inclined to the view that on the basis mentioned the limit of total annual cost might be £20,000 and the salary £7,500.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In relation to the particular question <Col N="899" /> of the personal salary of the President I think the House will no doubt have in mind the fact that the salary of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has been fixed at £4,000 and no suggestion has been made at any time that that figure is excessive.  It is felt that the personal salary of the President, as Head of the State, should be markedly greater than that of any officer of the State.  The committee's recommendation that the salary should be £5,000 is a very reasonable one and that figure has, accordingly, been adopted and, as I have already pointed out, is stated in sub-section (1) of Section 1 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amount to be allotted as allowance towards the expense of the maintenance of the Presidential household, it has been decided, in view of the constitutional bar against reduction during an individual term of office, that at the outset the amount should not be higher than the minimum which it is felt will permit the Presidential establishment to be maintained and all the functions, social and otherwise, of the Presidency to be fulfilled unostentatiously but, nevertheless, as befits that high office. After close examination, the conclusion has been arrived at that it would not be reasonable to allow less than £5,000 per annum for this purpose and that figure has, accordingly, been inserted in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is intended to make provision for the expenses of the office of the Secretary to the President, including allowance to <i>aide-de-camp,</i> for the equipment and maintenance of the official residence and for such incidentals as official travelling, postage, telegrams, telephones and stationery.  These expenses from their nature will fluctuate from time to time and, for this reason, apart from other considerations, their inclusion in the irreducible amount of emoluments and allowances would not be practicable. Section 2, therefore, is intended to allow expenses of this nature to be provided out of moneys voted annually by the Oireachtas and the necessary Vote in fact for that purpose has already been passed by the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> In addition, expenditure will be incurred on the Votes for Public Works and Buildings, on stationery and printing, on the upkeep of the residence and gardens and on sundry supplies. As in the case of the expenses of the Secretariat, no firm estimate can be attempted at the moment as to the annual amount of this expenditure. I may mention, however, that the annual charge under the head of maintenance and upkeep of the Presidential residence and grounds, even when, as during more recent years, the residence itself has been unoccupied, has been of the order of £3,000.  The additional expenditure necessitated by the occupation of the building will not, it is felt, be unreasonably in excess of this. As the House is no doubt aware, there are very fine gardens attached to the official residence, the fruit of long years of labour and a great deal of expenditure, and these gardens have to be maintained irrespective of whether the Presidential residence was occupied or not.</P>
    <P>The pension provisions for the President are incorporated in Section 3 of the Bill, and in this connection it may be relevant to read the following extract from paragraph 88 of the report of the Committee of Inquiry to which I have already referred:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We feel,&rdquo; the report states, &ldquo;however, that it is imperative on the State to provide against the contingency that a person on relinquishing office as Uachtaran might be obliged to live in circumstances which would be undesirable in the case of one who had previously occupied a position of such distinction in the community.  In consideration of this matter we have assumed that a person who has held the office of Uachtaran will, in the normal course, be precluded from returning to business or professional pursuits and that it is most unlikely that he will take an active part in politics with consequent possibility of ministerial or other parliamentary office.  It will probably be found that even in retirement a former Uachtaran would be obliged by circumstances over which he has no control to maintain his domestic establishment on a fairly considerable scale.  If these assumptions <Col N="901" /> are correct, it seems clear that there is an obligation on the State to provide a pension of reasonable amount.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As to what the amount of the pension should be, the majority of the committee agreed to recommend that after holding office for seven years the Uachtaran should be eligible to receive a pension of £1,200 a year.</P>
    <P>The committee's recommendation as to the amount of the pension has been accepted, but it has been felt that it would be unwise and inequitable to restrict the grant of pension to persons who serve for seven years or over in the Presidential office.  If this restriction were applied it would not be possible to grant a pension to a person who was obliged prematurely to relinquish the office of President on the grounds of permanent incapacity within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution.  Neither could a pension be granted to a President who, having served for less than seven years, found himself obliged, say, on some ground of high principle to resign and who was not re-elected at the ensuing election. It appears most desirable that the provision to be made for the grant of pension in such a case should be such as would secure, as far as possible, the President's freedom from personal financial considerations in the exercise of his functions.</P>
    <P>Conceding, then, that provision should be made for the granting of a pension without condition as to length of service in cases of the type stated, it was thought unnecessary to make any reference in the Bill to a service qualification.  A President can cease to hold office only by completion of a seven-year period of office, by retirement on incapacity, by resignation, by death or by impeachment under Article 12 of the Constitution.  The Bill provides for the grant of the specified pension to the President as of right, no matter what his length of service in each of the circumstances above mentioned, except where the cessation of his office is brought about by death or impeachment.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 3 provides that a second term of the Presidential office will not enable the holder to <Col N="902" /> qualify for a second Presidential pension.  Where a President in receipt of a pension is re-elected President, the provision for abatement of pension on account of other remuneration out of public funds, set out in sub-section (3) of Section 5, will operate to prevent payment of the pension during his second term of office.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with the general provisions in respect of pensions granted under the Act.  As to the first of these, it is considered that on the grounds of public policy it is undesirable that the President should look forward to taking up or renewing a political career on the termination of his office and, accordingly, notwith standing the provisions of the Payment of Members (Amendment) Act, of 1925, it is provided in sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Bill that the pension should be abated in the case of an ex-President who becomes a member of the Dáil or Seanad and receives an allowance as such.  Sub-sections (3) and (4) of that section provide for the suspension in whole or part of the pension in the event of an ex-President's re-employment, and remuneration out of public funds or the funds of local authorities, or from any other sources, such as, for instance, the Currency Commission, the Electricity Supply Board, the Turf Board, or University funds which the Government may deem to be a public fund for the purpose of this section.</P>
    <P>The fundamental idea in granting a pension to an ex-President is to provide against the possibility of a person who has held the office of President being unable to maintain the dignity of the position through lack of means. But if an ex-President is able and willing to get another public appointment with remuneration equal to or exceeding the amount granted to him as a pension, then the need for the payment of the pension disappears, at least during the occupancy of that fresh appointment.  In view of the adequacy of the amount of the pension which it is proposed to grant, the necessity for allowing the pensioner to supplement it to some extent by earning from public funds does not exist, and for this reason the net of suspension <Col N="903" /> is being cast in a wide form and the maximum total receipts, which may include any pension, have been fixed at the amount of pension payable. If an ex-President earns £1,200 or upwards from public funds no pension will be payable.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for the grant of a pension of £500 to the widow of a President or an ex-President who is entitled to a pension.  It is intended by the grant of a pension to an ex-President to ensure that he should be able to maintain the dignity attaching to him by virtue of his former office.  It appears essential and desirable that the widow of an ex-President should be provided for proportionately. It will be observed, however, that the widow's right to the specified pension of £500 per annum is dependent upon her making a personal application for it, and her pension is subject to suspension and abatement in like manner and for the same reason as in the case of the President.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill, which creates the post of Secretary to the President, provides, amongst other things, that the secretaryship will be a permanent post in the Civil Service of the State, and thus extends to the holder the benefits of the Civil Service Superannuation Acts.  The provision in sub-section (4) of this section brings the post of secretary into line with all other Civil Service posts in regard to tenure and the determination of remuneration and terms and conditions of service.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill makes the necessary provision for clerical assistance in the office of Secretary to the President, and power to make such appointments as may be required is conferred by that section.  To make sure that no doubts will arise as to the method of making these appointments, it is proposed that they will be subject to the provisions of the Civil Service Regulation Act and every Act extending or amending those Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I rarely find myself in the position of supporting Government measures, particularly when it is a case of expenditure in connection with salaries.  On this particular occasion I find myself in full agreement <Col N="904" /> with the Bill introduced by the Minister. It will be within the recollection of the House that some 12 months ago a rather representative commission was established in order to inquire fully into certain matters put before them, including the salary, etc., suitable for the office of President.  That committee, consisting of 16 persons, was representative of all Parties in this House.  It included representatives of the industrial life, the labour world and the farming community outside.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that for those associated with politics there is always a very big temptation to make political capital out of matters such as this. There is always a big temptation to oppose in order to make political capital. It is also true to say of every member of that commission that that bait, no matter how tempting, was rejected, and every member of that commission sat down to do the work in a spirit detached from, divorced from politics, conscious only of the big responsibility that was on them to make recommendations in accordance with the dignity of the State and, in this particular item, conscious that we were dealing with a new office higher than any other office in the State.  The recommendations made unanimously, with certain minor reservations, are the recommendations substantially contained in this Bill.  It at least has this much to recommend it, that every member of that commission no matter from what Party or from what class, was unanimous in thinking that the cost of the office outlined in this Bill was reasonable from the taxpayers' point of view and at about the minimum that would be necessary, considering the importance of the office and the dignity of the position of Head of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations with regard to pension, both for the holder of the office, and, if it should arise, for the widow of the holder of the office, were based on the common sense point of view that it should be possible for even the poorest member of the community to attain to that high office if he got sufficient support from the public and that it would be unfair to the poorer classes if a leader of the <Col N="905" /> poorer sections of the people, a poor man himself, found himself in that very high office and after his seven years were up had got to return to conditions of comparative poverty. The recommendations with regard to pension were not prompted by the idea of giving a pension to any comparatively wealthy man.  They were rather prompted from the point of view that our ideal in this State is the ideal of democracy, that every office inside this State should be available to the poor, should be open to the poorest man as well as to the wealthiest, and we realised that it is impossible for any man to occupy a very high office in this or any other country for a considerable number of years and then return to the comparative obscurity of the humble state of life which he previously occupied.  Every high office carries high obligations and high commitments and one does not shed those obligations or commitments entirely when leaving office.  The recommendation for a pension for the holder of the office was based on considerations such as those.  The recommendation for a pension in the case of the widow was based on similar consideration.</P>
    <P>If the Dáil approves of this Bill in the same non-political, non-Party spirit as that commission did its work, it will be a very good headline in the creation of new offices.  As I said, politically it is tempting to oppose measures such as this.  At times, duty and our sense of responsibility dictate that political temptations must be left aside, that the State is greater than Party, and that setting a proper headline and supporting State offices that are divorced from politics is a far more important work than defending Party interests or political causes.  It was in that spirit that the work was approached by every individual member of the commission.  I think the spirit in which those individuals approached their work deserves a certain amount of approval from the Dáil, and that the best note of approval that the Dáil can contribute is to realise that those people, before there were any vested interests and before they knew to whom this particular allowance would be paid, devoted their time for four or five months to this work <Col N="906" /> and made the recommendations that are incorporated in this Bill.  I join my voice to that of the Minister for Finance in asking the Dáil to approve of the recommendations in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two sections of this Bill to which I should like to devote attention.  Deputy O'Higgins has enjoined us to pass the Bill without cavilling at its provisions and, almost, to overlook any obvious blemishes which may appear in the Bill.  If only for the sake of paying tribute and obeisance to what he describes as a high office, we ought to temper our considerations of dignity by some reference to common sense and we ought not to be entirely carried away by this idolatrous regard for high office to such an extent as not to remove blemishes where blemishes appear. Deputy O'Higgins told us that this Bill was founded on the report of the committee, and that, therefore, as an appreciation of the work of the committee, we ought to pass this Bill.  Of course, Deputy O'Higgins forgot to tell the House that the section in this Bill which provides for the payment of £1,100 a year as a pension to the holder of the Presidential office is widely divergent from the recommendation contained in the report of the committee. The majority of the committee took the view that the holder of the office should only get this pension after he had held office for seven years.  A minority of the committee took the view that he ought to serve for 14 years before he could get a pension of £1,200 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A pension of £1,200 a year is a very substantial pension in the circumstances of this country.  If we are going to award pensions of £1,200 a year, we ought to award them only for lengthy service and for meritorious service.  In Section 3 of this Bill we are not concerned with the duration of that service the committee recommended that a pensior of £1,200 should be paid after seven years.  The majority of the committee, at all events, did so, but under Section 3 of this Bill it is possible for a person to be elected President on a Monday, to have a row with the Government on Tuesday, to resign on Wednesday, and <Col N="907" /> to apply for a pension of £1,200 on Thursday.  I may be told, of course, that that is not likely to happen, but if that situation does come about, there is legal authority to pay a pension to a man who has been three days in office.  He can go to the courts, as Deputy Costello will tell Deputy O'Higgins, and compel the State to pay him that pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Deputy for a moment?  I think if a man gave up £5,000 a year so as to get £1,200 a year he would be removed from office as a lunatic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins is apparently satisfied that the kind of person we are going to get in the Presidential office in this country is a person who will be only concerned with one type of appeal, that no matter what he is being asked to do by the Government, no matter how much he is being coerced or abused by the Government, all the time he will hold office because £5,000 a year is better than £1,200.  I prefer to think that we shall get as President a person who is not so much concerned with the attraction of that £5,000, and if he felt it necessary to resign because of a disagreement with the Government that he would do so even at the price of sacrificing £5,000 a year.  Deputy O'Higgins, by his interjection, apparently imagines that you will get mercenary-minded folk who, in the discharge of their duties as President, will trample on every principle and allow themselves to be rolled into any shape a Government likes because £5,000 is more than £1,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being asked to pass a Bill under which it is possible for a person who has served as President for a few days to walk off with £1,200 per year for life.  Is there any other citizen in the State who would <Col N="908" /> be treated as generously?  Is there any other office in the State where it is possible under legislation to get a pension of £1,200 a year after a few days' or a few hours' service?  Yet it is possible under this Bill to get £1,200 a year as pension after having served for that short period.  If Deputy O'Higgins wants to honour the committee upon which he served and upon which other persons served, he ought at least to have stood out for the very reasonable recommendation of the committee that a person ought not to get a pension of £1,200 a year unless he has served for seven years.  It is not a gift or a gratuity of £1,200, it is a pension of £1,200 per year for life.  The capital value of that pension is quite a considerable sum, and we ought not lightly to vote for a pension of that kind without making sure that a person has served a minimum period in the office of President.  I am opposed therefore, to the passing in this form of a Bill which makes it possible for a person to get a pension of such substantial dimensions after such a short period of service.</P>
    <P>In recommending this section to us, the Minister stated that if a person ceases to hold the office of President he has to adjust himself to private life, and you cannot expect him to go back to whatever occupation, if any, he followed prior to his assumption of the Presidential office.  That is reasonable and understandable, and everybody, I think, desires to make provision for a pension for the holder of the office, provided, as I said, he renders service sufficiently long to merit the granting of a pension.  The Minister visualised that this person who held the Presidential office might desire to become a private citizen, and in these circumstances we have to make provision for his sustenance in future.</P>
    <P>But an entirely different reason was given in asking us to pass Section 5. In recommending Section 5 to us the Minister told us that while the ex-President might desire to lead the life of a private citizen and almost become a recluse, we must at the same time provide for the possibility that he will select politics as a career.  So that he can have the choice of either of two courses&mdash;to become a private citizen, <Col N="909" /> when his existence in retirement will scarcely be known to anybody&mdash;certainly he need not obtrude himself on the public if he does not desire to do so&mdash;or, if he does not like that uneventful career, he can shift over to the turbulent and tempestuous career of a politician.  Whether he decides to live a quiet or a turbulent life, there is a pension to be provided for him in any case.  If he decides to live in quiet retirement, he will get a pension of £1,200 per year.  If he prefers the more exciting career of a politician, then he can become a member of the Oireachtas and he can come in here and become the most leisured politician in the House.  If he does that, and takes his place again as an ordinary citizen of the country, entitled to no more admiration and no more respect than any other Deputy, he will still be able to carry in here with him a pension of £1,200 a year, less his allowance of £360 as Deputy.</P>
    <P>If there is so much respect and admiration for an ex-President as to permit him to have a pension of £1,200 a year, we might reasonably expect him to live in retirement.  If he does not desire to do that, and prefers instead to follow the career of a Deputy, then he ought to have no special recognition at all, if, having abandoned his Presidential position, he desires to go back to public life, and into the more stormy aspect of public life, membership of this House.  I take the view that if the ex-President desires to become a member of the Dáil he indicates by his action in doing so that he wants to get into the heat and burden of the day, that he wants to be like every other Deputy.  If he decides to do that, there is then no case whatever for paying him a pension of £1,200 per year, such as you would pay to him if he decided to lead a quiet, retired life.  If the ex-President decides to become a member of the Dáil, I think the pension to him ought to cease entirely.</P>
    <P>Taking Sections 3 and 5 together, we may have a situation here where, after having served for a few days as President, a person may have a row with the Government and resign, may make himself the child of a political Party the following week, may fight and win <Col N="910" /> a by-election the week after, and may come into the Dáil again as probably the noisiest politician here, reeking with rancour because of the difficulties he experienced with the Government; and, in our sane senses, we are going to give him a pension of £860 per year in that set of circumstances.</P>

      <P>Certainly he would not be as bad as the Deputy&mdash;there is one little consolation in that.

Without making any reference to the present holder of the office, because normally we ought to have been dealing with this Bill before he assumed his present position, I think that we are needlessly generous in Section 3 and that we are leaving a loophole which ought to be closed.  In respect to Section 5, we ought to say to an ex-President: &ldquo;If you are going to go back into public life and be a member of the Oireachtas, then there is no case whatever for giving you a pension such as we would be prepared to give if you led a quiet, retired life as a dignified ex-President.&rdquo;  I am not opposing the Second Stage of the Bill, because it is essentially a Committee Bill, but I certainly reserve for myself the right to move amendments in the Committee Stage to try to close these two gaps and cure what seems to me two possible abuses under the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <P>What I dislike, and what I think every fair-minded person will dislike in connection with this Bill, is the association of dignity and money. It is assumed by this Bill that there can be no dignity attached to the office of President or to any other office unless there is a certain amount of money attached to that office.  I think that the principle upon which this State should be founded, and upon which every democratic State should be founded, is that there should be a certain amount of dignity attached to honest labour.  The people who have held the office of President in this State since it was established&mdash;Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins, William Cosgrave, and Eamon de Valera&mdash;were men who brought dignity to that office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> It was not the dignity of money but the dignity of hard work.  They were men who stood out above all others as workers, honest, fearless workers, and whole-time workers.  As workers, they brought dignity to this office and to the State.  They are recognised, and will always be recognised, as men who stood out not only above their fellow-countrymen, but above the leaders and heads of State in other countries, and I do not think we should depart from that principle.</P>
    <P>We have it set out here that it will be a disgrace to this State if an ex-president, or a president, commits the awful crime of digging his garden with a spade: that poverty, in any shape or form, is a disgrace for the highest officer of this State.  What I, as a farmer, want to point out is this: we in the country are frequently insulted and upbraided and told that we do not recognise the dignity of honest labour; that we, our children and our friends are leaving the country and coming into the towns and cities to look for higher wages.  We are told that somebody should be sent to educate us on the dignity of working on the land, even though we are getting no remuneration whatever for our labour.  Yet, in this Bill dealing with the office of the President, we have it clearly stated that there can be no dignity without ample remuneration. That is a principle that, I think, should never have been introduced.  I think that the office of the President should carry with it a considerable amount of hard work.  I have considered from the very outset that the Presidential office should have been amalgamated, or merged, with the office of Chief Justice, so that you would have at the head of the State a person who was absolutely divorced, not only from politics but from the possibility of ever becoming a politician. In that way you would have got over the difficulty of getting rid of, or disposing of, ex-presidents.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why this principle of creating a new something in the nature of a new aristocracy is being introduced.  Seeing that there can be no dignity for the President unless he receives ample remuneration, <Col N="912" /> I presume there can be no dignity associated with those in touch with the Presidential office&mdash;with those visiting the President&mdash;unless they can do so in state.  We are creating a new aristocracy or, rather I should say, a new snobocracy, a thing that is most undesirable in this country where the majority of the people are of humble means.  We are a new State, and I think we should be a democratic State, a State founded on the principle that every citizen has got to live, as far as possible, by honest work, and that the differences between the various classes or sections of the community are not very great.</P>
    <P>Now, it has been said that the office of the Chief Justice carries with it a salary of £4,000 a year.  I think that salary would have been quite ample for the office of the President.  As I have said, there is no reason why the two positions should not have been merged, and, as has been pointed out, there is absolutely no excuse whatever for the pension arrangements in this Bill.  Deputies know how the average farmer, who is supposed to be a very dignified citizen, is treated when he retires at 70 years of age.  He has almost got to go on his knees to a number of officials and, ultimately after having been examined and cross-examined in regard to his means, he is finally awarded a pension of probably 3/- or 4/- a week.  I wonder is that a dignified position for those who constitute the most important section of the community, the people who are feeding the entire population and carrying the entire nation on their shoulders.  If the President, the head of the State, is entitled to a certain amount of dignity in the form of remuneration, surely a member of the most important section of the community, the farmer, should be entitled to a fair pension when he reaches the retiring age: when he reaches the age when he is no longer able to contribute to the maintenance of the State. I would ask, therefore, that this whole matter be reconsidered, and that at least the pension arrangements be deleted.</P>

      <P>I would like to say how deeply I appreciate the manner in which this Bill has been received in all quarters of the House, even by those who have made some criticisms of its provisions, but particularly by Deputy O'Higgins, who, I think, has put this whole question in its true perspective. I should also like to pay a tribute to those members of the committee, representative of all sections of this House, and, I think, of virtually every class in the community, who examined this question over a long period and embodied in it the recommendations to which we are giving effect almost in their entirety.  The office of the Presidency is one, whether for good or for ill, whether we agree with it or not, which has been created by the Constitution, and it is now a formal part of our State.  It is not possible to amalgamate it with any other office, and if the Deputy who has just spoken had devoted as much care and attention to this as a great many other people have had to during the past three or four years, he would have realised that the functions of the Chief Justice <i>per se</i> are quite incompatible with the functions of the President, so that it would not be possible to amalgamate the offices in the way he suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Norton that there is any serious blemish in regard to Section 3.  I think there is something in the point which the Deputy made with regard to Section 5; but we must remember that this is the highest office in the State: that we hope the person who will be called upon to fill it will always be a person worthy of the office, a person who will be worthy of the Irish people, and if the Irish people chose an unworthy person &mdash;such a person as Deputy Norton has tried to envisage: a person who would hold the office for a day or two, have a row with the Government and, in a moment of pique, resign, secure in the knowledge that he would be able to draw a pension of £1,200 a year for life&mdash;then I say that the blame for that would rest, not upon the Oireachtas, not upon the holder of the office, but upon the people themselves who had put an unworthy person into it.  We <Col N="914" /> must proceed, in dealing with a matter of this sort where the highest office in the land is concerned, on the assumption that the Irish people fully realise what qualifications that office requires, and will put into it the worthiest citizen in the land.  And it is upon that basis of good faith and good judgment on the part of the people, and only upon that basis, that a measure of this sort can be conceived and given effect to.</P>

It might happen once.  It certainly would not happen twice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It would certainly be considered by the general body of the people as an abuse of the spirit of the Act.  Let us see what is the occurrence which Deputy Norton fears.  He says it may be possible for a person to be elected to the office of President on one day and, as he put it himself, to resign on the next day and secure a pension of £1,200 a year.  We must assume that a person elected to the office is one who seeks that office and who seeks it not because of the emoluments it carries but because of the honour which it bestows and the opportunity to serve the nation which it gives.  We have to imagine that he is a person worthy of the office.  Is a person who is worthy of the office and qualified for the office by character, capacity and in every other way, likely to resign in a moment of pique because he has, as Deputy Norton says, a row with the Government on a matter of no importance?  If he did feel it his duty to resign, he would be, I suggest, coerced into that view only because the matter upon which he felt his resignation <Col N="915" /> was necessary was one of the highest constitutional importance, one which, bearing in mind his position under the Constitution as guardian of the people's rights, he felt should be put to the final court of appeal&mdash;that is to the people.  In order that this might be done, he might feel bound to relinquish the high office to which the people had called him.</P>
      <P>That is the only circumstance in which a man worthy to be our President would dream of resigning.  If the President felt that, on a question of high constitutional principle, he must resign and, by resigning, allow the people to decide the issue which had been raised, is that the sort of issue on which we should penalise the President and endeavour to deter him from resigning by the knowledge that, if he resigned in these circumstances, he might be left a beggar for life? That is quite conceivable.  Are we to do that or are we to put him in the position in which we do to some extent, though not to the extent herein contemplated, put the members of the Judiciary?  They are put in a position in which they can exercise their functions quite independently of any monetary consideration.  I am perfectly certain that the Irish people would like to see the President, who is, in the final resort, the guardian of our Constitution, put in a position of independence.  The moment you impose a specified period of office as a condition to securing a pension, then, to that extent, you may penalise the President in exercising these constitutional functions by putting him in a position of dependence on the Government of the day.  I think that that is not a sound constitutional principle. The more you study this question, the more you will find it undesirable to impose such a thing as a qualifying period of service for the pension and associate it with the presidential office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They may have, but the committee's recommendations have been searchingly considered and it is <Col N="916" /> because of considerations of the sort I have tried to put before the House that we have felt ourselves coerced, in order to preserve the independence of the President, into discarding this limitation of a qualifying period.  That is in regard to Section 3.</P>
      <P>With regard to Section 5, I think the Deputy put a very wide gloss on anything I said either in regard to Section 3 or Section 5.  I never suggested that the President should become a sort of recluse.  Neither I nor the committee felt that that should be the position.  What we did feel was that, having been called to the office of President, if a person retired from that office after the expiration of the first or second term, he would not be able to live the life of a recluse.  On the contrary, commitments will follow him even into his private life which will prevent him becoming a wholly private personage again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the common experience in other countries, where it has been found that persons who have held office of this sort can and do continue to render very useful public service in a voluntary capacity.  I agree with Deputy Norton&mdash;I am sure it would be the view of every member of the House &mdash;that it would be extremely undesirable that a person who was once President should ever again enter into the hurly-burly of politics.  I am not so sure that there is not something to be said for a Constitutional amendment which might deter an ex-President from becoming a member of the Oireachtas. A Constitutional amendment might be necessary to do that.  I feel that a person who has held the office of President should be discouraged from again entering the political arena.  It is to deprive him of any monetary inducement to embark on politics that we have introduced the provision in Section 5 of the Bill.  I am prepared to agree with the Deputy that, possibly, it is not a sufficient deterrent.  But other considerations arise.  I have said that this matter might require a Con stitutional amendment, but I am not sure.  It would, at any rate, require an amendment to one or other of the Electoral Acts.  If the Deputy desired to give effect to his views in that <Col N="917" /> regard, I am not sure that this is the Bill on which he should do it.  I think it would be much better to go out flatfooted, and say that a person who has once held the Presidential office should never again become a member of the Oireachtas.  There is a great deal to be said for that view.  It is a matter that might be argued, but I am not sure that this is the Bill upon which it should be argued.</P>

      <P>With regard to the speech made by Deputy Cogan, I think the Deputy is wrong.  There is no association of money with dignity in this office.  As the Deputy said, dignity is attached to honest labour, but the functions of this office and all it signifies would confer a special dignity even upon the most illustrious person, because the occupant speaks and stands for the Irish nation.  The fact is that these functions cannot be adequately fulfilled or discharged without the expenditure of a great deal of money. It is not merely that the person called to this office is going to have a very onerous task and, so far as he is personally concerned, a very unenviable existence, because he will have to do many things, at times, which may be inconvenient to him to do from the point of view of his own personal comfort. He will have to go to many places to which, if left to himself, he would prefer not to go.  He will have to undergo a great deal of drudgery even in the discharge of the social side of his office.  The functions attached to that office are such that they cannot be adequately discharged without the expenditure of a great deal of money. It is only to enable the person whom the Irish people have put in that position to fulfil those functions in a <Col N="918" /> manner which benefits the Irish nation that money is needed and that money is being provided under this Bill.  It is not at all a question of creating a new &ldquo;snobocracy&rdquo; or anything of that sort.  At any function which up to this has been associated with the office of the Presidency, there has not been any element of &ldquo;snobocracy&rdquo;.  People in all walks of life have been invited to these functions, and have met the President, and I hope will continue to do so.  It is a great honour to meet the President, because he represents the Irish nation.  They cannot, however, be invited to meet him unless we make some provision out of public moneys to enable these functions to be held.  They are regarded as an essential part of the public life of any well organised State or well organised community.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cogan has talked about the provision made for the maintenance of the President after he has left his office and has asked if that does not indicate that poverty is regarded as a disgrace for an official. I say no.  If the official were impoverished, or compelled by force of certain circumstances to live in a condition of poverty, it might be no disgrace to the official.  It would depend entirely on whether his condition was due to spendthrift extravagance on his part.  It might be a disgrace to him if he had squandered a patrimony which would have enabled him to live in conditions which were not poverty-stricken; but if the person has been lifted up by the consent, either of the whole of the Irish people or the majority of the Irish people, and placed upon a pinnacle as a symbol of the whole people, and if, afterwards, he were to have to live in conditions which would be generally regarded as being impoverished, it would be a disgrace not to the official, but to the Irish people.  It is to avoid blemishing the reputation of this people by <Col N="919" /> such a disgrace that these provisions for a pension have been embodied in this Bill because we want to feel that a person who has once been our President will afterwards continue to live in such comfortable circumstances as will enable him to render, I hope, a great deal of voluntary unpaid service to the State and will enable him to move about among the people in a way which is commonly regarded as fitting for everybody in the State, and even for those who have never held or discharged very responsible official functions. It is in order to enable that to be done that the pension provisions have been incorporated in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether, in view of the statement of Deputy Norton, he reserves to himself the right to move certain amendments on Committee.  I was going to ask that the House might take all stages to-night.  I appreciate that that is not possible now, but I do think that whatever else this Bill does, it certainly does not associate dignity with money.  It merely makes the necessary provision to enable a dignified office to be filled in a fitting manner.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners shall, in the case of a person who is a citizen of any of the following countries that is to say Australia, Canada, Newfoundland, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States of America, who takes up residence in Ireland for such a period as would normally render him liable to income-tax at the full rate on moneys brought into Ireland and being income derived from the country <Col N="921" /> of which he is a citizen, have the following powers:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  To remit the tax chargeable on the first £500 of such moneys, and</P>
    <P>(b)  to remit in part the tax chargeable on the remainder of such moneys up to such sum and at such rate as may be fixed by the Commissioners,</P>
    <P>where the income from which such moneys are derived is subject to taxation in the country of origin and such tax is not recoverable under any inter-governmental or other agreement.</P>
    <P>As I understand that it is desired to complete the Bill to-night, if possible, I will make my observations on the various amendments as short as possible. The object of this amendment is to provide that people who have made their money in the various countries set out in the amendment, and whose money is invested in those countries, and who return to this country for the purpose of taking up a permanent residence here should not be subject to the double income-tax of this country and of the country from which they derive their income.  It is intended merely to encourage people who have made their money abroad to come over and live here, and allow this State to gain such advantage as it can from their permanent residences here by way of collecting taxes from them.  In the case of this country and Great Britain, there is a double income-tax relief agreement, but in the case of other countries, we have no such agreement, and this amendment is to enable relief of a certain type within the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners, if the House is disposed to give a discretion to the Revenue Commissioners in a matter of this kind, for the purpose of gaining some benefit.  We are supposed to encourage tourist traffic here and this amendment is designed to enable people to become permanent residents instead of tourists.</P>

We believe that the law as it is written and as it was intended by the Legislature to be administered, is being so administered at the moment. However, as I have already stated, doubts have been created elsewhere, and all we are endeavouring to do here is to confirm the practice which has been carried on for 50 years in operating the provisions related to this section.  The position is that during that period of 50 years the law has been so interpreted and acted upon, not merely by the Revenue but by our bankers and coupon dealers acting as agents for the Revenue, taxpayers and their advisers acting as reasonable citizens.  If the particular words which the Deputy proposes to delete were in fact deleted, then a certain amount of confusion might arise, and bankers and others who acted for the Revenue all those years might be faced with claims for sums which it might be contended were deducted illegally.  Even though these claims were not sustainable in law, great difficulties would arise and a position of the utmost insecurity would be created.  It is submitted here that whatever views may be held on retrospective legislation, there is no doubt that the law is as everyone has assumed it to be over a <Col N="924" /> long period of 50 years.  Things have been settled on the basis that the law was such and such during those years and transactions have been settled on the basis that the law was as it was assumed to be.  That is the reason why we have these words in the section.</P>

      <P>I am not particularly interested in bankers, nor do I speak for them.  I have no touch with bankers except by way of overdraft. But I have been informed that this special Section 8 will impose a very large additional amount of labour on bankers.  I do not know whether that is so or not, but I have been told by persons in touch with bankers that if this section is pushed retrospectively, bankers will have to go back a long number of years in their books, and will be given a great deal of trouble.  I draw the attention of the Minister to that because I have been told that it is so.  I have no means of verifying whether it is or not.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 8 and in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Where by or under any statutory <Col N="925" /> or other provision in relation to income tax, surtax, excess profits duty or corporation profits tax a period is fixed for the doing of any act or thing the court may, either before or after the expiration of the said period, extend such period upon such terms as the court thinks proper.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section the expression &ldquo;the court&rdquo; means the Special Commissioners for Income Tax or, on appeal, the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>This is a matter in which I am very much interested and to which I would press the Minister to give very serious consideration.  There are a number of statutory provisions scattered through the income-tax code making provision for certain acts to be done within a certain period.  The period must be strictly complied with irrespective of whether hardships ensue from it, or irrespective of whether the Revenue would be prepared to accept an extension of the time or not.  The general experience has been that there are cases where a statutory provision should not be so strictly or rigidly enforced.  Accordingly, in most statutes it will be found that there is power in some tribunal to extend the time laid down by statute.  There is no power in any body, either in the commissioners, the High Court or the Circuit Court, to extend the time laid down in this case.  If relief is sought by the taxpayer in connection with taxation or by reason of the fact that he puts in a farm account that shows a loss, then he must make that claim within a period of one year from the period of assessment.  There is no power in any tribunal to extend that time.  I think it ought to be possible for the Revenue Commissioners or the circuit judge to extend the time on a claim being made.  There was actually a case where the circuit judge did assume that he had power to extend the time as all courts, by the Rules of Court, have power to extend the time.  But the circuit judge was quashed on <i>certiorari.</i>  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this section with a view to giving power to some tribunal to extend the time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of specific cases that came within my own practice.  In one case that point was raised rather acutely.  Even the Minister himself could do nothing about it, however sympathetic he might have been, because the law says that the claim must be made within 12 months from the period of assessment.  That period elapsed and no one can do anything about it because the time cannot be extended and no relief can be given.</P>
      <P>What I am asking the Minister to do is to provide power in the Special Commissioners or the circuit judge, or some judicial authority, where there is a proper case, to extend the time.  As a matter of fact, I modelled this amendment on the section of the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931, where there are various statutory provisions requiring certain things to be done within three months, six months, and so forth, and the operation of that statute has shown the necessity for having such a provision as I propose here.  In actual practice, in courts dealing with the statute of 1931, to which I have referred, the judges have been very rigid in their application of their own powers to extend the time, and all I am anxious to ensure is that there should be some power, in a proper case, and for the purpose of avoiding admitted hardship, in some judicial tribunal to be able to decide, as between the Revenue Commissioners and the taxpayer to extend the time.  I do not think it would work any hardship on the Revenue Commissioners and it would certainly prevent a hardship that ought not to be imposed on taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps, Sir, I might be permitted to add, very briefly, one or two remarks that I might have made on another section of the Bill.  I admit that they are not strictly relevant, but I think it will save time if I introduce the matter here.  In this connection, in dealing properly and adequately with taxpayers, I do think that the policy of the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="927" /> and of the Minister for Finance ought to be somewhat changed: that the taxpayer ought not to be regarded, so to speak, as the prey of the Revenue Commissioners, and that a time has now come when the policy ought to be changed, the past shut down, and an effort made to inculcate in the minds of taxpayers that it is their duty as citizens to make honest and proper returns of their income-tax. I feel myself, personally, that that would be a proper state of mind to induce in taxpayers&mdash;that we should endeavour to inculcate in the minds of taxpayers that it would be for the benefit of people who do make proper returns of income-tax that everybody should make proper and honest returns.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the Revenue Commissioners or their staff in any way.  They are only carrying out the law, and it is their business to bring in revenue, but I am suggesting that, perhaps, they may have been rather harsh in some cases on people who, let us say, over-stepped the mark and made, perhaps, not as honest and proper a return of their income-tax as they should have made.  I think that that particular bag has been squeezed dry and there is not much left in it; and I think that, from now on, except in cases of actual fraud, that kind of thing should be regarded as a closed book: that the taxpayer should be asked to make proper returns from now on and that that spirit should be inculcated in taxpayers.  I think that, if the idea abroad generally amongst taxpayers to the effect that they are the prey of the Revenue Commissioners, that they are squeezed dry, their businesses turned inside out, their past raked up, and the past of their fathers and their great-grandfathers raked up, is got rid of, we might have a better spirit amongst taxpayers and, ultimately, a better revenue.  As I say, Sir, these remarks are somewhat irrelevant to this section, but I thought it would save time if I introduced the matter now.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to consider it.  Of course, I am not accepting the point of view that the taxpayers are the prey of the Revenue Commissioners, and if I were speaking on the Estimate, I would endeavour to controvert that suggestion very vigorously; but on the question of the amendment to which the Deputy desires me to give consideration, I am prepared to consider the question of whether we could not, in regard to time limits, have some kind of appeal either to the Revenue Commissioners or some other court.  However, the matter will require to be very carefully examined, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the question is a very wide one.  When I asked the Deputy if he had any specific cases in mind, what I meant was whether he had any specific type of case in mind where this would be desirable.</P>
      <P>If he could let me have some specific cases, it would make it easier, as it would be better to consider a limited number of cases rather than go over the whole wide field.  If I got such specific cases in time, I would endeavour to introduce an amendment which might give effect to what the Deputy has in mind.  Otherwise, the matter would have to stand over, at any rate, until the next year.  I could not accept his amendment at this stage and undertake to give effect to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is a matter on which I feel very deeply.  I think it will not affect the revenue to a serious extent, and it may avert hardship: The actual case I have in mind is where a person is engaged in a business&mdash;let us say, a farm&mdash;and that he has made a loss.  For the purpose of making a claim for relief in respect of that loss, he must make a claim&mdash; speaking from memory&mdash;within a year of assessment.  That is a matter of statutory provision.  By reason of circumstances over which he has no control, such as negotiations going on in connection with his business, and so on, he forgets to put in the claim within the period of 12 months, or whatever it is.  Well, then, I hold that it is a hardship, in a proper case, that by reason of the fact that the time limit is allowed to go by, he should now find that statutory provision facing him and that nobody can do anything about it. That is one case I have in mind.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (4), page 14, line 27, to delete the words &ldquo;or having been&rdquo; and in line 28 to delete the words &ldquo;or having had&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to say one or two words on this amendment, because it is slightly different, or at least there are some additional considerations arising on it besides those arising on the general principle of retrospective legislation.  The position that is provided for in sub-section (4) of this section may possibly work very great hardship on the person who occupies the position of personal representative of a deceased person because, if the words &ldquo;having been&rdquo; or &ldquo;having had&rdquo; are allowed to remain, the personal representative of a deceased person may find that, years after the estate has been distributed and when he has no assets, he may be called upon to give the information or the particulars, mentioned in the sub-section, to the Revenue Commissioners, without being in a position to give such information or particulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not merely will he have difficulty in furnishing the particulars required, after the lapse of years, but he will have no money, except what money comes out of his own pocket, to pay any expenses that he will be put to in eliciting the information or particulars required.  The personal representative of a deceased person is in a gratuitous office, and very often he is not paid for what is usually an onerous task; the only way that he has to recoup himself for any losses he may sustain is out of the assets of the deceased person.  If the section remains as it stands, it would mean that when all the assets are distributed he <Col N="931" /> may be called upon to give these particulars and that may put him to the expense of hiring an accountant or other people, and there will be no assets left out of which to recoup him for his expenses.  I should like to know if the Minister has considered that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point which I should like to make in regard to Section 15.  It really arises on number 7 of the Schedule relating to golf clubs.  I did make certain representations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in reference to golf clubs.  Under number 7 of the Schedule referred to in Section 15, a very prohibitive tariff is placed on the importation of golf clubs, whether imported in whole or in part, shafts or heads of golf clubs.  The position as I understand it at the moment is that there is only one particular company in this country which is actually manufacturing golf clubs.  I am not interested in anybody except one set of persons in connection with the matter I am raising now.  The persons in whom I am interested are golf professionals and their assistants; I am not interested in anybody else except those.  I did make representations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce asking that there should be granted to those professionals and their assistants in the clubs throughout the country licences to import certain heads, shafts and things of that kind, in order to enable them to carry out their business in their shops attached to the various golf clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt about it that if <Col N="932" /> those duties are insisted upon as against the professionals, it will throw a lot of assistants throughout the country out of employment.  At the time I made the representations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce he appeared to be sympathetic with the point of view which I put before him on behalf of those professionals and their assistants.  I do not know whether or not the Minister for Finance himself endeavours to play golf, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce did appreciate the proposition I put to him, and that was that golfers are apt to blame their caddies, the ball, the lie, the club, and everything else except their own incompetence if they are playing badly.  The first thing they do is to rush off to the professional and ask him for a new golf club and a different one from the one with which they had been ploughing their lonely furrow for some time before.  That is a source of remuneration to the professionals and a source of employment to their assistants.  The prohibitive tariff proposed in this schedule&mdash;if persisted in, and if some relaxation is not granted in favour of professionals and their assistants&mdash;will undoubtedly prevent those professionals and their assistants from satisfying the desires of golfers to cure their incompetence at any price.  While the Minister for Industry and Commerce appeared to me to be sympathetic towards the proposal which I put up to him, I do not know whether anything has been done about it.  Perhaps the Minister might have regard to the considerations which I put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Several matters arise on Section 16.  First of all there is the question of the steel erectors in this country, who are caught between the appear and nether millstone, having to pay the increased price for their raw materials under this section, and being up against the price at which fabricated steel can be sent in from the other side.  I do not know whether the Minister has given any consideration to that point.  I scarcely think that at this late hour the matter can be gone into very fully, but I should like again to call the Minister's attention to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to two other points which arise on this section.  The steel that is brought into this country is of very varied kinds.  Probably the entire range of samples that are used in England are used over here, but in very small quantities.  It is absolutely impossible for the industry here to hope to supply the varied samples required. I think on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce I called attention to the various steps that a person had to take in getting permission to import articles which were not even manufactured in this country.  That will arise to a very great degree under this section.  There is also another question which will arise under this section, and it is in relation to the same class of thing, namely, that there are all sorts, kinds and descriptions of steel which people require in small quantities.  Those are special sizes and special shapes.  Take, for instance, guillotine knives.  Those probably have to be slotted to a particular pattern, and saws would have to be gulletted to various shapes.  If the people cannot get the component parts which they want for the various machines, it practically renders the machinery obsolete.  There is a great deal of delay and hardship occasioned to people in this country who have to import special kinds of articles which would come under this section.  I should like to ask the Minister if there is any hope of relaxation in regard to the present difficulty about a letter from the manufacturer to the effect that he does not manufacture the goods.  Some of the manufacturers <Col N="934" /> have a most unpleasant habit of replying not exactly that they do not manufacture the goods but that they have something which is equally suited.</P>
    <P>Persons who wish to import goods know that they are absolutely unsuitable, and, as they are not experts in every line in the department, they find difficulty in deciding between the rival claims.  The consequence is that quantities of goods are imported on which very high duties have to be paid, and that is, really, only adding to the burden that the people of this country are carrying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any such law.  All I have to say is that steel fabricators have, at the moment, protection sufficient to enable them to get the bulk of the market here, and it is only in the face of a higher price being charged at Haulbowline than for British steel that that degree of protection will be impinged upon.  If that should happen, and if it is clear that steel fabricators are not sufficiently protected, the position will have to be considered.  Certainly, I do not propose to take action upon an assumption which may be entirely incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputy read the reference to guillotine knives wrongly. <Col N="935" /> They are referred to in sub-section (3) for the purpose of excluding them from the duty on products from Great Britain and the Dominion of Canada. That provision is inserted in consequence of the Trade Agreement with the United Kingdom.  Machinery parts, as such, are not liable to duty at all.  The firm that erected the steel mill at Haulbowline intends ultimately to manufacture all classes of steel that might be liable to duty.  There may be an <i>interim</i> period during which full supplies will not be available, but licences to import these goods will be issued.  The firm's programme contemplates the manufacture of the full requirements of the country in these goods.</P>
    <P>A point was raised concerning the duty upon golf clubs, and the position of golf professionals under the new duty.  The firm which is manufacturing golf clubs here has undertaken to supply professional golfers with heads and shafts for assembling, which has been the practice up to the present, and, I think, that will leave the position of professional golfers unaffected by this duty.  There were certain proposals in reference to this duty on golf clubs against which the professional golfers made representations and, as I thought there was force in their representations, the duty as it now operates will not affect their position at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Minister is quite right in what he said about guillotine knives.  As to iron and steel, he said that he does not propose to take action on a matter based on assumption.  The real test is this: If and when this duty is enforced it can be shown that the price of goods in this country is considerably higher than the price at which they could be bought outside, will the Minister issue a licence?  That is the acid test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is referring to steel fabric, I say that we will take such measures as are necessary to ensure effective protection, because, obviously, it would be unwise to start a steel mill for the home manufacture of steel girders, if the tariff arrangement <Col N="936" /> would permit fabric steel to be imported.  These steel fabricating firms will be in no worse position than they are now, unless there is an increase in price.  An increase in price must not be assumed.  There may be certain charges which will be higher here than in Great Britain but, subject to that, there is no reason why, in a properly equipped steel mill in this country, they could not produce steel as cheaply and as well as in Great Britain.</P>

I should like to know from the Minister what the position of users of steel will be, if they find that the price charged here is con siderably higher than the price outside. I am referring to raw material not fabricated steel.  That is the acid test.</P>

      <P>I do not get the point in the Deputy's question.  We are imposing this duty on steel, and we will take whatever measures are necessary to hold the price of the product.  I do not think the price will be higher here than in Great Britain.  If it is higher it will be very slight.</P>

      <P>The point I am concerned about is this, that I say the price in this country will go to the world price, plus the duty.  The Minister denies that.  He says he is not going to deal with something that has not arisen.  I put it to him that if the price of steel manufactured here for angles, girders, joists and other things is such that it can be bought outside for 25 per cent. less, what will be the position?  What action will the Minister then take?</P>

      <P>I was referring to the price at which Irish steel is sold compared with British steel.  It is possible to buy steel cheaply in small lots of occasional lines, but that is a different matter.  If the price should be raised here, and if it is what I consider unjustifiable, then the duty will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>There was a certain aspect of this question before the Minister for Finance, and it was left over in the hope that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would face it. The Minister seems to have stuck his feet in the ground: I should like, however, to put one or two points before him.  He will admit that the success of the Haulbowline mills depends on there being Irish firms fabricating steel, taking that steel and using it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no future for the Haulbowline mills if there are not firms fabricating steel here.  Firms that extended their works during the last couple of years, that put in additional capital, and gave employment to additional workers had the advantage of a 50 per cent. tariff against non-British steel fabrics, and against British manufacturers had a 60 per cent. tariff, because the preference of 33? per cent. that normally would be available for British steel fabrics was wiped out, and to the 50 per cent. that then stood against them was added an additional 10 per cent. tariff.  The industry then extended here, additional capital was invested and additional employees taken on, under the effective tariff against foreign manufactures and the 60 per cent. against British steel.  With the signing of the Agreement the 60 per cent. tariff against British steel was reduced to 33?, and the cost of raw material is definitely going to be increased by at least 25 per cent. Irish steel fabricators have been importing 50 per cent. of their steel from Great Britain and 50 per cent. from Belgium. They imported it from Belgium at an average of £3 per ton cheaper than from Great Britain.  As well as the tariff of 50 per cent. falling to 33? per cent., as far as imports of British steel are concerned, now the cost of raw material will be affected.  I am not asking for an increased tariff, but I am asking what kind of policy is supposed to operate that would induce people under such an extraordinary tariff arrangement to develop their business, or to induce firms to take men into employment, that they felt was going <Col N="938" /> to be fairly permanent, if there is going to be such a radical change in the whole position?</P>
      <P>Nothing could be more ridiculous, I think, than, we might say, halving the protective tariff under which they are working, and increasing the cost of their raw materials, the raw material being about one-third of the total value of the fabricated article.  The one thing I am concerned with, and that I am asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tell us is what does he expect is going to be the result of this change on employment in the City of Dublin where there are, I suppose, five or six factories employing a fairly large number of men.  The Minister knows that one of the things that shut down the Dublin dockyard was that it was not able to compete even with the 60 per cent. tariff against work that was coming from outside.</P>

      <P>There is nothing I am telling the Minister that he does not know.  I say it is an astonishing thing that he can walk into Parliament practically with his mouth shut, and, as it were, take up an attitude that these things are going to stand.  He is not going to discuss the pros or cons of them here.  He is simply going to declare that fabricated steel is going to be made in this country at the same price it is made outside.  The Minister knows very well it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he has any information as to the position with regard to the steel industry either in Belgium or Great Britain he must know that there is not any possibility, in its early stages particularly, of the Haulbowline mill competing with Great Britain and <Col N="939" /> Belgium without raising, as Deputy Dockrell said, the price of steel substantially.  He has had evidence himself in estimates that have come from outside firms for doing certain works in connection with the new building for the Department of Industry and Commerce that indicates what the position is.  He has, no doubt, seen estimates that have come in for steel work in connection with some of the new airports and, as I say, there is no information that we can give him that he has not got already, and yet his attitude is that he is not going to say anything about it, that the Haulbowline mills are going to flourish and be all right, that they are not going to charge more than is charged by outside firms, and, as to the possible effect on unemployment in the steel fabricating firms in the City of Dublin or Cork or Waterford or elsewhere, he has nothing at all to say about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say this.  When the Deputy refers to existing contracts such as the contract for the new Department of Industry and Commerce building or the airports, he is obviously trying to make the case that the existing tariff is insufficient.  I am not convinced that it is.  I think that unless unfair methods of trade are being resorted to by firms the 50 per cent. against Continental firms and 30 per cent. against Great Britain should be sufficient.  If that assumption is correct, then the existing position will not in any way be detrimental to those firms engaged in the fabrication of steel.  If I am convinced to the contrary&mdash;I have not been convinced yet that a higher duty is necessary, assuming efficiency in operation by the existing firms here &mdash;then I would be prepared to consider an increase in the duty, but I am not yet convinced that an increased duty is necessary.  The position, therefore, of these firms is quite safe until this steel is being manufactured at Haulbowline and will only be adversely affected if the steel manufactured at Haulbowline is dearer than the steel they are buying at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> I want to say here, for the information of the Deputy and for the information of those associated with the Haulbowline mills and everybody else, that there is no reason that I know of why steel manufactured here should be dearer than steel manufactured in Great Britain.  I would expect after a while, when they get their plant properly organised and their machinery properly run in that their prices should be lower than the prevailing prices in Dublin at the moment.  If I am convinced that there are circumstances not within the control of the people directing that industry which prevent these prices being secured then the position of the fabricating firms will have to be reconsidered but I am not going to take action now which would assume an acceptance by me that prices at Haulbowline will necessarily be dearer than prices in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;which,&rdquo; line 40, to the end of the section, and substitute the words &ldquo;appears on a <i>bona-fide</i> invoice together with the cost of freight and insurance for such article or goods delivered at the place of importation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> I put down this amendment because I thought it was a vicious practice to leave it to the discretion of anybody to fix the price an importer would give for any article.  I think it is vicious. Take a case of misapprehension, to put it mildly.  One person may import an article the price of which has not been fixed before importation by the concern from which he imports it. Another person may import an article of similar quality for which the price has been fixed before importation and he is charged a different price from that fixed by the Revenue Commissioners for the first article.  I consider the whole practice vicious.  I understand that goods are sent into this country to factors and brokers for the purposes of sale and that the price is not fixed before importation in many cases.  When such goods are consigned to factors or brokers, I think it should not be left to the Revenue Commissioners to fix the price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think on the Second Stage of the Bill I called the attention of the Deputy to Section 34 of the Finance Act of 1933.  The object of Section 25 of the present Bill is to amend that section so that the values, as defined by the Revenue Commissioners, may be made applicable to purposes other than the charging of duty.  I think that since the Legislature has already agreed that the Revenue Commissioners should have power to fix the value for the purpose of levying or charging a duty upon an article, which of course might be rather onerous on the subject, there should be no objection to their being entitled to fix the value for the purpose of relieving an article from duty.  That is really the purpose of the present section.  So far as people who import goods, and who present <i>bona fide</i> invoices, are concerned, they have got nothing to fear.  To provide against fraud it was necessary in Section 34 of the 1933 Act to give the Revenue Commissioners power to fix the value of goods for the purpose of charging duty.  It is thought necessary to amend that in order that they may be empowered to fix the value for purposes other than that of charging duty.</P>

      <P>This Bill, together with the Appropriation Bill, already passed, may be said, in essence, to be the Budget of this year.  In my view, last year's Budget was not balanced, and neither has the Minister's Estimate for this year been on the basis of a balanced Budget.  We have the unusual spectacle of having for two successive years unbalanced Budgets.  During the last few months of this year, we have had, month after month, records of the <Col N="946" /> largest adverse balance in trade this country has known.  The road of unbalanced Budgets and big adverse balances, which we are travelling, leads only in one direction.  If that be the policy of the Government, the question of whether or not we remain on sterling will not arise.  That policy leads, and has led in every other country, to the one and only resort of countries with adverse balances beyond their means and unbalanced Budgets. That is inflation.  The remedy, of course, is a Budget balanced not merely on figures, but balanced on the capacity of the people to bear the taxation that is imposed.  In my view, the taxation that is imposed in this Budget and for some years past is beyond the capacity of the people to bear.  The Budget must be balanced both on figures and on the capacity of the people to bear taxation. The remedy in the other case is to aim at increasing our production.  Notwithstanding all the efforts that have been made in connection with industrial development, about which we hear so much and of which we see so little result, the situation was never worse. If the policy is towards self-sufficiency, we were never less self-sufficient.</P>
      <P>We have had to pour out more money in this country since the Government came into office than we ever did before and the result must be, and has been, a reduction, in our reserves and in our resources.  The source from which an improvement could be effected has been badly damaged during the last five or six years and the better trade relations that are now going to subsist are, apparently, to be left to themselves to effect that improvement. There has been no indication whatever on the part of the Government since the Agreement with Great Britain was made of any attempt to improve our agricultural production or to lessen the costs that are so regularly and systematically imposed upon agriculture.  There has been no effort to improve either our agricultural production or our sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the last week, I understand that the Prime Minister made a reference to the point to which the Government was urged to go in connection <Col N="947" /> with the collection of moneys for the Exchequer.  He used the words &ldquo;to the point of being unjust.&rdquo;  I should like to know if any other Catholic Minister in the world would make a statement like that&mdash;&ldquo;to the point of being unjust.&rdquo;  Justice should be the headline and the guiding spirit of administration.  Unfortunately, I think Ministers know very little about it.  It would be well for themselves and for the country if they knew a little more about it.  I should like to know whether, during the adjournment that is to take place, there is to be any advertence to the dangers likely to arise from (1) unbalanced Budgets, (2) a very big adverse balance and (3) the absence of any policy to improve the output or the sale of our agricultural produce.</P>

I think that the people, who study these matters just as carefully as Deputy Cosgrave, have expressed their judgment in a practical way in that regard and I do not think it is necessary for me to answer the questions which the Deputy has put.  Justice has always been the guiding spirit of this Government's administration&mdash;justice and consideration for the common people and, above all, for those who have to bear the cost of the upkeep of our services.  I can promise the Deputy that, not merely during the adjournment, but during the remainder of our term of office that will continue to be the lodestar of our administration.</P>

      <P>The first Bill on this subject was passed in 1928 and dealt with the compensation payable for animals slaughtered at British landing places as a result of foot and mouth disease. Another Act was passed in 1932 to extend the provisions covering compensation in respect of detention, lairage and feeding charges due to foot and mouth disease in Great Britain.  This Bill goes further and deals with the depreciation of live stock detained owing to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.  I presume Deputies are aware that the fund is made up of a levy, collected by the Cattle Traders' Association, on exported animals.  It is managed by trustees appointed by the cattle trade. When this Bill is passed it is proposed that it should be retrospective to October, 1936.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I put a question to the Minister when this Bill was previously before us as to whether it would not be advisable to continue to collect this money.  £40,000 is a very small sum.  It really amounts to £2,000 or £3,000 a year.  A visitation of this disease would, if it came to us &mdash;and it is very close to us&mdash;be very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill passed its Second Reading in the last Dáil and I stated then that the cattle trade believed that £40,000 was quite sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming you have no visitation, it is, but we have had such visitations a couple of times. It is very close to us at present and they are very concerned in England as to the reason for the periodic outbreaks there.  They are attributed sometimes to birds and at other times to travellers.  The collection of the <Col N="950" /> sum of money in hands at present did not impose any great liability on anybody. To my mind, it is a great mistake not to build the fund up to about £250,000.  That would put us in an absolutely unassailable position.  If we found that it was not necessary to employ the fund in that way, there are many other ways by which it could be used with the consent and approval of the cattle trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right in saying that the levy imposes no great burden on those concerned.  It is only 2½d. on each head of cattle, ½d. on each sheep and 1d. on each pig. This Bill has nothing to do with that matter.  I am prepared to discuss that question with the cattle trade.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take Committee Stage now.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee and reported without amendment.</P>
      <P>Bill received for final consideration and passed.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until Wednesday, 20th July, at 3 p.m.</P>
