      <P>When they were speaking on this Estimate yesterday, it was rather amusing and contradictory to hear Fianna Fáil Deputies disown that any attempt was made to bring political pressure to bear on Land Commission officials.  I did not make the allegation that it was being done, but the allegation was made.  While Deputies here may deny that political <Col N="1786" /> pressure is being brought to bear on Land Commission officials, Fianna Fáil clubs down the country try to impress everybody that no land can be got unless through them.  That is the fact.  Wherever an estate is divided, the Fianna Fáil people will take credit for its division when all the work is over.  Let there be some consistency amongst the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I would like to hear Fianna Fáil Deputies assure us to the contrary, and, if there is not pressure of any kind being brought to bear on Land Commission officials, then they ought to get under control the secretaries and chairmen of Fianna Fáil clubs and not have them going around the country seeking members for their clubs by telling the people that no one can get any land unless through them.</P>

      <P>Absolutely.  We had Deputy Corry and Deputy Maguire dealing with the collection of annuities, and they were trying to throw the blame on us here for the fact that there is a sum of £1,250,000 outstanding. That is merely eyewash, and everybody knows it is.  Nevertheless, we will have the back-benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party here standing up to make that statement.  It has always been done, and it ought not to be done.  The first person who recommended the nonpayment of annuities was the present Minister for Justice, back in 1922, and there is no use in saying that we started it.  Any person who has any knowledge of agriculture, and who recollects what <Col N="1787" /> happened here during the last six years, knows how agricultural prices have become depressed and how agricultural production has gone down in value.  Anyone who studies the position must know that the farmers are finding it hard to meet their liabilities.  There is a genuine case to be made for the people who cannot meet their obligations with regard to annuities and rates.</P>
      <P>The present Government collected annuities up to the passing of the Act of 1936 without any legal or moral right to do so.  They had to put themselves right by getting legislation through this House&mdash;the Act of 1936&mdash;when moneys were being withheld from local councils without any authority to do it.  At the back of the whole thing was a grave injustice.  I preached that in this House and I tried to inform the Government that there must be an injustice somewhere, and that they ought to tackle it and put it right.  We had Deputy Kelly from Meath telling us that the present system of land division is in accordance with the Government's tillage policy.  What is the Government's tillage policy?  What has been the increase in tillage for the last six years?  Have we yet got anywhere near what was laid down by the late Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Hogan&mdash; one more cow, one more sow, and one more acre under the plough?  When will we, at the present rate of progress, get near it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>While Fianna Fáil allow themselves to be educated by such stuff as appears in their organ, in which it was stated quite recently that a schoolboy with the most elementary knowledge of agriculture knew that tillage would improve land, not much progress can be made.  That is about the worst agricultural heresy that anybody could utter.  If you want to kill land you will kill it with indiscriminate tillage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one thing I would like the Land Commission to do, and that is, in selecting applicants for land, in choosing incoming tenants, irrespective of what preference might otherwise be given them, they should give preference to people who are prepared to farm the land in a proper way.  There ought to be some eye to the future when applicants are being selected.  The House expressed the opinion yesterday that men of the old I.R.A. ought to get the preference.  That is quite right to an extent, but we ought to remember, and the Land Commission ought to remember, that the primary purpose of land division is to provide a potential living in the future for somebody, and while we all favour giving the men of the old I.R.A. their proper due, I do not want to go over the margin by saying that a man in receipt of a pension of, say, £80 a year ought to get the preference as against a man who has nothing.  Last night I pointed out where the Land Commission might say to a man who has a pension: &ldquo;You cannot get land because you have a pension.&rdquo;  On the other hand, they might inform a prospective pensioner: &ldquo;You are going to get a preference.&rdquo; Those things are inconsistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> There is another matter that I rather expected would be raised by the Labour Party.  I do not know whether they have any instance of it, but I had one brought to my notice last year.  I refer to people working for the Land Commission in my neighbourhood.  They were being paid the full day for Saturday, although they worked only half the day.  That was provided they worked five days a week.  If they worked less they did not get paid for Saturday.  What it meant was that if the unfortunate men, through broken weather, were not able to work more than three days, they were not given the full day for Saturday.  I do not think that was fair.  I have in mind married men with families, and they are living in a poor way.  They were quite agreeable to work all day on Saturday if they were paid for it, but they were knocked off the half-day and got paid only for that half-day, the reason given being that the weather was so bad that they could not earn a full week's wages.  I think that is not fair, and if that practice still exists I should like the Minister to take steps to effect a remedy.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to point out, as he said he would, the reason for the very large increase which we observe in the staff.  As I pointed out last night, it does not appear to me to be consistent.  There is, as the Minister indicated, a dwindling amount of land to be divided. There ought to be a dwindling number of estates.  In such circumstances, why should there be an increase in the inspectorial staff, the staff generally, and in the expenditure of the Department?  We ought to realise that, sooner or later, we will come to an end of land division; or will we bring it to the point of dividing the 20-acre holding into two holdings of ten acres?  We ought to visualise an end somewhere to land division, and, in the circumstances, it is an awful mistake to be adding to the Department, especially when we are approaching, as the Minister says, a period when the amount of land to be divided is dwindling.  I do not think that there has been much vision brought to bear on the whole position. <Col N="1790" /> I hope that some people in the Department will take this matter into serious consideration&mdash;this whole question of land division.  It must be done by somebody, and the sooner it is done the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the debate up to the present has indicated one thing, and that is that there is a deep interest being taken in land division by Deputies on all sides of the House. Most of the speeches contributed something that should give rise to thought and that will, perhaps, tend to remedy any grievances that may exist.  I do not think it would be possible for any Act of Parliament or any Government to divide such an important thing as land without having grievances in many directions.  The county from which I come is one in which, in the last couple of years, possibly the greatest amount of land was divided.  Looking at it generally, I must say that it has been divided with satisfaction.  There has not been any great degree of discontent.  A very large number of houses has been built in the county.  The Land Commission has practically entered into competition with the Local Government Department in the building of houses so far as County Meath is concerned. It certainly has changed the whole appearance of the county and given it a different outlook.  The people in general seem to have settled down and are making an effort to work their land as best they can.  We have, of course, some difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some serious questions arise over migration.  I propose to criticise the migratory schemes, not with the object of preventing migration, but with the object of improving it, provided that the experiment shows that it is going to give good results.  It would strike one who thinks over these things that the migratory scheme for County Meath got very little thought.  The people were simply dropped into certain areas in which land could be procured with facility, without taking into consideration what were the circumstances that existed there.  Any people who take an interest in these schemes should take into consideration the conditions in the areas in which <Col N="1791" /> they have been placed and they will find that invariably they are placed where there is a reasonable number of people.  In fact, they were placed where most of the people in County Meath reside, that is, in the most thickly populated areas.  In the first place, that was an error of judgment, because it brings about many difficulties in the matter of employment. It is obvious that in the thickly populated areas of Meath there are many people looking for employment, whereas, in other districts of the county it is sometimes impossible to get a man to work, and we are carrying on a process of drawing coals to Newcastle.  I think that is one of the biggest difficulties that arose in connection with these migratory schemes.  Athboy is a reasonably thickly populated area, and we have two colonies there.  The first colony that came there is one in which there were at least 12 or 13 persons in each family, and that seems to indicate that there was not a lot of thought given to the economic situation.  I take it they were placed there because the land was easy to acquire and the block was rather large, and it was a question of the Land Commission facilitating themselves instead of making an effort to have a more equal distribution of population, with the result that there we have a certain clash in the matter of employment.  It is quite true that quite a number of these people emigrate.  Possibly they would do that anyway, but I am putting these points forward in order that everybody will take an interest in this question of the distribution of land, and will not try to get away with the idea that, in County Meath, we are selfish and hostile people.  All we ask is reasonable and fair treatment.</P>
    <P>There is the other difficulty that the farms in Rathcarne, and possibly in Gibbstown, are entirely too small. Twenty statute acres with the ditches, the roads and the house taken out, make a very small farm of land in County Meath, where there is practically no alternative to farming.  People may ask how they lived in the West on holdings the valuation of which <Col N="1792" /> was only £5, but, in those cases, there are alternatives, and anybody who looks at a Board of Works map will see what is taking place there as an alternative.  There are fisheries and different other employments in those congested areas, but when these people come to a farm in County Meath they have to live on them.  The poor law valuation of such a farm would be about £20 with the rates, possibly about 8/- an acre, and rent 10/-.  These people find it rather difficult to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty arose there which may not have too happy results. Deputy Brennan has referred to it and I am not going to be ruled out of order by directly referring to the amount of land tilled, but as it was carried out by the Land Commission it is necessary to refer to it.  The Land Commission generally tilled for these migrants in these small farms some three or four acres, and the results of that were reasonably successful, but these men are now faced with laying down these acres and with carrying out the usual rotation and the question of manure immediately arises.  If people have the impression that land in Meath, or in any other county for that matter can be profitably utilised and its fertility and value kept up by incessant tillage without manure, the result is going to be that the land will eventually become as poor as the land they left, so that rushing in and ploughing up a lot of land for these people, without any reference to the question of manure the following year, is going to give rise to some very serious difficulties.  However, the houses are nicely built with a small, neat shed alongside.  That shed is pretty to look at, but is practically no use whatever.  They got 30/- a week for a year and the intention was that they should put up whatever other sheds were necessary.  That is not being done because the 30/- was probably necessary for the support of the families, and the result is that these little farms still look extremely naked.  The little shed that was erected can serve no useful purpose. It is certainly very decorative and neat, but it is not a useful or practical building. <Col N="1793" /> So far as the people of Meath are concerned, they have no objection to migration as long as it is carried out on reasonable and sensible lines, but my contention is that it has not been carried out on reasonable and sensible lines, because the people were put in districts in which there were other people to occupy the land.  We have a situation in Rathcarne in which there is a bog&mdash;and these schemes were always carried out in close proximity to a bog&mdash;and in Meath, where there is a bog, there are people.  The Freyne situation has not yet been dealt with. Weak efforts are made to deal with it, and there are a number of uneconomic holders in that bog.  I suppose there must be something like sixteen people living there on an average of three acres of land.  I think everybody will admit that it is not very reasonable to have a colony just on the other side while the natives of the county&mdash; possibly people who were once evicted from those lands&mdash;are still living on the bog.  Very little effort was made to take them out of this bog and to provide land in its proximity.  The main point is that a bog in County Meath is just as useful as, and possibly more useful than in any other county. The migrants are being very deliberately placed in close proximity to these bogs which the people of the district need, and beside which most of them live.  They went there through pressure of the old landlords, or because the bog was there.  It is very doubtful which drove them there.  They may have been compelled to go, but they may also have gone because the turf which is, of course, a very useful commodity was available there.</P>
    <P>So far as the holdings are concerned, the present Minister very wisely increased the area to 25 acres.  I still contend, as do most other Deputies, that the holding should be at least 30 acres, in order to get them to farm it in the proper way.  Complaints are made that houses are not occupied in the County Meath by those who got the land, and that the land is not profitably used, but it takes a little time to get those holdings in order.  The people of Meath are fairly practical, and they know their business.  They are not <Col N="1794" /> going to rush in and plough up four acres of land, and then wait until next year to find out where they are going to get manure.  They look to the next year first, and they say to themselves: &ldquo;We cannot do this sort of thing; we made this land good and we intend to keep it good, we are not going to do anything to deteriorate it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These people practise a reasonable economy.  There has been a good deal of talk about the people who got these new holdings, and the suggestion has been made about their not working them.  But I say if there is any question of examining these people who are not supposed to be working their holdings properly, there should be an individual examination, and what each man is doing should be looked into properly.  There is no use and it is all wrong in supposing that because a man is a Meath man he is not working his land properly and economically.  I say here and now that if a man finds it pays him better to feed his cattle on the land I am going to tell him to feed his cattle.  If it pays the man better to till his land, I am going to tell him to till his land.</P>

      <P>I am going to tell the man on the land to do what is most economical for him with his land. The Government or the Land Commission did not order him to do anything else but that.  The Department of Agriculture encouraged him to do what he thinks is best.  These statements that men were forced to do this thing, or that men were forced to do that thing or the other thing by the Government is totally wrong.

      <P>We come back again to the question of economic holdings and to the manner in which the land is divided by the Land Commission. I hope that this individual examination will take place, and it is my candid opinion that when it does take place, and I hope it will, that we will get at the truth.  I want to see the inspectors visit these farms and without fear or favour have an individual examination as to how they are worked.  If the inspector finds that the individual who signed the contract with the Land Commission and took over the liability to work that land, is not working the holding properly, then it is the business of the Land Commission to take steps to see that that man is removed off the land, because there are people to take his place.  The matter is altogether too expensive and too important to have it treated in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on this Vote last night, Deputy Cosgrave, and, I think, Deputy Linehan, brought up a case in the County Meath in which the Land Commission are supposed to have done wrong.  It was a question of a fee farm grant.  I think the name was mentioned, but there is no necessity to mention the name now.  Under the 1923 Land Act there was very little notice taken of these fee farm grants. These fee farm grants came about in a peculiar way.  I think they were the first attempts on the part of Irish farmers to get a secure grip of their land and to get some fixity of tenure. There were very many of such cases in the County Meath; they are found in all rich counties.  I may take take it that Meath, Westmeath and Kildare would have more of these fee farm grants than the other counties.  They arose in this way; the landlord wanted to raise the wind, and when such a landlord had tenants with some money he went to them and said: &ldquo;You want some security in your holding; I will grant you a lease if you pay me a bit of money.&rdquo;  The sum may have been <Col N="1796" /> £3,000 or £30.  When this sort of thing originated the Department that then corresponded somewhat with the Land Commission in later days were anxious to help this business and they made little advances.  They sometimes advanced half the money to the tenant, the tenant himself putting up the other half for the purpose of these leases.  There was no change in the occupation of the land.  The farmer continued to work it as usual.  The conditions usually were that if the rents were not paid within six months, the landlord had power to break the lease.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that in these cases there were two interests to be purchased. The landlord had an interest and the tenant had an interest in the fee farm grant.  In their day, these fee farm grants were considered by the banks and others as good security, and money was lent on them.  It was not until later years that the banks realised that the security was not as good security as they had believed it to be.  The consequence is that these fee farm grants became overloaded with debt, and in addition there was a good deal of money owing to the landlords. When these came to be dealt with by the Land Commission in the last two or three years, and when all the liabilities were worked out, it was found that the landlord's interest was much greater than the tenant's interest. As a result the tenant got very little.  It was pretty much the same as a registered holding taken over by the Land Commission and previous advances had to be redeemed.  There was very little to go to the tenant.  In equity, of course, it is tough luck on these people that their goodwill was worth so very little.  Very little was paid, or could be paid, by the Land Commission to the grantee in the case of these fee farm grants.  I do not know what remedy could be devised. There is, of course, a grievance.  It is like a property owing a debt to the bank.  The bank holds the title deeds. A good deal of sympathy can be aroused for the case that Deputy Cosgrave made, but when it comes to be examined, it is not quite so easy to see what remedy can be adopted.  It is quite true that in 1925 a certain figure <Col N="1797" /> was offered for this land.  But that is some time ago, and the land was only purchased two or three years ago by the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>But is there not a great difference between the sum that was offered in 1925, £3,000, and the £5 that the Land Commission is paying for it now?  Would not the Deputy relate these figures and then talk about justice?</P>

      <P>There has been quite an amount of land divided in Meath. It has been divided with the minimum of disturbance and the minimum of friction.  These farms are uneconomic and I hope the Minister will consider increasing the size of the holdings.  It may be difficult to do that now.  The lands have been divided and they are as they are, and it is very difficult now to make them economic.  The next thing that has to be considered is the question as to how these lands are to be properly used, and how are you going to make genuine homes of these farms.  I take it that once the lands are vested the Land Commission is finished with the matter.  Other Departments must then come in.  The Department of Education must come <Col N="1798" /> in and try to reap the benefits of what has been done.  I think the Department of Education is prepared to enter on that business and see that these farms are fully utilised.  As far as I can see, the Land Commission has done its duty fully and well There is that difficulty that there are more things to be done and there is the undoing of what has been done under the previous regime.  Very few houses were built then.  The uneconomic holders were given holdings extending sometimes three miles away from their residences.  A great deal of the time of the Land Commission has been occupied trying to adjust these things.  Quite a number of farms have been divided and no houses have been built on them.  These farms are almost derelict.  Many Deputies here passing along by rail will have seen a number of those farms and they get a very bad impression from the sight. I want to explain clearly to them that that is not our work.  Previous Governments have been responsible for what is wrong there.  Only in a few cases along the railway line are people able to see the work done by the present Government.</P>

      <P>We have divided a good deal along the bus lines.  It will, as I say, take quite a long time to rectify the mistakes that have been made, but I hope the Land Commission will give attention to those farms because they are in a bad way.  It is impossible for people living three or four miles away to work these farms properly.  The solution of the problem will cost money, I know.  I trust sincerely that the Minister will reconsider the migratory schemes, and that, as far as possible, people will not be brought into areas in which there is at present a reasonable population; that land will be sought for migrants in areas in which there are not many <Col N="1799" /> people already resident, and there are a great many such areas in County Meath.  If colonies are established in such areas, the schemes could be worked properly and there would be no friction.  It is quite obvious that people who own land will work that land in the proper way, in the way that they think best if they get an opportunity.  I do not think it quite fair that we should be led away by wild phrases that people are not working their land properly.  As I say, they will work it in the way that they consider best themselves.  That generally is the best way to work it, and they should get all the assistance and encouragement they can.  I hope the Minister will consider these questions on migration carefully, and that in connection with the present scheme which is under consideration as far as the Craig Waller estate is concerned, he will carry out the promise made to me that eligible men will be sought for this estate and that the limits will be increased there.  I must pay a tribute to the Land Commission for their efficiency and courtesy, and certainly for their hard work.  We cannot at present realise fully what is being done.  In three or four years' time, when these farms are beginning to be worked properly, the full effect of what is now being done will be better realised.  I am sure that it will be a source of satisfaction to all concerned, and that it will bring credit to the Land Commission and to this House.</P>

      <P>I had occasion to rejoice recently over the conversion of the Labour Party.  I now may rejoice, as I do know all my colleagues on these benches will, at the conversion of Deputy M. O'Reilly.  That a man who stumped this country on the policy of &ldquo;Grow more wheat, whether it pays or not,&rdquo; now declares his conversion to the doctrine that any man who is using his land as he thinks best to use it, should be approved and encouraged by the Land Commission, is a remarkable thing.  I think that, if I may say so, is a great tribute to Parliamentary institutions.  In other countries differences are settled by revolutions and <Col N="1800" /> they have a great contempt for the talking shops of democratic countries, but here, by protracted argument, we actually succeed in converting so convinced a Deputy as Deputy O'Reilly. That, I think, is something which should give great heart to Parliamentarians the world over.  If Parliamentary debate can convert Deputy Matt. O'Reilly it can do anything.  I look forward with enthusiasm to the day when we can receive into the ranks of our Party all the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  When they return to sanity they will be very heartily welcomed in the work of governing this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Sir, with special reference to the Land Commission, I feel bound to say that I think the Land Commission is endeavouring at the present time to deal with a volume of work beyond its capacity, with the result that a very considerable element of confusion is taking place within its organisation. I ask the House to remember that they cannot expect a single man to do the work of three men efficiently.  I believe that there are people working in the Land Commission at present, including the Minister, who are trying to do in a month work that they should not be reasonably expected to complete in three months, with the result that it is very difficult to get information from the Land Commission.  It is very difficult to get satisfaction when you have an inquiry to make, and I am afraid some of the work of improvement, and some of the work of choosing tenants with discretion, is not being done as well as it should be done.  I, therefore, suggest to the Minister that he should very seriously consider whether some scheme of reorganisation should not be contemplated with a view to getting control of the work that has to be done, with a view to removing confusion and getting the machine working smoothly.  It might mean the temporary slowing down of the actual process of land division for a period of a few months until the process of reorganisation be completed but, in the long run, I believe it would be the best course to pursue.  There is no use in spurring a willing horse, and if all the responsible officials of the Land Commission year after year find themselves <Col N="1801" /> borne down by an accumulation of work, upon which they can never satisfactorily reach, it will be more than human nature can stand, and their efficiency, and the efficiency of the men who work under them, will be, eventually, irreparably impaired.  If there was a pause, and a satisfactory reorganisation carried out, it would remove that atmosphere of strain which is embarrassing the whole Land Commission personnel.  I believe more efficient work would be done and, taking the long view, the land distribution problem would be more efficiently and effectively dealt with.</P>
    <P>The next question to which I wish to refer is the matter of allocating land.  Do you know, I think it rather helps the Minister for Lands if violent allegations of corruption are made against him from this side of the House, because if they are not made from this side of the House it will be suggested by his own supporters that he has sold out to the Fine Gael Party.  I am not concerned to protect the sensitive feelings of the Minister for Lands.  If I thought that there was corruption in the allocation of land, I should not have any hesitation in saying so, but I do not believe there is.  I think the Land Commission allocate land very fairly.  I have known estates in which practically no supporter of mine got an acre of land, and I have known other estates where men who were notorious adversaries of the Government got a larger share of the land than Government supporters.  I believe that, on the whole, the allocation of land is carried out without regard to the political convictions of the allottees.</P>
    <P>There is no use in this House passing laws requiring the Land Commission to give preference to certain classes of individuals, and then, when it carries out the laws, finding grave fault with it for having done so.  We have laid it down in these laws that certain classes of persons' claims must be considered in order, and, so far as I am aware, that is what the Land Commission did. There is a qualification of that statement which I wish to make.  There is no use imagining that the Land Commissioners can go and walk the land on every estate.  They have to act <Col N="1802" /> through inspectors.  I believe these inspectors are, on the whole, a disinterested and a conscientious body of public officials, but I say this to the Minister, that I believe there are some amongst them lacking in discretion.  I believe, with the best will in the world, they go down under the commissioners' instructions to inquire into local views so as to choose the most suitable tenants.  Certain people are active and go out to meet an inspector, seek him out and invite him to come and interview them.  The inspector in perfect good faith does so, but it may become clear locally that the Land Commission inspector was, in fact, discussing the question with nobody but stalwart supporters of the Government Party. He may not be conscious of that.  All he knows is that he gained local knowledge and, having listened, called upon them for advice.  I think the Minister might sound a note of warning to all the inspectors and point out to them that they had got to be tactful when conducting inquiries in the neighbourhood of an estate about to be divided. If they had the advantage of discussing their plans with persons who were very violently associated with the Fine Gael Party, they ought also seek out someone who was an ardent supporter of the Labour Party or an ardent supporter of the Government Party to get their views.  Then when the scheme was finally prepared, the inspector would be in a position to say that, having heard all parties, he did what he thought was best, and did not acknowledge any particular right in persons who had strong political views to dictate as to how the land was to be divided, but he did acknowledge it as part of his duty to hear everyone who was prepared to give bona-fide information on the problem to be resolved, and did not want his judgment to be unduly coloured by persons whose observation might be inspired by some ulterior political motive.  I believe if the Minister would do that, and give that word of counsel to the inspectors in the Land Commission, he would remove the last substantial ground upon which the commissioners administration could be seriously impugned, so far as the allotment of land is concerned. <Col N="1803" /> I am naturally more concerned for the old evicted tenants, and for the old soldiers of the Land War, than many other Deputies, and I note with regret that the work that was done 50 or 60 years ago when the Land War was commencing, is naturally being more and more forgotten by the generation that is rising now. Nevertheless, in every Land Act passed since 1885 down to to-day, lip service has been paid to the evicted tenants.  I cannot help feeling that they are being forgotten.  I know some men who are still struggling to get back to holdings that were taken from their fathers 55 years ago. I think they ought to be put back. They are entitled to be put back.  I remember that in East Mayo prior to 1918, one of the greatest sources of gratitude we had then was that a fortnight before Mr. de Valera was elected member for that constituency, the member who had sat for it before that put back the last evicted tenant there. There were other counties where the Land League had not been so strong as in Mayo, where the evicted tenants were forgotten, and I would like to get from the Minister to-day an assurance that the case of any evicted tenant brought under his attention would be guaranteed favourable consideration. I know that in regard to many of them an argument can be advanced that they have gone in for other kinds of work, and have become detached in one way or another from the land.  I do not think too much weight should be given to that argument.  They have sentimental claims on these holdings, and if the fight for the land is to be honoured and vindicated in an adequate way, I feel that these old warriors should be put back on the holdings from which they were originally evicted.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the matter of the failure to collect land annuities.  We cannot escape from this fact, that when the last Government went out of office, the arrears under all Land Purchase Acts from 1885 to 1923, amounted to £650,000, and that the tenant purchasers were then paying 100 per cent. of the annuities.  All the arrears were funded under the 1933 Act, and the <Col N="1804" /> annuities cut in two, but to-day we have arrears of over a million on half the annuities that used to be charged upon the land.  To explain that some Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party suggest that that is due to a no-rent campaign.  Everyone knows that that allegation is &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.  If we got the figures for the several counties we would find that the arrears were largest in counties where Government support is strongest.  I invite Deputies on the Government Benches to inspect the arrears records for counties like Clare, Kerry or elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I claim to have converted Deputy M. O'Reilly, but I do not claim yet to have converted all who support Fianna Fáil in the country.  It cannot be assumed that Fianna Fáil supporters in the country are withholding their rents because Fine Gael preached a no-rent campaign.  We must have some reason in this matter.  The truth is, there is no foundation for the allegation made by members of the Fianna Fáil Party, and it is going to serve no useful purpose by jumping on the backs of the farmers who have withheld the annuities or upon the Land Commission, which sought to get them in a reasonable way.  We all know that the difficulties that existed during the last two or three years made the payment and collection of annuities very difficult, and that getting excited about it is going to do no good.  What we ought to do is, to try to make it possible for the tenants to pay the annuities.  If we do that, it will largely resolve the difficulties of the Land Commission in collecting them.  I have not the slightest doubt when normalcy is restored the tenant farmers of this country will prove just as scrupulous in the payment of their commitments, as did their fathers and grandfathers before them.  But I do not believe that it is expedient to pursue that question too deeply, because at this stage in the affairs of the State I do not think it is desirable to be wrangling and arguing as to the financial circumstances of the agricultural community of this country. We will have an opportunity of doing that on the Vote for the Department of <Col N="1805" /> Agriculture and on other votes, and events will then have come and gone which will leave us all freer to speak our minds more cogently than we could speak them to-day.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime the Deputy will go into training, and also in the meantime he would urge Deputies not to grow too eloquent either about the collection branch of the Land Commission or about the tenants themselves. If the truth were told, probably both parties are doing their best to overcome their difficulties, and no matter who was faced with it he might have just as great difficulty in meeting the situation as these people are finding at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do say, in regard to the allottees, that greater discrimination ought to be shown in selecting them, not from the political point of view at all, but from the point of view of their competence to use the land profitably when they get it.  I say that for two reasons.  The first is because I think it is a highly undesirable thing to put impracticable persons on to the land, and, secondly&mdash;and to this reason I attach the more importance&mdash;that if you put in unsatisfactory allottees, and, under the terms of the 1933 Act, I think, take them off again because they are proving unsuccessful, you are in the minds of the people of the country shaking the whole conception of fixity of tenure.  We understand in this House the difference between a vested tenant and a non-vested tenant and a tenant at will, but country people have always understood that once they got an allotment of land, or a straw out of the thatch in the cottage to which they went, that that was their home.  Fixity of tenure meant to them that, once they closed the door of their cottage, nobody must cross the threshold without their leave.  If you qualify that, country people will begin to ask themselves: &ldquo;What has become of fixity of tenure?  Does anybody own their land any more?  Can we be put out of our holdings overnight because some <Col N="1806" /> neighbour wants it?&rdquo;  Therefore, the less chopping and changing that we have of tenants the better it will be.</P>
    <P>You see, there are certain things extremely difficult to explain.  The late G. K. Chesterton&mdash;requiescat in pace&mdash;was in many ways a very wise man.  He once pointed out that it was a very dangerous thing to abolish an existing custom even though you were not quite clear what purpose the custom served, because, he said, suppose you abolish what appears to be merely an archaic custom, unless you know the reason which originally gave rise to that custom, when you abolish the custom the evil that that custom was originally designed to abate may manifest itself; and in our generation we may not have the wisdom to perceive that the custom is the best way to abate the evil.  So when we abolish an archaic custom, the evil may manifest itself again, and we may be at our wits' end to end an evil which was satisfactorily provided for by the archaic custom which we in our folly abolished.</P>
    <P>A great many Deputies of this House do not realise the evils that existed before the 3 F's were secured for our people.  All the Deputies in this House have grown up in the possession of fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale. They do not know what it means to live in rural Ireland in the absence of those things, but their grandfathers, and fathers even, would have told them that, in the absence of those things, the tenant farmers of this country grew steadily poorer until they became a by-word in Europe for poverty and degradation.  Once they were persuaded that the land was not inalienably theirs, the tenant farmers of this country refused to invest any money in it.  They knocked as much out of the land as they could, and they put nothing back into it.  They were always afraid that if they put anything into the land a covetous neighbour would come along and take it from them, and that the money they invested in the land would be lost to them. They let their houses fall into disrepair. They would not improve them lest the rents would be raised.  No young fellow regarded the land as offering a decent livelihood.  Young <Col N="1807" /> fellows would rather go to America because they felt that if they ever wanted to sell their tenant right in the land the landlord had the right to interfere.</P>
    <P>This astonishing thing has happened. After a 50 years' struggle we established free sale, fair rent and fixity of tenure in this country, and in the last five years, amidst universal rejoicing, we have abolished them all.  In the last five years, amidst acclamations from the sons of the men who fought in the land war, we have abolished fixity of tenure, free sale and fair rent.</P>

The Deputy, I believe, is a thoroughly well-intentioned man, but it does throw a flood of light on the public men of to-day that they do not realise what they are doing.  They think it is in the national interest to do it.  I say it is to the national ruin to do it.  It will destroy the entire rural economy of this country if it is successfully done.  How can any man like Deputy Victory, who knows the country, claim that the whole foundation of the land war was wrong?  How can he claim that the argument of the Clanricardes and the Barrymores was right&mdash;that there ought to be some over-lord over land who could control and enslave the people living on it?  Is not that the very principle that we fought to destroy?  The whole doctrine of the Land League was that a man who was living on the land should be the lord of that land, and that, instead of having a lord of vast domains and vast estates, you should have the lord of the homestead, and that nobody should have any right to enter that homestead and interfere with it.  Deputy Victory says to-day that it is in the national interest to abolish all that, and to get <Col N="1808" /> back to the Barrymores and the Clanricardes, substituting the Government for the Barrymores and the Clanricardes.</P>

It is to rebut that assumption by a man whom I believe to be bona fide and well-intentioned that my remarks are addressed.  Fixity of tenure is destroyed by the practice of the Land Commission in choosing unsuitable tenants.  When they find them unsuitable in practice&mdash;as 90 per cent. of the people could have told them they were going to prove to be before they were put in&mdash;the Land Commission take them out and try to find alternative tenants for these resumed holdings, whereupon all the neighbours say &ldquo;There is a man who has been seven years in that holding and he is thrown out on the side of the road because the Fianna Fáil club say he is not running his farm in the right way!&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do urge Deputy Killilea to let me speak my mind and then he can speak his.  The next way in which fixity of tenure is being jeopardised is by the practice of acquiring very small farms quite out of the category of demesne lands and of what was associated in the public mind with landlord's property.  I admit that, once the 1923 Land Act was passed, every Land Act that followed that was merely a development &mdash;and a logical development&mdash;from the authority included in that Act to break the demesne wall.  I do urge upon the Minister that he should try, by administration, to abate, so far as he can, the evils that are arising from the power of the Land Commission to re-purchase land vested under previous Land Acts and to break the demesne wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is difficult.  Once you give the Land Commission authority to go back on sales made in the past, take land from people who had bought under previous Land Acts and re-divide it amongst any group, you are opening a <Col N="1810" /> floodgate that human ingenuity will find it very hard to close.  But it is bad for the country to throw the whole land-settlement into the melting pot.  If that is done, there will be no end to it and, eventually, as I warned this House on three successive occasions, you will start minor land wars all over the country.  I ask the Minister if my words have not been borne out.  Has he not found in the day-to-day administration of the work of the Land Commission that minor land wars have been started in different parts of the country?  The recent scenes in Ballyhaunis recalled the old days of 1883.  I know nothing of the merits of that dispute, but it is deplorable that you should divide a parish into two warring factions, one half describing the others as land grabbers and emergency men, and that you should have a group of enraged women going out and attacking the Guards.  Remember, respectable women from East Mayo do not go out and attack the Guards unless they are very deeply moved and are labouring under a sense of very deep grievance. On investigation, their grievance may prove to be ill-founded, but that is typical of the danger of destroying the principle of fixity of tenure.  No matter how careful you are, you are running straight into the peril of starting minor land wars all over the country and creating bitter parish feuds that may go on for generations.  That is no laughing matter.  It could develop into a very deplorable state of affairs, and I think the Minister ought to say categorically to-day that he is strongly opposed to any administrative policy which would persuade the average farmer that there was any danger of disturbance of his right to his land&mdash;that the policy was not to interfere in the administration of any farm once the tenant had been firmly fixed upon it.</P>
    <P>I agree that you can make a very strong case when you reply: &ldquo;Suppose a fellow proves to be no good; suppose that he is obviously a failure, are we to leave him on the land?&rdquo; On balance. I should be inclined to say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; These men are an infinitesimal minority and the amount of damage you do by shaking the whole concept of fixity of tenure in shifting these fellows off to <Col N="1811" /> make way for more prudent persons, outweighs altogether the advantage of getting land into the hand of competent farmers.  I admit that, where you give a man a holding under the Land Commission and he goes and sets it and becomes a petty landlord, he is deliberately stepping back into the Clanricarde and Barrymore class and you can defend your saying to him: &ldquo;If you are going to set the land and make no attempt to work it, to turn it into a sort of investment, there are plenty of people who would like to live on and out of the land and they are entitled to have it.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not altogether.  There should be a clear-cut policy announced with regard to any man who sets his land without good reason.  You can imagine a widow with an upgrowing son who may want to set her land for a few years until her son is able to work it.  That is a perfectly good excuse, and I do not think that that person ought to be disturbed.  But if a man gets a holding and, for no other reason than the desire to make money out of it in rent, sets it, then the Land Commission are entitled to regard him as a minor landlord and to apply the ordinary land code.  But where a man is in occupation of land and is working it, we should not set ourselves up as judges as to whether he is working it badly or well.  He must determine that for himself, and we should not strike at the root of fixity of tenure in order to gratify our own desire to be judge and jury on the methods of husbandry which are being practised on every acre of land in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point I want to make is about free sale.  Free sale is of immense importance to the people of the country.  Suppose a farmer needs to invest money in the improvement of his land, he must have the belief that if some family emergency arises he can put that improved farm on the market, sell it and get a fair bonus from the purchaser for the improvements he has done on the soil and the buildings. That is not happening.  The very <Col N="1812" /> reverse is happening.  If I improve my land and make it an outstanding farm in the neighbourhood and afterwards make up my mind that I want to change my place of residence, or perhaps live in the city, and I put my farm up for sale and ask the auctioneer to advertise it and the solicitor to take carriage of sale, on the following morning I will get a letter from the Land Commission to say that an inspector will walk the land.  I may conceal that letter.  A purchaser comes into me and bids a good price for the land, when the Land Commission inspector arrives and walks the land and the sale is finished.  The other party to the sale withdraws immediately and says: &ldquo;Where is the use of my buying the land?  If I give £2,000 for it, the Land Commission will walk in the day after the sale and take it over and give me £300.&rdquo;  That is literally what would happen, if the Land Commission make up their mind to take it, with the result that free sale is completely finished.</P>
    <P>Nobody dare offer a good farm for sale now amongst his neighbours.  That is common knowledge.  The result of that is going to be that a farmer who has any surplus profits will put his money in the bank and not into the land.  Remember, the old 20-acre man did not start putting money into the bank until he had ample savings invested in the land.  He bought slag and artificial manures.  He conserved the product of his land for the purpose of improving the soil, and it was only when he had the soil up to the standard he thought right that he began to put money into the bank.  What is going to happen now is that a farmer will not buy manure, will not repair fences, and will not repair outhouses, because he has the feeling that if the son goes to England and the daughter to America, and he wants to sell the place, he cannot sell it.  He dare not sell it, because the Land Commission will come in, and it will be divided up, and he will not get any price for it.  In any case, whatever price the Land Commission gives him, they will give as much for rotten land as for good land.  They will rob him in any case, and he would sooner have <Col N="1813" /> money in the bank than have it invested in the land, to be robbed of it when the Land Commission comes to buy.  In so far as that is true, free sale is gone.</P>
    <P>The last thing is fair rent.  In the old days, we set up courts of law, we passed Acts of Parliament, and insisted that tenants would not be rack-rented in this country or would not be asked to pay more than an economic rent for the land.  What has happened?  The Land Commission have reduced the rents by 50 per cent., and a new body of Barrymores and Clanricardes have appeared on the horizon.  When the Land Commission reduced the rents, the tariff-mongers and the quota-mongers proceeded to collect on the kettles and pots, the boots and shoes, the clothes and everyday necessities of the people, a far greater rack-rent than the landlords attempted to get.</P>

Surely it is time for the Minister, who as a Dublin man probably had little association with the Land League, to give his own followers a lead in this matter and tell them that their fathers and <Col N="1814" /> grandfathers were not all fools, that they did not go to gaol and suffer eviction for something that was all wrong; tell them that Michael Davitt did not spend a great part of his life in penal servitude in defence of things that the Fianna Fáil Party should tear to pieces and destroy.  The three F's were worth fighting for.  Tenant farmers never dreamt that when we got a national Government it would triumph in the destruction of the three F's.  They were convinced that with the advent of a national Government the three F's would be for ever guaranteed.  Is it not an appalling commentary that so prominent and well-informed a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party as Deputy Victory should proclaim to-day that these three F's were abolished and abolished in the national interest?</P>

Deputy O'Reilly deplores the Minister's present policy of the migration of Gaeltacht residents to Meath, the general suggestion being that little or nothing was done for the Gaeltacht dwellers until this Government came into office.  In fact, the schemes sponsored by the late Deputy Hogan for the migration of residents out of the Galway Gaeltacht were infinitely superior to the Gibbstown scheme at present in operation and provided the Gaeltacht residents with a far better type of farm and a happier household in which to dwell and did not involve a tithe of the expenditure which the present scheme demands, with the <Col N="1815" /> result that far more people were looked after and far more people stayed where they were put.</P>

      <P>When replying to Deputy Cosgrave's question a couple of weeks ago, I had hoped that our negotiations with the British Government would have reached such a stage that I would be able to inform the Dáil before it adjourned whether or not an agreement was likely to be made, or at least when a definite decision would be taken.  The House will appreciate, however, that negotiations of the kind we are engaged in almost invariably extend over a long period.  Where questions of trade are concerned, a great variety of interests are involved and detailed examination becomes absolutely necessary.  Such examination takes time.  In the present case a number of external accidents have also contributed to the delay.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the Dáil that the Government have been fully alive to the inconvenience and the loss which the protraction of the negotiations has entailed, and we have done everything possible to expedite decisions.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>When this debate adjourned last Wednesday, I was endeavouring to set before the House my view as to what constituted the essential principle of arbitration.  I was saying that, essentially, arbitration was a process whereby specific issues which had arisen between two parties were referred, with their consent and by their agreement, to a third party, who should endeavour, by expressing an opinion, to bring the two contenders in the disagreement or dispute into agreement with each other.  I was going on to make it clear that, while there might be voluntary arbitration, and another process which is sometimes called arbitration by compulsion, the power of compulsion was in no sense an essential factor in any arbitration scheme. When discussing a motion of the kind now before it, which asks that certain matters in which the Government, as representing the whole people, has a primary and overriding interest, should be referred to what is described here as an independent arbitration board, it is essential for the House not to allow itself to be confused into assuming that there is in existence in this country any code or statute of law which provides for an arbitration board of the kind which is specifically referred to in the motion.  There is, of course, at common law a process of arbitration which seeks, where differences have arisen between individuals as to their rights, say, under a contract or as to their rights in certain property, to have those differences reconciled without having recourse to the ordinary processes of the courts.  There are statutes which give the courts, when those conflicts of individual interests arise, power to have them referred to an arbitrator, in order to assess the compensation which should be paid for some loss or damage sustained either <Col N="1817" /> when property has been or is to be taken by compulsion, or where a contract has not been fulfilled.  Sometimes, as I say, where two individuals are at issue, the court will appoint an arbitrator for the purpose of assessing the compensation or adjudicating upon a particular narrow issue.  But at common law, in the generality of cases where arbitrations take place, the submissions are by agreement.  I have here Redman's Law of Arbitrations and Awards.  Now, it may seem strange that I, a layman, should in a matter of this sort, endeavour to controvert the statements which have been made by the learned counsel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the one case they are concerned to ensure that their clients shall not be misled.  In the other, they are concerned to put the best face possible upon their client's case.</P>

      <P>While I should be quite prepared, if I were a private individual, retaining the services of either Deputy Costello or Deputy Lavery as my advisers, for a fee, to attach the greatest possible importance to their advice and to be guided by it, it is quite a different matter when they appear here as the advocates for one party in the dispute.  Then neither I nor any member of the House is bound to listen to them or to take their opinions, even though they offer them to this House for acceptance as the opinions of experienced lawyers.  They count in this matter for nothing more than I or any other layman in this Assembly.  They are simply here to plead a case and not to advise us as to the law.  That, possibly, will explain why we have heard statements made <Col N="1818" /> during the course of this debate by a former Attorney-General, as to the constitutional position, which, at any rate, were not in accordance with the principles upon which my predecessors acted during the period when Deputy Costello was Attorney-General and their law adviser.</P>
      <P>Now, Sir, I was dealing with arbitration at common law, and the first point I want to make&mdash;and I make it on the authority of Redman's Law of Arbitrations, as edited by Mr. William E. Watson, Barrister-at-Law, and Honorary Standing Counsel (Past President) of the Institute of Arbitrators&mdash;the first matter to which he calls my attention is on page 78 of this volume which I have here, where he states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The jurisdiction and authority of the arbitrator are governed by the terms of the submission.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then we go on to what he previously said on page 3, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At common law any agreement by which parties refer an existing or possible future matter in dispute between them to the judicial and final determination of a third person, who is named, is called a submission.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On page 6 he goes on to say that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An agreement means the assent of both parties to the same set of terms.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that touches&mdash;and I am merely going to touch on it in passing&mdash;upon one feature of our arbitration proposals which has been attacked and which was attacked on the last occasion upon which this motion was before the House by Deputy Lavery.  He said that we had a veto at both ends.  Of course, I think it is a misnomer, in connection with what is reserved to one of the parties to any arbitration which might be undertaken under the Government's proposal, to describe as a veto the fact that the Minister for Finance will have reserved to him by statute the ordinary rights which, under common law, every citizen enjoys&mdash;the right that he himself shall determine and agree that a matter in which he is a party shall be referred to arbitration or not.  In general, it will be the staffs which will be putting forward demands, asking <Col N="1819" /> that they should be referred to arbitration. Their agreement is implicit in their demands.  The only thing that we are bound to do, if we propose to pass a statute setting up an arbitration board for the Civil Service, is to ensure that we safeguard to the Minister for Finance the same liberty of action as the staffs have&mdash;this liberty that what will be referred to the arbitration board is a matter upon which we are prepared to arbitrate and nothing else. As I say, this liberty is the right to reserve it to oneself to say &ldquo;There are certain matters which I shall refer to the arbitration board, and certain matters which, in my view, are not justiciable and which I must reserve,&rdquo; goes to the whole root of this principle of arbitration, which is that the whole reference to the arbitration board should be by agreement between the parties themselves&mdash;that is, voluntary arbitration as it is understood in this country.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I was pointing out that the House must be careful to distinguish, first of all, between arbitration as it has existed in this country and as the courts have had cognisance of it under the common law procedure since, I think, about 1854, in regard to disputes between individuals, and secondly, industrial arbitration as applied to the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes as it has been in operation here since the Act of 1919.  They are two separate processes.  The House heard Deputy Alfred Byrne, on Wednesday last, referring to the fact that he was one of those who had advocated the setting up of the Whitley Committee, and he urged that the Government should provide for the Civil Service here such machinery as had been recommended by the Whitley Committee.  Now, what attitude did the Whitley Committee take in regard to this question of arbitration?  So that there shall be no doubt as to my authority, I am going to quote to the House what I think is an authoritative résume of the findings of that committee in regard to this question of arbitration.  It is to be found in the 14th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and the article is written <Col N="1820" /> over the initials &ldquo;F.W.L.&rdquo;  It is all very well for Deputy Norton to laugh, but I think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In any event, I want to put before the House an authoritative statement as to what the Whitley Committee did, in fact, recommend.  I should like Deputy O'Neill, who has accused us of pledge-breaking, to bear with me for a while, just to hear what is the issue between us and the Civil <Col N="1821" /> Service.

Yet, that is what the Deputy wants us to do, to say that we gave a blank cheque to any person to fill up.  We said we would set up an arbitration board. The arbitration scheme is in draft. We are ready to fulfil our pledge, but we are not going to let Deputy Norton or Deputy Heron or any civil servant avail of our signature to fill in a cheque for something that was never intended, never contemplated, and is not in existence even on the other side of the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me now get back to the question of the Whitley Committee.  The Whitley Committee made a recommendation against compulsory arbitration. Mind you, what is being <Col N="1822" /> demanded here is that we should have compulsory arbitration, that whether as I said before, a matter is deemed by the Minister to be arbitrable or not, without his consent or agreement it is to be placed before some independent board so that they may adjudicate upon it.  The Whitley Committee, therefore, to which Deputy Alfred Byrne referred on Wednesday, made a recommendation against compulsory arbitration.</P>

      <P>It is a long document, and I do not want to occupy the whole time of the House in dealing with it.  These are some of the heads of the scheme as circulated to the Civil Service organisations.  The difference between the draft Bill and this is that the draft Bill is somewhat more precise as to how a chairman shall be appointed and other important matters. &ldquo;(a) The arbitration board shall consist of a chairman, (b) a panel of not less than four persons acceptable to the Minister for Finance as his representative, and (c) a panel of not less than four persons acceptable to the staff side of the General Service Council.  For the hearing of each claim the board shall consist of a chairman,&rdquo; who, I may mention&mdash;it is not in this document, but I may mention it&mdash;is to be appointed by agreement between the Minister for Finance and the representatives of the Civil Service, and in the event of the failure of these two parties to agree, to be appointed by a person as nearly independent as possible of both parties.  I do not think that any fairer procedure than that <Col N="1824" /> could be devised for the selection and appointment of a chairman of an arbitration board.  It is to be made, if possible, by agreement between the two parties concerned, and, in the event of their failure, upon the nomination of another official personage who is as nearly as possible independent of both parties. &ldquo;For the hearing of each claim the board shall consist of a chairman, one member to be nominated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce from panel (b)&rdquo;&mdash;that is, from the panel of four persons whom the Minister for Finance has indicated are acceptable to him&mdash;&ldquo;and one member similarly nominated from the panel (c) &rdquo; that is, the panel of not less than four persons acceptable to the staff side of the General Service Council.</P>
      <P>The next feature of the scheme is: &ldquo;The Minister for Finance shall prescribe the kind of dispute which would be appropriate for arbitration,&rdquo; and it is then intimated to the staffs: &ldquo;It is proposed that claims which may be arbitrable are those concerning the emoluments, weekly hours of work, and leave of classes of civil servants, and for this purpose, the word &lsquo;emoluments&rsquo; includes allowances in the nature of pay, the application of bonus to basic pay, overtime rates, subsistence rates, and travelling and lodging allowances.  Subjects that would be excluded are discipline and conduct regulations, political rights, promotions, superannuation, cost-of-living index figure as the basic of bonus payments, recruitment, grading of work and organisation of staff.  This set of exclusions, however, must not be taken to be exhaustive.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy wanted to know whether our proposal was a proposal for a compulsory arbitration scheme.  It is not; it is a proposal to allow an arbitration board to adjudicate upon disputes where both parties to the disputes are agreeable that the matter should be arbitrated upon.  Naturally&mdash;and this is an important point-the Minister must, I think, reserve the right to agree, or disagree, as to whether a matter should be arbitrated upon, but if the Minister for Finance, or the Government, set up an arbitration board, they intend that arbitration <Col N="1825" /> board to work and they are not going to vexatiously prevent disputes from going to that board which obviously and plainly are matters upon which the board should be called on to arbitrate. The reason we have retained this reservation in the scheme is in order that the scheme should be one for voluntary arbitration, and not one under which we should be compelled to go to the board willy nilly, whether it is in the public interest or not, whether it is in the interest of the general citizens or not and whether we think it is, as I have said, a matter which is not justiciable.</P>
    <P>I am sorry there has been this digression, Sir, and I want to get back, if I can, to this report of the Whitley Committee because it goes, I think, pretty deeply to the root of the difference which has arisen between us, on the one hand, and the Civil Service, on the other.  The Whitley Committee made a recommendation against compulsory arbitration, but in favour of a standing arbitration tribunal as part of the voluntary machinery and the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, which superseded the Conciliation Act complied with this recommendation. Our proposal here is to set up a standing arbitration tribunal as part of the voluntary machinery for conciliation and arbitration in the Civil Service.  This article from which I have quoted goes on to say: &ldquo;Cases are referred to the court by the consent of the parties...&rdquo;  All we are standing for is that we shall not be deprived of the right to consent, that our non-consent shall be effective and that, as I have said, if disputes arise as between the Civil Service, on the one hand, and the State, on the other, the claim will not go to the voluntary arbitration court unless our consent is secured, just the same as in an ordinary industrial dispute, the consent of the employees, of the workers, would have to be secured before the matter could be referred to an arbitration tribunal.</P>
    <P>This article goes on to say: &ldquo;... terms of reference as in all arbitration cases being agreed upon by the parties&rdquo;&mdash;the terms of reference defining the issues upon which a decision <Col N="1826" /> is required&mdash;and then&mdash;which once again touches upon one of the points of difference between the Government and those who profess to speak for the Civil Service&mdash;&ldquo;The awards are not of compulsory application.&rdquo;  We are taking up the attitude that the Government is entitled, in a matter of this sort, to all the rights which the parties to voluntary arbitration in this country would have under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919.  Under that Act, the awards are not of compulsory application.  Naturally&mdash;and this is a point I want to bring out again&mdash;if the Government refers a dispute with the Civil Service to an arbitration board which the Government itself is setting up, the Government would be very slow indeed not to honour the award of such an arbitration tribunal.  It would only refuse to honour that award under circumstances of compelling necessity, that is to say, that the award was going to impose such a substantial burden on the community or on the State that it could not be endured.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this problem of arbitration as applied to the State service, we have to bear in mind another very important point, that in ordinary cases of arbitration in industrial disputes, if an award, in the opinion of the employer, of those who own the industrial undertakings involved in the dispute, is excessive, they always have the remedy in their own hands of closing the undertakings down.  If the award is excessive and makes it impossible for him to carry on in the existing economic surroundings with some prospect of profit to himself, some return for his labour, and some return on the capital he has invested in the undertaking, the owner can close his concern down.  He can throw his workers out of employment; he can cut his losses and get out, if the award is more than the industrial concern in which he is interested can bear.  That is not the position in regard to the State.  The State services have to be carried on and, therefore, no Minister for Finance could, in advance, bind himself under our Constitution&mdash;I do not care what the opinions of Deputy Lavery and Deputy Costello may be and, as I said, my experience of lawyers <Col N="1827" /> in regard to these constitutional matters is that their opinions vary very much according to what side of the House they are sitting on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; what their opinion may be, I say that no Minister for Finance could bind himself in advance, to honour the award of an arbitration tribunal willy-nilly.  He must be fully free to exercise the responsibility which the Constitution imposes upon him to secure, so far as he can, the general financial well-being of the country and to ensure that the citizens and industry of the State are not called upon to endure heavier burdens than they can withstand.  That is one of the essential difficulties in applying this principle of arbitration to Civil Service disputes.  In ordinary industrial disputes the employer has the option of closing down if the award is in his view excessive.  The State cannot do that.  That is a fact that we ought to remember.</P>
      <P>I want, Sir, again to remind the House that one of the points at issue between the representatives of the Civil Service and the Minister for Finance is that the award should be of compulsory application.  I have already pointed out that that is quite contrary to the spirit of the Industrial Courts Act of 1919.  I hope the House will bear with me if I occupy its time a little longer because I want to bring home to everybody this fact, that we have heard arbitration discussed here as if there was some general stereotyped form of procedure which was of universal application.  I pointed out that there is no foundation for that assumption.  Except the Industrial Courts Act of 1919 there is no arbitration code for setting disputes between employers and employees in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial disputes are not confined either to Ireland or Great Britain. Accordingly there are many codes of conciliation and arbitration to be found throughout the world.  There are many codes of conciliation and arbitration, but I want the House to <Col N="1828" /> bear with me if I go into this matter a little further in order to show that those codes differ and vary in their principles and in order to make it quite clear beyond yea or nay that it is not universally true that the awards of arbitration boards are of compulsory application and that they have the force of law or a judgment, as Deputies Lavery and Costello endeavoured to suggest they had, when they referred to our scheme as sham arbitration.  I want to show also that it is not universally true either, that one party to a dispute can have recourse to arbitration without the essential agreement of the other party.</P>
    <P>Now in what I am going to say I base myself upon an authority that ought to be acceptable to the Labour Party.  The International Labour Office, in series (A) of its Industrial Relations, Studies and Reports, published in 1933 a very exhaustive volume upon conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes.  I am not going to read the whole of it to the House on this occasion but I do propose to try to make a brief summary of the main points which emerge from a study of that report in regard to conciliation and arbitration because it is essential that the House and the general public ought to be fully seized of the fact that this scheme which we have set before the Civil Service is an arbitration scheme in the true sense of the word and that it is unfair, unjust and quite indefensible to refer to it, as it has been referred to here by Civil Service spokesmen and Deputies opposite, as a sham arbitration scheme.  The first thing that is pointed out in this volume in regard to arbitration is that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;as a rule two main stages can be distinguished in the procedure.  The dispute reaches the first stage when it is so developed that certain special bodies, set up to undertake conciliation negotiations, begin to deal with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(Our scheme which we have submitted to the Civil Service provided for the setting up of special bodies to undertake conciliation negotiations.)</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This stage may be described as the conciliation stage.  If no success is achieved there is, generally, but not always, another possibility of <Col N="1829" /> bringing the parties to agreement. One or more referees propose to the parties a formula on the basis of which it is hoped they may be able to agree.  It is sometimes decided in advance that the parties will accept this proposal, which is generally referred to as an award.  This section of the procedure may be called the arbitration stage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now mark this.  We have been told that our scheme is a sham arbitration scheme because we do not bind ourselves in advance.  For the reasons I have endeavoured to set before the House, we do not bind ourselves in advance to accept the proposal which will emerge from the arbitration board. But here you have the International Labour Office in this publication pointing out that it is not general and not universal for the parties to pledge themselves in advance to accept the award of the arbitration board.  It is only done sometimes.</P>
    <P>This publication then goes on to say that when one or other party to the arbitration has not accepted the award, that &ldquo;a special set procedure is applied by which the actual situation can be clearly brought to light by unbiased observers.  This inquiry procedure may be instituted when conciliation proves fruitless.&rdquo;  These are very important points.  &ldquo;It is also possible, however, even after arbitration has failed and the parties refuse to accept the award.  This means that a certain pressure is brought to bear on the parties which may lead them to an agreement which may pave the way for fresh attempts at conciliation or arbitration.&rdquo; Thus, Labour authorities, in regard to this principle of arbitration as applied to the solution of labour disputes, quite clearly have envisaged arbitration proposals the result of which both parties in advance do not bind themselves to accept and which, in fact, experience has shown may not be accepted.  They go on even to point out what I have already endeavoured to convey to the House, that there are, one might say, myriad schemes for arbitration, all of which differ from one another in essential points.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be found,&rdquo; this publication says, &ldquo;as already mentioned, that <Col N="1830" /> there are many intermediate stages, differing very slightly from each other, between the pure conciliation method and the compulsory arbitration system.&rdquo; Then we are given&mdash;and this is important from the point of those who believe that all our civil servants are contending for is what civil servants already enjoy in Great Britain-two examples, one of the pure conciliation method, and the other, an example of the compulsory system, as they term it. The essence of the pure conciliation and arbitration is, as I have already shown you, that the award has not compulsory application.  The example which is given of this method is the arbitration code of Great Britain, and the example of compulsory arbitration is the Australian code.  &ldquo;The last point,&rdquo; our Labour authorities go on to say, &ldquo;to be considered is that of the conclusion of the proceedings and the application of any decision which may be arrived at by the conciliation or arbitration board.  Here the differences (in the choice of method) in various countries will be clearly apparent.  The description of the method by which the conciliation proposal or the arbitration award is arrived at, its form, content, and legal character will be followed by a discussion of the complex of problems connected with the enforcement of the award or other decision.  Furthermore, special attention must be paid to the acceptance or rejection of the award, the power to declare it binding on the parties in advance or subsequently, the civil or penal guarantees for its observance, other forms of pressure or compulsion, and the right of appeal where such exists.&rdquo;  Once again we have it quite clearly brought out that you may have&mdash;and you have in fact in other countries, most generally in the democratic countries&mdash;a form of arbitration where the award is not binding on either party, and where no sanctions attach except such sanctions as attach to a gentleman's agreement, the sanction of loss of public reputation, which is invoked when one man breaks faith with another.</P>
    <P>This impartial study goes on, at a further stage, to say: &ldquo;It is therefore natural that in the oldest industrial State of the modern type, England, <Col N="1831" /> many and varied arrangements for conciliation and arbitration should have been created by the parties concerned in close connection with the development of a system of collective agreements.... There is no need to go into further detail on this subject since even the English-speaking countries... have almost entirely adopted the system of putting official machinery at the disposal of the parties concerned in the dispute, at their own request, if the efforts of the parties themselves are unsuccessful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, mark what is the practice. Arbitration machinery is provided in other countries just as we propose to provide it in the Bill which, as I have already told the House, is in draft, but it is only put into operation at the request of the parties concerned.  What does that mean?  It means this: that if one of the parties proposes to reserve to himself the right to say whether a matter is or is not arbitrable, as we propose to reserve that right to ourselves here, then the matter cannot go before the arbitration board.  That is the practice in general in connection with this question.  That is the essence of voluntary arbitration.</P>
    <P>Again, addressing myself to this point&mdash;and if I labour it, it is because of a difference of opinion as to whether arbitration should be by agreement or by compulsion, or as to whether awards should be of compulsory application or not-it is because of the difference of opinion that seems to exist about these matters, that civil servants are without the arbitration machinery which was promised in 1932&mdash;the Labour Office study proceeds: &ldquo;The form of the application is extremely varied&rdquo;&mdash;that is the form of application to the board&mdash;&ldquo;In most systems there is no prescribed form&mdash; in those of Austria, Finland and Germany, for instance, and apparently almost all countries such as Great Britain, and some other English-speaking States, where the proceedings are voluntary, and there is no compulsion. In systems, which on the whole dispense with compulsion, the conciliator or conciliation institution may invite the parties to submit to arbitration and assist them in their choice of an <Col N="1832" /> arbitrator or, in other ways, but cannot open proceedings against the will of the parties.  This is logical, for according to most regulations the opening of arbitration proceedings naturally entails a readiness, usually pre-arranged, to accept such award as may be made.&rdquo;  That is precisely our position.  If we agree, as in general we are prepared to agree, to the opening of arbitration proceedings, there is a natural readiness to accept such an award as may be made.  It is not right that we should go further than that and it is less than right that we should be pressed to go further.</P>
    <P>This study of an international authority on conciliation and arbitration goes on to state on page 80: &ldquo;Attention was drawn above to the principle of informality in conciliation and arbitration systems. The remarks made there are equally true of the actual proceedings and it is only necessary to add that conciliation and arbitration procedure is, as far as form is concerned, much freer than civil procedure but that this freedom decreases nearly everywhere with the growth of powers of compulsion.&rdquo;  In fact, the more informal the procedure, the greater likelihood there seems to be of a decision acceptable to both parties.  As I reminded the House arbitration between individuals is instituted when two people have a dispute and desire to refer it to a third party for his opinion in order to avoid the expensive, cumbersome, formal and sometimes prolonged processes of the ordinary law.</P>
    <P>The study proceeds to make this important summarisation &ldquo;Once the dispute has been dealt with on its merits, there are two main possibilities for the conclusion of the proceedings. One is that an agreement may be reached while they are still in progress without a formal proposal for conciliation or an award having to be made; the other that the institution may make such a proposal or award, in which case three further eventualities emerge.  The parties may submit the proposal or award in advance, or decide the question of acceptance subsequently, or again the award may be legally binding or can be made binding.&rdquo;<Col N="1833" /> These three eventualities are what I should like the House to bear in mind.  They make it clear that formal compulsion is not an essential element in arbitration.  &ldquo;The first group of systems comprises first of all certain English-speaking countries with the exception of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.&rdquo;  In fact, however, subsequent to the drafting of the first part of the report to which I am referring, New Zealand decided to abandon the principle of compulsory arbitration in industrial disputes.  Therefore this system of arbitration where an award has not compulsory application and where the submission of the arbitration board is by agreement, extends first of all to &ldquo;certain English-speaking countries with the exception of Australia and South Africa, that is to say Canada, Great Britain, and as far as can be established the United States of America... According to the legislation of these countries, acceptance of the proposal or award of a conciliation or arbitration institution creates no legal obligation but only the moral obligation of a gentleman's agreement.&rdquo;  As I said time and time again in this House, we are prepared to accept the moral obligation of a gentleman's agreement if our arbitration is set up and, so far as we can to honour such awards as the arbitration board may make.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have kept the House at length on this point, but its importance will be understood.  It is quite clear from everything I have said, that there is no stereotyped well-defined or authoritative scheme of arbitration which has as two of its essential elements, reference to the arbitration board by compulsion, and a compulsory application of that board's award. Throughout the world there are systems of voluntary arbitration, such as it was intended to set up for the Civil Service here.  It was stated that if we were returned to power we would have an arbitration board for the Civil Service, that is of the type of arbitration that exists in most democratic countries. There are systems of compulsory arbitration. Where do they exist?  They exist in Italy, in Germany, in Russia, <Col N="1834" /> and also Australia.  They used to exist in New Zealand.  Compulsory arbitration was, I think, originally introduced in Australia at the behest of the workers.  The strongest opponents of compulsory arbitration in Australia to-day are the workers.  It was introduced in New Zealand also, but so unsatisfactory was the working of the system of compulsory arbitration there that it has been virtually abolished.  A new measure has been passed which almost abolishes completely the compulsory element in arbitration, and lays greater stress on conciliation procedure.</P>
    <P>It is right, from the point of view of the workers, that the stress should be on the conciliation procedure, and not on this reference to a third party because as once again this authoritative study of the problem by the International Labour Office, talking about the undesirability of undue compulsion in regard to arbitration, says on page 135:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This view is logically connected with an objection often raised by employers and sometimes also by workers, namely, that compulsory arbitration destroys the sense of responsibility of the parties concerned. No one experienced in the psychology of conciliation and arbitration can doubt that there is here no small degree of truth; and for this reason most systems which have both institutions separate the two completely, even when arbitration is based on an arrangement between the parties, in order that the possibility of an award may not endanger the chances of conciliation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, I suggest, that if in your Civil Service scheme you have an arbitration board whose award will be of compulsory application, a board before which one party to the dispute can bring the other party, without the consent of that other, then you are not going to have any real attempt to settle differences between civil servants on the one hand and the State on the other hand, by discussion and negotiation. There is going to be a court of ultimate resort which will finally determine, and everything else will be made subservient to that.  That is what is stated here by this authority on the question. <Col N="1835" /> If you want to make your conciliation machinery effective then you must make your arbitration voluntary.  You must provide that resort to the arbitration tribunal can only be had by agreement between the parties, and that the award of the tribunal even in that event is not compulsory in application.  Of course, on the other hand, we have the important factor that this machinery is not being set up <i>ad hoc</i> to deal with one specific dispute and then to be abandoned. It is machinery which is intended to exist for a long time, and is intended to work, and, therefore, I assume that both parties to the arbitration who value this machine are going to accept the moral obligations of it, and enter into a gentleman's agreement to fulfil that obligation and to honour an award where practically possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to dwell upon another matter raised in the course of the debate.  It was stated by Deputy Lavery, and was suggested by Deputy Costello&mdash;and it was quite clear from some speeches made that some members of the House were under a misapprehension&mdash;that the Government had deprived the Civil Service of any machinery for voicing its grievances, or bringing them before the Administration of the day.  I am sorry Deputy Costello who, in moving this motion declared that he spoke particularly for the benefit of those newcomers to the House who were unfamiliar with the problem of arbitration in the Civil Service, did not put before the House certain facts which are vital to this aspect of the discussion.  These are, first, that there is, and since March, 1926, has been, in existence machinery for the discussion of general Civil Service matters between representatives of the Government and representatives of the staffs.  The second is this: that the staff organisations have been informed that it was proposed to set up similar machinery in each particular Department, and to provide, further, for direct negotiations between Ministers, or their representatives, and the staffs, so as to secure by discussion and conciliation, if possible, agreement upon the matters at issue <Col N="1836" /> between them.  We have offered to replace, if necessary, the Civil Service Representative Council by similar machinery with, possibly, a somewhat wider ambit of activities so as to secure, as I have said, by discussion and conciliation agreement upon the matters at issue between the State and its servants; and we have, as I have already pointed out to the House, in draft a Bill for setting up an independent arbitration board to which, as I have said, in the last resort the questions at issue might be referred if the conciliation machinery failed.</P>
    <P>The position, accordingly, is this: that notwithstanding the statements which we have heard from Deputy Lavery, Deputy Heron and others who have spoken on the motion, the Government has already provided, or is prepared to provide, for the Civil Service everything that could reasonably be demanded in the way of conciliation machinery or arbitration.  It is quite true that the machinery is not in operation at the present moment, but the responsibility for that rests not upon the Government, but upon those organisations which, professing to represent the Civil Service, have refused to avail themselves of the facilities which the Government is willing to provide.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to this question of arbitration in the Civil Service, therefore, is peculiar.  The Government, let me emphasise again, is willing to provide machinery for arbitration. Those who profess to speak for the staff have refused to avail themselves of that machinery and to work it.  Instead, they misrepresent and abuse the facilities which they refuse to use.  Now, why cannot the Government's proposals be given a fair trial. If in practice they prove workable and fair, as they are intended to be, what have the staffs gained by this long and continued agitation to secure what the Government cannot concede?  If, on the other hand, experience demonstrates that the Government's scheme is not being operated by the Minister for Finance in the spirit in which I have declared I would operate it, what more have the staffs lost than they are losing now by their attitude of nonco-operation?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> It has been said that the Government has taken a mistaken view of its constitutional responsibilities as they affect this question of arbitration.  I do not think it has.  I believe that the particular feature of the scheme upon which the Government has taken its stand goes to the very heart of one of the fundamental principles of the Constitution: that is the principle that the Executive Government of the day shall have full discretion and full responsibility and be fully answerable to Parliament for the control and management of the public servants, and the public funds wherefrom those servants are paid.  Power and authority go with the control of the purse. If the Government were to cede its final responsibility in regard to the cost of the Civil Service to an arbitration board it would cede its executive authority as well.</P>
    <P>This is the position as it has been realised by us, not merely by us, but by our predecessors in office as well. In that connection, I would like to remind Deputy Costello, who was the principal law adviser to the Government of this country from January, 1926, to March, 1932, of the history of the Civil Service Representative Council.  My predecessor, during 1924, occupied himself with devising a form of conciliation machinery for the Civil Service.  As a result of his labours, the Civil Service Representative Council was set up.  That body held its first meeting in March, 1926.  It was composed, on the one hand, of representatives of the staff organisations, and on the other, as Deputy Heron has told the House, of the heads of the various Departments.  Now, I would like those Deputies who are interested in this question, and who have said that they are only anxious that the Civil Service of the State should have some method of adjusting its differences, to ask themselves: what more representative machinery could have been devised for the discussion of Civil Service problems. On the one hand, you had those standing next to their Ministers, the heads of Government Departments, who in almost every case had risen by promotion from the ranks of the Civil Service themselves.  They were familiar <Col N="1838" /> with every aspect of the matters to be discussed at the Representative Council With them, as representing the staffs, you had colleagues of theirs in the Civil Service, men who could speak with equal conviction, experience and ability on the problems to be discussed. Moreover, they could discuss the matters before the council with absolute freedom of expression of opinion.  I want to emphasise that: that those who spoke for the staffs on the council could express themselves, as I have said here, with absolute freedom, without any reservation of any kind.  I know that it has been suggested that in some occult way the representatives of the staffs were intimidated so that they dared not express their full minds on the matters before them.  There is not a scintilla of truth in that suggestion. How much liberty the spokesmen of the staffs have in these matters is clearly evidenced by the continuous propaganda campaign which is being carried on in the Press and elsewhere by civil servants.  So far has it gone that one civil servant has actually addressed a circular to members of the Dáil, asking the members of the Dáil to vote against the Government: to turn out the Government, because that is what it would mean.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The circular concludes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the earnest wish of the alliance that the opportunity provided by the present resolution should not be allowed to pass, and therefore an appeal is made to every Deputy to vote, without consideration of Party politics, in its favour.&rdquo;</P>

The Minister for Finance, who is responsible to this House, made clear during the last general election where he stood.  If this motion were carried against the Government, what does it <Col N="1839" /> mean according to the Constitution? Of course, I know that Deputy Heron and the Labour Party do not give very much for the Constitution, but the ordinary people of this country, the majority of those who voted at the last general election, have accepted the Constitution.  What does this mean?</P>

And I hope, before I conclude, to show, by reference to some evidence given before the Brennan Commission of Inquiry, the position as it might exist if Deputy Heron and Deputy Norton succeed in working out the policy upon which they are now engaged.  Let me get back.  It is quite true&mdash;I do not want to make any bones <Col N="1840" /> about it&mdash;that the Civil Service Representative Council has no power to come to formal, binding decisions upon the matters before it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because the law and the Constitution have reserved that power to the Minister for Finance. In that connection, I do not think I could put the position before the House in a better way than it was put by Deputy Cosgrave when, as President of the Executive Council, he spoke on the 17th July, 1924, on the staff demands for conciliation machinery in the Civil Service.  Referring in particular to the proposal that Whitley Councils be re-established, with power to bind the Government by their decisions he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Ministry are not prepared to give any bodies, other than bodies of a consultative and advisory character, the power of decision being in all cases reserved to the Minister.  It is true that the Whitley bodies can only arrive at decisions by agreement and the official representatives on the bodies can always prevent a decision by refusing to agree.  But it is not right that Ministers should divest themselves of their powers and responsibilities by leaving it to such bodies to say what salaries will be payable in the Civil Service or not.  What the staff should have, and what the Ministry is prepared to give, is every facility for making known its views on matters affecting the Civil Service, for considering Governmental proposals affecting the Civil Service, and giving their views on such proposals before the Government finally confirms a proposal into a decision.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It will be noted that Deputy Cosgrave held in 1924 that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;it is not right that Ministers should divest themselves of their powers and responsibilities by leaving it to such bodies to say what salaries will be payable in the Civil Service or not.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is precisely the principle we are endeavouring to maintain in regard to the arbitration board&mdash;that we should not divest ourselves formally, fully and <Col N="1841" /> legally of our powers and responsibilities. We have accepted the principle of arbitration because we are quite prepared in these matters to have the opinion of a third independent party. But it must be an opinion only.  It must not be a judgment with compulsory acceptance.  The fact that we do agree to refer a matter to this third party-again, I want to emphasise that the reference must be by agreement&mdash; puts upon us a moral obligation to abide by the opinion, when given. Apart altogether from the question whether or not it would be contrary to the explicit declaration of any article of the Constitution, it would be contrary to the spirit of our Constitution for Ministers to divest themselves, as Deputy Cosgrave so well put it, of their responsibilities by</P>
    <P>&ldquo;leaving it to such bodies to say what salaries will be payable in the Civil Service or not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If Deputy Cosgrave were prepared to get up here and criticise us for having agreed to arbitration, he could, on the basis of that statement, make a very good case.  We have agreed to set up an arbitration board but there is something we cannot do.  If the Civil Service want to see arbitration in operation within the lifetime of this Government or, I believe, within the life time of our successors&mdash;for if such successors are sensible of their responsibilities, as I believe they will be, they will recognise that the limitation which binds us binds them&mdash;they will have to realise the limitations which their responsibilities to the State and to the citizens impose upon Ministers.</P>
    <P>An attempt has been made continuously&mdash;principally by those who have not been at the Civil Service Representative Council&mdash;to belittle the value of the council to the Civil Service.  We have been told by Deputy Lavery that it was unfair that the Civil Service had not even a medium for expressing their grievances or putting them before the Government.  I have said that the Civil Service Representative Council could not come to binding decisions but, if they could not arrive at a decision, a full report of the proceedings was submitted to the Minister for Finance.  That report was in terms <Col N="1842" /> agreed upon by the official side of the council and the staff side.  I may say that, in later years, a verbatim report of the proceedings was taken and that this report was also available to me in my consideration of the matters which had been discussed by the council. Speaking for myself&mdash;I cannot speak for any other person&mdash;I may say that I regarded it as one of my first obligations as Minister for Finance to study these minutes very carefully and in regard to the matters dealt with therein to come to a decision upon the merits as disclosed in these extensive reports. That machinery for the discussion of Civil Service matters between the heads of Departments, on the one hand, and representatives of the staffs, on the other, remains in existence for those who desire to avail of it, and it was in fact, I may say, invoked in 1935.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I must refer before I sit down, and I am referring to it now lest I may, by reason of the lapse of time, be prevented from mentioning it.  It will be remembered that when the Fianna Fáil Government took office I set up a Commission of Inquiry into Civil Service problems.  I set it up in order that the introduction of arbitration might not be unduly deferred by the fact that the Government had also to deal with more urgent and, if I may say so, from the point of view of this country and of the people, more important problems than that of arbitration in the Civil Service.  The Commission of Inquiry was set up in June of 1932, and amongst its terms of reference was a request to report upon &ldquo;methods by which arbitration can best be applied for the settlement of questions relating to pay and other conditions of service.&rdquo;  In my letter of appointment to the members of the commission I notified them individually that the commission was expected to consider first and to submit an interim report on that part of the terms of reference relating to the application of the principle of arbitration already accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>This commission and its members have been subjected to unwarranted attacks in this House and elsewhere. Now I want to emphasise that when <Col N="1843" /> the commission was set up to report upon the methods by which arbitration could best be applied for the settlement of questions relating to pay and other conditions of service, and when its members were informed that the application of arbitration for this purpose had already been accepted in principle by the Government, no objection was taken to the course proposed by the members, or by those who professed to speak for the members, of the Civil Service.  It was recognised by them, as it was recognised by us, that this question of arbitration was a difficult one, that, as I have already been at pains to demonstrate to the House, there was no cut-and-dried scheme of arbitration, that indeed there was no scheme of arbitration which was obviously suitable to the conditions of our Civil Service. Even the scheme of arbitration which we are told the English civil servants enjoy is one which was hastily improvised during the War period in 1915, when machinery which was intended to prevent industrial disputes was applied to quite a different purpose. That machinery, I may say, in Great Britain is proving itself to be unsuitable even from the point of view of civil servants who are now demanding that this arbitration board of theirs should be set up by statute. When it does come to be set up by statute, I will tell the civil servants, and those who are speaking here and demanding that the British procedure should be applied here, that there will be written into it, and there must of necessity be written into it, the same limitations as we have found essential and as have been in practice imposed upon the operation of arbitration in the British Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I was saying that when this Commission of Inquiry was first set up even the staffs recognised that the matter for investigation was a difficult one and that it was desirable that their views in regard to the proposal should be ascertained and considered.  The commission was attacked on Wednesday last because of the time which elapsed between the setting up and the preparation of this report.  For that delay the <Col N="1844" /> staffs themselves were in great part responsible.  The commission was set up in June, 1932, and it was only, I think, at the end of March, 1933, that the last of the staff memoranda relating to arbitration was submitted to the commission.  The commission sat. Naturally, the members of the commission, who were giving their services voluntarily, had other concerns and other interests, and the summer holidays came.  In any event, the commission, to which the staffs had only furnished their final memoranda on the 31st March, 1933, presented its report to me in the February of 1934.</P>
    <P>As I said, the commission has been attacked many times since the publication of this report.  But, leaving the pronouncements of Deputy Norton, which in matters of this sort are <i>sui generis</i>, out of consideration, I have never heard a more unjustifiable attack upon any body of publicspirited citizens than was launched against the members of this commission by Deputy Costello in the course of his speech moving this motion.  Might I direct your attention to it?  The reference is Volume 70, col. 1202:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That report came as a complete disappointment and disillusionment to the Civil Service because, while it pointed out that, apparently, the Government had accepted the principle of arbitration, that did not prevent the members of the commission from really torpedoing the whole principle of arbitration for the Civil Service, for the reasons they purported to set forth in the interim report, and they accordingly set themselves out really to nullify the entire principle of effective arbitration for the Civil Service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was there ever a serious charge levied more light-headedly?  I have pointed out to the House that the terms of reference of this commission gave an explicit direction to it to ascertain the methods by which arbitration can best be applied for the settlement of questions relating to Civil Service pay and other conditions of service.  I have told the House that I wrote individually to the members of the commission telling them <Col N="1845" /> that the Government had accepted arbitration in principle.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have wearied the House by pointing out at length that the element of compulsion is not an essential factor in any arbitration scheme; that, in fact, all over the world you have in one country and another schemes which make a reference to the arbitration tribunal a matter of agreement between the parties concerned, and that you have other countries where the award of the tribunal is not of compulsory application.  That is the position in Great Britain.  The Brennan Commission which went voluntarily into this matter, and which had before it the views of the staffs and other people, devoted not merely a few minutes to glancing through a brief, but, as investigators requested to examine the problem and make an authoritative report to the Government upon it, but spent from March, 1933, to February, 1934, investigating the question.  The conclusion which the great majority of the commission arrived at was that if the Government was going to set up an arbitration scheme it would have to provide, first of all, that matters could only go to the arbitration tribunal when both parties were agreed that they were properly arbitrable; and secondly, that because of the constitutional position here, the awards should not be made of compulsory application&mdash;two conditions which are found in many arbitration schemes the world over. Yet, because the majority of the members of the commission, having voluntarily spent, as I said, 11 months of their valuable time, presented me with a report which provided for these conditions, which are, I emphasise, of very general application, Deputy Costello comes in here and accuses them of nothing less than a breach of good faith.  Those people were told that the principle of arbitration had been accepted, and were set up to advise as to how that principle could best be applied; yet, according to Deputy Costello, &ldquo;that did not prevent the members of the commission from really torpedoing the whole principle of arbitration for the Civil Service, and they accordingly set themselves out really <Col N="1846" /> to nullify the entire principle of effective arbitration for the Civil Service.&rdquo; That is a very serious charge to make against any body of men.  I think it will be admitted that it becomes more serious when the circumstances under which it was levelled are taken into consideration.  It was made by a Deputy who held a responsible position under a former Administration; who was one of the chief law officers, and who possibly may, in the ordinary course of time and circumstances, eventually occupy a high judicial position in this country.  I say that this charge, by reason of the circumstances in which it was uttered, becomes of very serious importance, indeed.  I think that there has been too much of this sort of thing going on in regard to this arbitration controversy.  I know that Deputy Norton started it, but Deputy Norton has not a very high standing in those matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But let us consider what is this commission which has been attacked in such terms by Deputy Costello.  Of whom did it consist? First of all there was Mr. Joseph Brennan, the late Secretary of the Department of Finance, the late Chairman of the Civil Service Representative Council, and present Chairman of the Currency Commission&mdash;a high public servant, with no axe to grind, and with no interest but the public interest to serve.  Who else?  The Reverend J. E. Canavan, of the Society of Jesus, who has shown great interest in the matter of arbitration in the Civil Service as an advocate of the staffs claims, and an authority on social questions&mdash;and he is charged with having endeavoured to torpedo this principle of arbitration.  Then we have Mr. James R. Coade, former Managing Director of Messrs. Cantrell and Cochrane, Ltd.; Mr. T. Condron Flinn, a member of a large accounting firm with wide experience of commercial concerns; <Col N="1847" /> Mr. A. M. Fullerton, former Secretary of the Valuation Office; Reverend Brother J. S. Galvin, M.A., a noted authority on education; Lord Glenavy, former Secretary to the Department of Industry and Commerce, bank director, director of large business concerns, and Barrister-at-Law; Professor Joseph Johnston, M. A., Trinity College, Dublin; Senator Sir J. Keane, Barrister-at-Law, and Director of the Bank of Ireland; Professor William Magennis, M. A., Barrister-at-Law, ex-Fellow, Royal University of Ireland, Professor of Metaphysics, University College, Dublin, and member of the Senate, National University of Ireland; Mr. John J. O'Leary, Managing Director of Messrs. Cahill and Company, printers, and Miss Nelly Ryan, county councillor, with experience of the administration of local bodies.  Those citizens of high reputation and prestige have been accused here in this House by the former Attorney-General with having, in betrayal of the trust reposed in them by the Government deliberately set themselves out to torpedo the proposal of applying the principle of arbitration to the Civil Service.  I think that charge was unjustifiable, and should not in any circumstances be stood over. I hope that Deputy Costello when replying will, with full advertence to the positions of trust which those people occupy, at any rate have the good grace to apologise for what was, I think, an unwarranted reflection upon them.</P>

      <P>Well, I suppose, Sir, Deputy Heron's somewhat peculiar views about the position of the Executive in regard to finance and in regard to the Civil Service will wait another day.  Before I sit down, however, I just want to say this: that the attitude of the Civil Service organisations on this matter has been the cause of very great regret to me, personally, and to the Government.  As I have <Col N="1849" /> indicated already, we believe that the scheme of conciliation and arbitration we have proposed is a reasonable one and that, in its main principles, it goes as far to meet the claims of the Civil Service as we can go consistently with our duty to the Dáil and to the taxpayers. I have pointed out already to the House our grounds for that belief. If the Service is prepared to work our scheme in the spirit in which we offered it and intended it, we are still prepared to proceed with our proposals to set up an arbitration board to which, with our agreement, Civil Service disputes may be referred. Furthermore, we are willing to consider sympathetically any case which may be made for the amendment of the scheme which we have submitted, in such of its details, as do not touch the essential principles&mdash;such as that which Deputy Cosgrave stated in 1924 when he said: &ldquo;It is not right that Ministers should divest themselves of their powers and responsibilities by leaving it to such bodies&rdquo;&mdash;he was talking then about the Whitley Councils&mdash;&ldquo;by leaving it to such bodies to say what salaries will be payable in the Civil Service or not.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That, Sir, has been our attitude all along.  From the beginning, we have been ready to give full consideration to any suggestion for the improvement of the scheme which might be made by the Civil Service organisations, and the present <i>impasse</i> has arisen because the organisations refused to submit the detailed observations for which they were asked.  In order, however, that the <Col N="1850" /> Service may have every opportunity of ascertaining directly our views as to the way in which the machinery which we are willing to set up will be operated, I am prepared to arrange for a discussion to take place between a small group of civil servants, representative of the organisations which are entitled to participate in the deliberations of the Civil Service Representative Council, on the one hand, and a group of civil servants appointed by me on the other.  I should like to point out that that does not exclude civil servants who are representative of any substantial body or grade in the Civil Service and that, therefore, no interest need be overlooked in this discussion. I want to say furthermore, that the discussion which I envisage can be a full and frank discussion.  If it results in suggestions which can be accepted without departing from the fundamental principles on which our arbitration proposals are based, I am prepared to consider such representations very sympathetically indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I suppose that we may as well keep our eyes open to what is a commonplace of human experience, and that is that no matter what scheme is proposed it is not going to satisfy everybody. Even a scheme which we might introduce, after having heard the representations of representatives of the Civil Service, may have deficiencies and may have defects.  I can only say this: that we have drafted our proposals with the honest intention of making those proposals work&mdash;of trying, if we can, to find some way of getting a third opinion upon the very vexed questions in relation to pay and allowances which arise from time to time in the Civil Service. I should like, if I could, to relieve my Department of some part of the strain which these demands and these disputes and differences often impose upon it, and, therefore, as I say, I would quite spontaneously welcome the opinion of a third party.  I am prepared, within the limits which I feel bind me, as I have said, to try to apply the principle of arbitration in these matters.  We have drafted a Bill which, I think, does provide effective machinery-machinery which will operate.  It rests, as I have already indicated, with the civil servants to say <Col N="1851" /> whether they are prepared to accept that machinery in the spirit in which it is offered, and to operate it as it might have been operated here since 1935, or whether they are going to spend further long years in trying to compel this Government to give what it cannot concede and what I believe no other Government would find itself able to do or would find itself willing to do: that is to be abandon what Deputy Cosgrave held to be, and what, I think <Col N="1852" /> is the overriding principle in this matter, to wit, that no Government can divest itself of its duties and responsibilities to keep control over the public purse and thereby over the public service.</P>
