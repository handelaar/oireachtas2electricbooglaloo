    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the late Mr. Daniel Egan was appointed as acting secretary to the South Cork County Board of Public Assistance on the 20th January, 1925, at a salary which was to be determined later; if he is aware that such salary was fixed in February, 1926, at £750 (£500 board of assistance and £250 board of health) plus certain emoluments amounting to £190, and that this salary was only sanctioned in February, 1928, from which date Mr. Egan received the salary agreed on in 1926; if the Minister is aware that the amount due to him in respect of the period from the date he took up office to the 14th March, 1928, is £443, and if the Minister will state why, despite the expressed wish of the local authority concerned, sanction has not been given for the payment of this sum to the representatives of the late Mr. Egan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative except that the salary fixed was not a salary which was to be determined later but the salary the late Mr. Egan was then receiving from the board of public assistance. As regards the second part of the question the reply is in the negative. On the abolition of rural district councils Mr. Egan who was Assistant Clerk to the Cork Rural District Council at a salary of £210 a year, <Col N="1054" /> with bonus of £99 2s. &mdash; was retained as secretary to the Southern Committee of the Cork County Board of Health but the committee decided to discontinue the bonus of £99 2s. a year.  At that time Mr. Egan held the post of Superintendent Registrar of births, deaths and marriages and his total income from all sources was, approximately, £700 a year.  As regards the third part of the question the answer is also in the negative.  As regards the concluding portion of the question the inclusive remuneration of Mr. Egan fixed at £940 per annum in 1928 was not retrospective to 1925. In fact a request for its retrospective application was definitely refused at the time.  The matter cannot now be reopened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. O'Neill)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the charges for quarterly and half-yearly licences for motor cars are excessive when compared with the full year charges; and if, seeing that a large number of motorists are unable to meet the cost of a full year's licence, he will reduce the quarterly and half-yearly charges to a more reasonable level so as to accommodate such persons as hackney car owners and lorry owners whose sole living is derived from driving their own vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. It is not proposed to reduce the charges on quarterly and part-yearly licences as these charges are not unreasonable, having regard to the concession entailed in granting licences quarterly or part-yearly.</P>

One proposal which was the subject of negotiation with my Department over a long period and which I had hoped would be in this area did not materialise mainly, if not altogether, on technical grounds.  The establishment of a steel rolling mill is being carried out with my approval and assistance at Haulbowline, and this industry is the beginning at least of new employment in the area.  The establishment of an industry is, in the first place, a matter for private enterprise, but I am prepared, if any such proposal is submitted to me, to give every help within the limits of my power.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the bridge referred to in the Deputy's question has been in a dilapidated condition, and abandoned for vehicular traffic for many years past.  Further, that, when the Land Commission divided the Ventry estate, to which the bridge was formerly an approach, they constructed a new road in the most suitable position for the general convenience of the farmers concerned. The new road is now maintained by the county council, and is also used by children and others having business at Colaiste Ide, Burnham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> The distance saved by reopening the disused bridge would be relatively small, and the public utility of the work would not appear to justify the very considerable expenditure involved. It is not, therefore, proposed to allocate public moneys towards the proposed work.</P>

      <P>An application for a grant to build a protection wall at Ventry has been received, and an inspection has been duly carried out. From the inspector's report it is clear that, apart from the question of the county road; the degree of public utility to be obtained from the work is incommensurate with the expenditure involved, and the application has accordingly been classified as unsuitable for execution as a minor employment scheme.  The question of the protection of the county road appears to be one for the attention of the responsible local authority.</P>

The London University Board's regulations require not only that the Government should give its consent to the holding of the examination in Eire but also that it should take full responsibility for the conduct of these centres, the provision of accommodation, superintendence, etc. It is the question of taking responsibility for these matters and of defraying the cost involved therein, rather than the obtaining of the consent mentioned, that has so far prevented the establishment of centres here for these examinations.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 36) Order, 1937, made on the 5th day of November, 1937, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Acts, 1934 and 1937.</P>
      <P>This quota order relates to laminated springs and the component parts of laminated springs.  Formerly an ad valorem duty of 33? per cent. operated upon these articles.  But for obvious reasons it was found that the protection desired to be afforded to the manufacturers of these articles in this country could not be effectively given by way of customs duties.  These springs, which are imported by motor car assemblers, are invoiced at a price far below the prices at which they can be normally purchased.  Furthermore, the cost of the spring forms a very small part of the price of the vehicle into which the spring is built.  For this and other reasons, it was decided to afford protection to the manufacturers of these articles in this country, and, consequently, this quota order was made under the Control of Imports Acts.  The imports of laminated springs have been reduced considerably, and it is contemplated that in due course these imports can be eliminated altogether.  I think that none of the motor car assemblers, and the same applies to other users, has any difficulty in procuring supplies of Irish manufactured springs in adequate quantities.</P>

      <P>I have noticed in the public Press that some difficulty arose in connection with the people who are assembling Morris cars, and that difficulty was in connection with the springs.  They felt that the spring available from the Irish manufacturer would not fit in with the spring of the Morris car, and I understand one firm of assemblers went so far as to close down their factory until such time as these springs could be had from England or until they could be manufactured here.  I would like if the Minister would give an assurance to the House that if it proves impracticable to make in this country laminated springs suitable to the Morris car, that he will give the assemblers of the Morris car the right to bring in whatever springs are necessary in order to make practicable the assembling of the Morris cars in this country.  I do not know if this firm will succeed in producing the kind of laminated springs that are required, but in the event of their finding themselves unable to produce them anywhere but in Cowley, Oxford, I want to know what steps the Minister will take or what he will do to maintain a supply of suitable springs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that the difficulties which the proprietors of that firm of assemblers stated existed did in fact exist only in their own imaginations.  I understand the whole matter was only a display of childish pique arising from a dispute between a member of that firm and a director of the firm making the springs.  There is no difficulty about producing in this country springs of a suitable kind, and this is borne out by the fact that another manufacturer who assembles large quantities of another type of Morris car advertises that they are themselves making these springs.  The particular firm to which the Deputy refers is proceeding to establish a factory of its own for the manufacture of these springs.  I understand they will soon be in production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give that undertaking.  There is no difficulty in the manufacture of laminated springs here.  In fact the announcement made by this firm that they propose to make them themselves is proof of that.  The difficulty related to the guarantee which they gave as to the wearing qualities of their vehicles.  The laminated springs of the design required for these cars have been produced here and have been incorporated in these cars, and that continued to some extent until circumstances arose which induced that firm to take up a position of refusing to take the springs that were available and deciding to manufacture their own.  The particular circumstance which they alleged was based on the fact that the allocation of the quota was based upon a set formula relating to their imports over a set period and that the quota was not sufficient to meet the requirements of this firm until they had their own factory established and producing. But there would be no difficulty in procuring the springs from a firm which had been manufacturing the springs had they wished to purchase from that firm.  Their failure to purchase was due not to the fact that the springs were not suitable or that they were not produced in a proper manner. I understand there was some question as to whether the seller of the springs should go to the motor car assembler or that the motor assembler should go to the seller of the springs.  It was rather a childish business altogether.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 37) Order, 1937, made on the 12th day of November, 1937, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Acts, 1934 and 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This quota order relates to women's and girls' hats and caps.  The manufacture <Col N="1082" /> of women's hats upon a large scale undertaking has been started by a firm which has established a temporary factory at Galway and is at present constructing a permanent factory in that town.  The imports of these hats were liable to an ad valorem customs duty of 25 per cent.  But it soon became evident that the customs duty was having no effect upon imports. It is extremely improbable that any customs duty would be effective in relation to any commodity such as these where established connections between distributors and manufacturing firms are so strong, and where the sale value of the advertisement that the hats were designed in Paris is probably worth anything from 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. increase in price.  The quota order was made in order to ensure that the products of the Galway factory would have a fair chance.  In fact, as a result of the conference between the wholesale firms, the distributors and manufacturers held in my Department, a satisfactory arrangement now exists for taking up the distribution of the products of the firm concerned.  These arrangements are working quite satisfactorily. There is a very wide variety of hats being produced at Galway. There are 400 different models being produced and they vary considerably as to colour and charm.  The variety of the hats produced there runs into several thousands.</P>
    <P>Everybody who has mentioned the matter has spoken favourably of the quality of the hats produced, and, in fact, distributing firms who have been taking supplies, have found little difficulty in disposing of them.  The quota order for the first quota period, which expires at the end of this month, was very considerable and permitted importation during that period of 270,000 of these articles.  The quantity to be imported will, of course, be reduced from time to time, but unless there is a substantial expansion in manufacture, beyond the extent contemplated by this firm, some considerable importation of the goods will still be required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to divide the House on this quota order, because I think it is peculiarly indefensible.  We <Col N="1083" /> have got to make up our minds in this country sooner or later whether we want to have the whole population dragooned, as people are at present being dragooned in countries like Germany, Italy and Russia.  If we want to do that, we ought to do it with our eyes open.  Now, a decent standard of living for our people ought to include the right amongst women to dress themselves in what they consider to be a reasonably fashionable and attractive manner.  To suggest that the factory in Galway can produce millinery which would meet the requirements of any people living up to a reasonably high standard of living, under modern conditions, is grotesque. I say that a quota, the result of which means that every woman in this country must go round dressed in a &ldquo;caubeen&rdquo; is outrageous.  It is absurd to say that the quota was rendered necessary by the established connection between retail milliners and manufacturers abroad being so strong, or that the sale value of saying that a hat was made in Paris was, in itself, sufficient to outweigh any tariff that was imposed. Neither of these things is correct.  The fact of it is that if you are going to drive the women of this country to the choice of wearing a felt hat produced in Galway, or wearing no hat at all, they will not wear hats.  They will give up wearing hats.  You will simply wipe out the millinery trade altogether.  That, I know, is a source of amusement to a number of people in comfortable jobs but if they were living out of the millinery business, as numbers of women in this country and in this city are, it would not amuse them. It means that these people will have to go on the dole, and on the dole they will go.  We are told that they are the eggs that require to be broken in order to make omelettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says discussions have taken place between the millinery wholesalers and the manufacturers, and that they are quite quiescent in the plans he has in mind by which there will be a substantial reduction in imports of ladies' millinery.  No wholesaler is engaged in the really fashionable millinery trade.  They never have <Col N="1084" /> engaged in it.  The really fashionable millinery trade is conducted entirely as between the retailer and the manufacturer.</P>
    <P>The millinery wholesalers in this country, as in every other country, have dealt with what has been known as the bread and butter section of the trade, which is a rapidly diminishing section of the trade.  Fifteen or 20 years ago the very large bulk of medium-priced and cheap felt millinery was sold in rural Ireland. That has stopped.  That cheap felt millinery is no longer sold, because the women have given up wearing it.  The bulk of the millinery coming into this country at present is of a fashionable character, catering for a fashionable trade.  It is a trade in which a very considerable number of people were profitably employed.  It was a trade in which a number of people made a good living, because the margin of profit was good.  A woman wanting a fashionable hat was prepared to pay a fancy price, and one was able to get a very decent profit out of that trade.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that people who have built themselves up a little business in the trade of selling millinery are as well entitled to their living as we are.  This quota order is going to wipe them out.  I consider that the women of this country are as well entitled to be fashionably and smartly dressed as the women of any other country.  The ultimate object of this quota order is to restrict fashionable millinery to the people who can afford to go up to Belfast or over to England to buy it.  I regard that as a highly undesirable and grossly unjust arrangement. There are many people who regard it as somewhat ludicrous to argue the case at all in Dáil Eireann about the right of women to wear fashionable clothes, but I think it is a very important matter.  I think it relates to the standard of living our people enjoy, and I do not think they should be lightly deprived of that standard of living.  Why should people in this country be condemned to wear clothes which would make them conspicuous in any well-dressed company? The only reason vouchsafed by the Minister is that, in the sacred cause of <Col N="1085" /> economic self-sufficiency, he is determined that they are going to wear Galway hats or none at all.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the Minister is acquainted with the millinery trade.  He ought to know something about it, because he was engaged in the general drapery trade himself, as I am, before he entered public life, but it sometimes appears to me that the Minister has forgotten all he ever learned before he became a politician, and has accepted the Departmental viewpoint on every subject.  We are told by the Minister to-day that there are 400 different models being manufactured in Galway in various colours and trimmings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>A thousand different colours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I often heard of all the colours in the rainbow, but that goes even further.  I do not think you could get 1,000 colours in any factory whatever. Deputy Killilea is mistaken in trying to overstate his own case, because rainbows, even in Galway, will not hold 1,000 colours.  We are told by the Minister to-day that there are 400 different models in various colours and trimmings.  The House will immediately perceive the absurdity of the situation which arises out of that declaration.  You have 400 models.  My information is that the range of colours in Galway is between 12 and 20.  Let us assume that the range of colours is 15.  I suppose that each of these 400 models will be available in about 15 colours.  That would give about 60,000 hats, on the assumption that you have one hat of each colour for each model. Presumably, you make about 12 hats from each of these, which suggests that you have about 760,000 felt hats in Galway for this season.  Every one of these hats will be worthless in three months' time.  If I had that stock of hats in my millinery department on the 1st March, I would reduce them all down 50 per cent., and on the 1st November I would take off another 50 per cent., and if they were not sold before Christmas this year, I would give them away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any millinery shop will tell you the same thing &mdash; that the hat that you <Col N="1086" /> buy for the winter season 1937-38, if it is not disposed of at a sacrifice before the following Christmas, is simply thrown out.  It is no good, because by that time fashions have changed and, if a woman went out in that hat, the people would turn round and look at her.  Have any Deputies ever taken up a picture of a woman dressed in the attire of ten years ago? Has any Deputy ever got a picture paper and looked at what was highly fashionable ten years ago?  If a person walked down the street to-day in what was the height of fashion ten years ago, she would start a riot.  I make no disguise of the fact that I am a country shopkeeper.  It is my job to know these things.  I would not know them but for the fact that I make my living out of operating a shop.</P>
    <P>Into this highly technical trade the Minister and two or three permanent officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce come waltzing.  There is not a single one of them who would be trusted by his wife to buy her anything, much less a hat, but they are prepared to determine now not only what hats their wives will wear, but what hats other women in this country will wear.  They are going to tell them: &ldquo;You must be satisfied; we have provided 400 different models of various colours.  It means, in effect, if the undertaking is to be carried out, that there will have to be 750,000 hats in Galway, and if you do not buy them now, you will have to buy them sometime.&rdquo; Three quarters of a million hats would represent, I suppose, the consumption of women's felt hats in this country for the next five years at least, if not for more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>During the last three months, which was the winter, and <Col N="1087" /> during the remaining three months no hats will be imported at all, for the reason that you do not sell felt hats to ladies in the middle of August. Did the Minister ever hear of an article called straw?  Any of the 250,000 not sold now are reduced 50 per cent., and this day 12 months will be thrown out on the ashpit.  At the moment when 250,000 hats have been brought in to supply the entire requirements of Ireland, 750,000 have been assembled in Galway and the people are going to take them and like them.  If they do not take them, the quota will be reduced until they must either take them or go bareheaded. Deputies, when they take their wives abroad for a Christmas holiday either to Blackpool or to Paris with Galway hats on them, two years hence, need not express any surprise if they require mounted police to get them through the streets, because the people will think that they have taken something out of Madame Tussauds.  That really is ludicrous and arises from the situation of a group of wholly untrained persons romping into a highly technical trade to achieve the impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot make in this country or in any other country all the felt hats that the entire community want, particularly when concerned with women's wear.  The very essence of the millinery trade is variety; the very essence of the trade is the pleasing of highly individualistic tastes.  If you fail in that, what is going to happen is that the people will give up using the commodity altogether.  They will simply wear tam-'o-shanters and they are already doing that very largely.  One of the reasons why the felt millinery trade, to which I referred earlier, has diminished so much in the last ten years is that women went over very largely to wearing what are called berets.  It tickles the fancy of Deputies for anybody to talk of the technical side of the millinery trade.  But we are at the present moment going rigidly to fix the entire millinery trade by legislation, and every Deputy <Col N="1088" /> thinks that there is something incongruous and almost improper in going into the technical side of the business. I am inclined to agree with him.  But, if it seems incongruous to go into the technical aspect of the business, why not leave it alone?  I think we would be very well advised to leave it alone. I do not think Deputies are qualified to poke their noses into this business at all.  They know nothing about it. It is a matter of grave concern materially to reduce the standard of living of the women of the country. I think women are entitled to attach considerable importance to the matter of making themselves look smart by buying the kind of hats they like to wear and by putting up a good show so far as general costume is concerned. That is an important matter which should concern the House before they adopt a resolution of this kind.</P>
    <P>But there is another far more important matter and that is the livelihood of the people who sell good millinery.  These people have built up good businesses.  They are making a nice living out of them.  They have families to support and they are living in a modest degree of comfort.  They have created all that by their own unaided efforts in the past, and we are going to blunder into that whole business and wreck a number of these people and wipe their business out. I think that is wrong.  I think you have no right to go into a person's house and wipe him clean out of existence and put him out on the road as a pauper unless some overwhelming social good requires that his individual interest should be sacrificed.  Even in that event you should go to the limit to try and help him over the difficult period and get him on his feet again in a similar calling.</P>
    <P>I have seen too much of this happening in the past five years.  I have seen commercial travellers, respectable married men, who always presented a cheerful and reasonably prosperous exterior, who had families going to nice schools, and who were getting on in the world.  They had no reason to believe that they were doing wrong or <Col N="1089" /> doing anything contrary to public policy.  Yet, overnight these men were simply kicked out on the side of the road and told that the product they had been distributing could no longer be imported and their services were no longer required.  I have known men who had children in good schools who are to-day literally hungry.  Of course, these individual cases mean nothing because they have no one to speak for them.  Nobody cares very much about them.  But the suffering in these families is ghastly, to my mind.  Now, I admit that you cannot hold up the whole of Government policy if you are going to incommode one individual, but you ought to have a full realisation of the measure of real suffering, distinct from inconvenience, which a resolution of this character is likely to create.  This resolution is going to destroy the business of a large number of small business people in this country who have been well off in the past.  It is going to create a very undesirable restriction on the standard of living of women in this country, and in exchange it is going to establish, I believe only temporarily, in Galway a factory which cannot in the nature of the trade enjoy a permanent success.  I would be glad to think it would, but I am as certain as I am standing here, with the limited knowledge I have of the millinery trade, that the thing cannot possibly enjoy a permanent measure of success. Now, bear this in mind, that you are going to take the risk of establishing, by this ruthless method, an industry in Galway which I believe can serve no useful purpose to the community or the City of Galway, and in the process of establishing that you are going to wipe out a vast number of small milliners through the country, not the kind of milliner who makes her own millinery, but the kind of milliner who went to London, Paris or New York and brought home a select range of fashionable millinery. Once you have destroyed those people, broken their connection, and closed down their business, you cannot bring them back into existence overnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not deliberately try to make one another lose our tempers and then complain in your tied newspaper about the rude things said to one in the past.  The reason why the milliners to whom I refer cannot go to Galway &mdash; I say this for the information of the Deputy who asked the question &mdash; is this, that the very essence of their trade was that they gained amongst their clientele a reputation for discriminating purchases of millinery.  They would be people who would go around to all the fashion modistes of Paris, London and elsewhere, and pick up a hat here and there&mdash;hats of a very distinguished uniqueness.  It was as a result of their capacity and knowledge of where to go to get that class of millinery that they built up their business. Now, suppose you say, &ldquo;let them all go to Galway,&rdquo; the result is that all the big stores, all the ordinary shops, can simply write to Galway and ask to be supplied with one-twelfth of every hat they make in Galway.  They can then put in their windows every model of a hat that Galway is turning out, leaving the modiste, the small shopkeeper, who built up her business through her power of discrimination with no claim on public custom at all. Far from it, because under the new arrangement which Deputies envisage, the big shop can buy up the whole of the Galway range of hats by taking one-twelfth of every model that is made there.  The small business woman cannot do that because she knows very well that she would never be able to sell thousands of hats.  Her business consisted in selling a very restricted number of expensive hats to a restricted clientele on which she made a good profit, her clientele being such that it was able to pay for her discrimination in picking out a range of unique hats and assembling them in Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Profiteering means that you go to a person who has got to buy something from you, and you charge that person an unfair profit on that article.  He is in the position that he must pay your price or do without the article.  Now, no woman is bound to buy a Paris hat, and if she cannot afford it she ought not to buy it.  But, suppose she elects to buy a Paris hat, instead of spending a week in Parknasilla, has she not a perfect right to do so, and is it not part of the standard of living in this country, that a woman living here would have the same facility for doing that as if she went to live in England? Suppose, a working girl in Dublin makes up her mind that she would like to give up going to the pictures for a month, or some of the other luxuries that she has been in the habit of indulging, and instead invests her savings in a fashionable hat, is she not entitled to do it?  This will deny that working girl that right, and in addition to that, and what is much more serious than that, it is going to deprive the milliner to whom I have referred of her means of livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you want to do that, do it with your eyes open.  I say it is wrong, and what I apprehend is that Deputies of this House have got the idea that they are going to establish a grand new industry in Galway, that it is going to be eminently profitable, and that it is going to give splendid employment when, in fact, what it is going to do is: it is going to employ a very limited number of women in Galway in an industry which I do not believe can possibly survive for long, and you are going to put out of employment dozens of persons who have built up their own <Col N="1092" /> business in the distribution of this particular commodity, people who, when once put out of business, this House will be unable to put them back again into business, even if the Galway venture should fail.</P>
    <P>Surely that is a short-sighted policy. Who is going to get advantage from it?  Who is going to be helped by it? In my judgment, nobody, and the difficulty that I find myself in is this, that I cannot clear my mind of the suspicion that a great many Deputies of this House feel that this is simply making a mountain out of a mole-hill. It is not for many individuals these restrictions are going to mean&mdash;mind you, these restrictions have been in operation for some time, and the Minister has announced that it is his intention to intensify them in the future&mdash;jeopardising their whole existence and destroying a perfectly legitimate business that yielded a good livelihood to a very small number of <i>entrepreneurs</i> all over the country.  I think that is wrong, and I think that this quota proposal in regard to hats is equally unsound and bad.  I propose to divide the House on the question in the earnest hope that this quota business may be brought to an end, and that normal conditions may be restored.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has been talking through his hat.  It is, of course, natural enough for him to assume, as he always assumes, that any product from an Irish factory must necessarily be inferior to the imported product, and that any hat made in this country must necessarily come within the description he has given of &ldquo;a caubeen.&rdquo; The Deputy cannot conceive the idea of an Irish-made article being as good as an imported article.  Deputy Dillon has given evidence before of his complete inability to conceive the possibility of our manufactures being any good.  He has done so again to-day, but he has done it to-day not merely on a sort of general basis, but because of his extraordinary ignorance of a trade in which he professes to be an expert. I told him that 750,000 was six months' supply.  He said it was four years' supply.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The imports amounted to 1,300,000 in 1936, and were the same in 1935.  The Galway firm can produce 2,000 a day now, and a rough calculation makes that 750,000 a year.  That is six months' supply.</P>

      <P>In due course they will manufacture in Galway the felt and other materials from which the hats are made.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And now he must try to cover himself up.  There has been established in Galway an industry for the manufacture of hats.  I invite any Deputy to go to anyone who claims to be an expert in the sale of this type of goods, wholesale or retail, to see if they can produce a single individual of that character who will not pay a tribute to the quality and to the up-to-date designs and general turn-out of the Galway products.  In any event, <Col N="1094" /> the quota only reduces imports by 25 per cent.  Those women who want to buy the exclusive products of Paris, Berlin or Tokyo, where most of these things come from under the quota order, can continue to do so, as there will be imported in the year not less than 500,000 or 600,000 hats.  Even when the Galway factory is up to the maximum, 500,000 hats will be coming in, so that those who do not want Irish hats can continue to buy the products of sweated industries to which reference was made.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to find out what is precisely the attitude of the Party opposite towards industrial development in this country.  A member of that Party some minutes ago asked what was the Government going to do about establishing a factory in Mullingar. The Deputy has been agitating about the establishment of a factory in Clones.  If this factory was established in Clones, would the Deputy take the same attitude?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was established in Mullingar, what would the Deputy's attitude be?  Are the Galway Deputies in that Party going to vote against this motion?  The whole attitude of the Party opposite in relation to industry is hard to understand.  Are they against industrial development or not? On every occasion on which any proposal of any kind for the establishment of an industry comes before the Dáil, Deputy Dillon makes violent speeches against it, and his Party votes against it.  If there is any alternative by that Party, let them indicate it.  In fact, we have members from that Party not merely urging the establishment of industries in their constituencies, but actively assisting in doing so.  Some of them have been most useful people in formulating plans for industries, but when the plans come before the Dáil, Deputy Dillon leads his Party into the Lobby to vote against them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure him that not merely was the establishment of this industry the direct result of very active workdone by a local committee, but that on that local committee there were many, if not the majority, who are avowed supporters of the Deputy's Party.  Deputy Brodrick will bear me out in that.  They formulated the plans and they should have got some assurance in advance that their plans would not be opposed by any Party.  Certainly, if any members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party come to me in future with industrial plans, I will have to ask them to go to Merrion Square to get an assurance that the establishment of industries will not be opposed as Deputy Dillon has opposed this; that they will not be maligned and slandered by Deputy Dillon and others when it comes to a question of taking the vote.  I do not think there is anything more I need say on this matter.  The imposition of quantitative regulations of imports is necessary for the development of this industry. These quantitative regulations will permit of a substantial import of goods in future, but there will be available Irish manufacture of excellent quality and design, so that no one need be ashamed to appear wearing goods made by Irish workers, even when accompanied by Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>These will be as good and as up-to-date in design as the products of Paris.  There is a sufficient quota of other hats for those who require them.  On the general question as to the difference between an import quota and customs duty, I would like to say that I would not agree to impose an import quota unless I was satisfied that there was no alternative method of protection. I regard the Control of Imports Act as one only to be used to develop such an industry when it is necessary to overcome difficulties arising out of the circumstances in which business was carried on in the past, and the imposition of a different type of regulation to the customs duty involved.</P>

Quantitative regulations for imports have proved essential in relation to certain types of industries during the development stages and these industries could not be established here on the basis of the protection afforded in any other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a very sensitive man.  This amending Bill moves a step beyond the principal measure.  The Principal Act contained in it the decision to establish a cement industry in this country, and therefore that question does not arise for discussion now.  The amending Bill and this <Col N="1101" /> Financial Resolution were introduced by the Minister with the announcement that he intended to confer upon Cement Limited a monopoly of the cement trade in this country.  That is the point which I want to discuss with the Minister, objectively, so that we may make up our minds in this House and in the country what the Government's view is on the issue thus raised. I believe in the system of individual liberty, individual enterprise and capitalism, and it appears to me that certain industrialists in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to relate it particularly to the cement industry.  It appears to me that certain industrialists in this country are in the position of those whom the gods wished to destroy and first made mad, because they are co-operating with the Minister in the cement industry &mdash; and in others, but particularly in the cement industry &mdash; in establishing a monopoly in private hands for the supply of a commodity which is of virtual necessity to the consuming public in this country.  That thing may be done to-day, but my submission is that that interpretation of the doctrine of private property is calculated to make the doctrine of private property disreputable in the eyes of the people.  I would deplore it, but the difficulty in which I find myself is that, when there is a proposal for a monopoly of this character, and convinced socialists like Deputy O'Brien and Deputy Heron make the case that a monopoly of this kind should be in the hands of the Government, I have no answer.  They make the case that, if you have a monopoly, any profits derived from it should go to the Government, and be used by the Government either for the relief of taxation, if they believe in one type of socialism, or for the relief of the consumer by the reduction of the price of the commodity to a point which will yield no profit, if they believe in another type of State socialism.

      <P>On a point of order, I do not want to prevent Deputy Dillon from discussing the subject, but I think he should discuss it at an appropriate time.  There is nothing raised on this motion but the question of whether there should or should not be a licence fee charged on cement licences.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Minister's submission, the whole question of the Government policy on monopolies would, as suggested by the Minister, be more appropriately debated on one of the Estimates, particularly the Estimate for the office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The principle of this Bill was approved on Second Reading, as the Deputy is aware.  We are taking Nos. 7 and 8 together.  No. 8 does raise a rather wide question, the question of whether money should be granted for administering this Bill.  The Deputy is entitled to give reasons for or against, but his arguments should be directed to this Bill and not to the general question of Government policy on industrialisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the difficulty, but I want to be taken not as making a categorical assault upon Cement Limited <i>qua</i> Cement Limited.  I am invoking the case of Cement Limited as typical of a series of other cases of industries established on a certain basis with the approval and even the encouragement of the Government of the day.  If an individual <i>entrepreneur</i> asks for a limited tariff and announces his readiness to produce cement in this country in competition with foreign <Col N="1103" /> cement that has paid the tariff, or in competition with anybody else who chooses to establish the industry here, that man is giving the public the guarantee that he must produce cement of a quality and at a price which will represent better value than anything that was brought in from outside or that is manufactured here, and that if he fails to do that, the public can simply abstain from buying his commodity.  Now that man is practising individual enterprise under a reasonably controlled capitalist system.  If, however, a man comes forward and says: &ldquo;I will produce cement in Ireland on condition that nobody is allowed to bring in cement at all except me and that, in effect, nobody will be allowed to compete with me in the manufacture of cement,&rdquo; I cannot see what public service that man is giving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State is conferring on that group of individuals a most valuable concession for no consideration at all. The shareholders, the board of directors, of that company, are all eminently respectable men, all men who deserve well of the country by a long and honourable reputation in the country's commercial life, but their ordinary method of approach to this problem will be, as it has been, to issue capital which has been underwritten by the Government Industrial Trust Corporation.  Having issued the capital, the board of directors is appointed, and they employ technicians, a general manager, and labourers to build their factories and to manufacture the commodity, and they then exercise a general supervision over the enterprise thereafter, subject, according to the Minister, to the restrictions that will be put upon them by the Prices Controller.  What are they doing for the profits that they are going to make out of the industry? As far as I can see, they are doing nothing at all.  They are not competing with anybody else.  They are not holding out their product in competition with anybody else's product. What are they doing that the Government itself could not do?  As far as I can see, nothing.  If, instead of calling in this body of shareholders and <Col N="1104" /> this body of directors the Government employed the general manager and the technicians, built the factories and made the cement and sold it to the public authorities and the other consumers in this country, the Government would get the entire profit of the enterprise, which would run into a very substantial sum, being the profit on the sale of some 370,000 tons of cement per annum, and that could go to the relief of taxation or else to a reduction in the price of cement.</P>
    <P>I think that a plan whereunder the Government would engage in the industry is a bad plan, because I think the inevitable result of it is that, operating under those terms, the industry is going to run down in efficiency and competitiveness, and the commodity is going to go down in quality and probably to rise in price. Assuming, however, that, even with all these evils, any benefits that accrue would go to the Treasury, if you are going to put a group of private capitalists in that position of absolute independence, with no competition of any kind, I apprehend that very similar evils will manifest themselves, but the community will not have the compensating result that any profits that may turn up will go to the Treasury.  They will not.  If the enterprise is in the hands of private capitalists, any profits that accrue will go into their pockets.  So that the system of granting a monopoly for the production of an essential commodity such as cement to a group of private capitalists secures for us all the evils of both systems &mdash; all the evils of the capitalist system and all the evils of the socialist system &mdash; and deprives us of all the benefits of both systems, the capitalist system and the socialist system.  I just want the Minister to tell us quite objectively, why does he resort to that method.  The Minister will say, of course, that, while it is true that the enterprise is being left in the hands of a group of private capitalists, the Prices Controller and the Prices Commission will exercise a very careful watch over the whole enterprise; but I particularly ask the Minister to direct his attention to this point.  It <Col N="1105" /> is physically impossible for the Prices Controller to exercise the necessary control.  It is quite easy to regulate prices.  You can always tell a man to charge 40s. instead of 45s., and you can make him charge it, but you cannot control quality.  You cannot control quality, for two reasons.  The first reason is that the technical information requisite to arrive at certainty about any product is extremely difficult to get.  That is the first difficulty. Assuming, however, that you do get it and that you require the monopolist to raise his quality, he has got this reply.  He can come in to the Minister and say: &ldquo;To raise the quality of my product and to charge the price which you have forced me down to by a Prices Order means that I must close down the three cement factories, because we cannot carry on&rdquo;; whereupon the Minister is immediately in the dilemma that he has either got to abandon his whole plan of producing cement in Ireland, which would be very damaging to his prestige, or else to expropriate the monopolist, compensate him, and raise the price, which would also be damaging to his prestige.  What happens, in effect, is that the Minister reads, as he did in the case of the flour millers, the Prices Controller's report, where the Controller said that excess profits were certainly being made.  He heard the case of the millers and the dilemma which they propounded to him, and he simply sat back and said: &ldquo;For the time being in any case, that is an insoluble problem.&rdquo;  I wonder would the Minister tell us now, quite frankly, does he really mean to go in for State Socialism?  Has he really in the back of his head the belief that, if this monopoly system will not work, it is his intention to take over all these enterprises and have them run by the Government....</P>

      <P>Well, Sir, I do not press that point, but I do think it is vital, when we are actually voting money to bring this cement plan to its completion, that the Minister should tell us what contingencies he foresees in connection with this enterprise and what he proposes to do in certain eventualities. Suppose a time comes when the Minister is told that the prices will have to be fixed higher than he ever anticipated if the quality is to be maintained. What will he do in those circumstances? Will he say, &ldquo;I am going to open the ports.  I do not believe you; I do not believe you are playing square with me.  I will open the ports and, if it means closing your factories, close them.&rdquo;  Perhaps he will say, &ldquo;If you cannot do what I am advised it is possible for you to do, I will take over the factories and do it myself.&rdquo;  Which do you intend to do?  I think that is the whole kernel of this question.  Are we prudent or right in advancing money for the promotion of this business without having those issues clearly before our minds?  I am affording the Minister an opportunity in relation to this Portland cement industry, which is typical, of stating his view on the question of granting a monopoly to a group of individuals and indicating what measures he contemplates taking in the event of the maximum prices that his advisers consider reasonable proving unacceptable to the monopolists in this particular industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I see here that the word &ldquo;cement&rdquo; means Roman cement. I suppose Medina cement would also be included under that category. Apparently the cement industry is going to be established for the manufacture of ordinary cement.  There are certain cements outside that category and the Minister stated the other day that they would continue to pay the <Col N="1107" /> 5/- licence fee.  I suppose if they are manufactured in England they would pay a further 10 per cent. <i>ad valorum</i> duty.  I think the Minister ought to recognise that these other duties are frankly revenue-producing items; that under no possible stretch of the imagination can they be considered as protecting the industry.  I take it those connected with the cement industry have very properly stated what they are going to manufacture and what they are not going to manufacture.</P>
      <P>Of course, it does not make a huge lot of difference, because these special cements are a very small item in comparison with ordinary cement.  At the same time, I do not think the Minister should tax every single item connected with the provision of houses, every item which has to be brought into the country.  Ordinary cement is in a different category.  There are some specialised items which the cement company do not wish to manufacture, and I wish to register a protest at ordinary revenue being put on these items, for instance, on such an important item as the provision of houses, in which the cost bulks so large, especially considering that it has to be paid, in the case of a lot of houses, over a great series of years; in fact, going down to what we might describe as posterity.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon used, in relation to the proposals in this Bill, the term monopoly.  Most people instinctively react against that word. It conveys a condition of affairs which the public instinctively regard as bad. You can always arouse against any proposal a certain amount of opposition by attaching that word to it. That instinctive reaction is a carryover from an earlier period when the idea was prevalent that the greater amount of competition that prevailed in any business, the fewer the restrictions upon trade, and the larger the advantages which consumers and the public generally secured.  That is no longer true.  In quite a number of industries nothing like free competition exists.  It does not exist in the <Col N="1108" /> cement industry.  The choice which the Government had to take, and which the Dáil must take, is not between a monopoly for cement in the hands of Irish Cement Limited and free trade cement; it is a choice between one form of monopoly and another.</P>
      <P>There is a monopoly in cement, a monopoly which existed for some time past and which is completely watertight. If Deputy Dillon wants to buy some cement at the moment before Irish cement is available, he will have to buy it from a monopoly and pay a monopoly price, whatever that monopoly dictates.  He cannot go from one country to another and bargain off his order for the purpose of getting a reduced price, and buying it wherever he would get it cheapest. Even if he did get it cheaper, he would not be allowed to purchase it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain small cement producers outside the combine, but their imports are negligible.  A small quantity came from Spain and Poland, but that was not normal trade; it represented cement sent here for the purpose of establishing sterling credits.  There was no continuing business available, nor is it available. The cement at the moment sent into this country is supplied by the cement cartel.  The distribution is effected by a body called the Irish committee of the cement <i>cartel</i> and if anyone wants to do any business in relation to the importation of cement it is with that body he has to do it.  Let us consider the situation in the light of that fact. There are only two alternatives open. Either the Government, as such, sets out to establish a nationally owned and governmentally controlled cement manufacturing enterprise, or we get some private company to do the production for us.  In theory, there is something to be said for the Government owned and Government controlled business, but it is only in theory.  In practice it is not possible except under exceptional circumstances and in relation to an enterprise of a certain kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> We established here the sugar manufacturing industry as a semi-Government industry.  We could not have done it were it not for the fact that there was available an individual who was brought into the country by a private company, an individual who had acquired expert knowledge of the circumstances of this country, which he added to the expert knowledge he already possessed, and whose services were available to us.  When we established the sugar company and authorised and financed them to proceed with the establishment of additional factories, we were banking everything on our faith in that individual and the persons associated with him.  If we were to try to establish a cement or any other industry on that basis we would first have to find an individual concerning whom we would not have and could not have such personal knowledge as we had in the case of the individual to whom I have referred.</P>
    <P>It is a possible way of doing things. I have often considered it, but I have always considered it as a last resort, when no other way of establishing an industry which I wanted to see set up here was available to me, that is, going out and hiring a management and trusting that management to spend your money properly and to give the results which you think it should be possible to secure.  I do not think that is a good way of doing it, and I do not think that if we had followed that course in relation to a number of industries, we would ever have succeeded in getting them established properly.</P>
    <P>We went, therefore, on the alternative line, and Deputy Dillon must not misunderstand what that alternative line is, because in the case of cement it is clearly set out in a special Act relating to the cement industry. We let it be known that there was available to any person who satisfied us that he was entitled to get it a licence to manufacture cement, but a licence subject to very definite conditions which specified, not merely that the cement should conform to a definite <Col N="1110" /> standard of quality, but that it should be available at a certain fixed price and in certain fixed quantities.  This cement company is undoubtedly going to handle all the cement required by our people, but they are going to produce, and must produce, that cement subject to these conditions.  It must conform to a standard specification prepared by us which I have stated is higher than the British national standard; and it must be sold at a fixed price, a price which is fixed in relation to certain known factors&mdash;in this particular case, the cost of electricity, the price of coal and the standard wage fixed for the industry.  If any of these charges vary, if labour costs, electricity costs, or coal costs go up or down, the price of cement will go up or down; but not otherwise.</P>
    <P>The company must produce stated quantities, and no more and no less than the stated quantities; it must produce, furthermore, and sell that cement subject to the over-riding regulation that the amount to be distributed in dividends to its shareholders shall not exceed certain limits on the average. In these circumstances, we think we have got all the safeguards necessary to secure the efficiency of the enterprise, and we have these safeguards while, at the same time, the stimulus to improvement which exists in the case of private industry, and less in the case of Governmental enterprise, exists.  The company which is undertaking the manufacture of cement is an Irish company.  There are certain external expert interests associated with it, but the bulk of its capital has been raised in Ireland.  It was raised by public subscription through an issue of shares underwritten by the Industrial Credit Corporation.  However, all that matter was discussed and decided by the Dáil long before this.</P>
    <P>The question that arises on this Bill is whether in the very peculiar circumstances that will exist from now until the end of next year a certain arrangement for the importation of limited quantities of cement should or should not be made.  From next month, Irish cement will be available.  From the end of May, the two factories established <Col N="1111" /> by this company will be in full production and, consequently, the quantity of cement that must be imported will be a comparatively small part of our total requirements.  At the end of next year, even that importation will have disappeared, and all our cement will be produced here.  The only question which arises at the moment, the only thing with which this Bill is designed to deal, is the arrangement for the importation of that limited quantity of cement from now until the end of next year, an arrangement which will in fact cease to have any significance after the end of next year.</P>
    <P>There were two courses open to us. One was to take a number of cement importers and to say to them: &ldquo;We are going to reduce the quantity which each of you will import pro rata to the total reduction of imports which is necessary.&rdquo;  That course is quite feasible.  It is a course which in fact was adopted in relation to a number of other industries in respect of which quantitative regulation imports was applied, but in relation to some industries &mdash; the sugar industry is one and this is another &mdash; everybody is prepared to agree that that is not the best course.  In relation to the cement industry, it is obviously not the best course because we can arrange, under this system of giving a sole licence to a cement company, that we can buy that imported cement at a lower price than that at which any other person can get it. The arrangement which is contemplated involves the selling of all the cement to be imported at the same price as that at which Irish cement will be sold.  The price of Irish cement, as I have said, is fixed by the formula which relates to the particular charges I have referred to and the imported cement will be sold at that price.  It will be sold at that price irrespective of whether there is a licence fee, irrespective of whether various items that might affect the price of imported cement vary or not.</P>
    <P>The licence fee has been criticised in the past as an undesirable method of raising revenue for the Government and there was something to be <Col N="1112" /> said for that point of view, at least since the cartel closed in upon this market and the price of cement jumped up.  It jumped up considerably, not merely because the members of the cartel were in a position to regulate the price they were going to get for their cement, but also because the agents for these importers were able to regulate the commission which they got on the imports, and in fact increased that commission very considerably. That disappears from now on.  So far as imported cement is concerned, it is going to be sold at a fixed price, namely, the price at which Irish cement will be sold by Cement Limited.  In so far as we are retaining the licence fee, it does not alter the price of cement.  It does secure revenue for the Government, but if we abolish the licence fee, it will not reduce the price of cement, but it will mean profits for the agents, for the cement company as the importers and for the cartel of manufacturers.  It would mean no difference in the price of cement because, clearly, the limited quantity of imported cement that will come in must be sold, and will be sold inevitably at the same price as that fixed for Irish cement.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the arrangement which we contemplate ensures, firstly, an immediate reduction in the price of cement and as soon as this arrangement comes into operation the price of cement will come down because Irish cement will be available at a price lower than that now charged for imported cement on which this licence fee is payable; secondly, it ensures the least possible dislocation in existing trading organisations because the whole of the cement required by users in this country will continue to be distributed to these users through the existing channels, the channels through which they got imported cement in the past; and thirdly, it means that we can regulate, without any difficulty and without need for any elaborate machinery, the actual quantity of cement to come in.  If we were to try to regulate that quantity independently of the cement manufacturing company, we would obviously <Col N="1113" /> have considerable difficulty, because it is very difficult to determine accurately the total amount required in the whole country, and much more difficult to determine accurately the total amount required at particular centres.</P>
    <P>The original scheme, as Deputies are aware, contemplated the regulation not merely in the country as a whole but in particular districts, a much better system of achieving the same result as that which the Bill contemplates.  We have adequate safeguards to ensure that that licence cannot be abused and that the importing company cannot make 1d. profit out of handling that cement. If we decide in the interval to abolish that system and inaugurate a new system which would permit of the importing company to make a profit then that profit would go to effect an all-over reduction in price.  We do not contemplate that this circumstance will arise because the position has been carefully examined by all parties who are very definitely interested in this matter and it is possible to give a reasonable assurance that the position will develop on the lines I have set out and that cement will be sold at a fixed price without profit and the State shall continue to get this 5/- licence fee from cement without any additional expense to Irish consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You will observe, Sir, that Section 3 repeals sections of the Principal Act referred to in the sections of this Bill, and that includes Part V of the Principal Act <i>in toto.</i> The Principal Act contains one section which requires the Minister to publish in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> certain relevant facts relating to the licence conferred on the <i>entrepreneur</i> to manufacture cement and to import it.  That obligation is now removed and the Minister is no longer under an obligation to publish these particulars.  I want now to ask the Minister some questions so that he may have an opportunity of answering questions which he would have answered by the advertisement in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> if this section were not passed.  The first is a question of price.  It is true that cement has been controlled by a <i>cartel.</i>  I want to give the Minister an opportunity of denying something which I am not sure he will be in a position to deny.  Cement has gone up in the last two years by, I suppose, 15/- to 20/- a ton.  So far as I am aware the history of that increase in price is as follows:&mdash; The Minister began this system of levying a tariff on incoming cement by prescribing a licence fee.  He put on a 5/- nominal fee in order gradually to raise the price of cement so that when the Irish product came on the market, the shock to the consuming public would not be too great because at that time he foresaw that Irish manufactured cement would cost much more than the imported cement.  When he put on the first 5/- nothing untoward happened. But he then gave the signal that he intended to put on another 5/- at some stage with a view gradually to stepping up the price, whereupon the <i>cartel</i> intervened and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now, look here, if you are going to go and put on 5/- a ton, we ourselves will put on 5/-; why should the Irish Treasury collect this 5/-.  We are prepared to quote cheap cement in order to keep out Spanish and Polish cement to which the Minister referred; but if the Irish Government proposes to levy a general tariff of 5/- over and above what they are already levying, we will spare them the trouble.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> And they did.  Accordingly, they got word somewhere of the figure that was in the Minister's mind with regard to Irish cement and they stepped up the price of cement until they have reached a figure that they knew the Minister wished to arrive at.  The result is that the <i>cartel</i> is now, and has been during the last 12 months, charging us £1 a ton more for cement than it would have charged us only for this interlude, and more than it is at present charging Great Britain.  That represents £320,000 a year of an overcharge on this country.  That is going into the pockets of the <i>cartel.</i></P>
    <P>Deputy Corish recently said that the fee of 5/- a ton was a very trivial matter in the cost of a house.  It is true that if the fee was not more than 5/- a ton that would mean not much more than 30/- in the cost of a labourer's cottage.  But the fact is that if you add to the licence the additional price charged by the <i>cartel</i> in anticipation of another licence fee here you will find that that will bring the additional price of the cement up to about £1 a ton.  This works out at about £6 in all in the cost of a labourer's cottage. If one had an additional £6 to play about when building a labourer's cottage, one could do a good many things that one cannot do now.  If this cement scheme had never been brought about, we would be getting cement at a low price.  There is no doubt about that, for the <i>cartel</i> would keep down the price lest Spanish and Polish cement might establish a market here.  That class of cheap cement never got a hold in the market here.  That was a thing the <i>cartel</i> never allowed to happen.  I know that the cartel would freely bleed us in the price of cement, but there is one thing they would never do and that is to induce us to look for a cheap cement in other markets.  For that reason they were compelled to bring the price down to a low level so that nobody in this country would find it worth his while to venture on bringing a cargo of cement from Spain or Poland.  They knew that the moment they forced the price up here, that was likely to happen.  They kept a certain stock of cement in the country.  If there <Col N="1116" /> is a large stock of cement at an inflated price, it would pay somebody to bring cement from the port of Daynia in Poland or from some port in Spain. So long as the price of cement was kept down everyone would go on dealing with the <i>cartel.</i>  While I admit that the <i>cartel</i> can do something to abate the consumers' normal advantage, there are limits to which it cannot go.  Because if they try to raise the price too much, cement flows in from other sources.  I have reason to believe, and I suggest, that this increase in price was made with the knowledge and tacit approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. If that is true, I think the Minister has to bear a very heavy responsibility, because in order to cover up the increased cost of manufacturing cement in this country he is permitting and, in fact, officially encouraging the <i>cartel</i> to plunder the Irish consumer of cement, 70 per cent. of which cement was used in the erection of labourers' cottages and public buildings.  I invite the Minister to deal with that question fully in anticipation of the repeal set out in the Schedule to this Bill because he will not have an opportunity of dealing with that matter when <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> comes to be published.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly urged on the House that there can be no effective regulation of prices for cement unless there is regulation of quality.  One of the obligations, under Part V of the old Act, was that the Minister had to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the quality which he required the cement manufacturer to produce.  The Minister, when questioned by me on the Second Stage of the Bill, said that the quality he had in mind to impose on Cement, Ltd., was one superior to the British standard. My recollection was that in fact commercial cement always exceeded the British standard, and the Minister or some Deputy said that his belief was that the British standard had been brought up to the average level of commercial quality cement.  That is quite wrong.  No modern cement industry in the world at present is trying to sell cement of the British Engineering Standards Association <Col N="1117" /> specification of 1925 and, if they did try to sell it, nobody would buy it.  I had these figures in my hand when the Principal Act was passing through, and I have since found them.  I want to put them on record so as to give the Minister an opportunity of dealing with them.</P>
    <P>The British Engineering Standards Association specification is, first, in respect to fineness and the residue, on a sieve, 180 x 180 mesh to the inch, 10 per cent. maximum.  The residue, in the case of an ordinary commercial sample of cement is only 3 per cent. Again, on a sieve 76 x 76 mesh per inch, the residue, under the British Engineering Standards Association specification, is 1 per cent. maximum, while the residue in the case of good quality cement is a trace.  That shows the immense superiority of ordinary commercial cement.  The second test is for soundness.  The British Engineering Standards Association specification provides that the expansion, by the Le Chatelier test, shall be 10 millimetres maximum while the same test for an ordinary sample of commercial cement gives one millimetre expansion. The setting time is the third test. Here the British Standards specification provides 30 minutes' minimum for an initial set, whilst the time for an initial set, in the case of ordinary commercial cement, is four hours five minutes.  In the case of a final set, the British Standards specification provides for a ten hours' maximum, and in the case of ordinary commercial cement the maximum is five hours ten minutes.  There you have an immense superiority, on both these tests, of ordinary commercial cement.</P>
    <P>Now, we come to what is, in my judgment, the most important of all tests, that is the tensile test.  The British Engineering Standards Association specification for the tensile test provides that the breaking strain in lbs. per square inch of briquettes, measuring one inch by one inch, per section, shall be a minimum of 600 lbs. on a briquette seven days old, made of neat cement.  The commercial test for a similar briquette is 946 lbs., more than 50 per cent. superior.  For three <Col N="1118" /> parts sand and one part cement, the British Engineering Standards Association specification for seven days is 325 lbs. minimum and for 28 days 366 lbs. minimum.  That is very important, that the British standard only requires a very modest increase in tensile strength over these vital three weeks of early setting.  In the case of ordinary commercial cement, the specification provides, for three part sand and one part cement, a tensile test of 478 lbs. for seven days, rising to 616 lbs. for 28 days, which represents an improvement of about 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>I direct attention to these figures because I apprehend that Cement, Ltd., will come forward with the British Engineering Standards Association specification of 1925 and say to the Minister: &ldquo;If we produce cement for you which is equal to that specification, at the price which you fix as the price of good cement, we are filling the bill and we are giving the Irish consumer as good a cement as he has been getting outside at a price fixed by you.&rdquo;  That would not be at all true.  The commercial article at present being sold here is 50 per cent. superior to the minimum British Engineering Standards Association specification, and it is of vital importance to every consumer of cement in this country that that superior commercial specification will be insisted upon when the Minister arranges with Cement, Ltd., the type of cement that they will produce.  That is the second question.</P>
    <P>The third question arises out of something the Minister said in his concluding remarks when he stated that the quantity produced by Cement, Ltd., is going to be fixed.  Why do you want to fix the quantity that they produce? Is there no hope ever of selling any abroad, or do we anticipate that the cost of producing cement in this country will be always so much higher than that at which it is produced by the <i>cartel</i> that we will never be able to compete in the markets in which the Poles and the Spaniards are at present competing?  I am not sure that this is relevant, but the Minister also said that it is his intention to limit the profits.  I take it that that <Col N="1119" /> will be a condition imposed on the company.  What, then, is the stimulus left to Cement, Ltd.?  What difference is there between Cement, Ltd., and any Government Department, if you are going to limit the profits?  I see no advantage at all in having this individual enterprise system if you limit profits, because the only justification left for it is then promptly swept away.</P>
    <P>I submit that the matters I have referred to are of vital importance to the country and that it is essential that the Minister should take this opportunity of giving this information which he otherwise would have been obliged to give us in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> at the appropriate time.  In connection with the price, which was the first matter mentioned, when the Minister comes to deal with that he might answer an important question that arises.  Supposing when Cement, Ltd., come into production in two months' time and the price of Irish cement is fixed, that it is substantially in excess of the price ruling at the present time, what will the position be of persons who have contracts to deliver cement? Secondly, what will be the position of persons who have contracts for the completion of large building schemes, whose ultimate contracts for the building depend on the price that has been tendered by the supplier of cement? Does the Minister propose, by statute or regulation, to amend all these contracts and, if he does, has he power to do it, and where?</P>

      <P>If Deputy Dillon is ever in need of a new occupation he should take to writing thrillers.  I think that neither William Le Queux nor Edgar Wallace could rise to the heights of imaginative creation which he has done just now.  That was a good thrilling story when he pictured the inner councils within the <i>cartel</i> meeting to discuss how they were going to deal with the situation that arose here, how they planned to give effect to the secret wishes of the villain of the piece &mdash; myself, of course &mdash; who desired to increase the price of cement, even though foreigners get the profit, so that we would disguise the <Col N="1120" /> fact that the price of Irish cement was going to be so much dearer than the foreign cement.  It was a thrilling scenario, and if he wrote it for the movies I think he would get a substantial fee.  It happens to be all bolony.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a nasty word; it is a nice word.  It is all nonsense. I am not as familiar with the plans of the inner councils of the <i>cartel</i> as the Deputy professes to be, but I am certain that nothing happened except this.  First of all, the <i>cartel</i>, so far as this country is concerned, did not exist when the 5/-licence fee went on.  That rather knocks the bottom out of the Deputy's story.  I am equally certain that whether we put on the 5/- licence fee or not, whether this Government was in office or not, whether I was Minister or not, or whether Deputy Dillon had remained an Independent member or leader of the Farmers' Party, or joined Cumann na nGaedheal or not, the <i>cartel</i> would have extended its operations to cover this country inevitably sooner or later.  The only reason for surprise is that we were ever excluded from the scope of its operations. I have often expressed the opinion here that that was purely accidental and that the accident would be remedied as soon as the necessary arrangements to that end could be made.  These arrangements were made and, when made, all that happened in the inner councils of the <i>cartel</i>, I am certain, is this, that they decided to get as much as they could out of this market while it was left to them, and that the increase in price, in so far as it was not caused by an increase in other charges, was occasioned entirely by that desire &mdash; to get as much profit as possible out of this market while in it, and that the only limitation that operated in the fixation of the price they charged was the possibility of killing the market and reducing the actual sales.  As a proof of that, I mention the agents, who happen to be <Col N="1121" /> of our own nationality, who were engaged in the distribution of that Continental cement and who, operated by a similar impulse, increased their commission from about 2/- per ton to 8/- or 9/- per ton.  That, I am afraid, rather destroys the beauty of the Deputy's story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not, in my opinion.  The Minister has been very careful not to deny the truth of my story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was bolony, but perhaps he did not understand me. I meant that it was nonsense, untrue, without foundation, and, in fact, inconceivable. Let us turn to the other questions which the Deputy succeeded by some method unknown to the Standing Orders, in hanging on to this section of the Bill.  He spoke for a long time about the British standard specification.  Nobody mentioned the British standard specification except himself.  I think Deputy Dockrell did ask on the Second Reading for an assurance that the cement to be produced here would conform to the British standard specification.  Deputy Dillon thinks that the British standard specification is nonsense and that, in fact, cement that conforms to it is inferior.  Deputy Dockrell wanted an assurance that it would be at least up to that standard.  I think the only assurance I gave the Dáil was that the cement manufactured here and the cement to be imported would have to conform to the Irish standard specification, and that specification, which will shortly become operative under an Order to be made by me, was prepared by a committee established by me, or by me in association with the Institute of Civil Engineers; and I am assured by persons who are in a position to give an authoritative opinion that it sets a standard considerably superior to that prescribed in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked why we should fix the quantities of cement to be produced in these factories.  There are two reasons.  Clearly, it is not desirable that the company, if it is to be an importer of cement as well as a manufacturer, should be at liberty to <Col N="1122" /> reduce unnecessarily the quantity of cement to be manufactured here.  In fact, if there is any advantage in doing so, under the arrangement we are making there is, in fact, every inducement to them to eliminate imports as quickly as possible.  But we have fixed an upward limit to the amount that may be produced at each of the factories in order to ensure that the intentions of the Government to distribute the manufacture of cement through the country will be given effect to.  From the manufacturers' point of view, undoubtedly the most satisfactory arrangement would be to produce all the cement in one plant.  But that would be by no means satisfactory from the consumers' point of view.  It would suit the consumers within the immediate vicinity of that plant because they would possibly get the cement cheaper.  But, it would not suit the consumers throughout the rest of the country who would have to pay very high transport charges and, consequently, get the cement much dearer.  Because of that we decided that the most economic way to produce cement in the circumstances of our market involved the establishment of at least three producing centres, possibly four.  In order to ensure that that would be done, we fixed an upward limit to the quantity of cement to be produced by the licensee at each of the plants he was authorised to establish.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the manufacture of cement for export should not be undertaken here.  There is, in fact, quite a prospect of a business of that kind developing, but, obviously, it will not develop for some time, because it will be at least three years from now before the full quantity of cement required for this market will be produced, much less a surplus which can be exported.  But the Deputy need not be apprehensive that the manufacture of cement here will be in any way inferior to the method of manufacture in other countries. The plant which has been installed is as up-to-date as exists in the world. The methods of manufacture are as economic as are in operation anywhere. The quality of the cement to be produced will be as high as any <Col N="1123" /> other.  I give the assurance that it is my intention to see that these conditions shall continue to exist by the use of my powers, if such a use should be necessary, under the original Cement Act, 1933.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy wants me to say.  I think most contractors had certain difficulties in connection with the rise in the price of cement which has occurred over the last two or three years.  That is inevitable.  In fact, contractors in future are going to have the advantage of a relative stability in cement prices, something which they have not had heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not taken my point.  You could put a provision in your contract that the price of cement was to be 40/- per ton, plus any impositions put on by Oireachtas Eireann.  That is all right.  But if you make a flat contract for the delivery of cement at 40/-, your supplier must hedge your contract.  He must secure himself against any future rise in prices if he undertakes to deliver. But, suppose a contract of that character is in existence in which he unconditionally undertakes to supply cement at 42/- a ton, and that the Minister comes along and fixes by law that nobody will sell cement at less than the price of Irish cement, he is obliged by law to charge more than that although he has hedged his contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am saying that the imported cement will be sold at the same price as Irish cement.  The difficulty which the Deputy contemplates will not arise because the Irish cement will be sold at the prices now prevailing. There is going to be a reduction in the price of cement in consequence of this new arrangement and not an increase.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The price at which Irish cement will be sold was fixed when this contract was entered into with this company &mdash; when this licence was issued to them.  That was a number of years ago, and has no relation to the present price of cement at all. It was fixed in relation to the manufacturing costs.  These were taken out and analysed in detail.  It was noted that a number of them were fixed: that they were capital charges of one kind or another.  A formula was prepared which fixed the price of cement, subject to certain variations. It is at that price the cement is going to be sold, and it is at that price imported cement is going to be sold. What I have stated to the House is that that price is lower than the prevailing prices for cement here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in another part of this speech, said that the cost of cement here will be based on the electricity, coal and labour charges.  A moment ago he said that a formula was prepared some years ago on which the price to be charged for cement here is based.  Is he able to tell the House what increases have since taken place in electricity, coal and labour charges?  If these increases have been such that Irish cement will be dearer than British cement, are we to take it from him that the imported cement will be allowed to be sold under the price of Irish cement?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was a difference of 3/-, presumably the manufacturer <Col N="1125" /> would get it, or somebody engaged in the distribution of cement. But there is not this 3/-, and that is the point that I have been trying to make clear to Deputies, because, obviously, if any of the factors to which I have referred should vary here to an extent sufficient to be reflected in the price of cement they will vary elsewhere. I cannot say how much the price of cement will have increased beyond the original contemplated figure by reason of any increase in coal and other charges.  It is unnecessary to deal with that, because if, for instance, there was an increase in the price of coal which affected the price of Irish cement, it would also affect the price of British cement.  There is no reason to contemplate that the manufacture of cement in Great Britain is any cheaper than it is here, except in so far as their coal, labour or electricity may be cheaper, but, subject to these three charges being the same, I should say that the cost of manufacturing cement here would be lower, and not higher, than in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>Under paragraph (d), the Minister is given power to impose a condition that cement shall be imported at a specified port or place or by a specified route.

      <P>The Deputy, no doubt, appreciates that many of the provisions of this Bill will be inoperative if we work on the lines I indicated of issuing a sole import licence but we <Col N="1130" /> have to provide against that not proving possible and for our having to issue a number of licences to individual importers.  In such event, the arrangement we would make would be to effect the distribution both of our home-produced cement and of the imported cement on the most economic basis.  Transport is such an important item in cement costs that, obviously, we would try to ensure that cement produced at Limerick would be sold as near as possible to Limerick and that cement produced at Drogheda would be sold as near as possible to Drogheda.  Consequently, the cement to be imported would come into those areas which could not be served by these centres.  That will be a very cumbersome thing to arrange, and that is the reason we were trying to deal with the matter by the other system we have outlined here.  Those particular conditions will not become operative unless that other system cannot be operated, in which case we shall have to fall back upon the less satisfactory and more cumbersome arrangement of regulating cement imports in the way I have just described.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it may be relevant at this stage, as reference was made in this year's report of the Public Accounts Committee.  A practice has grown up during the last four or five years, when the Comptroller and Auditor-General has completed his review of the year's accounts, and when it becomes the duty of the Public Accounts Committee to deal with it, by which they are held up by inquiries they deem it right to make.  The Public Accounts Committee finds that the presence of accounting officers is necessary and, when called to answer, not infrequently, some comparatively minor official from the Department is sent, very often with the most puerile excuse that they were engaged elsewhere. I feel satisfied that the Minister will agree with me that it is a very unhealthy development, that the accounting officers do not put themselves to very considerable inconvenience to meet the Public Accounts Committee on the day appointed.  I do not want to imply that the Public Accounts Committee should make unreasonable difficulties if accounting officers are away, or are engaged on urgent State business, when the Committee should excuse them and accept substitutes. I should be glad if the Minister would allow it to go on record that he would regard it as improper on the part of accounting officers to absent themselves <Col N="1133" /> from the Committee unless some very grave matter made it impossible for them to attend.</P>

May I say that the remedy very largely lies in the hands of the Public Accounts Committee which, I think, has power to compel the attendance of accounting officers who absent themselves without due and proper reasons? I am in some difficulty about discussing this matter on this Vote because, I think, strictly speaking, it has nothing to do with it.</P>

      <P>I notice that there is a sum of £1,000 for the Royal Zoological Society of Ireland.  It may have escaped the Minister's notice that one of the criticisms uttered in the celebrated Longford election a few years ago was in regard to the fact that £1,000 was being given to the &ldquo;Zoo&rdquo; to feed wild animals while the poor in various parts of the country were being neglected.  I notice that, like a great many other peculiarities of the Fianna Fáil Party, they have probably repented of their criticisms and are now generous with the money.</P>

The ordnance survey is very much behind the times.  I believe some of the maps are as much as 20 years out of date, or even more.  At the present time, Dublin and certain other places are seriously considering the matter of town planning.  The fact that the ordnance survey is so very much out of date complicates that matter very considerably.  After all, terrific building has taken place even in the last five years, and to try and plan a city on 20-year-old maps is obviously a hopeless procedure.</P>

      <P>I believe I have on two occasions already given a definition. The Quit Rent Office, subject to the general control of the Department of Finance, deals with the management of all former Crown property&mdash;including the rents which I defined last year &mdash; which was transferred to Saorstát Eireann by virtue of Article 11 of the Constitution, 1922.  Upon it devolves the safeguarding of State interests in all Land Purchase and Registration of Title proceedings, and the examination of Private Bills from this aspect; the apportioning of quit rents when necessary; the ascertaining and asserting of State title to lands, beds and shores of inland loughs &mdash; a service of increasing importance &mdash; fisheries and other matters; and the responsibility for certain foreshores formerly controlled by the Office of Woods.  Since the burning of the Record Office and the destruction therein of so many records, the importance of the Quit Rent Office as an office of record has grown considerably, and references to it arising out of legal and other proceedings and in connection with questions of title and pedigrees have greatly increased. The Office also acts in an advisory capacity to the Transport and Marine Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce in connection with the administration of foreshores.  From April, 1923, to December, 1934, the Quit Rent Office performed work in connection with foreshores for the Department of Industry and Commerce. This work comprised investigation of title to foreshore, preparation and examination of maps, plans and leases, etcetera, and was additional to that done for the Board of Trade &mdash; now done for the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;as part of the ordinary functions of the Office. The accounts work of the Office is performed by the Office of the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <P>Deputies will remember that last year I promised that the question of extending delivery on rural posts operating on less than six days a week would be undertaken.  When speaking I anticipated that about 600 of the three-day posts would be increased to six-day frequency, and I am glad to say that consideration of this matter is now almost completed and to date some 950 posts have been improved at an additional annual cost of £16,960.</P>
    <P>Continuous pressure had been made for a number of years for the introduction of such arrangements as would enable the bulk of the staff employed by the Department to enjoy Christmas Day with their families.  Last year I decided, as an experimental measure, that delivery of correspondence should be suspended on Christmas Day.  I am happy to say that, thanks to the co-operation of the public in responding to the request to &ldquo;post early,&rdquo;<Col N="1144" /> coupled with the special efforts made by the staff, the experiment was a complete success.  With the exception of those employed on essential telegraph and telephone services, the whole of the Post Office staff were thus enabled to spend Christmas Day with their families.</P>
    <P>Automatic stamp vending machines are now installed at more than 30 offices throughout the country and as this facility is largely availed of by the public I propose to erect similar machines at ten additional post offices in the provinces.  There are 128 motor and 33 horsed services performed by contract and the Department possesses a fleet of 72 motor mail vans for the operation of other similar services. As regards overseas mails, the ports of Cóbh, Galway, and Dublin were used to the greatest possible extent during the past year, when 17,500 bags were despatched and over 32,500 bags were received through these ports.</P>
    <P>Air mail transport for long distance letter mails shows further development, and, in addition to the air surcharge services, is now utilised as the normal means of transport, without prepayment of air fees to Africa, Palestine, India, Ceylon, Malay States, etcetera.  The question of utilising similar transport for the conveyance of letter correspondence between this country and Great Britain, where such a course would accelerate delivery, is under consideration conjointly with the British Post Office.</P>
    <P>The development of the telephone service, following on the reductions of tariffs on the 1st July, 1936, continued at an accelerated rate last year. Although it was anticipated that the reduction of charges would have led to a considerable reduction in revenue it has been found that, as a result of increase in the number of subscribers and traffic, the revenue for 1937-38, which is estimated to reach £497,220, will be in excess of the revenue for the year preceding the reductions.</P>
    <P>Extension of the telephone service will for some years to come continue to necessitate heavy capital expenditure and as the capital funds of £500,000 provided by the Telephone <Col N="1145" /> Capital Act, 1936, will be exhausted this year, it will be necessary to ask the Dáil for further borrowing powers through a new Telephone Capital Act. Capital expenditure during the year 1936-37 amounted to £117,438, for the year 1937-38 it reached £268,000, and the programme planned for 1938-39 will involve a further sum of over £300,000.</P>
    <P>Telephone exchanges increased from 770 to 789; 28 new public call offices were opened, bringing the total number to 1,478.  Subscribers' lines increased by 1,654 to 25,494.  Telephone traffic also showed an appreciable increase.  Local calls rose to over 29,000,000, an increase of 713,000, and trunk calls increased by over 450,000, to 2,470,000.  To cope with the growth in trunk traffic, 83 additional internal trunk circuits were provided last year.</P>
    <P>An increase in the number of circuits and the extension of the system of &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; working on the main routes has greatly improved the general standard of the trunk service both as regards delay and quality of transmission. A further large number of circuits is planned for the current year. A new direct cross-Channel cable was laid in September last, but owing to unavoidable delay in the installation of the terminal equipment at both ends the number of working circuits in the cable is as yet only four.  These have, however, enabled an appreciable improvement in the cross-Channel &ldquo;day&rdquo; service to be effected, but at night, owing to heavy traffic at the cheap rates, delay is still considerable. In view of the continued increase in cross-Channel traffic, it has been decided that a second new cable should be laid in the course of the present year.  When this second cable is in service, probably towards the end of the year, there will be at least 16 direct cross-Channel circuits and a practically &ldquo;no delay&rdquo; service will be ensured at all times.</P>
    <P>During the past year there has been an appreciable extension of the automatic system in Dublin.  The capacity of the Central Exchange in Crown Alley has been increased.  A new automatic exchange has been opened in Clontarf, and the Drumcondra area has also been converted to automatic <Col N="1146" /> working.  Conversion of the Dundrum area will be carried through in a month or two.  Work on the erection of a new building for an automatic exchange in Dún Laoghaire to serve the existing Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock, Dalkey and Foxrock areas, which was delayed owing to the building trade stoppage last year, is proceeding, and the transfer to the new exchange will, it is anticipated, be carried out within a year.  It is hoped also that the installation of an automatic exchange at Cork will be commenced this year and that the change-over will be effected next year.</P>
    <P>During October last, when the transfer of large numbers of subscribers from the Merrion Street and Ship Street exchanges to the Central Exchange at Crown Alley were being carried out, a certain amount of congestion was occasioned in the latter exchange, resulting in delay and, I regret, some unavoidable inconvenience to subscribers.  Modification and extension of equipment have since taken place, and the service is in consequence materially improved.  Further additional equipment is being provided, and when the work of installation has been completed I am hopeful that service will be of an entirely satisfactory order.  An experimental rural semiautomatic telephone system embracing the existing exchange areas of Malahide, Donabate, Rush and Lusk will probably be installed during the coming autumn.  It is hoped that this experiment will help to solve the problem of providing a continuous 24-hour service economically at small exchanges.</P>
    <P>A scheme is at present under consideration for the provision of communication with a number of islands off the West and South-West coast. The results of detailed surveys are being considered for the purpose of determining whether communication could be adequately afforded by radio in all cases, or whether in particular instances cable working will be necessary. Consideration of the matter is being expedited as far as possible.  It is hoped that it will be practicable this year to replace the telephone cable <Col N="1147" /> between the mainland and Inishmore, Aran Islands, which by reason of damage has been out of use for some time past.  In the meantime a temporary wireless telegraph installation is functioning.</P>
    <P>The financial position of the Telegraph Service continues to be unsatisfactory. Although the traffic increased by 81,000 messages last year, the increase was not sufficient to cover the loss of revenue resulting from the reduction of charges in June last.  In this connection I would like to refer to the suggestion made by various Deputies during the debate on last year's Estimates, that the number of words covered by the minimum charge of 1/- should be increased from nine to 12.  This concession would cost an additional £10,600 per annum, and in view of the present deficit in the service I regret I would not be justified in supporting the proposal.</P>
    <P>Civil aviation and meteorological services are controlled by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but my Department undertakes responsibility for the installation, operation and maintenance of the radio services associated with them.  The wireless station already existing in Baldonnel serves provisionally the purpose of the cross-Channel air services.  The permanent station in connection with these services will eventually be located at Collinstown when the municipal airport there is completed, but the temporary station at Baldonnel will be retained to serve as an emergency station on occasions when it may be necessary to use the Baldonnel aerodrome as an alternative to Collinstown.</P>
    <P>The provisional radio installation erected at the Shannon air base to deal with 1937 test flights is being augmented.  Hitherto only one shortwave transmitter and one medium wave transmitter were available to work to aircraft and to the terminal station in Newfoundland.  Two separate stations situated about three miles apart are now being provided, one to work to the terminal station at Newfoundland and the other equipped with facilities for quick changes of wavelength to work to aircraft.  A blind landing beam <Col N="1148" /> system on ultra short waves is to be installed at Rhynanna Aerodrome.  Provision is also made for the completion of the installation of direction-finding apparatus on medium waves, and of a blind landing beam system on ultra short waves at the municipal aerodrome at Collinstown.  A sum of £7,000 is included for the provision of radio equipment which will probably be necessary to airports to be established at Cork and Galway.</P>
    <P>The rapid spread and development of telephones is also reflected in the activities of the Post Office stores branch.  The value of the contracts placed by the stores branch last year was approximately £100,000 in excess of that of the previous year.  In this connection, it is interesting to note that over 50 per cent. of the contracts placed were for articles manufactured or assembled in this country.</P>
    <P>The stores branch also undertakes multifarious duties for other Government and quasi-Government Departments. Among the purchases made for other Government Departments were plant and machinery for the establishment of the toy factory at Elly Bay; forestry tools and material required in connection with reafforestation schemes; plant and stores for the establishment and extension of the meteorological services; and railway materials required in connection with the production of machine-made turf in Kerry and Offaly.</P>
    <P>The Commercial Account figures given in the first part of my statement are for the last completed year, 1936-37. Figures for the current financial year will not be available for several months. It is possible, however, to make a close estimate which shows that the profit for the year is not likely to exceed £100,000.  The reduction of profit is mainly due to increased expenditure in the provision of new facilities and increased staff costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us a very comprehensive survey of his Department, but there are some comments I wish to make.  With regard to the Post Office Savings Bank, I made the suggestion last year that it should be modernised and <Col N="1149" /> brought into line with the ideas of people who feel that they should be able to get money practically at call. I think that with very little trouble the Minister should be able to bring this service up to date.  If not, he ought to scrap it.  I was very glad to hear him say, with regard to telephones, that arrangements had been made for more cross-Channel lines and that they would be in working order this year.  I know that a delay of an hour for a telephone call across-Channel is not unusual, and the Minister can realise that he must be losing a very substantial revenue from that source, because it is not everybody who can wait for an hour and then find that he cannot get the connection he wants.</P>
      <P>With regard to the telegraph service, the Minister said that if the allowance in respect of words in a telegram were extended, he would lose so much more money on that service. It is very hard to calculate the number of people who would send a telegram if they were allowed 12 words and who do not send a telegram at all&mdash;under the present system. That, however, is only a small point because, to my mind, the position in regard to the telegraph system is that, with the extension of the telephone service, most people will use the telephone, and if they can get the instantaneous service of which the Minister spoke, it will have a still greater effect on the telegraph service.  I notice that the St. Andrew Street Post Office is still not operating.  I spoke about this subject some time ago, but if the authorities are considering some aspect of town-planning, or thinking about the lay-out of the buildings, it is time very well spent.  The Minister might, however, deal with the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the carriage of mails, the Minister says that the Department is considering conveying the ordinary mails by air.  I think that an excellent idea, and the commercial community certainly would welcome it.  The service might be so speeded up that the Minister might get the whole of the extra expense in increased revenue, but, at the same time, I think he ought to consider it over a period of years. There is no doubt that if the conveyance <Col N="1150" /> of mails could be considerably speeded up, it would be a very great service to the commercial community and to everybody else who uses the mails.</P>
    <P>There are some remarks I want to make with regard to the cross-Channel mails and the Dun Laoghaire service. Some time ago the Minister was approached, and he pointed out that the Post Office here was not only interested in this matter but that the Board of Works were interested because they owned the harbour, and that also the British Post Office or British Government &mdash; I forget which he sheltered behind &mdash; had their say in the conveyance of the mails.  There is a further point in that connection which I want to draw to the attention of the Government.  There is a very great hope, which we all echo, that transatlantic air services will come to this country.  They will come ultimately, and it is only a question of when and how they will come.  When they come, there will probably be radiating services from this country and, in the opinion of most people, there will be a very considerable increase in the number of passengers who will use the ordinary rail route to Dublin and, from there, to England.  In view of that, I think the Minister ought to look at the Dun Laoghaire-Holyhead route to London from the special point of view of making it as improved and as up to date as possible, because there is no doubt that the traffic I speak of will go to the best-equipped line and the best-equipped route. Many people who may hesitate as between air and rail, if they find up-to-date rail services available, may decide to go by rail.  In view of the time which will be taken by the necessary negotiations between the Great Southern Railways, the Board of Works, the Minister's Department and the Post and Telegraphs Department across the water, I urge the Minister to open up negotiations and, at any rate, to get the length of having the scheme on paper and gone into, because it would give a great deal of employment and provide a service over here which we should like to be able to compare with any other similar service.  It would also benefit tourist <Col N="1151" /> traffic, and from that point of view alone would probably justify very careful investigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which this Vote was discussed, I referred to the out-of-date and old-fashioned instruments which the rural areas seem to inherit when more up-to-date instruments are installed in cities like Cork, Dublin, Waterford and Limerick, and I asked the Minister to give consideration to this complaint as it was a genuine grievance.  I am sorry to say that we still inherit the old machinery which is now not good enough for the people or for commercial users in the cities.  One finds in parts of the country at present the old pre-War bell system of telephone, a telephone that is noisy and, in my opinion, out of date.  I suggest that the country is just as important as the city.  Over and over again distinguished visitors come to this country, either on business or travelling as tourists.  Their adverse comments are not in connection with the quickness or slowness in getting through.  On the contrary they comment favourably on the personal service they receive.  What they comment adversely on is the out-of-date and inadequate system of telephone machinery which we use.  I have heard a good deal about expediting service and about foreign traffic and cross-Channel traffic.  I trust that this time at all events the Minister and his chief officials will listen to the appeal we are making for a speeding up of the telephone service and bringing it in every respect up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the next matter, and that is with regard to the slow delivery of letters in many parts of the country.  Whether the reason is because of understaffing or some other cause I do not know, but I want now to complain that letters are not receiving the quickest possible dispatch in country districts.  After all, we are just as important as the people in the city who are looking for improved cross-Channel services.  Over and over again we find that letters posted in the regulation time in rural post office boxes are not delivered the following morning.  Sometimes an interval of <Col N="1152" /> 48 hours elapses before these letters reach a destination very often of not more than 15 miles.  I ask the Minister not to look upon these complaints of mine as being made for the sake of criticism.  I know that I am speaking for those who have genuine grievances.</P>
    <P>Then again there is the position where people may meet with accidents or other trouble along the main roads at night.  They find there is no possibility whatever of getting into telephonic communication because of the fact that in a large part of the country the telephone offices close down at 10 o'clock.  Is there not a possibility of having along the main roads a telephone kiosk where one could go and put a telephone call through?  This is very important in the case where medical aid is required, in sudden illnesses or accidents.  I think there is no doubt that in those parts of the country where there is fairly heavy traffic and where even late at night a certain movement to and fro along the roads is taking place, telephone services should be available and people should not have to travel long distances on bad nights in order to secure aid of one kind or another.  When one does come to a town or city in the country and one has to knock people up, one finds that considerable delays are involved.  I would suggest to the Minister to have an impartial investigation along these lines made into the service, and to find out whether additional telephonic services might not be made available in country districts.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of the 10 o'clock closing down of telephone offices.  In certain towns new industries have been started.  There are in these places sometimes night shifts, but after 10 o'clock one cannot get any telephone calls at all, even of a local nature much less the getting of long distance calls to Dublin or elsewhere.  I think the time has now arrived, in this year 1938, when country towns should be put on a level with their neighbouring towns.  What is the difference between Athy and Carlow?  There are, of course, other towns similar to Athy where after 10 o'clock one cannot have any communication at all by telephone. Is it a question of cost or is it a question <Col N="1153" /> of getting a guaranteed local number of subscribers?  I have seen a memorandum filled up by numerous new subscribers.  I have been given to understand that if a certain number could be secured a night service would operate.  That memorandum has been sent in months ago, but yet no result has followed so far.  To-day the telephone is of tremendous importance. This is the case particularly in rural districts four or five miles distant from towns.  In these places telephones are becoming from month to month more numerous, but in the case of urgency or sudden sickness, for the reasons I have stated, they are very often useless.  At night time nervous people are more susceptible to sudden illnesses than in the day.</P>
    <P>Another complaint is that new subscribers have received and are being given better terms from the rental point of view than the old subscribers. I am not stating that as a definite grievance, because it seems so absurd that it can scarcely be true.  Yet I have been told that telephones are being put in and extensions made on better terms than those given by the post office to the old subscribers.  I am told that they are given also at a lesser rental.</P>
    <P>My last criticism is with regard to the long, slow, wearisome waits when one wants a new telephone put in.  Is the post office under-staffed?  I do not know, but it is a fact that weeks run into months before an extension is carried out from one room to another in the same house.  There is still greater delay in getting a telephone in to a business house, even to a house very shortly removed from the post office main lines.</P>
    <P>I expect that in fairness I should give credit where credit is due.  I might delay the House by giving that credit, but it is not necessary, because all of us who use the telephone on a large scale know how very courteous the operators are.  Under the circumstances in which the operators work this is very creditable.  We know that again and again irritating people use the telephone, and one knows how hard it is for the operators to remain courteous towards such people.  I <Col N="1154" /> must say that on all occasions I have met with all the courtesy that one might expect.</P>
    <P>One very persistent complaint about the use of the telephone is in connection with trunk calls, 30 or 40 miles distant.  One often finds a buzz and an indistinctness for which the officials can give no explanation.  I think the Minister should inaugurate a better system of inspection.  Personal calls might be made on the subscribers asking them if they had any grievances in connection with the use of the telephone. In these days when one hears so much talk about good service that would be a proper thing for the Minister to inaugurate.  The Post Office officials could, in their own districts, where the telephone is used on a large scale, investigate whether satisfaction is given, and suggest improvements that might be effected. Those who feel inclined to put in a telephone or to use a telephone would be greatly encouraged by these old users who could say so much in praise of the telephone or who, like myself, might offer a little criticism of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to the conditions under which telegrams are delivered in country towns.  I do not know whether the same system obtains in other towns but recently a case was brought to my attention where, in the town of Clonakilty, a telegram was sent to a professional gentleman, a barrister, and was laid in the office for two hours or perhaps longer.  It was a very important message but it remained there until a second wire came along cancelling the first, and both were then delivered to this professional gentleman.  The absence of a telegraph messenger in an important office like Clonakilty is something that is to be deplored, leading as it does to neglect of this character. This gentleman wrote to the Department complaining of the treatment which he had received.  I think he lost a very important case and a fee because of the delay in the delivery of the telegram.  The reply he received was that the delay was due to inability to obtain a casual messenger <Col N="1155" /> to undertake delivery owing to the inclemency of the weather.  This gentleman lives within 100 yards of the post office and surely it would be the postmaster's business, if he had not a casual messenger, to see that an important communication like that was delivered.  I hope that some remedy will be found for cases of that kind.  I do not know whether such cases arise in other towns like Clonakilty but, if they do, it is a matter which calls for immediate remedy.</P>
      <P>I have also the case of a man living out in the country, two miles away, connected by phone with the office. If he gets a wire to Clonakilty it is phoned out immediately to his home. He also has an office in the town. The postmaster, I am sure, knows that very well, but sometime when a wire comes it is left there, unless some neighbour calls into the post office and the post office authorities give it to this neighbour.  I do not think it is proper that the business of the post office, particularly in regard to wires, should be carried on in that way. Wires generally deal with urgent matters, and I think that it is very unfair and very bad business on the part of the post office authorities to allow them to lie in the office in this way.  I must say that I have no grievance myself in this regard.  I live two miles away and I find that wires have always been delivered to me in reasonable time, but the two cases which I have mentioned have been brought to my notice within the past week.  We do not want to have any recurrence of delays of that kind in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's statement introducing this Estimate.  There is one point, only one point, on which I can congratulate him, and that is on the courage and imagination which the Post Office, and the Minister in particular, displayed in suspending postal deliveries on the 25th and 26th of December last.  It is not often that the Post Office displays much imagination in its administrative activities. It is very rarely indeed that it can be induced to depart from long-established practice.  It is an essentially conservative institution.  It keeps on <Col N="1156" /> doing in 1938 the things it did in 1937 and thinks that because these things were right in 1937, they should also be right in 1938.  The longer the Minister is associated with the Post Office, the more he will find that conservative spirit pervading all its actions and outlook.  When, therefore, the Post Office decided to suspend the postal deliveries on December 25th and 26th, 1937, believe me, the Post Office did a revolutionary thing that would have made many of its past Ministers and its past administrators turn in their graves.  Indeed, I am not sure that it did not cause a very profound shock to the nervous system of many of its present administrators.  I hope the success of the experiment &mdash; and it was a gigantic success from the public point of view &mdash; will induce the Minister and his Department to realise that changes can be made without bringing about the catastrophic results which the Post Office sometimes fears will accrue if a change is made.</P>
      <P>On last Christmas Eve, letters and parcels were delivered, which in previous Christmasses, with the type of organisation then in existence, would have lain in the Post Office to be delivered on Christmas Day or on the days following.  On last Christmas Eve there was no correspondence left over to be delivered.  All correspondence posted in time was delivered before Christmas and the public had the experience of being able to receive their Christmas greetings before the festival instead of receiving stale greetings, as was the common experience in other years, after the festival has passed.  I hope, as I have said, that the success of that experiment will encourage the Minister to be bold and courageous in other spheres.  I feel sure the success of the experiment will ensure that never again will the staff be dragged from their beds at three or four o'clock for the purpose of delivering mail on Christmas Day, which it was demonstrated last year could be delivered quite easily before Christmas if the public only posted a little earlier.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only trying to make the Deputy realise what a very beneficial change this has been.  If the Deputy were called from his bed at three or four o'clock on Christmas morning to assist in the delivery of letters which could have been delivered a day or two previously, with proper organisation, I am sure he would not be such an admirer of the old system. I am sure if he were a victim of the public laziness in that regard, he would view the matter from a different standpoint. The Minister referred in the course of his speech to the fact that, in the course of the past year, daily deliveries had been restored on some 950 posts at an additional annual cost of £16,960.  I think the Minister indicated last year that it was proposed to restore daily deliveries in the case of 600 posts at an estimated cost of £20,000.  The Minister has been able to do 50 per cent. more than he anticipated, at a cost of 20 per cent. less than he anticipated.  There are still a number of routes in the country, probably about 250 to 300, where the services are less than of daily frequency.  As the Minister has not spent the £20,000 which he budgeted for last year, I should like him to go into that question with a view to increasing the frequency further, and thus give all members of the community liable to pay taxes equally the benefit of daily deliveries in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from the social benefits to the community, the proposal to restore daily deliveries has a natural interest for part-time employees in the Post Office.  The effect of restoring the daily deliveries has been to create a <Col N="1158" /> number of full-time duties out of part-time duties and has also added substantially to the hours of attendance of part-time officers.  The Minister, therefore, could feel sure that the restoration of daily deliveries will not only be appreciated by the community, but that the expenditure of the money would, in addition to the benefits provided for the community, enable the hours of attendance and, consequently, the wages of part-time officers to be increased.  I hope the Minister, when replying, will indicate that as the money, which it was anticipated would be spent, has not in fact been spent, it will now be utilised to carry the experiment still farther, so that we can get back to the condition of affairs which existed prior to 1923, namely, a daily delivery in all areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is retrogressive in this age to be talking about postal deliveries on three days a week.  The Minister talked about sending letters more quickly to the other end of the world, to India, Malay, Ceylon, Africa, etc., and the desire apparently is to expedite the delivery of letters from here to these places.  But, here at home there is a problem much more important, and that is delivering more speedily the letters to our own people and the letters of our own people here, who provide the taxation necessary to run the Minister's Department.  It seems to me to be a vicious contradiction to be considering how we can deliver letters more speedily to India, while at home we are quite satisfied to allow about 300 rural postal districts to get their letters on three days per week instead of every day.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind the anomalous situation which is being created by, apparently, one side of his head not knowing what the other side is doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the telephone service and opened for us a picture of considerable development in that connection.  As everybody knows who has occasion to use the telephone, the service is rapidly expanding, and a new and complicated type of mechanism, in the form of automatic exchanges, has been made available to the public.  The growth of the service <Col N="1159" /> and the conversion of manual exchanges to automatic working have produced considerable additional work for the staff and resulted in their work being of a much more complex character.  While the Minister was referring to the programme of telephone development, I was sorry he could not find time to mention some proposal for an improvement in the conditions in the Crown Alley exchange. I do not know whether the Minister was ever in the central telephone exchange at Crown Alley, but, if not, I recommend him to pay a visit there as soon as possible.  If he can manage to go there without its being known beforehand, I think he will find, if he has any experience of telephone operating, a rather unsatisfactory condition of affairs in that exchange.</P>
    <P>It is true that there was a considerable breakdown in the telephone service last year, due to the fact that whole areas were converted from manual to automatic working, and that there was, apparently, not sufficient cohesion between those responsible for the technical conversion and those responsible for the administration of the telephone service.  The gap between these two sections produced a very unsatisfactory condition of affairs, which resulted in the telephone service during that period not coming up to its normal efficient standard.  The telephone exchange in Crown Alley, in my opinion, is the powder barrel of the whole service.  The building is a very unsatisfactory one.  It has been in existence for a very long time.  If the Minister has ever seen a telephone exchange in the capital of any other country he will know that the present telephone exchange in Crown Alley differs radically from anything that serves as a central telephone exchange in any other capital.  The building is out-of-date; it is a drab, cheerless kind of building, packed up with all kinds of stores, and used as a kind of lumber depot for all kinds of engineering equipment. The main room in the place available for trunk telephone operating is very dreary.  It is a dirty room and, on top of that, it is unsatisfactorily planned and very badly ventilated. <Col N="1160" /> When one goes into it one would think it was intended as an example of Gothic architecture.  On account of its appearance, and the type of windows provided, one gets the idea that it belonged to that period.  The equipment in the room is decidedly unsatisfactory, while the conditions under which the staff operate are also decidedly unsatisfactory.  There is no space there for the possibility of further telephone extension.</P>
    <P>It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that the trunk service has not been satisfactory.  Any Deputy who has experience of the trunk service knows that.  The conditions in the trunk room in Crown Alley are not such as to enable a satisfactory trunk service to be provided, owing to the defective condition of the room, the out-of-date equipment, and the inadequacy of the equipment generally provided for dealing with the trunk traffic.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that there was a surplus of £73,000 on the telephone side.  He ought to make sure that a substantial proportion of that sum is utilised to improve the position at Crown Alley, which is decidedly unsatisfactory. Those who have any experience of the service know that a breakdown in the arrangements at the Crown Alley exchange will mean a complete dislocation of the service.  If the Minister would pay a visit to that exchange and could manage to visit a central telephone exchange in another country, he will see the enormous difference between the conditions in Dublin and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Last year I raised with the Minister the question of the callous treatment&mdash; one cannot describe it by any other name&mdash;meted out to part-time employees in the Post Office by the Minister when these people come to retire.  Cases come to my notice every year of persons who, having served in a part-time capacity in the Post Office for 30, 35 and 40 years are obliged to retire when 65 or 68 years of age. Having served the State and the community generally for a period of 40 years or more, the Minister simply allows them to go.  He does not even send them a note of thanks and he does not give them one farthing <Col N="1161" /> gratuity.  A week after they have gone out they have to try to get unemployment insurance benefit, national health insurance benefit, or home assistance. I suggest to the Minister that that is a type of treatment for persons who have served the State for 40 years or over of which no public Department ought to be proud.  One thinks of the Post Office as a gigantic social service playing a big part in modern civilisation. While we think of that gigantic service, on the one hand, and the value of that service, we are confronted, on the other hand, with the position that that service could not give as much as a farthing compensation to a person who had served it for 30 or 40 years.  I think last year the Minister indicated that he was in sympathy with the proposal I had then made to pay a gratuity or a pension to persons in that position.  I think they ought to be paid pensions, and I think there ought to be some recognition of the services which they give to the community.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister expect them to live when they retire at 65 years of age?  The Minister at present casts them adrift with no pension and no gratuity.  Last year he indicated great sympathy with the proposal which I then made.  I would like to know from him what he has done during the past 12 months to translate into some tangible form the sympathy which he then expressed.  After all, a number of people have retired in the meantime; more will be retiring while we are discussing this Estimate, and numbers of others next month and in every succeeding month.  Something ought to be done by the Minister to speed up a decision to provide pensions or gratuities for those persons who have served the State for such long periods. I hope the Minister will be able to tell the House, when concluding, what he intends to do in this matter: that he will be able to find a remedy and will apply it speedily.  It is rather strange that in Great Britain and the Six Counties the Postmaster-General treats such employees much more generously than the Minister treats them here. If there had not been a change of Government, such employees here <Col N="1162" /> would, in fact, be treated much more generously than they are being treated by the Minister.  Theirs is, I think, an outstanding case which will have every sympathy from all sections of the community. I think the Minister ought to announce that he intends to meet the case and meet it in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Mrs. Redmond will speak on this Estimate and raise her voice in protest against the condition of the Waterford office.  I happened to be in Waterford a few days ago, and I must say that the condition of the office there is very far from satisfactory.  It is a very old building. I understand that the question of reconstructing it has been under consideration for a decade or, possibly, two.  The conditions in the office have deteriorated sadly, structurally, during that period.  The position to-day is probably worse than it has ever been in the history of the Waterford post office.  In fact, recently in an effort to try and provide accommodation, which is not available elsewhere in the building, a white elephant, in the form of a temporary structure, was erected at the public counter the effect of which has been to destroy the counter, to cramp the space formerly available for the public, and to make a mess of what ought to be decent counter accommodation in an important city like Waterford.</P>
    <P>I know that the Post Office is not directly responsible for new buildings or for the carrying out of structural alterations, but if the Minister were to take a strong line in the matter I feel sure that he could get somebody to listen to him as regards having these attended to.  The conditions in that office are particularly bad.  They are the subject of comment locally by prominent citizens, and of complaint by those who have to try and transact their business at the public counter in the cramped space available there.  I hope the Minister will deal with the matter when replying: that he will be able to announce some proposal for improving the condition of the accomodation in Waterford.  The Post Office authorities have been dealing with the matter for a number of years, but no progress has been made in the meantime. You could get an Empire <Col N="1163" /> created in Europe much more quickly than you could get a post office created in this country.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to take the matter in hands himself, to try and break away, as was done last Christmas, from the traditional method of dealing with these things.  I think that if those who have to deal with the Waterford office were obliged to work there for a period they would deal with it much more expeditiously: that if the consideration of the necessity for carrying out structural alterations there were given to somebody who had to work there under present conditions there would be a speedy decision in the matter of having alterations carried out in this very important office.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us, when speaking of the ramifications of the Post Office Stores Department, that not only did it deal with all stores matters affecting the Post Office, but that it was also a kind of wholesale buyer and warehousing merchant for other Government Departments as well.  One could admire and commend that kind of comprehensive purchasing and storage if one did not know the position.  I suggest to the Minister that the Post Office Stores Branch should do its own job well before it undertakes the job of looking after other people's business. It is a well-known fact that it is extremely difficult for postmen to get uniforms and articles of protective clothing from the Stores Branch with the regularity to which they are entitled to have them under the Post Office regulations.  It is quite a usual thing apparently for the Stores Branch to say that they have none of those uniforms in stock.  It is quite a common thing for them to say that they have not such and such an article of protective clothing in stock.  It is quite a common thing to see people entitled to uniforms doing without them for two, three, four and sometimes six months.  It is an extremely difficult thing to get certain articles of protective clothing out of the Stores Branch.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that before the Post Office Stores Branch undertakes other people's business it ought, first <Col N="1164" /> of all, to do its own business well, and that it is not doing its own business well in the respects I have mentioned. One job done well is much better than a bigger job not so well done, and that is essentially the position of the Stores Branch in regard to uniforms and articles of protective clothing.  I hope also that there will be an examination, on the part of the Stores Branch, of the quality of the protective clothing supplied to many officers.  Generally, the experience of those who have to wear them has been that in many respects they are of inferior quality; that they do not last the prescribed period.</P>
    <P>Attention to that matter by the Stores Branch might in the long run be much more valuable on its part than in taking upon itself business for other Government Departments.  I hope, however, that having called attention to the matter, the Minister will probably find it possible to take some steps to remedy a position which, as I have said, is far from satisfactory in respect of the uniforms supplied to the Post Office staff.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter, and that is the question of the wage standards paid to Post Office employees.  The Minister told us of a surplus of £306,000; he then told us of a surplus of £200,000, and finally he brought us down to a surplus of £100,000.  The thing which emerges from all the figures quoted by the Minister is this: that there has been a substantial surplus and that there is still a substantial surplus.  I think that the Post Office ought to pay a decent wage to its employees whether there is a surplus or not.  It is not entitled to pay people a low rate of wages simply because it fixes charges on a basis which will not produce a surplus.  The Post Office employees have an undeniable moral claim to a decent wage whether there is a surplus or not.  The Minister, like many of his predecessors, has not a clean sheet, and I cannot imagine he has a clear conscience in this matter.  Over 12 months ago a claim was submitted to his Department asking for certain increases for all grades of Post Office staffs.  Prior to that a special claim <Col N="1165" /> was submitted in respect of the engineering grades in the Post Office, who have carried out the gigantic scheme of telephone development to which the Minister referred in his opening remarks.  I suggest to the Minister that 12 months is a reasonably long time&mdash;in fact it is too long&mdash; in which to enable the Post Office to come to a decision on the claim submitted. Seeing that for the past 12 months the matter has been under consideration, and is still under consideration, one would not like to suggest that those who have been dealing with it were in any way affected with sleepy sickness.  Twelve months is surely an inordinately long time to deal with a matter the issues of which are so clear to everyone who has devoted even a short time to an examination of it.  I should like to know what he proposes to do or what his Department proposes to do in that matter. It is all very well to talk of surpluses when the staff the Minister employs is underpaid.  It seems to me to be a vicious contradiction of values to talk of surpluses on the administration of the Post Office when the staff in the Department in which that surplus is made are underpaid.  One of the horrible features of Post Office wage scales is the long and wearisome incremental scheme over which officers have to travel before they reach their maximum. When they do reach it, they find that it is a low maximum.  Many of the younger officers in the service are unable to assume the responsibilities of marriage and fatherhood because of the difficulty of living on the low scales in operation.  We have in this country the lowest marriagerate of any white country in the world. Is it any wonder?  We have a particularly low rate amongst the agricultural community because of the abominably low standard of living which obtains in that industry.  In the Post Office service &mdash; a State Department &mdash; we find that nothing is being done to correct the tendency there, notwithstanding the special responsibility which devolves on the State.  Many of the younger officials in the Post Office are unable to marry because of the low wage scales.  Many of them are compelled to postpone the question of <Col N="1166" /> marriage for a long period&mdash;until such time as they can get out of their incipient difficulty of low wages.  When they marry, they find that difficulties which they thought they had left behind simply multiply because of the impossibility of maintaining a decent home on the low wage scales in operation in the Post Office.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a claim in his Department on this matter for over 12 months.  Surely, 12 months is not an unreasonable period in which to come to a decision.  Prior to 1932, one used to think that a Fianna Fáil Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would not take long to arrive at a decision, so manifest were his sympathies with those on whose behalf the claim was made.  There is not, however, much difference between the present Minister and some of his predecessors in previous Administrations.  It might be said on behalf of some of the Minister's predecessors that they made up their minds speedily, even if they did not make them up satisfactorily.  The Minister cannot make up his mind either speedily or satisfactorily.  I can understand the excitement which Estimates produce in Ministerial quarters, but I should like the Minister to make an effort this week to come to a decision on the claim his Department has had for the past 12 months.  I am sure the Minister will not accuse anybody of impetuosity or fussiness for asking him to come to a decision 12 months after he has received the claim.  It is not unreasonable to make this request and I hope he will not turn an unsympathetic ear to it.</P>

      <P>A couple of weeks ago, I drew the attention of the Minister to the want of a daily delivery of letters in the parish of Donoghmore. I regret to say that the Minister did not see his way to accede to the request of a large number of farmers in that area.  They are adversely affected, as explained in the letter they have written, by the fact that when they are sent a notification by the Pigs Marketing Board to send on pigs, it is received late.  They do not receive the letter until the day after the period has elapsed, and they lose their sale. <Col N="1167" /> That is very important to people engaged in what is regarded by the Government Front Bench as a most important industry and it must be accompanied, as the Minister will understand, by severe monetary loss. I ask the Minister to investigate again the complaints which have been made. Sixty-three farmers have signed a petition and, where the income of 63 producers is seriously affected, the matter is one deserving the attention of the Department.  I have again received a request from this body to urge the Minister to reconsider the position and to have it investigated by some subordinate body.  I hope the Minister will see his way to give consideration to the appeal made by these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell drew the attention of the Minister to the importance of the conveyance of mails by air.  I think that the activities of a committee in Cork, composed of the representatives of the corporation, Cobh Urban Council, Cork County Council and Cork Harbour Board, will result in the formulation of a scheme whereby these facilities will be brought into a district which is of the utmost importance agriculturally&mdash;a district such as Midleton, where the site is claimed to be one of the best of about ten different sites. I can look forward with a certain amount of pleasure to American mails being conveyed by air to this country, and to visitors who want to travel quickly availing of the same service. I am sure that encouragement by the Minister will help to develop such a service, to the benefit of employment and to the benefit of the tourist industry.  Unfortunately, the Department of the Minister has been frequently attacked.  I am sure that Department is doing its best, but we cannot ignore the fact that the considerable expense, over and above the charges made by the British Post Office, in which the people of this country are involved in respect of the delivery of letters militates against them.  Perhaps the Minister could see his way to reduce those charges and also the cost of telegrams.  I do not want to dwell on this matter because there are other services to be dealt <Col N="1168" /> with, but I earnestly ask the Minister to give relief to the agricultural community in those places where they have not a daily delivery of letters.  We do not want to sink back into the Stone Age, but I am afraid we shall do so if we cannot get a daily postal delivery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to say that the telephone service of this part of Ireland is bad, but the telephone service in my constituency is bad.  I urge that steps be taken to bring the service up to the standard of that in other countries.  The slowness with which calls are given and the interruptions and delays make the telephone service very bad.  Anybody who has any experience, be it ever so small, of the telephone service in the Six Counties or in England and who compares it with the service here, will admit that we are very far behind. On various occasions I brought this matter up on this Estimate during the past ten years.  I traced the lay-out of the whole telephone service, as known to me, in the Free State, as it then was.  I pointed out five years ago that the telegram developed with the railways and had no relation to the occurrence of trade in the various parts of the country.  I gave as an illustration that to get a call from where I live &mdash; Castlepollard village &mdash; to Oldcastle, eight miles away, it is necessary to go around by Dublin.  I also gave an illustration in which a man rang from Delvin to Collinstown, five miles away, failed to get through, and drove to Collinstown.  When he was talking to his friend in Collinstown, the phone call came through.  This part of my county is linked up with Meath, because the G.N.R. served that part of Meath to its western boundary. Consequently, telephone calls have to go round through Navan and Athboy in order to reach places only a few miles removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the increased use of the telephone, it is time to help out subscribers by giving direct connection with the automatic service in Longford, Navan, Mullingar, and parts of County Meath.  There should be better facilities for night calls and for calls on holidays and Sundays.  If an operator has to go up two flights of <Col N="1169" /> stairs to answer a call, the fire that is provided should be upstairs, so that he will be available instantaneously when there is a ring.  The Minister should also consider the charge made for telegrams.  Twelve words for one shilling seems reasonable.  It is hard to get any message into nine words.  I understand there has been increased use of the telegraph service, and I believe the increase would be greater if 12 words were allowed for one shilling.  Deputy Norton and Deputy Brasier referred to bad deliveries in some parts of the country.  I wish to draw attention to another aspect of that.  It takes two days for a letter to go from Westmeath to parts of County Meath.  A letter from remote parts of Westmeath reaches London or Liverpool far quicker than it reaches an adjoining townland, perhaps a stone's throw away.  If there is a midday delivery each day there is no delay. In actual practice it takes two days for a letter from some parishes in Westmeath to get to parishes in County Meath, and <i>vice versâ.</i>  That state of affairs should be ended, particularly in counties that have so many trade connections.</P>
    <P>Reference was made last year to the cost of air-mail facilities, which were reduced to certain parts of the world. The reduction was not universal.  The result is that if a person is unscrupulous, or, if you like, dishonest enough, he can send his correspondence by air-mail to South America via England, and get it through at one-third of the cost from here, by having it posted in England.  I do not know if the Department would lose much if they reduced the cost of air-mail correspondence to the Argentine from 5/- to the rates that prevail in the Six Counties and in England.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this is the time to advocate a better postal service for this House, but I think the worst advertisement for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is the penny-in-the-slot machine in the hall, where sometimes, when a penny is put in, no stamp is delivered, or otherwise two stamps may be delivered.  Is that a criterion of the service here?  If I am in order, I suggest that the service we <Col N="1170" /> have here should be improved, because the facilities for Deputies, who work in the House when the Dáil is not sitting, are inadequate.  Deputies should, at least, have the facilities that are provided throughout the country or at cross-roads for getting stamps and sending telegrams.  I drew the Minister's attention before to the fact that the trunk services in Leinster House are very bad.  The Minister explained the difficulties to me, and I am sure the Department is doing its best to overcome these difficulties.  I am not a technician, and I know nothing about the technique of the very complicated question involved in the telephone service, but the newspapers tell of lines in operation in other countries that take ten calls at a time.  We are told that such a service is to be established between this country and Great Britain, and that one has been provided in Cork.  May I agitate that the Minister should speed up such a service all over the country?  The sooner it is done the better.  As the telephone has become a part of the life of the ordinary people, I would like to see its use greatly developed, and in my constituency. In places like Rathowen, which is a dispensary district, a parish area and a Gárda station, there is no telephone available, while the service has been opened up in other places where none of these activities exist.  I do not know the reason for that.  I am not begrudging the service to any area in which it has been provided, but I would like to see it in vital places like the one I mentioned.  Accordingly I advocate its development generally as quickly as possible.  I do not depreciate the services rendered by the Post Office and the benefits it confers on the community.  My point is that the services it provides should be second to none.  There is a big field for development in the postal services, in the telephone service, and in the telegraph service, and the Minister should make a special effort to provide them for the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that this is the one Department in which, in my opinion, there has been <Col N="1171" /> an improvement within the past year. At the same time, there is very much yet to be done, and much leeway to be made up in the way of providing better facilities.  I should like the Minister to take notice of conditions in the Waterford post office.  At the general post office on the quays the work of the staff is so hampered by the small space that is available that under present conditions justice cannot be done to the taxpayers.  I believe if the Minister could see the conditions there he would, at the earliest possible moment, endeavour to have them put right.  If the Minister would at any time come down and inspect the building I should be pleased to accompany him.  I believe that, having seen it, he would at the earliest possible moment have the matter rectified.  The present building does not do justice to Waterford City, and I believe it is not the wish of the Minister that it should remain in its present condition.  Deputy Norton has spoken about this matter, and it is not necessary for me to say anything further than to ask the Minister to have it rectified at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the telephone system in this country, I am quite prepared to admit that it has improved in the past year, but there is still much to be done. First of all, I would suggest that the instalment charge should be reduced. That reduction, as well as a reduction in the yearly rental, would encourage more subscribers.  Many people would have a telephone if the cost were within the limit of their means.  I should also like to refer to another matter, which has already been raised by other Deputies.  It is in regard to the necessity for a public telephone in the ordinary small country towns and villages. I am acquainted with several not very small towns where the telephone call office closes down at 7 o'clock in the evening.  That means that the people have to go a distance of, perhaps, ten miles if they want to make an urgent telephone call necessitated by a death, a motor breakdown, or anything else. They could, of course, go and knock up a neighbour's house.  The neighbour <Col N="1172" /> may be good enough to answer them, but everybody knows that he would be less likely to answer after a certain hour, and in any case one does not like trespassing on people's generosity. There is always the possibility that the neighbour might say: &ldquo;Why have you not got a telephone of your own, instead of coming bothering me?&rdquo;  I suggest that it would be well if the Minister would take this matter seriously. I believe that anybody in his Department who has an ounce of sense will realise that it is a necessity to have, in an ordinary country town or village, a public call office which will be open after 7 o'clock, so that people can make a telephone call at any time through the night.  Matters do not always work out just as one wishes; everything which would necessitate a telephone call will not conveniently happen before 7 o'clock.  In those districts on Sunday you cannot make a telephone call.  That means that from Saturday evening at 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock on the following Monday morning those districts are without a telephone.  I believe that the Minister should, and I am sure he will, look into this matter and have it rectified as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The delay in the delivery of telegrams from country post offices has already been referred to here.  I believe the people are quite satisfied with the present delivery rate of 3d., but I myself have had experience of a telegram being delivered three hours after it had arrived at the post office.  Sometimes it is said that the weather was too wet.  Sometimes it is said that the post office could not get a man or a boy to deliver the telegram.  I want to know is that good business?  Personally, I say it is not, and it is a matter that the Minister should look into.  I will give the Department credit for the fact that it has livened up a bit in some ways within the last year, but that does not apply to this matter of telegrams.  In one case which came to my notice, a telegram had been lying in the post office for 3½ hours before it was delivered.  It happened to be in connection with an important matter, and it was too late to be of any use when it eventually did arrive.  It was <Col N="1173" /> no consolation to the man to whom that telegram was addressed to be told that there was nobody available to deliver it.  I think that, no matter what the cost may be, there should be a certain staff ready to deliver telegrams. Another Deputy has referred to similar delays in Cork.  It will be seen, therefore, that they are not confined to any one area.</P>
    <P>In regard to the daily delivery of letters, I asked a question to-day about a particular district &mdash; Ballynoe, near Cappoquin, County Waterford.  Certain farmers in that district have letters delivered to them on only three days a week.  Now, those people are taxpayers, and even if it involves an extra cost, I believe they are entitled to a daily delivery of letters.  I am sure that if the matter is looked into in the Department a way will be found out of the difficulty.  As I say, even if it does cost extra money, it would be money well spent.  That is all I have to say on this Estimate, but I would again ask the Minister to look into those matters and have them rectified as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I did intend to make some suggestions to the Minister as to a few ways in which he might spend a little of this surplus money, but I am afraid Deputy Mrs. Redmond has forestalled me.  She has said much of what I was going to say, and said it much better than I could.  First of all, with regard to telegrams, I am acquainted with some of the country offices, and I know that when a telegram arrives its delivery depends on whether the children are going home from school, what direction they are going in, or some other incidental matter.  If the children are not going home from school, the telegram is left until such time as somebody turns up who might oblige by delivering it. I have been making inquiries as to the cause of that, and I have been told that it is the fault of the Department, because they will not allow sufficient money to pay delivery fees. The most that would be allowed is something like 3d.  In the cases I am referring to, the Post Office would be within one mile, so there would be free delivery.  I believe that 3d. is too <Col N="1174" /> small an amount for which to expect a messenger to go almost a mile with a wire.  There ought to be a little more liberality in this matter.  After all, telegrams are usually sent with the idea of having a message delivered quickly.  If the telegrams are delivered at any time which pleases the Post Office, it is not worth while sending them at all.  Deputy Kennedy has referred to the cost of the telegram, and suggested that it might be reduced.  Might I suggest a way in which it could be reduced without much loss to the Department?  Some telegrams might be of such a nature that they would require to be delivered quickly, while in the case of others it might not matter if they were not delivered for three or four hours.  Could there not be a concession made for slow deliveries in cases like that?  Where a wire has to be delivered immediately, the full price might be charged, but, in cases where there is no hurry and where the wire might possibly be sent by the next postal delivery, a concession might be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter which I want to mention, and which has already been referred to by Mrs. Redmond, is in regard to telephone calls.  In the country, after 7 o'clock at night, we cannot get a telephone call except we go to the nearest Guards' barracks. If the telephone offices were open up to 10 or 11 o'clock at night, there would certainly be a great deal more telephones in use.  After all, you can get a telephone anywhere during the day, but after 7 o'clock, when the telephone is really wanted, it is impossible to get it unless you go, perhaps, quite a long journey.  I remember some years ago you could make a telephone call at any hour you liked, and the cost was nothing more than it would be in the daytime.  At the same time, the rental was only about half what it is now.  I believe that the rental at the present time is excessive. If that rental were reduced, you would have a great many more people installing the telephone.  The reduction would in the long run be no loss to the Department; the additional number of subscribers would more <Col N="1175" /> than compensate for it.  That is all I want to say, except to emphasise that there ought to be some way of delivering telegrams instead of depending on school children to take them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the plea made by Deputy Norton and other Deputies in reference to the conditions of Post Office workers, and to appeal to the Minister, who claims that he himself is the Minister of a Government which is a worker's Government, to face up to the fact that, if the Government is a worker's Government, they should treat the workers in the Post Office and other public services in a proper and Christian-like way.  One thing, at least, that can be said to the credit of the late Cosgrave Government is that they never claimed that they were a worker's Government but, notwithstanding the fact that they never made that claim, as far as I can see, from the development of the policy of the present Government, the Cosgrave Government acted in a much more humane way towards the workers, although they did not claim to be a worker's Government, than the present Government, which does claim to be a worker's Government, has acted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The surplus which appears to be available at the present time can go a very long way, if the Minister has the desire to use it in that direction, to meet the reasonable claims of the Post Office employees, who are known to be the worst paid workers in the Government service.  I also want to support the appeal &mdash; and I hope it will find some response in the ear of the Minister &mdash; for the extension of the existing postal deliveries.  I think it is within the right of every citizen of this State, no matter what part of the country he lives in, to have a daily postal delivery.  I believe that if you decide to have a daily postal delivery in every part of this State and to give every citizen equal facilities, from a Post Office point of view, in this matter, it will prove to be a less costly undertaking than the advisers of the Minister now seem to think.  At any rate, the people are entitled to have <Col N="1176" /> a daily service, and I hope the Minister will take his courage in his hands and decide to put that policy into operation before the end of the present financial year.</P>
    <P>I have heard some Deputies refer, and rightly refer, to the lack of telephone facilities in rural areas, particularly after 7 o'clock at night.  It is well known that any telephone facilities that are available after that time are provided, in most cases, in the rural areas, by the goodwill of the Civic Guards.  Now, I understand that the Civic Guards have an instruction from the Commissioner and from the Minister for Justice not to allow their telephones to be used on public business. On that account, I think there is a very genuine case to be made for the extension of telephone facilities and the placing of those telephone facilities within the reach of any small group of citizens of this State, whether they are living in villages, towns or rural areas.  It very often happens, as far as I can see, that people, whether poor or otherwise, find it necessary to make a sudden call upon the local doctor.  I think that, instead of compelling such people to provide motor transport or other means of conveyance involving a considerable delay, telephone facilities, in a civilised country and a country that is supposed to be making progress, should be available for purposes of that kind or for any other purpose, whether by night or day, or after 7 p.m.  Telephone facilities should be available for the citizens for any purpose they may require them for.</P>
    <P>I also want to draw attention to another matter about which I made representations many months ago without any effect up to the present time.  I am referring to the provision of a better postal delivery service in the town of Tullamore.  A memorial was sent by the principal business people of that town many months ago. It was sent direct to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and a copy was sent, I presume, to every Deputy for the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly I made representations to the Minister many months ago in connection with that matter, but so far there has been <Col N="1177" /> neither a denial nor an admission that the claim for better delivery facilities in that town is reasonable and right. The town of Tullamore is a big industrial centre, with a new factory, recently established, which will increase to a considerable extent the business previously done in that particular town.  I do not know how long the Minister thinks it should be necessary to take in investigating a claim of that kind, but at any rate, after four or five months of consideration, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs ought to be in a position to inform the memorialists as to whether or not they are likely to respond to their appeal.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters which I do not want to deal with because they have been referred to by other Deputies.  The Post Office Department appear to take the view that they are a commercial concern, entitled to earn a certain sum per year and to accumulate a certain surplus.  If they are a commercial concern, entitled to get a profit on the business they carry out during the year, then let them at least set themselves up as a model commercial concern, do their business on up-to-date lines, and provide the people with the necessary postal and telephone facilities which an up-to-date and progressive nation is supposed to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the plea for a better postal service.  A number of other Deputies have mentioned the question of a daily post in rural areas.  As far as my own constituency is concerned, there is quite a number of rural areas that have only postal facilities three days a week, and I think, as Deputy Davin said, that they are just as much entitled as anybody else to have a daily postal service.  Even in some of the towns that have a daily service, however, I regret to say that that service does not at all correspond to the service of 20 or 30 years ago.  In my own town there was one daily post 20 years ago, and there used to be a midday post.  At the present time we are up against this difficulty from the point of view of any person who has business by letter with Dublin, that <Col N="1178" /> in order for a letter to reach the town for to-morrow's post it must be posted before 4 o'clock.  Otherwise it will take two days to be delivered.  I suggest that it is extraordinary that a letter posted in Dublin should take two days to reach a town 160 miles away.  I think the Minister should look into that.  As I say, 30 years ago or so there were two posts in the town and at the present time it is only once in a blue moon that we actually are able to get a letter in a day.  Most people do not think of posting before 4.15 p.m., and they wait until their offices are closing to post their letters. The result is that it takes two days for the letter to reach us.  In fact, as a result, I know of people in business in that part of the country who have a habit of writing at the bottom of a letter: &ldquo;Post before 4.15 if you want us to get a reply the next day.&rdquo;  The Minister should provide us with that facility and he should see at least that a letter posted in Dublin should reach us the next day and that we should not have to wait two days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of telephones, I know of a number of people in the smaller country towns who would instal telephones were it not for the fact that they feel that they would not get any great benefit from having a telephone. There is a post office in the town, and, since they may not have very much telephoning to do, they do not think it any great hardship to walk down to the post office and telephone.  The reason they give is that they would have to pay the installation fee, and the other necessary charges for the privilege of having a telephone installed, and they do not see why they should have to pay about £6 a year for the privilege of not having to walk a few hundred yards on the occasions on which they might want to telephone.  If the telephone service were extended throughout the night and on Sundays and holidays and occasions like that, I imagine that a greater number of people in rural areas would instal telephones.  To give an instance in that connection, take the case of a Sunday followed by a Bank Holiday, as in the case of Easter Monday or the first Monday in August.  The rural <Col N="1179" /> areas are entirely isolated practically from 7 o'clock on the Saturday evening until 8 o'clock on the following Tuesday morning.  Very often a necessity may arise to use the telephone.  And the great difficulty is that, even if a person had a telephone, it would not be much use to anybody who wanted to use it during the night, because the person with a private 'phone in a country town or rural area would not have any means of getting in touch with the Exchange after 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock on the Saturday evening. There would not be anybody in the rural post office to put them through in case they wanted to make a call.  I believe that in rural areas you would find ten times as many people installing telephones if they were satisfied that they would have a service at night, and on Sundays.  At the present time those services are not available, and I trust the Minister will consider this matter very seriously.</P>
    <P>With regard to the late delivery of telegrams, I often have wondered how the system works.  I am not quite clear on the point, and I should like some information.  In a number of rural offices, indeed in fairly large towns in the country, there is no permanent messenger boy retained to deliver telegrams.  The boy who delivers is paid by the job, apparently; he is not a salaried official.  I think that is one of the reasons for the slackness in the delivery of telegrams.  In a number of country towns that I knew a considerable period ago, there used to be telegraph boys, apparently permanent boys, who had uniforms and bicycles, and their job was to deliver telegrams.  They do not appear to be utilised now in many offices, and any boy who delivers a telegram is just paid for the job.  That is the system that is in operation, and it is possibly the cause of the slackness in delivery, and particularly the late deliveries.</P>
    <P>I should like to give one instance of how serious sometimes is the late delivery of a telegram.  About two years ago a man made a bitter complaint to me about the delay in delivering a particular telegram.  He was practically heartbroken.  He had a <Col N="1180" /> friend in England from whom he expected a telegram.  He got his wire all right, and the delay was not very great, only 15 minutes.  But, small as the delay would seem to us, it made all the difference in the world, because his pal in England had promised him a tip for a particular race.  He was to get the tip by telegram; it came a quarter of an hour late.  The man was late with his bet, and the horse won. It is very hard luck on him that he had not a claim against the Department for the money he would have won if he had got the telegram in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in support of those who have been advocating better facilities for people living in remote rural areas. I think it will be agreed generally that the services which the Post Office is providing in many rural areas are antiquated.  They are no better than, and perhaps not quite as good as, the services of 20 or 30 years ago.  It is about time that the Post Office woke up to the fact that the people in the rural areas are entitled to as good service as those living in the cities and towns.  Twelve months ago the Minister told us that he was going to provide a six-day postal service in the rural area.  He did so to a limited extent.  When the Budget is introduced we hope that the Government will by then have seen their way to increase that service.  They certainly should endeavour to provide a six-day delivery in all rural areas.  There are still areas in the country that have only two deliveries in the week and, strange to say, they are within a short distance of towns.  I know one district that has a three-day delivery and it is within one and a half miles from the town post office.  It is time that system was changed and that the Post Office started deliveries every day in the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the telegraph service, the Minister stated that he could not increase the number of words on a 1/-telegram from nine to 12.  Perhaps he forgets that five of the words very often constitute the address, and that leaves you only four words for the message. The 1/- telegram is of very little use when you can put only four words into <Col N="1181" /> it.  In many cases the address accounts for at least five words.  I think that is a matter the Minister might favourably consider.  Deputy Cole suggested a system of deferred delivery of telegrams in remote areas where there is no great urgency.  You have that system in connection with cablegrams overseas and there is a lower rate because of the deferred delivery.  If that system were applied to rural areas it might solve the problem where telegraph boys are not available.  In the case of urgent telegrams it is very unfair that they are not delivered immediately.  There should be provision made for immediate delivery of urgent telegrams where there is a post office or a telephone exchange office.</P>
    <P>The need that exists for a night telephone service in rural areas has been referred to.  Very many people have approached me within the last couple of years, wanting to know why they could not use the telephone at night. They were quite prepared to instal telephones if they were assured of a night and a Sunday service.  I believe it is quite true you would have thousands of telephones installed in rural areas if the people could use them at night and on Sundays.  Why is there not some facility given in this connection?  Only in one post office out of every 50 will you find a night man on duty, and you need such a man in order to permit the telephone service to operate during the night.  I think the time has arrived when the Post Office should provide a night man in every country town office.</P>
    <P>Then, again, there is a grievance with regard to the delay in installing telephones in rural areas.  Complaints have been made to me with regard to the delay in extending the telephone. The Department plead that it takes a considerable time, and there is also an excuse about shortage of staff.  If they have not sufficient staff at the moment they should increase the number.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the postal facilities in Leinster House.  These could be improved without very much trouble.  I think the Minister should consider the question of installing an automatic stamping machine or franking machine, and not have Deputies, <Col N="1182" /> who have gone to the trouble of writing letters for hours, licking stamps in order to stamp these letters.  They should be provided with some stamping or franking machine; they could give the letters to some official and pay the cost of postage, and then have the letters franked.  There is a stamp machine in the building, but for long periods there are no stamps in it and, indeed, it is of very little use here at all.  I hope the Minister will pay particular attention to the rural areas. I consider that they are entitled to greater facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will recognise that the Accountants Branch is a very important part of the machinery at the headquarters of the Post Office.  I should like to call his attention to a matter affecting the staffing and the organisation of that branch.  There are, I think, a number of vacancies in the establishment of Post Office accountants.  There are a number of duties which, I think, have been recognised by the higher officials in the Minister's Department as duties to be performed by officers of inappropriate grades.  Over 12 months ago there was a revision of the staffing in that office.  An inspection was carried out, but since then nothing has happened.  I would be glad if the Minister could provide some information on that subject, and if he would look into the matter with a view to carrying out the recommendations, if any, of the officers who, over 12 months ago, inspected the duties in the Accountants Branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not desire to cover the field already covered so well by Deputy Norton, but I should like to endorse what he has said in regard to the under-payment of Post Office employees. It may be that the point of view which the Minister will express in that matter is that the payment of the Post Office staff must bear some relation to whether or not the Post Office is making a profit, and the extent of that profit.  I do not think that the question of the pay of Post Office servants, or the servants of any other State Department, should be regarded in that way. The question of profit or loss in the <Col N="1183" /> Post Office should bear no relation whatever to the payment of any official in the Post Office.  The Post Office workers have a claim, and a just claim, to a decent wage, and it is a disgrace to the State that it should employ people under the conditions under which many of the Post Office employees are employed.</P>
    <P>No doubt it is good news for every Deputy that the Post Office provides a surplus, but the Post Office exists, first and foremost, for the purpose of providing a service.  Many Deputies have appealed for improved services &mdash; for better telephone facilities in rural areas, night services, Sunday services, more deliveries and so on &mdash; and I am in complete sympathy with the point of view of those Deputies; but I should like the Deputies who make those pleas to face up to the fact that improving these services may possibly mean the disappearance of the surplus which the Minister is always glad to be able to present to the House.  I think that Post Office workers should be properly paid and services improved, no matter what the cost is, and whether it means the disappearance of the surplus or not.  We do not expect the Department of Local Government and Public Health necessarily to be run at a profit, or on a profit-making basis, and we do not expect any of the Departments of State to show a profit except in the form of the welfare of the people, and I do not think that profit or loss should be the chief consideration in determining the Minister's attitude towards improved services and improved pay, so far as the Post Office is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies who have already spoken on this Estimate have, as usual, left very little unsaid, but there are one or two points I should like to raise.  One might infer from the repeated references to the unsatisfactory nature of the telephone service throughout the country, that the service was satisfactory in Dublin, but I can very definitely say that that is very far from being a fact. The telephone service in the City of Dublin was never more unsatisfactory <Col N="1184" /> than it is to-day.  Deputy Norton painted a very vivid picture of the unsuitability of the Crown Alley exchange but he dealt with it mainly from the point of view of the unsuitable accommodation for the staffs.  A much more important aspect of its unsuitability is that the telephone service provided by that particular exchange is extremely bad.  In saying that I do not wish in any way to cast an aspersion on the officials working in that exchange because the defect may be a purely mechanical one.  The Minister in his statement referred to a proposed extension of cross-Channel communication facilities.  Might I suggest to the Minister that, knowing as he does the unsatisfactory nature of the service in the City of Dublin, his energies might much better be directed towards improving the service as it exists, before he deals with an extension of the service.</P>
      <P>It is very well known that this country is the least telephone-minded nation in the world.  I do not for one moment think that is due to the reticent character of the Irish race. I think it is rather due to the fact that telephone rentals are far too high and the Minister, with a surplus of £300,000, might, without taking any great risk, reduce these rentals considerably. I am quite sure that if he did that, the loss in revenue would very quickly be offset by the increased number of users of the telephone service. He might also devote some of his surplus to ameliorating the conditions of the many underpaid officials in that service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that nearly every Deputy must admit that the Minister's statement from one point of view was pleasing, that is, the advances made and the extra facilities given by the Post Office in recent years, but I hope the time is not far distant when these facilities will be further extended.  In some of the rural areas the public were greatly facilitated this year by improved services in connection with the delivery of letters, but there are still rural areas left out.  I have been informed, on inquiry into the matter, that the Department arranges these deliveries <Col N="1185" /> on an economic basis and taking every district by itself.  I think that is a bad system.  I think that, whether the Department has a surplus or not, facilities in the shape of a delivery every day should be provided in every rural area.  After all, the man living in a remote district, far from towns and villages, needs his daily letter just as much as the man living in the heart of a big city, and, sometimes, that letter may be of greater importance to him than it would be to some of those who live in the cities.  I trust the Minister will take that into consideration when reviewing the position for the coming year.</P>
      <P>An allusion was made a while ago by a Deputy to messenger boys.  I do not agree with the view he put forth. As far as the rural post offices are concerned, I hold that the delivery of telegrams is as good as could be expected.  Some of those post offices would not justify the wage that should be paid to a messenger boy.  Very often a postman is employed in a small district and after he has finished his morning delivery he is given the job of delivering telegrams for the rest of the day; that is, after his morning's work is done.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter that I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  That is with respect to the waterproof capes which postmen wear on their rounds in rural areas. These capes should be replaced much oftener than they are.  I happen to know that in wet weather postmen find great difficulty in preserving the mails from being damaged by the rain.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Allen in what he said as regards postal facilities in Leinster House.  When the Dáil is in session the post office is open all right.  But if a Deputy has to remain in Dublin the day following the Dáil meeting to attend to his Parliamentary business, he must leave the House and go out and buy stamps.  When there is a post office in the House one would think that should not be necessary. Until we get those franking machines that Deputy Allen mentioned I think that at least the post office should be open for a few hours every day when the Dáil is not in session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak at any great length on this Vote for the reason that Deputy Mrs. Redmond has gone over all the ground that I intended covering.  However, I would specially like to draw the attention of the Department to the necessity for the installation of public telephones in a number of villages in West Mayo.  I will mention a few of them. Take, for instance, Lahardane.  Lahardane is a small village.  There is a police barrack there and a doctor.  If there is a necessity for a second doctor and anything sudden takes place the next doctor is 15 miles away.  The village is 25 miles from the county hospital.  I believe that a public telephone would be a paying proposition in Lahardane.  In addition to being a paying proposition it would be of great benefit to the area.</P>
      <P>The next village to which I wish to refer is Lacken.  That is a very backward, badly-served area, though it is thickly populated, and what I have said about Lahardane applies also to this village.  Then there are Achill and Keel.  They are very badly served and are both very remote.  The next is Belmullet.  Belmullet is 50 miles from the county hospital.  There is around this area a very big tourist traffic in the summer time, and when a car breaks down there is no way of getting into communication with places 30 or 40 miles away where one might get a car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to Blacksod village, which is 70 miles from the county hospital.  What I have said of the other villages about the matter of a doctor applies there when a second doctor is required.  Being able to get into rapid communication with a doctor in that area might sometimes mean saving somebody's life.  As I have said, the distance is 70 miles to the county hospital, and I believe a telephone would pay in that area.  At all events it is absolutely necessary. Then there is the village of Mulranny, which happens to be in about the same position in respect of telephone service. Mulranny is about 20 miles from the county hospital.  I might have mentioned that Belmullet is 60 miles <Col N="1187" /> from a railway station and it is without a telephone service.  There is a police barracks there.  Those villages that I have mentioned now are very remote and without public telephones. I believe a public telephone would be a paying proposition, and even if it were not a paying proposition it is necessary, in the interests of the people in those districts, that they should be linked up with the outside areas.  A public telephone would be of immense benefit to the people there.  These areas are more or less cut off from railway accommodation altogether; the great bulk of transport work is being done by lorries.  In such circumstances a telephone service would be most useful.  One service would work in with the others.</P>
    <P>The last point to which I wish to refer is the way in which the Department differentiates between private users and the general public.  The private telephones are open from 8 to 10 o'clock, but the service is closed to the public after 8 o'clock.  I think that is not fair to the public.  Why should they be closed to the public after 8 o'clock while they are still open to the private users?  Surely when the post office is at work until 10 o'clock dealing with private telephones one would feel that the same should also apply to the public generally.  By opening the post office telephones to the public, the Department would be serving the whole community.  These few remarks, I think, finish all that I wish to say, for the other points that I had intended speaking on have been dealt with by Deputies who have spoken already.  In conclusion, I would specially direct the attention of the Minister to the villages I have mentioned.  They have been for years asking for a telephone service, and up to the present they have failed to get it.  I hope the Minister will bear my appeal in mind, and that when he comes before us next time he will be able to say a telephone service has been installed in these villages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of this debate many appeals of a more or less deserving character have been made <Col N="1188" /> to the Minister.  I hope he will not regard my appeal as the least of them. I am speaking on behalf of a most deserving body, the sub-postmistresses and sub-postmasters throughout the country.  We have heard a great deal about grievances, but I think if anybody will examine the conditions of service under which sub-postmistresses and sub-postmasters are working he will begin to wonder how it is that the public are getting from these badly-paid servants the facilities that they are getting.  They work 87 hours a week, from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., where there are ten or more telephone subscribers. They have to put in three hours' work on Sundays as well.  The Government have been framing regulations for the shortening of hours in industrial and commercial employment. Yet their own servants are not being given any consideration in this matter of hours of service.  I suggest that the Government ought set a good example themselves.</P>
      <P>Then what is the remuneration that the Government are giving those people for the very responsible and arduous duties they perform?  I have before me a typical case where a man with a salary of £68 a year is responsible for all the work of his post office. He has to supply premises for the post office, he has to provide light, coal and all the other equipment that goes with the post office, and he is responsible for all the cash transactions in that office.  He has an assistant to whom he is paying £18 a year, with board and lodging, which brings up the wage to £44, leaving himself a salary of £24 per annum for all the duties of that office.  Working out his time, at 14 hours a day and 4 hours work on Sunday, it would come to 1½d. an hour. This matter has been repeatedly ventilated already, and it has given rise to some controversy in the Press.  Yet nobody worries about it.  We are told that these positions are very eagerly sought after by shopkeepers in small towns and villages.  That is no excuse for paying this miserable wage.  It gives the State no excuse for retaining in its service people who are vested with a great deal of responsibility and paying them a miserable wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> Sometimes one hears of lapses of a very undesirable character taking place.  Yet one can scarcely wonder that persons who are handling such large sums of money as they do handle, and getting such small remuneration, should take what is not their own.  I should say that it is very injudicious on the part of the Department to continue those people in the service at a starvation rate of wage, with the long and almost impossible hours of work to which they are condemned at present.  I sincerely trust that the Minister will give this his very earnest consideration and see if something cannot be done to put these public servants on some sort of a fair footing having regard to their long hours and the arduous work they perform for the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Vote was before the House last year, I remember drawing the attention of the Minister to the very point that is now being raised by Deputy Keyes.  I think it is a perfect scandal that these people are treated in the way that they are.  Not alone have they to supply a free house to the Department but their salary, even without taking that into account at all, is not sufficient to cover their activities.  They are disfranchised as citizens of the State.  We are told these low salaries are due to the fact that there is very keen competition for these appointments whenever there is a vacancy, and that the Minister takes advantage of that and pays these people such a very small amount for the services they render.  I would appeal to the Minister to go into that matter thoroughly.  He will find that there is a very grave and serious need to look into it and that these people are not paid for the services they render.  It is not so easy at present to supply a house, fire and light, with service, for possibly £40 or £50 and even, in some cases, less than that down the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be some confusion in regard to the point raised by Deputies about the telephone service.  It is a fact that where there are less than a certain number of subscribers, even the private subscriber has no service after <Col N="1190" /> seven or eight o'clock.  Something should be done to remedy that state of affairs.  Even if there happen to be six or seven subscribers in a district, they cannot take advantage of the phone, although they are paying well for it, after a certain hour at night.  Where people go to the trouble of installing a telephone, they should not be cut off in that way, particularly as the Minister was able to tell the House when presenting the Estimate, that that particular branch had yielded a profit&mdash;that in fact it was the only branch upon which he has made a profit.  He should spend that profit in facilitating subscribers by extending the service as far as he possibly can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather timid in approaching the Minister on a subject that has been mentioned frequently in this House before.  He is about the fifth Minister with whom this question has been raised.  I am only asking him to take a slightly different viewpoint from that which his immediate predecessor took and a totally different viewpoint from that which his more remote predecessors took.  I refer to the question of the delivery of telegrams in rural areas.  A charge is still being levied for deliveries over the three-mile limit.  I know his predecessor reduced the charge, but why should it be there at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I venture to say that the amount is so small now that it is scarcely worth while for an important Department like the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to collect it.  People living outside the three-mile limit are now in the position that they are not getting the same facilities or the same rights under the Constitution as those living within the limit.  It is a very poor plea to put up at this hour of the day to say that because a person does not live within a three-mile radius of the postal town, he has to pay an extra tax for the facilities which other people get without the payment of any extra tax.  To my own knowledge, I know of two offices where the messenger who works the whole district is paid by the fees collected from telegrams delivered outside the three-mile limit.  Therefore that messenger is <Col N="1191" /> provided free of charge for those who happen to live within that limit.</P>
    <P>I again put it to the Minister: is it worth while, from an economic point of view, to have these fees collected from people living outside the limit? A strong plea was made by other Deputies about rural postal deliveries, and the case was made that the people living in rural areas are entitled to the same service as people living in the more populous areas.  I agree, and I say that the same argument should apply to the telegraph service. Hitherto the House never seemed to be in sympathy with this proposal because the people living within a three-mile radius of a post office are the vast majority of the people.  I suppose their attitude might be compared to that of Hitler in Germany. There is no use talking to a bully, and the mass is sometimes a great bully.  I should like the Minister to take a different view, although he is a city man, to get away from the old tradition and to strike out on the principle of fair play and equal rights for all citizens.  I do not think I need say more except to make again an appeal which I have been making for the past 15 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L. Walsh Mr. L. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to draw the Minister's attention to one complaint, and that a very recent one, too.  So recently as last night, a business man in the town I have the honour to represent, had occasion to call up Holland. He called into Drogheda Post Office at twenty minutes to eight and he did not get through to London until ten minutes to ten.  From London he got through to Holland in exactly three minutes.  I think there is something radically wrong in the telephone service, particularly in that section which deals with cross-Channel calls.  It is a very serious state of affairs for commercial people in this country who want to get into communication with clients on the Continent to say that it will take two and a half hours to get through to London, while you can get through from London to Holland in three minutes.  That is a state of affairs that calls for a remedy.  With regard to the telephone service, and <Col N="1192" /> telephone charges and rents generally, I think the Minister would be well advised if he would adopt a policy of bigger trade and smaller profits.  I think that, in the end, he would find that the increased business would recoup him for any reduction in the fees which he charges.  After all, the telephone service is a public service. It is not right, in my opinion, that any Department of the Government should show a huge surplus while citizens are being taxed for services to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am somewhat disappointed by this Estimate.  In view of all the recent impositions and increased duties cast upon the Gárda Síochána, I fully expected that the latest imposition put upon them would be the onus of delivering the post each morning. However, I find we have not risen to that yet.  On the question of the telephone service generally, I think that, excluding the larger cities, it will be found that it is extremely bad.  Many of the instruments which the public in small country towns are forced to use are absolutely obsolete.  In fact, I am sure that if any persons living in country towns have the misfortune to lose their souls, and be damned, that terrible fate will in a large measure be attributable to the bad language they use over the telephone about inefficient instruments.  I have got an instrument at home, and I would much prefer to have to wind the handle of a barrel organ than to attempt to ring up a telephone exchange with it.  Judging from its appearance, one would say it savoured of Noah's Ark.  Then when one comes into the city one finds very efficient and nice instruments.  In the country, on the other hand, there are very obsolete instruments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that certain facilities are granted for night service in country towns.  The people, I think, who usually avail of them are doctors and people of that nature who require them, but there is a definite defect in that system.  Take a small town.  The number of people who are granted facilities for a night service are all on the one circuit.  You may have four or five people on the one circuit.  An <Col N="1193" /> unfortunate country doctor goes to bed after a hard day's work.  He has a telephone by his bedside, and the bell rings.  He is wakened up out of his sleep, perhaps to find the gentleman next door, having returned from a dance, ringing up to know has-his ladylove arrived home, or, perhaps, an inebriated gentleman ringing up his pal at the other end of the town to know was his wife up when he got home.  That is certainly a defect in the night system, to have five people on the same circuit, so that if A is rung up at night, the telephone of X, Y and Z also rings and they are wakened up.  I am not saying that it can be got over in a few moments, but it is a defect in the system.</P>
    <P>As to the scale of pay for sub-postmasters and mistresses, these people are certainly the Cinderellas of the service.  In some cases I believe they have to supply light, pens and notepaper as well as the actual premises. The only thing I believe which they have not to provide is the postman and his uniform.  In some cases I believe they get the munificent sum of £26 per annum, out of which they have to live, and perhaps have a fortnight's holidays on the Riviera.</P>
    <P>The last matter I want to refer to is the work at present going on at Collinstown Aerodrome under the auspices of the Minister.  I understand that a new line of communication is being made to the aerodrome from the city, on which there is a number of men working, some of them inside the aerodrome and some outside. I understand that the men working outside the aerodrome are paid 1/2½ an hour, but the men inside only get 10½d. per hour, so that the minute a man crosses into the aerodrome to lay the other end of the cable his wages are automatically reduced to 10½d. per hour.  That is an amazing thing.  It is actually happening in the County Dublin in connection with casual labourers employed by the Post Office. The result is that you could have two men carrying a 20-foot plank and the man at one end of the plank paid 10½d. an hour and the man at the other end 1/2½ an hour.  That may be a bit farfetched, but the actual position is that <Col N="1194" /> some men have been transferred from working inside and their wages have automatically been increased from 10½d. to 1/2½ per hour.</P>

      <P>Not yet, but if things continue as they are perhaps the only remedy will be a strike.  Of course, a man transferred from inside, and whose wages are increased, is hardly likely to go on strike.  But that is a state of affairs which should not be in existence in this country.  The only explanation of it that I can see is that the Minister, being a little more considerate than other Departments, pays the fairly decent wage of 1/2½ outside. In the aerodrome itself there are other men paid by another Department, and when a man working outside has to go into the aerodrome, then the Minister has to cease being Christian and human and reduce the man to the level of the people working under the other Department that is not paying the men a living wage.  That is a sad state of things which should be inquired into.</P>

I am sorry I was not here when the Minister introduced the Estimate, as I was anxious to know the result of the introduction last year of the 12-word telegram for 9d.  I was not very optimistic about that, and I am curious to know what the result has been.  I am told by a colleague that there was a substantial loss on the telegraph service.  If the Minister is going to retain the telegraph service at all he must at least do one thing involving two other things.  First of all, he must give value in the service rendered. Then there is the matter referred to by Deputy Gorey, of the charge on telegrams delivered outside a certain distance. What principle can be put forward for charging a peasant, living outside a stated area, an extra sum for having his telegram delivered?  Surely all the people cannot be expected to live within a certain area.  On what principle can an extra charge be justified on a man living 100 yards further away than his neighbour?  I never <Col N="1195" /> could understand that, and I cannot understand it yet.  I think it is an unjust, unfair, and improper imposition. Take a poor constituency like my own.  The further you go away from the post office the poorer the people get, and it is on these people that you impose this extra charge.  As a matter of fact, I have had cases where the only means of transmitting an urgent message to people was by telegram, and I refused to transmit the message because they lived some miles from the post office and I would not impose the extra charge on them.  I should like to hear from the Minister on what principle he justifies that tax on people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Hannigan made a general charge against the telephone service in the city.  It is quite easy to make a general charge or to make a charge against people who cannot come here to defend themselves.  I use the telephone as regularly as anybody else in this city and I find the service as efficient as anybody could humanly expect.  Deputy Dr. Hannigan made a general charge against the telephone staff.  My experience is that I found them as efficient as any body of people humanly could be.  If these people could come here to defend themselves I would not mind, but they cannot.  It was only last night when I arrived back from Donegal that I found a friend of mine had the honour to be elected to the new Seanad.  I rang up the exchange and asked how long I would have to wait for a trunk call to Donegal, and inside five minutes I was speaking to my friend.  In face of that it would be unjust on my part to allow a general charge to be made against such a body of people without protest.</P>

      <P>I am speaking as an ordinary citizen, and I do not want any smart remarks like that made.  I am only pointing out how unfair it is for anybody in this House to make a general charge.  The Deputy did not even quote one specific case.  As to the daily delivery of letters, I appreciate the difficulties involved in the <Col N="1196" /> general adoption of that, but I am anxious to know on what principle the Minister is proceeding in restoring the daily service.  Perhaps the Minister will ask what practical suggestion I have to make.  The suggestion I make is that he should take a map of the country generally and, in those places where there is most likelihood of daily business being transacted and of letters being required daily, he should restore the daily post.  I do not see why one area in the country should be picked out as an experiment.  The Minister should take a map of the country and, where there is a likelihood of daily transactions about oats or potatoes or pigs or cattle, owing to the intensity of the agricultural production, he should immediately restore the daily post in that area.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, when I came back to my house I opened a letter asking me to have the penny postage restored to an area of that kind.  I will be troubling the Department one of these days about it.  In this matter the Minister should adopt a principle and apply it generally throughout the country.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the Government should immediately establish machinery whereby conditions of employment in the Civil Service and other matters which may from time to time be in dispute between the Government and the Civil Service would be settled by agreement between representatives of the Government and of the Civil Service associations, and, in default of such agreement, would be submitted for decision to an independent arbitration board, the awards of which, subject to the overriding authority of the Oireachtas, the Government would undertake to implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject matter of this motion was before the House on several occasions. It would, perhaps, be inaccurate to say <Col N="1197" /> that the matter was debated.  Very largely, the discussions took place on speeches made by members of the Labour Party and by members of the Party to which I belong.  We had, I think, on no occasion any reasoned case made on behalf of the Government against the claims that have been put forward now for some years, on behalf of the Civil Service, for the establishment of an effective scheme of arbitration and conciliation for the determination of disputes or grievances which exist in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Over 12 months ago, Deputy Norton had down a motion calling upon the Government to receive representatives of civil servants, or of their organisations, with a view to seeing if agreement could be reached between the parties as to the setting up of this machinery for arbitration.  That motion was on the Order Paper for a long time.  It was opened by Deputy Norton, who gave an exposé of the position and of the arguments at considerable length, and with great cogency.  I followed.  The Minister did not, from that time, give any indication of the then Government's proposals, or what they intended to do with the matter, and the general election took place.</P>
    <P>At the outset of the remarks that I made on Deputy Norton's motion, I stated that it was my desire that this motion should be debated in the House in a strictly non-political atmosphere. I drew the attention of the House at that time to the fact that the then Government had, what they were fond of referring to as, a mandate from the people to set up arbitration machinery for the effective disposal of disputes between the Government and the Civil Service; that they had made certain promises at election time, and subsequent to election time, to the Civil Service; that the chief Opposition Party had committed themselves publicly in the Dáil and outside to the principle of effective machinery for arbitration with the Civil Service, and that, so far as I know, no protest had come from any Independent Deputies against the proposal.  During the course of the discussion that ensued <Col N="1198" /> on Deputy Norton's motion, no Independent member expressed any dissent from the motion.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, ought to have been, as I saw it at that time, that the proposal in reference to Civil Service arbitration machinery could have been, and ought to have been, approached and discussed on the merits of the case, and that really we had for once a topic on which all Parties could agree.  After the general election took place, as soon as it was possible, Deputy Doyle and I put down this motion.  It was amongst the first motions put upon the Order Paper, and that was done with the object of indicating and carrying out the policy that I indicated when Deputy Norton's motion was before the House, namely, that this matter ought to be, and could be, dealt with on its merits without any question of Party bias, Party affiliations or Party commitments.  We wanted, when that motion was put down, that it should be taken at the earliest possible moment, in the atmosphere of a new Dáil and in an atmosphere in which it could not be stated that we or those associated with us were advocating this reform, in which we believe, with a view merely of catching votes. That could not be said of a motion which was put down immediately after a general election when the Government had obtained, perhaps precariously but still obtained, a majority in the House.  It could not be said of such a motion that it was put down with a view to catching the votes of a few civil servants in perhaps five years' time.</P>
    <P>I want to say again that this is a motion with which all Parties in the House are in full agreement, with the possible exception of the very Ministers who committed themselves up to the hilt in their public utterances and in their private assurances to their political associates some years ago. The claim that is put forward &mdash; which I advocate and which the Party that I represent stands for&mdash;by the Civil Service can be stated shortly.  The Civil Service has agitated over many years for the setting up of effective arbitration and conciliation machinery <Col N="1199" /> on lines corresponding as nearly as possible, in view of the difference in circumstances here in this country, with that which exists in the British Civil Service for many years past, and which has worked very satisfactorily from the point of view both of the Civil Service and the Treasury, and incidentally, through the Treasury of the British taxpayer.</P>
    <P>We are not taking any leap in the dark by the proposals which are embodied and suggested for adoption by the House in the resolution I am moving because we have before us the experience of the working of similar machinery to that which we are asking to have set up here in the British Civil Service.  We have the advantage of  what that machinery is, and of how far it can be adapted to the conditions existing in this country, and to our own Civil Service.</P>
    <P>As I said on the discussion of Deputy Norton's motion, we do not advocate a slavish imitation of the British model.  But when we find, as we do find, that our Civil Service is based, and rightly based, on the British model; when we find that the financial structure of this State is based on, or analogous to, the structure of the British Constitution; when we find that in the British Civil Service, within the framework of the British Constitution, a tentative system of arbitration machinery has worked satisfactorily to all parties, we start in the consideration of these problems with the assurance that we are going to do nothing that is revolutionary and nothing that is going to cast any great burden on the taxpayers.  We have two parties to this dispute, if we may call it a dispute &mdash; the Civil Service, represented by its various organisations, and the taxpayer, who is represented by, or ought to be represented by, the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance is responsible to the Dáil in matters of finance, and, through the Dáil, to the people.  We have, therefore, in the consideration of proposals such as these to consider not merely the, perhaps, selfish interests of the Civil Service, but also the vital interests of the taxpayer.  In passing, <Col N="1200" /> I may remark that perhaps the interests of the taxpayer have not always been as jealously guarded in various matters by the Minister for Finance as, apparently, he intends to do in reference to the demands of the Civil Service.  At all events, it is his duty &mdash; and I recognise it to be such &mdash; to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer. Not merely do I recognise that, but the people I represent recognise it to be his duty and right.  So do the Civil Service and its organisations, I believe, recognise that right, because embodied in the motion I am moving is the overriding condition that all the recommendations which would be made by the arbitration board that would be set up to deal with these disputes and differences should be subject to the authority of the Dáil. The Civil Service and its organisations have made abundantly clear that all their proposals are subject to the overriding authority of the people's Parliament, and that principle must be firmly kept in mind in any discussions that will take place on these proposals.</P>
    <P>I do not intend at present to go down through the history of this matter. It has been covered again and again, and it was very elaborately covered by Deputy Norton on the last occasion on which this matter was discussed. A few words will be sufficient to put Deputies who may not have been here when the discussion took place on the last occasion in possession of the relevant facts.  Our Civil Service, as I said then and as I repeat to-night, is closely modelled on the British Civil Service.  Our financial structure is closely modelled on the financial structure of the British Constitution. When we were discussing this matter on the last occasion I dealt with the argument based upon constitutional law and practice as those matters bore upon the consideration of this topic.  I shall deal with them very shortly to-night before I finish.</P>
    <P>At that time, I was dealing with the Constitution enacted in 1922 and, particularly, the provisions of Articles 37 and 61.  I did throw out the suggestion <Col N="1201" /> that, in the amendment of the Constitution then spoken of but which had not then seen the light, if the Minister found any difficulty in connection with the arbitration proposals from a constitutional point of view, the opportunity was presenting itself when the Constitution came before the Dáil to set that matter right.  We have had the amendment of the Constitution enacted and I find that Articles 37 and 61 of the old Constitution are copied, if not verbatim, almost verbatim into the amendment of the Constitution enacted last year.  Article 37 finds its counterpart in Article 17 (2).  Article 61 of the original Constitution finds its counterpart almost verbatim in Article 11.  From the point of view of constitutional law, we find ourselves to-night in precisely the same position and governed by precisely the same constitutional requirements that existed on the 11th March last year, when this matter was first brought before the Dáil on Deputy Norton's motion.  I want to repeat my own declaration of faith in reference to the Civil Service &mdash; that I am convinced that for the preservation of this State, in order that this State may exist as a democratic entity and that its affairs will be conducted with efficiency, with honesty and without corruption, there is a vital necessity that there should be a contented and efficient Civil Service, independent of political considerations and, so far as possible, independent of political control.  At the same time, while it is essential in the public interest that there should be such an efficient and, as far as possible, independent Civil Service, another danger has to be avoided &mdash; the danger of bureaucracy.  I believe that both these dangers &mdash; the danger of political corruption, on the one hand, and the danger of bureaucracy, on the other hand &mdash; can best be avoided by the introduction of the arbitration and conciliation machinery proposed in this resolution.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service have advocated this course for some years.  At the general election in 1932, certain promises were made on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party to the electorate that, if returned <Col N="1202" /> to power &mdash; as they were subsequently returned to power &mdash; they would bring forward proposals for arbitration in the Civil Service.  Following upon that election promise, the Government set up in 1932 what came to be known as the Brennan Commission.  An intimation was apparently conveyed to that commission that the Government had accepted, in principle, the idea of arbitration for the Civil Service.  The Civil Service waited two years in the honest belief that the promises of the Party that subsequently became the Government would be carried through.  They waited for two years until the interim report of the Brennan Commission was published on the 5th February, 1934. That report came as a complete disappointment and disillusionment to the Civil Service because, while it pointed out that, apparently, the Government had accepted the principle of arbitration, that did not prevent members of the commission from really torpedoing the whole principle of arbitration for the Civil Service, for the reasons they purported to set forth in the interim report, and they accordingly set themselves out really to nullify the entire principle of effective arbitration for the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that the report was published somewhere about February 5th, 1934, and that the Government was to give effect to their promise of the principle of arbitration for the Civil Service, which they stated they accepted, no such proposals were given to the representatives of the civil servants until somewhere about June, 1935.  These proposals were promptly and unanimously turned down by the Civil Service organisations.  I think I am right in saying that they were such as did not embody one single principle underlying the principle of arbitration. They were nothing but a sham and a fantasy, and were promptly, effectively and speedily turned down by the Civil Service organisations.  From June, 1935, until the end of March, 1938, the Government have taken no steps whatever towards carrying out the principle which they said they had accepted in relation to arbitration for the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>An endeavour has been made here <Col N="1203" /> from time to time to get the Government to take up a stand one way or another on the matter.  The only overt act the Government has been responsible for in reference to the matter has been the promulgation to the Civil Service organisations of an alleged scheme of arbitration which in no single instance embodies the principle of effective arbitration in any way. We have not been able to get any statement of Government opinion in the course of these discussions. Perhaps we will be able to get it from the Minister on this motion and, if so, we will look forward to it with interest, in order to get now, after a lapse of so many years, what are the reasons which the Government have to put forward to justify the attitude they have adopted.  It may be that the Government will say, because they had turned down the Civil Service before the last election in July of last year, that they had now got a mandate from the people not to have arbitration for the Civil Service.  They came in fresh from the polls in 1932, after their promise to civil servants, and they now come here, some eight months after the last election.  They had a mandate from the people in 1932 to give effect to the principle they set out in their election manifesto, that of effective machinery for arbitration in the Civil Service.  That was conspicuously lacking in the manifesto that appeared at the last election. They had a mandate in 1932.  It is equally open to the Government now to say that they have no mandate, and that the people did not want this, because they returned the Fianna Fáil Party at the last election.  I propose, however, not to deal with these matters now.  I do not propose to examine the promises made in 1932 beyond telling the facts.  I want to discuss this as a question of principle.</P>
    <P>The only argument I have ever heard advanced &mdash; and the only argument that appears in the interim report of the Brennan Commission &mdash; against the idea of arbitration for the Civil Service is the argument based on the so-called unconstitutionality of the proposal.  It is with that aspect of the case I propose <Col N="1204" /> to deal now very shortly.  In effect, the answer is that if proposals were put forward by the Civil Service, that there should be arbitration machinery by which an independent board would be set up, with representatives of the Civil Service and the Minister for Finance on it, and with an independent chairman to decide between them, and if these proposals were put into force they, in effect, would be depriving the Dáil of the power it had over finance and the power of the purse.  If these proposals are unconstitutional, or would be unconstitutional under the existing Constitution or under the last Constitution, then they are unconstitutional in England.</P>
    <P>I have not yet heard from the Minister or from any spokesman in the Government ranks that they have got any legal opinion from anybody &mdash; I do not care who it is &mdash; that these proposals would be unconstitutional.  I have repeatedly pledged my opinion in public, and as explicitly as I could do it, that these proposals are not and were not unconstitutional, having regard to the constitutional provisions that existed up to December of last year.  I now state explicitly that they would not be in any way in contravention of any Articles of the Constitution that came into operation in December of last year.  I want to know if the Minister has any legal opinion to put against that opinion, and, if so, the reasons for it.  I gave reasons at great length on the last occasion.  There is nothing written down in the present Constitution in any particular Article or clause that would in any way prevent the proposals from becoming operative.  The civil servants have made it quite clear that the proposals they wish to put into operation are subject to the overriding authority of the Dáil.  The Minister has to agree that he will accept the recommendation of the award of the arbitration tribunal and will recommend that to the Dáil for acceptance.  The entire power lies with the Dáil to say whether or not the proposals embodied in the award of the arbitration tribunal will or will not be accepted by the people's representatives, <Col N="1205" /> acting in the interests of the general taxpayer.  I want to repeat what I said before, that it is possible under our system for a private citizen of the State to sue the State, through one of its departmental heads or a Minister of the State, and to get pecuniary judgment for any money or damages against the revenues of the State, and such a pecuniary award, whether of money or damages, may be confirmed by the highest court in this country, the Supreme Court of Justice.  Notwithstanding all that, the successful litigant who obtains such pecuniary judgment has no authority, nor is there any machinery in existence to enable him to enforce that award against the revenues of the State if the Dáil refused to vote the money required to discharge the amount of that award or judgment.  Even if the Dáil did appropriate specifically sufficient moneys out of the public purse to discharge such an award of the highest court of our country, it would not be possible for the successful litigant to enforce against the State, with the ordinary machinery available between private individuals, payment of the amount of his award.  There would be, therefore, no difference between the award of this arbitration board and the award of the Supreme Court of Justice or of the High Court of Justice from the point of view of the guardianship of the public purse. We have also the example of the tribunal presided over by Judge Davitt, dealing with claims under Article 10 by civil servants who deemed that their rights had been prejudicially affected, or who wished to retire in accordance with the conditions laid down in the Act of 1929. The awards of that tribunal could be flouted either by the Dáil or by the Minister if he so wished, if he had sufficient lack of public spirit or lack of sense of responsibility to do so. The point I wish to make is that any awards of the board which would be set up in accordance with the proposals of the civil servants would, from the point of view of constitutional law and from the point of view of the control of the public revenues of this State by the representatives of the people <Col N="1206" /> in Parliament, differ essentially very little from the awards of the High Court, or of the Supreme Court, or of the Judge Davitt tribunal dealing with claims under Article 10 of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I analysed and criticised the arguments or so-called arguments embodied in the interim report of the Brennan Commission in reference to the so-called unconstitutionality.  I want merely shortly to repeat here that there is no justification given in any single line of that report for the allegation that the proposals of the Civil Service are unconstitutional.  The only reference is a reference to what was then Article 37 of the Constitution, and which is now Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Constitution.  I pointed out and I repeat that the then Article 37 and now Article 17 (2) embodied a proposal with the same principle as exists in the Standing Orders of the British House of Commons.  It is a clause which provides that proposals for the expenditure of public moneys can only come from a responsible Minister, and after a formal message has come before the Dáil from the Government.  That principle is embodied as a principle of the unwritten law of the Constitution in England in one of the Standing Orders of the British House of Commons, but though it is named merely in the Standing Orders of the British House of Commons it is, in fact, one of the fundamental principles of the British Constitution in reference to the control by the House of Commons of the expenditure of public moneys.  That has nothing whatever to do with the proposals of the Civil Service.  The provisions in the Constitution merely prevent irresponsible Deputies &mdash; from political motives, in order to show that they are looking after the interests of their constituency &mdash; from making ridiculous and irresponsible proposals for the expenditure of public money.  The Government as a Government is supposed to have some sense of responsibility in reference to proposals for expending public money. The rule, therefore, is that no such proposals can be initiated except by means of a message from the Government, and through a Minister, a member of the Government.  What that has to do <Col N="1207" /> with the question of the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the proposals to set up arbitration between the Civil Service and the Government I entirely fail to comprehend.  I reiterate here now that there is nothing in the Constitution which in any way prevents the enactment into law of machinery of the type that the civil servants wish for.  Even if the proposals that they put forward were accepted by the Minister, were embodied in an Act of this Parliament, those proposals would still be within the letter and, in my opinion, also within the spirit of the constitutional provisions.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that there were two parties to this matter, one, the general taxpayer and the other the Civil Service.  I have a feeling that there is a third party lurking in the background.  There ought to be only two parties, the taxpayer and the Civil Service.  It ought to be possible to find some machinery which would satisfy the right demands, the just demands, and the right interests of both parties.  But because of this nebulous and grasping personality that exists in the background, I believe that the whole aim and object of the Civil Service is being frustrated in the interests not of the taxpayer, not of the Civil Service but in the interests of departmental control by the officials of the Department of Finance.  When we started the State here we started a Civil Service, and we modelled it upon the British Civil Service &mdash; a very sound model.  Unfortunately, in the taking over of that, we took over a lot of their old and bad principles and traditions. We took over many of the outworn traditions of the British Treasury in our Establishment Branch of the Department of Finance.  We took over the old view that civil servants were the creatures of their masters.  The masters were nominally the Executive Council representing the people, but the real masters were the bureaucrats who controlled them in the Department of Finance.</P>

He says he is here to-night to answer for the officials of the Department of Finance. I would be perfectly satisfied if he would answer for himself.  I am entitled to attack a system, and I repeat here that there is a third party at the back of all this, a third party in the shape of a kind of bureaucracy, in the Department of Finance &mdash; or, if the Minister likes, the Department <Col N="1209" /> of Finance that is trying to get bureaucratic control over the Civil Service, and to keep in existence the old and bad principles which they took over in the year 1922 and onwards, and which traditions the British civil servants have themselves shed in the setting up of the Civil Service machinery of arbitration which has been in operation in England for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can ride away on any irrelevancy he likes.  Some time or another he will have to come straight up against the issue, and the issue is this: Is he going to give any consideration to the demands of the civil servants? Is he even going to consider them?  Is he even going to condescend to give to the people's representatives here any arguments or alleged argument as to why this promise that was made in 1932, by the man who is now the head of the Government, by the man who is now Minister for Finance, and by various other members of the Party who form the Government Party in this House, to set up effective machinery for arbitration amongst civil servants, should not be kept?  I am not interested in hurling political arguments at the Minister based upon promises or failure to fulfil promises.  That thing stinks in the nostrils of the people throughout the country sufficiently without our drawing attention to it any further. Fianna Fáil promises have become a byword and a joke throughout the length and breadth of the country, and it is not necessary to repeat them here.  I am interested not in catching votes, not in gaining any political kudos for this Party over the Labour Party, over the Fianna Fáil Party, or any other Party.  I am interested because I have the interests of the civil servants at heart; because I know the civil servants better than the Minister knows them; because I have greater admiration for the personnel of the Civil Service than the Minister has; because I believe that those men in the Civil Service must be protected from bureaucracy and from the bad conditions that do undoubtedly exist and in reference to which these proposals, contrary to the demands of the Civil Service, are <Col N="1210" /> being pressed by the Departmental officials; and because, above all things, I am interested in the public interest, because I want an effective Civil Service, an efficient Civil Service, an independent Civil Service &mdash; a Civil Service that cannot be dismissed at the whim of a Minister such as has happened a few months ago&mdash;a Civil Service that will be free from the scandals that may be brought about by some future Government.  I am making no allegations against the present Government, but there is a future, we hope, for this nation, and I believe that the political future of this country depends upon our people being properly educated politically.  I believe there is a very long road to travel before our people will be politically educated.  In the meantime, in order that their democratic rights may be safeguarded and that government may be carried on by future Governments without corruption and in the general interests of the community, there must be an efficient Civil Service, an independent Civil Service, and an incorruptible Civil Service. For these reasons I believe that this machinery of arbitration should be set up in the public interest &mdash; not in the interest of a Party or even of the personnel of the Civil Service, but in the interest of an incorruptible Civil Service, an efficient Civil Service, and an independent Civil Service and, ultimately and in the last analysis, in the general interest of the public &mdash; of the people of this country at the present time and of the generations to be born in the future.</P>

      <P>I desire, Sir, to second the motion on the Order Paper. The question of providing machinery for the settlement of matters in dispute, as between the Government and the Civil Service, has been hung up for a considerable time, and it ought to be clear to all concerned that this matter must be settled sooner or later.  The Minister, I feel sure, is fully conversant with all the arguments that have been put before him from time to time in support of the claims of the civil servants, and Deputy Costello has dealt so fully with the matter this evening that I need not occupy the time of the <Col N="1211" /> House at any length except to say that I desire to be associated with Deputy Costello's remarks and that I feel content, in appealing to the Minister, that in honour and justice he ought to give effect to this motion.  It is a matter of honour, because the Leader of the Government Party pledged himself to set up effective arbitration machinery for civil servants in the form sought. If it is the case that the proposal of the civil servants is not acceptable to the Government, it ought to be the position of the Government to suggest something that would be accepted.  It is a matter for justice, because the civil servants are subject to a variety of restrictions and limitations which do not apply to any other persons employed, and owing to the curious interdependent link which exists between them and the State there is a definite need for independent arbitration on matters which come into dispute as between the Government and the civil servants, and I think that there should be some effort made to end that state of affairs.  It cannot be in the interests of the country to allow discontent and disgruntlement to drag on indefinitely in the ranks of such a large and valuable section of our people.  Ministers from time to time have paid tribute, and rightly so, to the zeal, energy and impartiality of our civil servants, and owing to the complicated nature of the type of legislation which has been introduced by the Government for some time past, the number of civil servants employed has been added to considerably and the complicated nature of the legislation involved has also added considerably to their work.  I feel that the settlement of this outstanding grievance would have the result of adding to the efficiency of the civil servants.  I think that if the Government can see their way to accept the motion, as it is on the Order Paper, they will be doing something to correct the grievance that has existed for a considerable time and also will be doing something that will tend towards the general good.</P>

      <P>I had hoped to hear something from the Minister for <Col N="1212" /> Finance in reply to the perfectly sound case which has been made by Deputy Costello on this subject of conciliation and arbitration machinery for the Civil Service.  As he pointed out on the last occasion on which this question was before the House, the Minister declined to state the reasons why he failed to carry out the promise which was made by him and by his leader and other members of his Party in 1932.</P>
      <P>I think it is necessary, lest there should be any doubt on the question, to repeat that promise.  The Taoiseach, in Rathmines Town Hall in 1932, said: &ldquo;I believe it is only right that there should be an arbitration board for the Civil Service, to deal with matters between the Service and the Executive. We would be prepared to agree that an arbitration board be set up, and would assent to an inquiry into the basis on which the cost of living is calculated.&rdquo; Not being satisfied with this statement on the part of Mr. de Valera, Fianna Fáil issued an election manifesto containing this: &ldquo;We are prepared to establish an arbitration board to deal with the grievances of civil servants.&rdquo; Not being satisfied with that, and in order to make their position abundantly clear, many Fianna Fáil candidates, including the Minister for Finance, in reply to a questionnaire sent to them by Civil Service organisations, stated definitely and unequivocally that, if returned as a Government, they were prepared to stand over arbitration for the Civil Service.  Whatever case the Minister may make, he cannot get away from that promise made by Mr. de Valera, and made by himself and his Party in their election manifesto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I have them, and I will read them in due time, when it pleases me to do so.  It is well, I think, that the House should learn something of the history of this question of Civil Service arbitration.  Deputy Costello pointed out that our Service is modelled on the British Civil Service. That is largely true.  It is not, of course, quite true, because the conditions of our civil servants are not <Col N="1213" /> modelled on the conditions of the British civil servants.  Structurally, however, the Service is modelled on the British pattern.  In the bad old days of the British Civil Service, civil servants were regarded by the Treasury as the same kind of slaves that civil servants in Ireland are regarded by the Department of Finance or the Minister for Finance.  As time went on, civilisation began to dawn in Britain, in Civil Service matters at any rate, and machinery was established, first of all, to enable the Civil Service to represent their grievances to the British Treasury and, secondly, if this machinery failed to settle these grievances, it provided an independent court to which the Service could appeal, beyond the Treasury.  The machinery was known as Whitleyism.</P>
      <P>The Whitley Councils in the British Service consisted of a certain number of staff-side nominees, on the one hand, and official nominees on the other.  The nominees to the staff-side, be it understood, were not necessarily civil servants.  Knowing that civil servants, in certain respects at any rate, are muzzled, and if they are going to have their grievances properly represented they often have to get a third party to represent them, provision was made for non-civil servants to represent civil servants on the staff-side of the Whitley Councils.  The national Whitley Council, having heard a case presented by the staff on the one hand, or the Treasury on the other, was enabled to arrive at a decision, and that decision was automatically put into effect by the Treasury.  If they failed to arrive at a decision, the staff-side had recourse to arbitration under the Industrial Courts Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello, needless to say, is much more competent than I am, and possibly more competent than any other member of this House, to deal with the constitutional aspect of this question.  He has made it clear that there is no constitutional difficulty, and, even if there were a constitutional difficulty, that the Minister would have no great trouble in altering the Constitution to provide against it.  The Minister, in effect, says this: that ultimate financial control must <Col N="1214" /> be in his hands; he says, in effect, that it is not possible to find a court of honest men in this country to hear the point of view of the Civil Service, on the one hand, and the point of view of the Minister on the other, and arrive at a fair and impartial decision. I hope this House is not prepared to accept that point of view, that we cannot find three or five honest men in this country to arrive at a decision which will be fair to the civil servant and to the taxpayers.  That is, presumably, what the Minister, in his failure to establish arbitration machinery for the Civil Service, asks this House to declare.</P>
    <P>There is one very important aspect of this question, and that is the psychological effect which the very existence of an arbitration board would have on the Civil Service.  I believe, and I am in very close association with the Civil Service staff organisations, that if there were an arbitration board it is doubtful if it would ever have to meet.  I believe that it would be on rare occasions that it would be necessary to appeal to an arbitration board, provided there was an arbitration board, because it is the absence of any appeal beyond the Department of Finance on the part of the civil servants which encourages the Department to take up the attitude which Deputy Costello has so well described. If they knew that beyond them the staff-side organisations had an appeal to some body which could be relied upon to deliver a just verdict on their case, I believe it would change the attitude of the Department of Finance and would encourage the Department to hear the staff-side case and consider it carefully.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputies realise the treatment which is at present meted out to the Civil Service in this country.  The Department of Industry and Commerce encourage the use of conciliation machinery in trade disputes.  They offer their services as mediators between outside employers and their employees.  But the State as an employer itself refuses any facilities to staff-side organisations to represent their grievances <Col N="1215" /> in any way that will enable them to have these grievances seriously considered.</P>
    <P>When the Free State was established and when the Whitley machinery to which I have referred was abolished, the then Minister for Finance set up an institution known as the Civil Service Representative Council.  That council consisted of the heads of Departments, on the one side, and nominees of Civil Service organisations on the other.  Unlike the Whitley Council, it had no power to arrive at decisions. The staff-side might present an argument relating to some aspect of their conditions of employment and the official side might or might not, as they thought fit, reply to the argument presented, and having talked for a few hours, the proceedings came to an end without any decision being arrived at. They were not even in a position to make a recommendation.  All they could do was to talk and, having wasted their time talking for some hours, the minutes of the proceedings were submitted to the Minister who might or might not read them.  The only satisfaction which any staff organisation had was that they were permitted to talk, for hours, if they liked, at a meeting of the Civil Service Representative Council and then the Minister might possibly read the minutes of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Civil Service organisations one by one left that institution and decided to have nothing more to do with it, and naturally.  At the present moment, there is not a single Civil Service organisation which recognises the Civil Service Representative Council, or which would waste its time attending meetings of the council, and yet on every occasion on which a Civil Service organisation writes to the Department of Finance concerning the grievances or problems of its members, it receives the same stereotyped reply: &ldquo;This is a matter appropriate for consideration by the Civil Service Representative Council.&rdquo;  One would expect sanity at least in the most important Department of this State, but still we have this idea of carrying on this farce, <Col N="1216" /> year in and year out and from one year's end to another.  For the past ten years and more, the Department of Finance has been solemnly replying to every staff-side representation in the same terms: &ldquo;This is a matter appropriate for consideration by the Civil Service Representative Council&rdquo;&mdash;a body which in fact has no existence except in the imagination of the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>Another feature of this so-called conciliation machinery, the Representative Council, is that only serving civil servants are permitted to sit on it.  The Minister decides who shall be the staff-side representatives.  It is not for a staff organisation, such as the Post Office Workers' Union, which employs a full-time staff, or the Civil Service Clerical Association, which employs a full-time staff, to send their own selected representatives, their full-time officials, to represent them, even if they were prepared to attend the meetings of the Representative Council.  Oh, no.  They must be serving civil servants; they must be people who, by reason of the nature of their conditions of employment and the restrictions placed on their civil rights, are muzzled and unable to open their mouths in their own defence.  The thing is too outrageous to be tolerated in any reasonable community.  So much for the conciliation aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>When we come to a consideration of the method of carrying out the Government's undertaking to establish an arbitration board, what do we find?  A scheme is submitted to the Civil Service organisations providing, firstly, that a Civil Service case may go to arbitration if the Minister permits it to go to arbitration.  In effect, that means that if a Civil Service staff organisation feel entitled to, say, an increase in pay, a higher leave allowance, or something else of the kind, they make an application to the Minister.  The Minister in his wisdom decides that this application cannot be granted and no doubt, in his own mind at least, has some good reason for so deciding.  If the Minister, in the first instance, has made up his mind to refuse a claim presented by a staff <Col N="1217" /> association, it is hardly likely that he is going to agree to that claim going to arbitration if he has the power to stop it; but under the scheme submitted by the Minister, the Minister will have a prior veto before any claim goes to arbitration.  The next stage in the matter, if the Minister permits a claim to go to arbitration, is that the arbitration board meets and hears the claim.  It does not, however, meet in public like a court of law.  It hears the claim in private and it makes, not an award in the sense in which ordinary arbitration boards make awards, but a confidential recommendation to the Executive Council; and the Executive Council, presumably on the advice of the Minister for Finance, may decide to put that award into effect, or not to put it into effect.</P>
    <P>Then again, if a Civil Service organisation decides to send its full-time secretary to represent it during the proceedings of the arbitration board, under the terms of the Minister's draft scheme&mdash;or daft scheme, as Deputy Norton once described it&mdash;the full-time official cannot appear before the board. Only a serving civil servant can act as an advocate on behalf of his organisation before the board, and not only can a full-time officer of a Civil Service organisation not attend before the board, but Deputy Costello, in his capacity as counsel, could not appear before the board.  It has been submitted before in this House, and I submit again, that the scheme presented to the Service organisations by the Minister for Finance is not arbitration as the word is ordinarily understood and not arbitration in the sense in which any man in the street would interpret the word.  If that is so, it is a complete betrayal of the pledge given to the civil servants in 1932, and it is a complete evasion of the promise given to the Service.</P>
    <P>Contrast the position here with the position which obtains in other countries with whose affairs many of us are familiar.  Deputy Costello referred to the position in Britain.  I previously pointed out that Britain has full and complete conciliation machinery for the Civil Service, that it has full and complete <Col N="1218" /> recognition for the full-time officials of the Civil Service associations and full, complete and satisfactory arbitration machinery.  The same thing applies in Australia.  The same thing obtains in Canada and in New Zealand. Speaking of New Zealand, I had the privilege not very long ago of discussing the position of the Civil Service in that country with a Minister of the New Zealand Government.  Since then I got a copy of the Act which was passed some time ago in the New Zealand Legislature entitled &ldquo;The Civil Servants Enabling Act,&rdquo; an Act which removed all the restrictions which are placed upon the civil rights of civil servants.  The civil servants in New Zealand are free to join political parties.  They are free even to be candidates in the elections.  They have all the civil rights that are enjoyed by people outside the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not advocating anything, but stating a fact. Now here in this part of this country civil servants are not permitted to belong to political parties.  Civil servants are not permitted to be represented by full-time officials of their associations.  Civil servants are subject to disciplinary action if they approach a Deputy of this House in any matter concerning their grievances.  Under any circumstances, I suggest that people whose conditions of employment are such have a very good claim for the establishment of some kind of machinery that will enable them to appeal to some kind of impartial tribunal beyond the Minister for Finance and beyond the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister interrupted me to ask whether I was advocating full rights for civil servants.  I would like to say a few words on that subject.  I do not see any reason why civil servants should not enjoy civil rights.  But, for the moment, I would like to stress this point: that whatever rights civil servants might exercise or enjoy in their private capacity, it is, I think, the view of every member of this House that it is desirable that in their official <Col N="1219" /> capacity civil servants, as such, should be kept out of and above considerations of party politics.  If the Minister for Finance is taking the line of opposing the terms of this resolution; if the Minister proposes to exercise the Fianna Fáil Party whip in order to get members of this House to vote against their own best judgment, if the Minister does that, I suggest that it is he, and not anybody on the Labour Benches or on the Fianna Fáil Benches who is bringing the Civil Service of this country into politics.</P>
    <P>I would like to see this question of decent treatment for the Civil Service being taken out of politics.  I would like to see every Deputy of this House no matter to what Party he belongs, allowed to vote according to his best judgment on this matter.  I have not the slightest doubt that if this question were left to the free vote of the House, the motion would be carried, for every Party in this House one time or another has expressed itself as being in favour of the establishment of proper conciliation arbitration machinery for the Civil Service.  If the Minister wants a political Civil Service, that is his business.  As far as I am concerned, I should prefer that these Civil Service issues should be taken out of and kept out of party political considerations. But the Minister by his attitude on this question is driving the Civil Service into politics, and he is making Civil Service issues, which should be kept out of the political arena, decidedly political issues.</P>
    <P>Just before concluding, I should like to anticipate what the Minister may say on this subject of Civil Service arbitration.  I have no doubt that he will fall back on the so-called constitutional case.  I think Deputy Costello has answered that case pretty fully. But the Minister will also, no doubt, repeat what he has said on at least one occasion in correspondence with the Civil Service staff association, and that is that the Civil Service staff associations themselves have a share in and a responsibility for the absence of arbitration machinery because of their failure to discuss in detail the scheme which was submitted by the Minister. <Col N="1220" /> The Minister has on all occasions made that suggestion.  But the suggestion is not founded on fact, because in the course of the correspondence with the Minister's Department on the subject of Civil Service arbitration, the Civil Service staff organisations made it clear that they were not in agreement with and not prepared to accept the basic principles underlying the Minister's scheme when the Minister provided for an ultimate veto that civil servants were not prepared to accept.  What was the use in the staff associations discussing the Minister's scheme, paragraph by paragraph?  There was no use in going into details of the scheme unless there was some agreement between the Minister and the staff association on the principles of the scheme.  And further, any Deputy of this House who has any experience of correspondence with a State Department, and particularly with the Department of Finance, will know fairly well that a matter of this kind of vital issue affecting the Civil Service on the one hand, and the Minister on the other hand, was not likely to be settled by correspondence, knowing that the Civil Service staff association made to the Minister the very reasonable and natural request that he should meet their representatives in order to discuss this question of Civil Service arbitration and see if a basis of agreement could be arrived at.  The Minister refused to accede to that request. He refused to receive a deputation representing all groups of civil servants in this country.  Now the Minister who refused to receive this deputation is the Minister who is asking the Civil Service to trust him in doing them justice and asking them to look to him as their natural champion. There is no need for arbitration machinery; there is no need for conciliation machinery; there is no need for anything so long as you have the Minister for Finance, the very Minister who refused to receive a deputation from his own Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have anything to add on this subject except once again to appeal to the Minister to take off the Party Whips on this issue.  If he is serious in his stated desire to keep <Col N="1221" /> the Civil Service out of politics, he has an opportunity of doing that now by withdrawing the Party Whips and by letting Deputies express their individual judgments on this issue as between the Civil Service and the Minister.</P>
