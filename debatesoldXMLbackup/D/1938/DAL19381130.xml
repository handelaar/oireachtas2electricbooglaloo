      <P>The office of Governor-General of Saorstát Eireann was created under the former Constitution. The provisions of that Constitution relating to the office were repealed by the Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act, 1936.  The office of Governor-General and the Commission of Appointment of the last Governor-General of Saorstát Eireann lapsed, therefore, when that statute became law, and the question of the withdrawal of the commission did not arise.</P>

      <P>With regard to the part of the Deputy's question which related to the exact phraseology of the Letter of Credence of the Irish Minister to Italy I would remind the Deputy that it has not been the practice to publish the text of Letters of Credence.  I may add, however, that these have been changed from time to time, and that the general question of the form of all documents of an international character which are at present signed on advice is now receiving attention in the light of the new Constitutional position and the Government's policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that of the 3,000 workers normally engaged in the woollen and worsted industry about 700 are totally unemployed and a large number of the remainder are under casual employment; and if he will have a Departmental investigation made with the object of finding ways to increase employment in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the numbers of workers unemployed or only partly employed at the moment in the woollen and worsted industry. <Col N="1130" /> I am, however, aware that there has been a falling off of orders with a consequent slackening of employment during certain months earlier in this year. I can assure the Deputy, however, that the problem of unemployment in the woollen and worsted industry has been under constant consideration in my Department and everything possible has been done to assist the industry. It may be of interest to the Deputy to know that the total output from this industry in the year 1937 is more than double what it was in 1931, with a consequent increase in employment.  This increase was the result of measures taken during the last six years to improve the position of the woollen and worsted industry.  There is some reason to believe that the shortage of orders during part of this year is a passing phase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister contradict the statement that there was a 33 per cent. less output in 1937 and a 20 per cent. increase in stocks&mdash;does he deny that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to deny that.  I know there has been a falling off.  The Deputy is, no doubt, aware of the cause&mdash;a certain amount of uncertainty as a result of the Trade Agreement with the United Kingdom. As a result of that people were led to believe that the restrictions on the importations of woollen goods were going to be modified or removed.  It is a fact which the Deputy must face, that a large number of traders and members of the public decided to defer purchasing in the hope that they would get English goods.  I think that is a passing phase, but it had a detrimental effect on the employment in the industry this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The staff required for the opening production campaign at the industrial alcohol factories was recruited in consultation with the nearest employment exchanges.  It was, however, found impracticable to confine the selection rigidly to the names on the employment exchange register because of (a) the distance&mdash;as much as 15 miles in one instance and 11 in another&mdash;between the factories and the exchanges, and (b) the desirability of securing for the initial working period key workers who, during the building and equipment operations, had acquired some knowledge of the plants and the process of manufacture.  The same considerations apply in the recruitment of staff for the second campaign which is about to begin, and the method adopted has been to invite applications by public notices posted in the factory areas.  Applicants are interviewed by the local master distiller, and the most suitable are selected by him, subject to the approval of the managing director.  The practice is&mdash; other things being equal&mdash;to give preference to local applicants with families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that Thomas O'Keeffe, of Edinburgh, now deceased, subscribed £20 to the Dáil Eireann Loan, 1919-20, on the 12th April, 1920, for which he was given a temporary receipt on that date; that an official receipt was sent to him on the 26th April, 1920; that after his death his brother, who holds both receipts, applied for repayment of the loan, and received a reply from his Department stating that his claim being late could not be entertained; and considering the fact that neither the subscriber nor the applicant had any means of knowing the time limit imposed by the Act of 1933, and as no official intimation was conveyed to them about the matter, he will take steps by legislation to have this subscriber's name and any others in like circumstances entered upon the register of subscribers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The records in my Department show that Mr. O'Keeffe subscribed a sum of £20 to the Dáil Eireann Loan (Internal), 1919-20.  His brother's application for repayment of the subscription was not received until the 9th April, 1935, that is, more than a year after the expiration of the time prescribed by Section 6 of the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds (Amendment) Act, 1933.  The time limit for such applications, which was first fixed as the 31st March, 1925, was extended from time to time until, by the Act of 1933, it was definitely fixed as the 31st March, 1934.  Wide publicity as to the various limiting dates was given in the metropolitan and provincial newspapers. In view of these facts, I am not prepared to introduce proposals for legislation as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that as a result of the strike in the malthouses, farmers' barley and wheat in soft condition now lying in sacks are in danger of serious deterioration, and, if so, if any steps have been or will be taken by his Department to assist farmers to dispose of this grain and thus save them from a total loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that owing to the exceptionally wet season many growers have harvested their barley and wheat in a moist condition and that in the case of barley some difficulty has been experienced by growers in disposing of their crops.  To deal with this situation the maize millers have been asked, through their associations, to purchase immediately, to the fullest extent possible, their requirements of home-grown grain.  I am not aware that growers have experienced any difficulty in disposing of wheat of millable quality. The wheat millers have, in fact, already purchased a greater proportion of the national percentage of home-grown wheat than was purchased at the corresponding period of any previous year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I would like to ask the Minister if he does not realise that in districts where the malt houses have got wheat and barley 80 per cent. of what has been threshed is in a very wet and bad condition, and that if it is not taken up immediately it is going to be lost, or practically lost?  Some really serious effort ought to be made to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, with a view to encouraging winter feeding and to put feeders in this country on a similar basis as <Col N="1137" /> English farmers who enjoy a subsidy on fat cattle and in competition against whom our feeders have to buy stores, he is prepared to have a bounty paid on fat cattle during the coming season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since questions on this subject were put to me by Deputies Keating and Fagan on the 26th ultimo and 9th instant, respectively, I have given the matter further consideration and I do not see my way to recommend the payment of a bounty on the export of fat cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I would like to ask the Minister does he not realise that now is the time to announce his intentions, because now is the time the cattle are going into the stall, and it would be necessary for feeders to know whether they are going to get a subsidy on the export of cattle or not.  Later on it may be too late.  It will not have the same effect.</P>

      <P>The Deputy evidently doubts my word, but I am afraid he must accept my assurance that what I said as to the price of Irish butter in London was a statement of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to the second part of the question, the price mentioned by the Deputy refers to secondary Empire butter, in which category Irish creamery butter is not included.  If he will consult recent issues of <i>The</i><Col N="1138" /><i>Grocer</i> he will find that the retail price charged by stores in the West End of London for Irish creamery butter and first-class Empire butter has been and still is higher than the figure he mentions. In fact Irish butter was quoted on the 26th November at 1/6 per lb.</P>

      <P>Before Section 14 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Where a person who was Attorney-General of Saorstát Eireann ceased, in pursuance of sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 (No. 16 of 1924), to hold that office and his qualifying service is on the date of the passing of this Act three years or more, such person shall become entitled on the <Col N="1146" /> date of the passing of this Act to a gratuity of an amount equal to one-half of the salary attached to that office at the date of such cesser.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a person who was Attorney-General retires from that office and his qualifying service on the date of such retirement is three years or more, such person shall, unless he has been previously paid a gratuity under sub-section (1) of this section or this sub-section, become entitled on the date of such retirement to a gratuity of an amount equal to one-half of the salary attached to that office at the date of such retirement.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purpose of this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the qualifying service of a person shall be the sum of each period during which such person held the office of Attorney-General of Saorstát Eireann or the office of Attorney-General, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the number of years of qualifying service of a person shall be taken to be the result obtained by dividing the number of days of his qualifying service by the number 365, any fraction over being disregarded.</P>
    <P>(4)  No gratuity under sub-section (2) of this section shall be payable to a person if, on his retirement from the office of Attorney-General&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  he is appointed to any whole-time office the remuneration of which exceeds £1,000 per annum and either is charged on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof or is payable directly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, or</P>
    <P>(b)  he is appointed on the nomination of the Government or a Minister of State to any office the remuneration of which exceeds £1,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where any gratuity under sub-section (2) of this section is paid to a person and such person is within 12 months after his retirement from the office of Attorney-General appointed to any such office as is <Col N="1147" /> mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) of the next preceding sub-section, such person shall pay to the Minister for Finance a sum equal to the amount of that gratuity.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill, I pointed out that the Government had not been able to accept the recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry in so far as the recommendations related to the office of Attorney-General. In the course of the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill, the attention of the Government was drawn to the fact that the Attorney-General was in rather a different position even to that of a Minister, that while it was quite true that he had not wholly severed his associations with his profession, and while he did in fact continue to practise that profession during his term of office, nevertheless the practice was limited and circumscribed to purely Governmental business, and that, in the proper discharge of his duty as Attorney-General he, like the Ministers, had to interrupt completely his former professional connections. We have considered the position, and the Government is of opinion that there is something to be said for that point of view, and that, accordingly, if a person for any reason retires from the office of Attorney-General having served three years in that position, he ought to be given an opportunity to try to make good some of the professional loss which he, undoubtedly, sustained by reason of the fact that, as I have said, he had to sever what was his purely personal and private professional connection. In pursuance of that, the Government have put down this amendment which would give to any person who has held the office of Attorney-General for three years and who retires from that office and does not, in the ensuing 12 months after his retirement, receive an appointment to any whole-time office the remuneration of which exceeds £1,000 per annum and either is charged on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof or is payable directly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, or is appointed on the nomination of the Government or a <Col N="1148" /> Minister of State to any office the remuneration of which exceeds £1,000 per annum&mdash;that, in the case of an Attorney-General who does not receive an appointment of the nature specified and prescribed in this amendment, he should be given a gratuity of one-half of the salary he held on retirement from office.  That, I think, is as far as the Government finds itself, in the circumstances, able to go to meet the point of view that was advocated here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the fact that some recognition has been given to the fact that the Attorney-General, to a greater or lesser extent, has lost contact with his business, and that, necessarily, when he goes back to ordinary life, he finds himself in the position that it takes a number of years at least before he gets back to anything like the professional position he was in before he took office as Attorney-General.  I accept the fact that provision is made here for that, although it is not exactly making the Attorney-General equivalent to a Minister in the pensionable capacity; but it is doing something to meet the case.  In connection with this particular section, however, I had an amendment down&mdash; which was ruled out&mdash;to meet a different type of case.  Generally speaking, in this Bill, two years of Ministerial service is equal to three years of service as a Parliamentary Secretary, and my amendment aimed at giving to the ex-Minister a right, if he so desired, to have his pensionable service converted into three years at the lower scale of pension.  Roughly, the proportion is two to three.  The pension rates proposed for Parliamentary Secretary and Minister indicate that the value placed on two years as a Minister is equal to that of three years as Parliamentary Secretary, and I wanted to leave, if possible, to the individual the right to have his service calculated according to either measure. I think this is the appropriate part of the Bill to raise that point, and that, if it were to be met, it should be met there, before Section 14.  Anyway, I am satisfied to take the opportunity to raise the matter, so that it can be <Col N="1149" /> considered by the Minister between this and the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal appears to be in conflict with a certain part of the speech made by the Minister for Finance on the Second Reading of the Bill.  The whole idea of this Bill is to make some reasonable provision, and as generous a provision as possible, for persons who can prove that they suffered financial disadvantages during the period covered by the Bill.  In his Second Reading speech, I think, the Minister took the view that an ex-Attorney-General was not likely to be looked upon as a sufferer during his period of office.  However, I do not know what prompted the Minister for Finance to change his view and introduce a new section, but I should like to hear from him how many people are likely to benefit under the new section now proposed, and what is the total estimated cost of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister deals with the points raised by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Davin, I think this is the appropriate place to mention again a matter which I raised on the Second Stage of this Bill.  It is here proposed to bring in the Attorney-General. Now, I mentioned a small class of persons, that is those members of Parliament who represented Nationalist constituencies in the British House of Commons for years, for no reward of any kind, many of whom ruined their professional careers, many of whom, to my personal knowledge, were hungry in London when they were doing their work.  They were hungry because they had to depend upon what subscriptions were collected in America and Australia and in this country.  That was the allowance they had to live on.  That was their only source of income.  Having borne the burden and heat of the day their Parties were rejected in 1918, and they are now old men.  Some of them are destitute.  I have pointed out to the House that they constitute an inevitably diminishing charge.  They are a class to which no additions can conceivably be made in the future.  They have certainly done as much for the establishment of the sovereignty and independence of this country as anybody <Col N="1150" /> else.  They have certainly given as disinterested service to this country as anybody else.  They never asked for anything; they have not authorised me to ask for anything, and if I asked them for permission to speak on their behalf I do not think they would authorise me to ask for it, because they were brought up in the old school, in which the fathers of all of us were brought up.  When Ireland had nothing you served her for nothing, and you never expected a reward.  Such reward as you got was the removal of the evils of which you set out to relieve this country.  As you remedied the grievances of the people, that was the reward you were working for, and that was all the reward you got.</P>
      <P>I believe those men would be quite prepared to face destitution if the country were still engaged in the struggle for independence, and still required all her resources to finance it. But that is no longer the case.  We have got our own Parliament.  We have got our own independence.  We have got our own opportunity to do with the resources of this country what we will, largely as a result of their efforts. I want to ask this House categorically now, when provision is being made for everybody else, is that dwindling body of men to be entirely forgotten?  There is no use saying that we hope to make provision on some future occasion. They will not be there to benefit by it.  They are mostly old men.  The affliction of age and infirmity is at present added to that of the threat of destitution.  That is not a great boon to ask of our own Parliament&mdash;that the threat of destitution should be removed from the evening of the days of those men who served this country. Some of those men have died in the knowledge that they were leaving their widows to face the world alone without resources of any kind.  I have sat by their bedsides, and I have known the added agony to them of having to condemn their wives to live an entire life of comparative poverty because they had chosen to take part in the national struggle, and they were now adding to the burden by leaving them destitute and unprovided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in our power to remedy that <Col N="1151" /> situation now at a trifling cost, and it ought to be done.  There is no administrative difficulty.  There is no legislative difficulty here that cannot be easily surmounted.  We have, by a section, provided that the Attorney-General will come within the benefits of this Bill.  It is perfectly easy to introduce a new section declaring that any person who represented an Irish constituency in the Nationalist interests in the House of Commons between 1879 and 1918 will be deemed, for the purpose of this Act, to have served the State as a Minister of State, and given the same benefits as an ex-Minister would enjoy.  There is no question of spending an extravagant sum as a result of doing that.  The sum is not worth talking about.  A couple of thousand pounds would cover the whole thing, and it would mean the difference between poverty and modest comfort for those men in their declining years and, which may be even more important, for their widows. Surely that is not too much to ask after 60 years of service.  They have never asked for anything.  They have never got anything from this country.  They never hoped for anything from this country.  Their whole lives were based on the assumption that they served for nothing, and in that full knowledge they undertook service.  Is it too much to ask now that those last years of their lives should be relieved from the more acute anxieties of poverty?</P>
    <P>In this matter, I appeal to the Minister not to allow any Departmental attitude or any other consideration to hold his hand.  The proper way to overcome this is to realise that it is a national responsibility, and that no finicky draftsman's rule or other obstruction should deter him.  Let a section be put into this Bill on the Report Stage, declaring that for the purposes of this Bill any person who served in the British House of Commons, in Parnell's Party or in Redmond's Party thereafter&mdash;or in any Nationalist Party, because there were others who were not members of the main Party&mdash;will be deemed to have been a Minister of State for the purpose of this Bill.  When that is done the whole case is met.  The charge <Col N="1152" /> may appear on the accounts of this country for the next ten or 15 years, and will then vanish, but at least we will have the satisfaction of knowing that none of those men died forgotten and ignored.  There is a lyrical poem about the man who never to himself hath said: &ldquo;This is my own, my native land&rdquo;, which urged us to mark him well and note that he died unwept, unhonoured and unsung.  In the case of individuals who thought too well of their own country and devoted their whole lives to it, apparently this House is prepared to throw them on one side and forget all about them.  I do not think individual Deputies who reflect on that aspect of the situation would wish to do that, and I am asking them now to join with me in saying to the Minister that they do not wish to see forgotten now anybody who served the country as disinterestedly as did those people.  They ought to be given this very small consideration.  It is not an endowment; it is not any kind of property; it is just a protection from the apprehension of dying hungry and leaving their widows after them to die in the same way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>As much as we are satisfied that there is justification for looking after people who have given service to the State, I am not satisfied with this section, or that there is any justification for Parliamentary Secretaries qualifying for pensions after three years' service.  I wonder if the Minister will say if there is great dislocation of contact with ordinary business, professional or otherwise, on the part of a Parliamentary Secretary who held office for three years, and that there is justification for giving him a pension.  Does the Minister want to visualise a situation something like France, where they have a series of Governments every two or three years, by bringing up the number of Parliamentary Secretaries who, after three years or a shorter period of service would qualify for pensions?  I am in favour of the principle, but I want to know if the House is sure that there is any justification to give men pensions at the rate mentioned in the section after three years' service.  There is no other walk of life in which a man would get anything like the same pension after such service, no matter what contact he had lost.  I do not believe that there is such a dislocation of a man's ordinary commercial activities, by the taking over of the office of a Parliamentary Secretary, as would justify the State giving him a pension.  I am not satisfied with the section as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it mean that if a Parliamentary Secretary held office for three years and, at the next election did not seek re-election by the people, he would be entitled to a pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the Bill as drawn.  We had to take it that way in case he were defeated, as good men have been defeated, and later re-elected again.  May I put it to Deputies that the real crux here is that it is always comparatively easier to provide a Government and to make provision for them than to provide an Opposition.  Ministers have salaries and a certain amount of prestige but, it is <Col N="1154" /> a much more difficult problem for any democratic country to provide an able and good Opposition.  They have to forego quite a lot that those in office have.  They have not got the assistance of a trained secretariat; they have not got the prestige of those who hold office, and they have not got the salaries.  In this democratic country, where the private means of individuals who take part in our public life are comparatively limited, and where, as a rule, they have to earn their bread, not being able to depend on the efforts of those who went before them for their day to day livelihood, able men must be put into the position, if they have a taste for public life, of serving the people's interest in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great misapprehension in the minds of some Deputies as to the real responsibilities carried by Parliamentary Secretaries.  As a rule, they are in charge of very important Departments. I need only point to my own Parliamentary Secretary, who is head of the Office of Public Works, where he administers public money running well over £617,144 yearly, and in order to do that he has to devote considerable time to the work.  I think it is a whole-time job.  No one can gainsay that, because most of us know Deputy Hugo Flinn's activities, realise the inspections he has to make to familiarise himself with the problems with which he has to deal.  No one can deny that the office is a full-time one.  There are occasions when he may have to go down the country on inspections, week-end after week-end, and the same holds good in the case of every other Parliamentary Secretary who does his job.  Every Parliamentary Secretary, no matter what the Department, must do his job.  Otherwise his Minister would not be able to carry on.  The office is a whole-time job.  Just the same as the Minister, he has to disassociate himself, so far as he can, from any private undertaking.  It is equally incumbent on Parliamentary Secretaries to make the same sacrifices as Ministers.  Therefore a Parliamentary Secretary, when he goes out of office, and when the people decide they want some other Party to administer their affairs, finds himself inevitably in the same position as a Minister <Col N="1155" /> finds himself.  This is not a matter of conjecture merely.  Deputies have talked of Parliamentary Secretaries and Ministers getting pensions after three or five years' service.  It may be that their term of office is short, but, before becoming a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister, they have given a great deal of service in the rank and file of the Party which happens to be in power when they are appointed.  I speak from intimate personal knowledge of men who were appointed Parliamentary Secretaries, who when they entered politics were men of substance, men with good businesses to look after, and I know from the records of the time, and from the subsequent demands made upon them, that they went out of office and had not one penny piece to their name, and had no business to which they could go back.  I can say the same of Ministers. I would say that to-morrow there are Ministers who would be in that position.  I would be in that position, if Deputies want to know.  It is not human, and not in the ordinary course of nature to expect that you are going to get devoted men to serve as Parliamentary Secretaries&mdash;men who have not the prestige of Ministers&mdash;if they think they have to face what is practically destitution, or become objects of charity and of commisseration to friends and to the public men when they have ceased to serve in such office.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, there is exactly the same justification for making certain that any person who has served as a Parliamentary Secretary should not be dependent upon private benefaction when he goes out of office in order to enable him to provide for himself and his family as is the case with Ministers.  Moreover, the big problem of democracy is not to get a democratic government.  Governments can always be found easily in democratic countries, but the problem is to get a good, sound informed and experienced Opposition which will fulfil the functions of an Opposition. For it is the recognition of the important functions of the Opposition which differentiates between democratic and totalitarian and party States.  In <Col N="1156" /> a democracy the next thing in importance to having a good Government is to have an Opposition to criticise and to examine proposals brought forward by that Government.  That is why it is necessary to enable the members of such an Opposition to play their part in public affairs here.  It has been said that it will be possible to get these pensions after serving three or five years.  Perhaps, but the real point is that we want to get persons to remain in public life who, having been three years at the head of a Department of Government, will be men whose experience will be invaluable in Opposition.  We want to enable them to serve in Opposition as they have served in office.</P>
    <P>I certainly know that in the future, whatever may have been the experience in the past, whether they have served three years or five years in office, only those who have served an arduous apprenticeship in the Dáil and in the constituencies will hold these offices.  Therefore, it is not right to say that persons may get pensions because they served three years in office.  Therefore, it is not correct to say that a Parliamentary Secretary will get a pension because of only three years' service.  As I said earlier, before he takes office a Parliamentary Secretary has built himself up perhaps one career, and when he takes office he has to relinquish that career and embark upon a new one where the limelight of publicity beats very fiercely upon him, where every act of his is subject to criticism, either public or private.  Then, at the end of that period, when he has adopted and pursued that career for three, four or five years, when he has made a complete break with his past, he may, simply because the people decide to have a change of government, be put out again to start upon a third career, absolutely from scratch.  That has been the experience of those who have served the public interest here in politics in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, in the cases he has mentioned, emphasised the point which I make.  Those who served in the <Col N="1157" /> ranks of the Irish Parliamentary Party when the time came and when it was thought they were of no further service to the public, were thrown aside. That is the fate of politicians.  It is the very fact that such is the possible fate of those who come into public life in this country that acts as a deterrent, and will act as a deterrent, in the circumstances of the future, to young and able men who think of taking up a public career.  If we want engineers we try to get the best men; if we want architects or lawyers we try to get the best men; if we want to get doctors we try to get the best men; and we try to get the best men by offering to them, if you like, a sufficient temporal award.  We do not ask a doctor to be a good doctor simply for the honour and glory of it and because of the laurels with which he will be crowned. We offer him that career and we invite him to be a good doctor because we know the emoluments in that case will be worthy of his talents.</P>
    <P>If you want to get the best men into public life in Ireland, if you want them in the circumstances of the new State, you have to make it quite clear to those young men who may be thinking of politics, of a political career, that if they enter politics and are put into office and are asked to make the sacrifice which that office imposes on them, that at the end of that period they will not have to go out through the streets buttonholing their friends in order that they may be provided with food and shelter for themselves and their families.</P>

      <P>The Lord Mayor of Cork has drawn the attention of the House to the great danger in this Bill. I should not, perhaps, say great danger, because the amount involved is not a big lot.  The Minister has concentrated on the circumstances of to-day and the immediate past, but he is legislating for the future as well as for to-day.  I am quite satisfied that many young men lost their opportunities in the peculiar circumstances of this country and they are entitled to be compensated at the expense of the country.  That is the particular circumstance we are dealing with.  Let us examine the possibilities.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that you must draw the ablest men, the most desirable men, and hold out attractions to them.  There are other attractions, too.  Assume, for a moment, that you have a Parliamentary Secretary for three years.  He retires after that period and he can get absorbed in business or something else, perhaps a more attractive career.  You are not retaining his services and you have no way of holding him.</P>
      <P>In the same way you may have a man with five years' service as a Minister. Other opportunities may open themselves to him, far more attractive. You are not going to retain that Minister. As a matter of fact, you are giving him opportunities and security in order to go out in competition with the taxpayer who is going to pay him. There is great danger in that.  You have already admitted that you cannot legislate for particular cases.  I am ready to admit that.  You know as well as I do that there are many who will come under this Bill who occupied office for a considerable time and who will be entitled to a pension.</P>

      <P>You have an extraordinarily exaggerated view of the honour of all people connected with public life&mdash;&ldquo;Only if they apply.&rdquo;<Col N="1159" /> Will you point out anyone to me who was entitled to the receipt of £500 who did not apply for it?  I think that is too Utopian an idea altogether.  I readily agree that it is impossible for you to frame such rigid legislation as will apply only to those entitled to get it.  Of course there may be a voluntary sacrifice on their own part.  Would it not be far better if you could devise some means, admitting that we are agreeable, so that no man holding high office and who has devoted his time to the State and sacrificed his opportunities, should be left on the scrap-heap? At the same time, you have to take into consideration men who have held ministerial office and have great advantages gained in their experience of ministerial life and to whom there are great attractions offered outside, as there have been to former Ministers &mdash;men to whom the provisions you now make are a mere trifle.</P>
      <P>To put the matter very clearly, the Dáil ought to see that those who serve the country are not going to be penalised.  There is only one way in which you can do it, and safeguard the interests of the State, and that is to set up a judicial commission <i>in camera</i> to whom everybody who is entitled, because of years of service in a ministerial office, to some consideration, can apply.  The same thing is done in other countries.  The judicial commission could, after hearing the applications, make recommendations to the Dáil on the merits of every case coming before it.  I think you can safeguard the interests of the State in that way. Under the Bill as it is framed you will be allowing men to get certain advantages, men to whom these advantages are of very little consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards men who are three or five years years in office, the State is more likely to lose their services than to retain them if opportunities of a more attractive nature offer themselves, which is a very likely thing. I think, in justice to the taxpayer and to the individual, there is no way of deciding this question by legislation. You can only do it by establishing a judicial committee which will report to <Col N="1160" /> the Dáil on the merits of every case, accepting the principle that those who serve the State ought to be assisted by the State when the need arises.</P>

      <P>I assume that the amendment which the Minister has moved would enable such a person to receive a dual pension.  If that is so, I think it is a highly objectionable procedure on principle.  It is surely objectionable that the same employer should provide one person who would have service of a military kind with a military service pension and a pension under this Bill, and that the military service pension paid to an <Col N="1161" /> ex-Minister or ex-Parliamentary Secretary would not be reduced in any way by reason of the fact that he would become entitled to a pension under this Bill.  He would have two pensions from the same employer and that is the general taxpayer.  I suggest that that is the position and it is a highly objectionable one.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir.  I desire to support the appeal made by Deputy Dillon&mdash;that if it is possible under the terms of this Bill some provision should be made for the very small number of members of the old Irish Parliamentary Party who are said to be in a destitute or semi-destitute state at the present moment.  If, as I believe, every decent person in the State is willing to pay a pension for services rendered in the fight for independence, surely there is nothing objectionable in extending that to the people who led the advance in the fight for independence, I mean the surviving members of the old Irish Parliamentary Party.  If I am correctly informed the number of members of the old Irish Parliamentary Party alive at the moment does not exceed 21, and I am reliably informed that five or six of these survivors are in a destitute or semi-destitute state.  I understand that the majority of the 21 are over 75 years of age.  I know the Minister made a passing reference to the appeal made by Deputy Dillon.  What I ask now is that he would give some consideration to that appeal and by doing so I believe he would have the support of a big majority of the people who are prepared to subscribe to the expense of such a measure later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I want to point out on this amendment for including a third class of persons, that the Minister was so convincing in the case he made that I had thought he would be inclined to add the unfortunate Deputies who did not become Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries.  The Minister said that the Parliamentary Secretary served his apprenticeship for a number of years and if he becomes a Parliamentary Secretary and is such for three years he becomes entitled to a pension.  Now if there is any justification for that case, surely every Deputy who has been here for 15 or 16 years and who did not become a Parliamentary Secretary should get a pension.  I would point out to the Minister that there is no good in arguing about the hardships of people who become Parliamentary Secretaries. Surely if the Minister is satisfied that he has made a case for the Parliamentary Secretaries he should be satisfied that there is justification for giving a pension to Deputies who did not become Parliamentary Secretaries. I have already given my opinion on the principles of the Bill. If there is any justification for giving anybody a pension for serving three years in a job as Parliamentary Secretary there ought to be justification equally strong for giving pensions to Deputies who served a number of years without becoming Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given my reasons.  I said there is a big difference between the Deputy who serves in the Dáil for 15 years and the Parliamentary Secretary who serves three or four or five years in the Parliamentary Office.  I emphasised that the difference was that the one man has to make a complete break with his career, <Col N="1163" /> while the other man may devote a certain amount of time to his private affairs.  I am not in a position to say that he is able to devote as much time as he ought to his private affairs while he is a member of the Dáil.  I have had experience of that when in Opposition. I had to come here on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, but I had the rest of the week and the weekends in which to look after my private concerns.  That applies to other Deputies, but it does not apply in the case of the Parliamentary Secretary. Whether it does or does not apply to all Parliamentary Secretaries, it is contemplated that in the future it will not&mdash; when the principle is established that henceforward the person who assumes Parliamentary Office will have some provision made for him after he is compelled to relinquish office.  When that principle is laid down then the person who accepts the position of Parliamentary Secretary will from that time forward dissociate himself from private interests and serve only the State. That is one of the things that will eventually happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Dillon, may I say, if I have only referred to it in passing, that it is not because I have not given it a great deal of serious thought.  I do feel very deeply that something ought to be done for the persons to whom the Deputy refers.  But I do not think that I could possibly fit them into this Bill which deals with Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.  The former office holder for whom provision has been made by amendment is one of the officers referred to in Part II of the Bill.  I do not see how I could possibly make every former member of the Irish Party &mdash;every surviving member of the Irish Party&mdash;an ex-Minister or ex-Parliamentary Secretary for the purpose of this Bill.  The draftsman would laugh me to scorn if I were to attempt to do so.  I do not want to overstate the case, but I certainly feel he would be shocked if I asked him to put such an amendment into this Bill.  I think he would say that it was quite contrary to the principle of the Bill.  However, I do think there is a case to be met, but <Col N="1164" /> I think that, perhaps, instead of raising it here in this way if the Deputy would get some other members of the House to associate themselves with him in asking that this matter should be considered we may be able to do something in that regard.  As I say, I think there is a historic obligation upon our people to see that those who served during the period prior to 1918 will not be allowed to die in penury and want.  It is one of the sad characteristics of our whole political history that that is what is happening and, so far as I personally am concerned (the Deputy will quite understand me&mdash;I am speaking quite personally&mdash;I cannot speak for my colleagues in the Government) I think there is a case to be met there and I am perfectly prepared to consider it if it is put in a reasonable way.</P>

The military service pension will stand in relation to military service rendered prior to 1923.

      <P>The provision of free rail and 'bus passes throughout Éire would obviously increase the charge on public funds; hence the amendment is out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I should like to know, Sir, is whether any steps have been taken to ascertain whether the amendment would, in fact, increase expenditure at all.  As I said on the Second Reading, the system is cumbersome, and entails quite a lot of accountancy on the part of the Ministry of Finance, the officers of this House, and the railway company.  It is quite possible that if the railway company were approached they would be quite prepared to allow free rail and 'bus passes to members for, say, the same sum of money that they were paid by the Ministry of Finance last year.</P>

      <P>We are dealing at present with the definition section.  On Section 2, or any other section referring to travelling facilities &mdash;Section 4 would possibly be most suitable&mdash;the Deputy might raise the matter to which he is now referring. As to the question which the Deputy was discussing, that is not a matter for the Chair.  It is obvious that unless certain outside approaches have been made which do not concern the Chair, the giving of facilities to Deputies throughout Éire would increase the charge on public funds.  That is on the merits of the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the definition section is allowed to remain as it is, then of course my amendment goes by the board, because it would be cutting across the definition section completely. Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I should like to know from the Minister what is the position between the Ministry of Finance and the railway company with regard to this question?  Have they been approached to see what they <Col N="1176" /> might do in that respect?  In fact, the main reason I wanted to get that done was that it might cut across the provision which is being made in another section of this particular Bill for Deputies' expenses in travelling into their own constituencies when they happen to live outside them.</P>
      <P>If we got this bus and railway pass it would eliminate that.  There is very much to be gained and nothing to be lost by the Department of Finance, and by the railway companies, by accepting what I might call this new method of dealing with travelling expenses.  If the Department approached the railway companies they could find out their views.  To a limited extent, I know their views, but I should like to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise what is more or less a personal matter.  On the Second Reading Stage certain Deputies took a decided action on the merits against this Bill and explained their reasons.

      <P>I assume that the Deputy was referring to me.  I was not the first speaker in the debate. Four or five speeches had been made before I spoke, by Deputies supporting the Bill, and it had been suggested that they were in the position of vultures falling on the corpse of the country, that they were satisfied that the end of things was coming, and that they were going to join together by stepping in to get some loot before it was all over.  In that atmosphere, and when an attempt was made to point out that there was something unclean about this latter £10 note, I wanted to paint the picture that, if there was anything unclean about this £10, the previous £30 was equally dirty.  I did not at all intend to address my remarks specifically to any individual. It was to the money, that if one tenner was unclean, so was the other £30, and the other £30 would not seem to have dirtied the hands or the honour of any member of the House.  If I was misunderstood or, if I hurt the susceptibilities of any member, I would be long sorry to do so, particularly the man sitting behind me.  I advise all Deputies to do what I did early in political life, and that was not only to grow a thick skin but to grow a shell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Brennan, and my position as to the proposal in the amendment, &ldquo;the provision of a free railway and bus pass for travelling inside Éire&rdquo;, we have not had any recent communication with the railway companies, but, on the whole question, we find ourselves, I think, faced with <Col N="1178" /> a constitutional limitation.  Article 15, paragraph 15, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas may make provision by law for the payment of allowances to the members of each House thereof in respect of their duties as public representatives and for the grant to them of free travelling and such other facilities (if any) in connection with those duties as the Oireachtas may determine.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Unfortunately if we issue passes it would not be possible to ensure that they would be availed of by members of the House when travelling solely in discharge of their duties as public representatives.  I am afraid the amendment would not be in accordance with the terms of the Constitution, but the Deputy may take it that while I am anxious to give members of the House every possible facility for travelling about the country which will assist them to better discharge their Parliamentary duties, I am bound, under the Constitution, to construe the section as binding me so far as possible, to ensure that these journeys in respect of which expenses are provided will be taken only on public business.  I have gone, in this Bill, as far as I find it possible to go. I would rather that the Bill should go through in the form in which it was introduced rather than be amended, because a number of things in it are experimental.  If we can devise some way of keeping inside the Constitution, I am quite willing, as far as I can, to ensure the fullest travelling facilities for Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure if the Minister has recourse to legal aid it would allay his fears.  It would not be reasonable to assume that these facilities were being granted for other purposes, and then it could not be assumed that they would be unconstitutional. If the Minister did grant these facilities to Deputies, for the purpose of performing their duties, and if the railway companies gave them general passes, I do not see how the Department would be acting in an unconstitutional way.  The travelling facilities are given to Deputies so that they may perform their public duties, and if the <Col N="1179" /> railway companies allow these passes to be used everywhere, I do not see how the Minister could be acting unconstitutionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something in what the Deputy has said.  What we need to have is some further experience of the operation of this Act before we say: &ldquo;Here is what a Deputy properly expends in the discharge of his public duties.&rdquo;  If the railway companies are willing to give the extended facilities for which the Deputies ask, well and good.  We would then be on safe ground and within the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason why, after 16 years' experience, we ought to tackle the question.  The railway companies are aware of the position. Now that we are dealing with the matter, this is the time to finish it.  I appeal to the Minister to deal with it on the Report Stage.  If a saving clause could be put in, which would enable the Minister to do it at a later stage, without having to introduce a fresh Bill, that would do.  I am not looking for extra expenditure or for extra travelling facilities as much as an easing off of the scheme under which we are operating.  The present scheme is a clumsy one.  If the Minister dealt with it now it would obviate what the next amendment refers to, the position of Deputies living outside their constituencies. That is something we ought to try to get over.  There is a &ldquo;snag&rdquo; and it is still there.  If the Minister approached the railway companies some reasonable arrangement might be made.  At present the railway companies have an arrangement with travellers and dealers that does not necessitate the voucher system.  I think that if the Minister sets out to do so, some system can be provided which will not entail any further expense on the Department of Finance.</P>

The Deputy has given me an idea, and it may be possible to meet <Col N="1180" /> his point of view.  I will look into the matter between now and the Report Stage.  The matter could more properly be raised on a later section. Before passing from this section and the amendment, would the Deputy be good enough to tell me what purpose he hopes to serve by the insertion after the word &ldquo;motor car&rdquo; of &ldquo;between such traveller's normal place of residence for the time being and Dublin&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I had two objects in mind when putting down this amendment.  There are Deputies who are well-to-do and who consider that it would be unfair and unjust for them to accept £40 a month. I want to give these Deputies an opportunity to accept the original sum of £30.</P>
      <P>That is the position on the one hand. On the other hand, I want to put an end, if there is any hope of doing so, to a lot of the hypocrisy that is going on in this House.</P>

I think the Deputy who adopts that attitude is placing himself in a very awkward and difficult position, and he is doing that because he knows very well, as was stated here last week, that the Government have a clear majority.  It is for that reason I move my amendment.</P>

      <P>I am more than interested in Deputy Corry's reasons for this amendment.  The first reason, of course, is that he wants to give the wealthy people of this House an opportunity of refusing an increase in their allowances.  His second reason is to expose the hypocrisy of members of the Opposition.  Now I say that this is the most hypocritical amendment that was ever brought in anywhere. If the Deputy is genuine in his amendment let him bring the Fianna Fáil members into the Lobby to carry it. Then we will find out who is genuine and who is not.  As one of those opposed to the increase of £10 a month, I am prepared not to take the extra £10 a month.  I do not care what Deputy Corry thinks of my attitude on the Bill.  The Deputy, when bringing in his amendment, spoke about hypocrisy.  Now the bringing in of this amendment is purely and simply a whitewashing motion, so as to give him an opportunity of saying that certain people voted against the Bill because they knew it would be carried.  Now there is nothing to prevent Deputy Corry from getting the Fianna Fáil Deputies to help us to carry this amendment.</P>

      <P>I want just to say a word in reply to Deputy Corry.  If the £10 extra is not given to me I am quite satisfied.  I take great exception to the Deputy's statement charging the members against this Bill with hypocrisy. <Col N="1182" /> I want to say that all the hypocrisy is on Deputy Corry's side, because the Deputy told me not later than this week that he was opposed strongly to this Bill and that it was only when he got instructions from his Party that he had got to support it.  If anybody is guilty of hypocrisy it is Deputy Corry. I know what it is for Deputies to live on their present allowances.  But I cannot get out of my mind the great deprivation of thousands of poor families in this country.  On a board of which Deputy Corry and I are members we had a case before us last Monday where a man and his wife and five children were in a terrible state of destitution.  Rags were their only covering.  The children were clothed in rags stitched together.  I as one Deputy am prepared to carry on on the present allowance until such time as these destitute people are better looked after.</P>

      <P>It would be very undesirable to make a statutory provision which would differentiate as between the allowance to be paid to one Deputy and the allowance paid to another Deputy, simply because one Deputy had more means than the other.  In the past certain Deputies tendered, not merely to myself but to my predecessor, the paying order for the allowance which was issued to them every month.  That paying order was invariably returned to them with the intimation that the Minister for Finance could not receive it, and that, of course, the Deputy could cash that order or not just as he wished himself. In most cases after a certain period the order was presented.</P>

It would be most undesirable to differentiate between the allowance made to one member of the Dáil and the allowance made to another member, simply because the one member was in a better position to do without the allowance than the other.  All of us have to be regarded on the one plane here, and there cannot be any question of choosing one man as a member of the Oireachtas who is to be paid less than the other. On behalf of the Government, I wish to say that I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister calls this a statutory provision.  There would be no differentiation made between one member and another in this matter.  It <Col N="1184" /> is merely a question of whether Deputies writing to the Minister for Finance saying that they had a decided objection to accepting a larger allowance and taking the smaller allowance. Honestly speaking, I think that a Deputy should be afforded that opportunity. There were Ministers here for a certain period in the past five or six years who accepted a lower stipend than the stipend provided by the statute.  What is good for the Ministers should be good for Deputies. Another thing I ask for is that the increase will be only provided on the application of the Deputy.  I do not see anything impossible in that.  I cannot see any grave difference between a Deputy applying for a certain amount and a Deputy applying to have a specific amount reduced.  If there is a principle in one case, then there is also a principle in the other case.  I think that the amendment should be accepted by all parts of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4.</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (1) to add the words&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided that, where a member is in receipt of a pension from the State or is in the employment of a local authority, the allowance payable to such member shall be at the rate of £30 a month.</P>
      <P>I wish to make an appeal to the Minister for Finance to accept this, as it will mean a saving, I understand, of about £11,000 a year.  I understand the total cost is £14,000.  That will mean a saving, I understand, of about £11,000 as there are, I think, 94 persons who are drawing pensions and who are employed by local authorities &mdash;94 Deputies.  In view of the condition of affairs existing all over the country I think it is time we should begin somewhere to economise.  Even last Saturday in Castlebar in the Co. Mayo, the county council had applications from the rate collectors in the county asking to have pounds for the impounding of live stock established all over the county.  These pounds were disestablished, I suppose, about 30 or 40 years ago.  Now, in order to collect the rates, that is the condition of affairs existing.  I understand that quite a number of Deputies are whole-time officers of public authorities and they are getting substantial salaries. There is no reason in the world for giving them £150 a year.  Some of them, I understand, are getting £1,200 a year from local authorities.  In addition to getting £1,200 a year from local authorities they have substantial pensions also.  With the pension and with the allowance, some of them have up to about £2,000 a year.  There is no reason why the State should give these people £150 a year extra.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept this amendment.</P>

We have pensioners in this country. They may not be Deputies to-day, they may be to-morrow, after the next election.  Some of them are getting pensions as low as £8 a year.

We must remember that we are legislating for the future.  If this amendment is passed will not its reactions be that all those people will come under it?  If that is not Deputy Nally's intention, I would like to know what it is.  I am looking for clarity.  I do not think it is Deputy Nally's intention that a Deputy who would be receiving £15 a year as sub-sanitary officer should be debarred in that way from taking his £10 a month extra.

      <P>On the principle of this, apart altogether from the points raised by Deputy Brennan, on the second reading of the Bill part of the Minister's case in favour of the Bill was made because he said that a number of people found it difficult to get through public life on the £360 a year.  I challenged the Minister on the point as to whether there were many people in this House who received other monies from public funds. It is not a question of the amount of moneys; it is a question of the dual payment&mdash;the one employer paying two salaries, two pensions, or anything else.  I am in favour of this amendment and, if the Minister's case was justified, that the £360 was not sufficient, he ought to be able to accept that where a person is provided for and has a large pension, or at least a substantial amount already, he ought not receive the increase under this Bill.  That is the point I raised on the second reading and that is the point I make now.</P>

      <P>I think it is a pity that this amendment was put in.  The statement made by the Minister for Finance on the previous amendment, I think, was sound and it is as much as any Minister could do.  It is what any Minister should do.  You cannot have different types of legislation covering the same thing.  What one member of the Dáil will get by way of allowance, every other member must get and while members of local authorities or employees of the State are allowed by law to become Deputies, then I think they should get the same allowance that any other Deputy gets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a very short-sighted and, if I may say so, ill-considered amendment.  What does it propose to do?  It proposes to do this &mdash;first of all, I think, to regard what is an allowance as a salary.  Some Deputies are under a complete misapprehension as to the purpose of the Parliamentary <Col N="1188" /> allowance which is made to the members of the Oireachtas.  It is not a salary.  It is an allowance towards the expenses which these Deputies necessarily incur when they do their duty to their constituents.  I say necessarily incur when they do their duty to their constituents.  There may be Deputies who do not do their duty to their constituents, and therefore, in my opinion, draw their allowance unjustly, but the authority for dealing with those Deputies is the electorate which elected them, and, as a rule, it does deal with them in due course. We are here considering, however, the position of a person who is a worthy representative of the electors who sent him here, a person who does look after their interests and who therefore does have to devote a considerable amount of time to that duty, and who, quite apart from that, does have to incur a considerable amount of expense under a number of various heads.  I should like to emphasise that this is not a salary: it is an allowance towards expenses. What are we going to do, according to this amendment?  We are going to single out two classes of people.  First of all, we are going to single out the members of that class who, by past services, have been able to establish their right to draw a pension from the State.  Now, a pension, in certain of these cases, if the man happens to be an ex-member of the Gardaí or of the Civil Service, is in the nature of deferred pay.  If it is a military service pension it is in the nature of a recompense for the service which in circumstances of great danger the man concerned rendered to the State and the Nation.  If it is a wounds or disability pension, it is by way of being some recompense for the physical disability which the person has suffered in the service of the State and the Nation.  According to Deputy Nally's amendment, a person who has earned his pension as a Civil Servant or as a public official of one kind or another would be put in the position that if he is sent here to the Dáil to represent the people, he will be put under greater expense than the person who has not up to the present served the people in any way or has not <Col N="1189" /> earned anything from them.  It means that the man who has earned his pension and who has served the people is going to have to pay some part of the personal cost of being a representative of the people out of his own pocket, whereas the man who has not served the people in any capacity is going to get £10 a month more towards the expenses of his office than the man who has served them.</P>
      <P>That is what the first part of Deputy Nally's amendment proposes.  The second part is this: that the person who is in the employment of a local authority is going to be put under the same disability.  We have got to assume, however, that the person who is in the employment of a local authority and draws a salary from that local authority earns his salary, and that he gets it because he does his work well and properly.  If he does not, of course, the local authority can object to his coming here, and there is another Government Department which will deal with that objection if it is made and if it is found to be well-grounded.</P>
      <P>But the case we are dealing with is the case of a man who, we must presume, does his work well and is paid a salary for doing it, and because he does his job for the State or the local authority and does it well, according to this amendment, he is going to be put in a worse position than the man who might happen to be the employee of a private concern or who might be a shopkeeper, who might not be giving anything like the same value to the community as the employee of the local authority is giving and who, perhaps, might be getting very much more out of the community than the local employee was getting.  According to Deputy Nally's amendment, however, we are not going to deal at all with the case of a person who, as a shopkeeper or as an employee of a private undertaking, might be getting a great deal more from the community and not giving half as good value for it as the employee of a local authority&mdash;and we are going to put him in the privileged position of drawing an additional £10 a month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that there cannot be any discrimination of the <Col N="1190" /> sort the Deputy proposes if we are going to have democratic government in this country.  If we are going to have a system whereby candidates are going to go to the electors and say: &ldquo;Because I am in such-and-such a position, my expenses as a Deputy will only be so much, and because my opponent is in such-and-such another position his expenses as a Deputy, and the amount which the public purse will have to bear in respect of his membership of the Dáil, is going to be so much more&rdquo;&mdash;then we are not going to have democracy at all in this country, but a kind of plutocracy in which a man's fitness to be a representative of the people in this Assembly will be gauged entirely by the amount which his membership of this Assembly is going to cost the country and the community as a whole.  The principle which is enshrined in this amendment is a vicious principle, and those who believe in democracy and in equal opportunity for every section to be represented in this Dáil, ought not to vote for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the Minister's adoption of a principle that he has not always held, and that is, that where a Deputy has a pension from the State, he has that pension because he earned it and there should be no deduction from his salary or allowance because he has that pension. I agree with that, but what about the poor civil servant who earns a pension, and it is deducted from his salary, or proportionately from his salary?  On a previous occasion I had an amendment down, which the Minister would not accept, to allow a man who had earned a pension by reason of having gone out with a gun in his hand to fight for the freedom of the country, and who will not get it now.  Many of these people are sorely in need of it, as a petition which was before the Minister recently showed him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My thoughts in this connection have been centring around another class of people who do not get the full pension, or anything like it.  I was thinking of that in connection with the sentiments expressed by the Minister.  There is quite a number of <Col N="1191" /> people in this country, who, in recent years, have got a very small military service pension&mdash;£10, £12 or £13 a year &mdash;and immediately they got that pension they found that their unemployment assistance was reduced or, in some cases, entirely withheld.  Not alone do they lose the opportunity of getting unemployment money, but they also lose the preference that that money carries with it for selection on local works.  In view of that, I think a good deal could be said for the principle of this amendment, if the amendment could be more clearly defined.  If we had a fair deal, as the Minister said, for everybody, we would know where we are, but when we find the people who are in the worst position in the country, who are in receipt of unemployment assistance, having their unemployment money withheld because they are in receipt of a small pension. I do not think there is any democratic principle involved in seeing that that principle is applied to people who are better off.</P>

      <P>On Section 3, Sir. Section 3 is the operative section of this Bill, and it is the reason why some members of the House divided the House on the Second Reading.  As far as I am concerned, and as far as other Deputies of this Party are concerned, we see no reason to change our views since last Wednesday.  As far as we are concerned, we are definitely and strongly opposed to the principle in this Bill of increasing the allowances of Deputies by £10 a month.  The Minister used very specious arguments in connection with the Bill.  He has been harping on democracy, and nothing else but democracy.  I will make the Minister a present of all he ever thought of democracy if he is trying to provide a democratic Government by increasing the Deputies' allowance&mdash;or whatever he wishes to call it&mdash;to such a figure that, instead of getting in the <Col N="1192" /> type which quite possibly he wants in Dáil Eireann, it will become so attractive and the competition will be so intense that it will be the one post in the country which everybody will be dying to get, because it will cost them nothing to be a member of Dáil Eireann.  The Minister on the Second Reading waxed quite sarcastic.  He said we were afraid this would mean a more intelligent Opposition; that we might be afraid to cross swords with the more intelligent Opposition which this would bring in.  I do not believe that, if he brought the allowances of Deputies of his Party up to £1,080 instead of £480, it would give a more intelligent Opposition in this House than we have at present.</P>

      <P>I am also opposed to this section.  I take it that it is the most important section of the Bill, inasmuch as it proposes definitely to increase the salaries of Deputies.  I hold that at the present time there is absolutely no justification for such an increase. There has been from various sides of the House a certain amount of criticism of those who opposed this Bill. It has been suggested that by opposing this Bill they definitely debarred themselves from drawing this increase.  I do not pretend to be one of the wealthy members of this House; as a matter of fact, I think I can claim to be amongst the poorest, because I think that a man who is trying to live on a farm, and particularly on a farm of inferior land, can claim to be amongst the poorest in this House, and as far as I am concerned I am not prepared to avail of any part of this increase for my own use.  I intend to devote it to the farmers' organisation, but I do hold that the suggestion which has been made that any Deputy who opposed this increase is thereby debarred from availing of it is altogether unsound, because after all that is introducing the personal element into the matter, whereas we were told we should approach all matters of public importance from a disinterested and impartial standpoint.</P>

      <P>This section deals mainly with the increase in salaries of Deputies, and I was simply referring to that aspect of the question.  I think that any Deputy who has opposed this Bill but who wishes to avail of the money for his own use is quite entitled to do so.  After all, if one Deputy is entitled to an allowance of £480, every Deputy is equally entitled to it.  I have mentioned that I am quite free to speak on this matter owing to the fact that I myself do not intend to avail of this increase.  Again, there was a suggestion that there was something dishonest and unworthy in our opposing this increase.  That suggestion, I think, came from two Deputies whom I was rather surprised to find of the same way of thinking, but it has been said that great minds think alike, and it might also be said with equal truth that mean minds think alike.  It was not altogether surprising to find Deputy Corry and Deputy O'Higgins of the same opinion.  It was not altogether surprising to find those Deputies endeavouring to discredit other Deputies who had the courage of their convictions and who opposed legislation which they considered to be unjustifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That suggestion was put forward by Deputy Corry and Deputy O'Higgins, but I do not think that any Deputy could have had any clear knowledge as to what action the Government might take if there was opposition to <Col N="1194" /> this proposal.  I think that the Deputies who opposed this increase were quite justified in the action which they took, and I think they were carrying out the wishes of the people of this State.  At the present time everybody is agreed that the country is in an impoverished condition, and I think everyone is also agreed that it does not tend to encourage the people who are forced to face serious economic conditions to find that those who are making the laws in this country are concerned chiefly with their own interests.  That is the only view which can be taken in regard to this proposal. There was no urgent public demand throughout the country for the increase of Deputies' salaries or allowances. I am not prepared to argue the point as to whether the present allowances are adequate or otherwise, but I do contend that they are not sufficiently inadequate to justify the initiation of legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention. This is one of the Houses of the National Parliament of Ireland, and I think that some Deputies at least have convinced the Government that they are entitled to an increase and that they are working very hard. I think that they should give a more visible exhibition of their zeal in the nation's interests by attending the meetings of this House and by attending to the business of this House.  Now, we find that it invariably happens that the majority of the seats in this House are empty.  I think that it is not an edifying position in a National Parliament. It is a position which would unfavourably impress strangers from any other country coming in here.  A foreigner coming into this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was hoping that the Minister would introduce a further amendment at a later stage making it compulsory for members to be present during a certain percentage of Parliamentary time.  As far as this section is concerned I should like to ask what case has been established for increasing the allowance of Deputies from £30 to £40?  Many arguments have been advanced to the effect that Deputies have to devote an enormous amount of their time to their duties as Deputies; that they have to attend to a great amount of business on behalf of their constituents, and that, therefore, their job is more or less a wholetime one.</P>
      <P>If we accept the view that a Deputy's position is an all time one, in the present depressed economic condition of the country, £360 yearly is sufficient. I believe that Deputies who lose most by being members of this House are not those who are dependent on this allowance for a living, but those who carry on considerable business, and who, by being away, have to neglect it, and thereby suffer considerable financial loss.  The case made for increasing the allowances was that it would help to secure the return of representatives of the poorer section of the community.  That argument is altogether unsound.  As far as the working classes, or small farmers, are concerned, they would not be deterred from seeking election to the Dáil because of the inadequacy of the existing allowance.  There is absolutely no ground for advancing such a reason for increasing the allowance.  I think £30 a month will be sufficient to induce any representative of the working classes, or of the small farmers, to seek election.</P>

      <P>This is really the vital section of this Bill.  I suppose if this section were taken out, the Bill, in the main, would be valueless.  I intimated my position with regard to this section, and to the Bill on the Second Reading, when I stated that in certain circumstances I would be prepared to vote for it.  In other words, I said that if Deputies were as anxious to set matters right in other respects, as they <Col N="1196" /> are in this, it could be done.  If Deputies were really as anxious, as some of them expressed themselves to be in their speeches, about the condition of the people, they could have mended matters last week.  They did not do so.  I intimated then that if there was any gesture from the Ministry, or from the Government Benches, of any intention to offer immediately some effective assistance to the majority of the people, and that it would not be put on the long finger, I was prepared to vote for this measure.  Apparently any effective relief for the people I represent is to be put on the long finger, and accordingly, I cannot vote for any increase of my own allowance or in the allowance of Deputies generally. If this House votes the extra allowance, I will take it, and I shall not be ashamed to take it.  I will be able to make as good use of it as any Deputies on the opposite benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this section, and I offer no apology for being opposed to it.  I do not agree with what Deputy Bennett has said, that if a gesture of a relief was made towards another section of the community&mdash;I presume he meant the farming community&mdash;he would vote for the Bill.  There are limits to gestures, and the economic condition of the country sets a limit to these gestures.  It is because of the economic position that I am opposed to this section, and on no other ground.  The Minister knows that we are facing up to a financial crisis at the present time.  He knows that money cannot be got for the housing of the working classes, even with his backing, by the municipality of Dublin.  We cannot get money at an economic rate to house the working classes.  Why?  Because of the economic position, and because of the position revealed in that terrible indictment of Government policy, the report of the Banking Commission.  With that position before us, I cannot understand any Deputy wanting to increase allowances, or voting for increased allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has not been an argument put forward that could be said to be in favour of an increase.  What was the argument put forward?  That men should take up politics as a profession. <Col N="1197" /> That is the sum and substance of the arguments that were advanced, and that people should be well paid for doing so.  There are things that I supported, and that I sympathised with, in connection with this and a previous Bill that I would not support in normal times.  I realise that brilliant men gave the best years of their lives, at a time when they should be minding their own business or professions, to the revolutionary movement which brought native government, and I would be the last to oppose these people being rewarded for their services, that they gave when there was no hope of getting a shilling either as pay or as pension.  When such people pass into honourable retirement they should not be forgotten by the country they served so well.  But to the young brood that is coming along, what is being offered from the Government Benches, and I am sorry to say from our own Benches, is but a bribe to take people from productive work and make them professional politicians.  If there has been any curse to this country it has been the curse of professional politicians.  As a business man and a farmer I make no apology for my attitude, but this Government, which pretends to cater for the poor, is being laughed at by the poor outside. They have no faith in it.  I do not want to make a Second Reading speech.</P>

      <P>The section deals with £40 a month or nothing.  I will vote for nothing.  In reply to the charge of hypocrisy, my position is that when a law is passed here it applies to every citizen.  If there is any discrimination in the allowance to Deputies I am satisfied with the discrimination if there is also discrimination in taxation.</P>
      <P>If I am going to pay my footing in taxation, I am going to get my rights as a citizen if I am performing my duties.  Why cannot Deputies do their work on a less allowance than £40 a month?  I notice that a case was made on the opposite benches that £360 a year was a good allowance for a Dublin Deputy.  Now it is strange that it is the far-away Deputies who are opposing this section.  As a matter of fact, I am the only Deputy in Dublin City and county who is opposing this&mdash;the only Deputy of any Party.  I am opposing it strenuously and continuously for no reason but that £360 a year is a very good allowance for any Deputy, no matter where he lives. No Deputy is expected to give all his time to his parliamentary duties.  If he gives all his time to these duties, he is not as good an asset to the country as the man who gives part of his time to the public service and part of his time to his own business.  We do not want the professional politician to predominate in this country.  We want the productive man, the man who knows he has to make his way in business or in a profession.  He is the most useful type of man in the Legislature in this country.  No case has been made for an increase of allowances to £40 a month.  The whole country deprecates the notion of making the office of T.D. attractive to the professional politician.  We do not want the professional politician and for no other reason I would vote against the allowance in order to keep out the professional politician.  No case has been made for the increase and, consequently, I am voting against it.</P>

      <P>The Deputies on this side of the House who opposed the Bill opposed it because of this section.  We have no objection to the provision of travelling expenses, but we strongly oppose this section of the Bill.  When one takes into account the economic state of the country, he must strongly object to this section.  If we want to prove our sincerity to the people we represent, if we want to show our honesty in attempting to improve conditions in this country, we should first of all think of the people who sent us here, and not of ourselves.  On principle I object to this particular section. Never in the last 50 years has the primary industry in this country been in a worse position than that in which it is to-day.  It is only in the present year that the reactions and repercussions of the economic war have struck us in full force.  This, together with the disastrous weather, has placed our agricultural people in a desperate plight.  When an appeal was made and a case was proved for having an examination of the agricultural position, when Deputies here made an attempt to illustrate the real position of agriculture, there was no help whatever from the opposite benches. These Deputies simply smiled and leered, and treated the matter with contempt.  There was no one here who denied that a case was made by Deputies on this side of the House for better treatment for agriculture. What was said then truly represented the position, but the primary industry got no help and no assistance from Deputies on the opposite benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have Deputies coming in here and telling the House of the enormous duty of a Deputy and his responsibilities to his constituents. These speakers have insisted on showing <Col N="1201" /> how necessary it was for a Deputy to go round and inspect lands and bogs and that sort of thing in order to make himself conversant with the requirements of his constituents.  I submit that that is essentially a matter for a Government inspector.  While it may be necessary for a Deputy at times to be conversant with matters of that kind, it is not his primary duty.  The primary duty of a Deputy in this House has not been adverted to at all. The primary duty of a Deputy is to sit in this House and legislate for the people and for the country; examine Bills presented by the Government and try to help in the shaping and moulding of legislation that will be useful to the country.  Some of the Bills presented here are presented with the intention of benefiting the community. But the majority of the Bills, in my opinion, are only piling up expenses and increasing the burden and the load upon the people.  As Deputy Cogan has already pointed out when important legislation is being discussed here most of the seats are empty and a good many from the opposite benches are out in the lobbies interviewing people whom I might call prospectors&mdash;men who are looking for a reward for the work done at the last election.  That is the kind of duty that is done here.  One will find more of the Deputies in the bar.  If Deputies want to do their duty they should sit the whole time in the House as far as possible at all events.  That is their duty. The majority of the people down the country are very indignant over the introduction of this Bill.  They are in a white heat about it.  The disastrous effect of the economic war, coupled with a desperate year for the farmers right on top of it, is forgotten by Deputies and a Bill of this nature is presented to the House.  Deputies should consider the welfare of the people.  People tell us that the parliamentary system is passing.  I am not expressing any view on that.  One thing that is going to help to destroy the parliamentary system in every country is the neglect by Deputies to do their duty and examine the Bills and legislation presented to them as these ought to be examined.  Quite recently, even within the last fortnight, <Col N="1202" /> after the adjournment of this House and as I was about leaving I found an envelope on the seat in one of the benches opposite.  I recognised it was the envelope that contained the Orders of the day and the business before the House that day.  But the envelope was not even opened.  That Deputy was so utterly and so completely indifferent to the important business done in this House, business of great moment to the welfare of the people who sent him here to represent them, that he failed even to open the envelope.  He had not as much curiosity as to try to find out what was the business of the day.</P>

Deputies on these benches and all over the House are entitled to know who has been behind this Bill, who has been asking for it. What memorials or deputations did the Minister receive?

      <P>There were a couple of statements made in connection with this section upon which I must comment. There was, first of all, Deputy Cogan's statement that he does not intend to avail of this increase.  If that is the Deputy's firm and fixed intention, it may be some consolation to him to know that he may have some difficulty in carrying out the intention. He has already announced it in the House, but it will be my duty to send him a paying order, and I shall await with interest the action which Deputy Cogan takes in respect to the first paying order which I send him and all those which I shall send subsequently. I think this House is not the place to make such statements as Deputy Cogan has made here to-day.  No Deputy has a right to single himself out as being better than his fellows; no Deputy has a right to put himself on a superior plane, holding himself <Col N="1204" /> out with a sort of purse-proud air, bragging that he is not going to do as other Deputies who, because their means may not be as good or their circumstances as good, are compelled to do.</P>
      <P>I shall await with interest to see the steps which Deputy Cogan intends to take to carry out his declared intention here to-day.  I cannot see how I can facilitate him.  I much prefer the manly attitude of Deputy Bennett or Deputy Belton.  They have announced that they are against the Bill but they intend to take the allowance. That is the correct attitude.  If any other Deputy wants to put himself in a superior position to his fellows, he will find under the statute, the law and the Constitution that it is a rather difficult thing to do.</P>
      <P>It has been said that, coupled with the proposals in the Bill, there should be some condition compelling Deputies to sit here.  It may be easy to sit here when some members of the House are speaking.  I do not think I am one of the easy ones to listen to.  There are some Deputies to whom it is a pleasure to listen, but does Deputy Cogan or Deputy Hughes or some other Deputy suggest that when he gets on his feet other Deputies are going to be compelled to sit and listen to what is said, day after day, hour after hour? If that were to be the position, then I should imagine that £40 a month would be little recompense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have listened to lectures here this afternoon about the duties of Deputies.  It is quite true that the main function of a Deputy is to assist in framing legislation.  I will concede that at once to Deputy Hughes; but it is not to be supposed that his duties end there.  If one were to ask a member of the Government or of the Opposition Front Bench what is the primary purpose of Deputies who sit on the respective benches, one would be told that the primary purpose was to satisfy their constituents that they were fit and proper representatives of the constituencies for which they had been elected, and that they should so fulfil the multifarious duties which those constituents have imposed upon <Col N="1205" /> them as to be returned at the next general election.</P>
    <P>I think there is a great deal that can and must be done for constituents outside this Chamber.  It is not necessary in order that a man may be a good Deputy that he should listen when the Minister for Finance or Deputy Cogan or Deputy Hughes is speaking.  There are other things which have to be attended to, and if a Deputy is going to take an effective part in the debates here he will spend, not merely a good part of his time here, but also a much greater portion in the Library trying to make up the material for the discussions in which he is going to participate.  It is not by sitting here hour after hour, watching the clock and jumping up to speak when the spirit moves him that a man makes a good Deputy or participates in the debates intelligently.  It is the common experience that Deputies who sit here, getting up when the spirit moves them and talking, are the Deputies who contribute least to the framing of good legislation.  Such a Deputy often talks not out of knowledge but out of ignorance on the problems which are under discussion.</P>
    <P>I wish to protest at the charge levelled against an unknown Deputy by Deputy Hughes.  Deputy Hughes said he found an unopened official envelope addressed to a particular Deputy and, because of that, he concluded that the man who had not opened the envelope was utterly and completely indifferent to the business of the House and the welfare of his constituents.  I think that is a very serious charge to base upon such slender evidence.  Perhaps the Deputy might have mislaid the envelope, but because he has mislaid it and it is found unopened, that does not indicate that he is completely indifferent to the business of the country or that he is unaware of the business that is being transacted here.  The Deputy knows it is quite possible to go to the General Office and get another copy of the Bill or whatever official document may have been in the envelope.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputies to criticise the Government, very often indeed upon a very slender basis.  It <Col N="1206" /> is the duty and the privilege of the Opposition to slate us because of our fancied sins of omission or commission; but I think it is not fair to give the public outside the general impression that Deputies of this House are lax or indifferent to the interests of their constituents.  On the contrary, if Deputy Hughes ever occupies ministerial office or even joins the ranks of those Parliamentary Secretaries who are regarded with so little esteem by certain members of this House, he will very speedily change his opinion as to the amount of attention which Deputies devote to their constituents when he is bombarded day after day with letters relating to the affairs of the different constituencies.</P>

      <P>I am.  I get an enormous number of letters from Deputies of all Parties every day and I try to attend to them because I know these Deputies are trying to do their duty to their constituents.  I can certainly say this, that the amount of correspondence and the number of matters which the average Deputy has to attend to day after day is very much greater than he is generally given credit for.  I think it is quite unfair to allow the public outside to believe that the general mass of Deputies are indifferent to the concerns of their constituents.  There are in every Party Deputies who are&mdash;we have to admit that&mdash;but they are the exceptions and they do not remain very long here. They pass out.  They are found out by their constituents and they pass out at the next general election.</P>
      <P>I was going to say nothing about what Deputy Belton has said in regard to the affairs of the Dublin Corporation, but I think it would not be relevant on this Bill.  I can possess myself in patience.  I do know that if people find difficulty in getting money very often it is because they do not know how to ask for it.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 6, standing in my name, Sir, I should like to ask the Minister about the construction of that particular section Is it necessary to put in the word &ldquo;member&rdquo; there?  After all, the Oireachtas, according to the Constitution, consists of the Uachtarán and the members of both Houses.  Was that contemplated, or are travelling facilities provided here for all members of both Houses?  It seems to me that &ldquo;members of both Houses&rdquo; must be inserted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I should be reluctant to accept the Deputy's point of view, in view of the fact that this has been drafted by experienced legal draftsmen, and I assume that they have not overlooked <Col N="1210" /> the point he has made.  As a matter of fact, I understand that the specific point raised by the Deputy was referred to the Parliamentary draftsman, and that he said that, having regard to the Long Title of the Bill, the use of the term &ldquo;Member of the Oireachtas&rdquo; in the body of the Bill is appropriate and not open to question.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), lines 40/41, to delete the words &ldquo;who does not reside in his constituency&rdquo; and to delete sub-paragraph (iii), lines 45/46 and substitute the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iii) such normal place of residence (being outside Dublin) and a selected and agreed centre in his constituency, provided such normal place of residence is more than 20 miles from the nearest point of such constituency,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to this on the Second Reading.  Amendment No. 8 is to replace paragraph (iii) of sub-section (a) of Section 4, which reads &ldquo;such normal place of residence and any place in his constituency,&rdquo; by substituting therefor &ldquo;such normal place of residence, being outside Dublin, and a selected and agreed centre in his constituency, provided such normal place of residence is more than 20 miles from the nearest point of such constituency.&rdquo; My object in putting that in is this.  Let us take the case of a Deputy who lives convenient to his constituency, but right outside the boundary mearing&mdash;outside the bridge, let us say.  If we are to allow that section to remain as it stands in the Bill, that man, since he is living outside his constituency, will have a right to get his expenses for travelling into his constituency on every and any day he so chooses to travel, or, in other words, the Deputy living outside his constituency may organise his constituency at the expense of the State. <Col N="1211" /> I am sure that that was not intended or desired.  Consequently, I think that any Deputy living, say, within 20 miles of his constituency, is practically in as good a position to travel his constituency as the man living inside it.</P>
    <P>If he is living further away than that, however, I say that he ought to be entitled to get into his constituency on equal terms with the man living inside and that, for that purpose, there ought to be an agreed centre, fixed as between the Deputy concerned and the Minister for Finance, to which he can always claim his expenses.  I think it would be unfair to the Deputy who is living inside his constituency not to have the right to get travelling facilities within his constituency while the man outside the mearing should have those facilities.  I do not think it is desired by the House or by the Minister that the man living outside should have those facilities.  Consequently, I think he ought not to have them, and that we ought to guard against this in some way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that No. (iii) of (a) does need either amendment or deletion.  No. (iii) of (a) puts a premium on a Deputy living outside his constituency, a definite premium, and I think that is not what any Deputy in this House would wish for or ask for.  Deputy Brennan's amendment certainly would provide a way out.  His amendment would allow a Deputy living away from his constituency travelling facilities to one specific portion of that constituency, just like an ordinary Deputy going home to a place of residence in his constituency. As the section stands, a Deputy living outside his constituency can travel to any portion of that constituency and have his way paid.  For instance, if one Deputy in my constituency lived in Cork City he could travel through any portion of his constituency free, whilst a Deputy living outside the borough boundaries of Cork would have to pay his way about the constituency.</P>

      <P>It is ridiculous.  I do not think this House should put a premium on an absentee Deputy and give him facilities which are refused to the Deputy living within his constituency. I think it is unfair and unjust.  It is the most ridiculous clause I ever saw inserted in a Bill.  It is a clause giving definite rights to a Deputy who does not live in his constituency, and who has not the same amount of work to do that a Deputy living in his constituency has to do.  I was hoping that the amendment to the section would be accepted.  That would place both Deputies on a level footing.  Since, however, it would be against the rules of the House to increase expenditure I think that No. (iii) should either be deleted altogether or that Deputy Brennan's amendment to No. (iii) of (a) should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I should like some further expression of opinion on the part of other Deputies before I would be prepared to accept the principle in this amendment.  There may be something in it, but it does seem to be restrictive of the travelling facilities. As against that, most of the Deputies, and particularly the two Deputies who are in favour of the proposal now before the House, have been advocating that we should rather enlarge the travelling facilities than otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be something to be said for it, but I think it would be rather impulsive, if I may put it so, if the House were to consider this merely from the point of view that a Deputy who resides outside his constituency has some fancied&mdash;I think it is fancied&mdash;advantage over a Deputy who happens to reside inside the constituency. Perhaps there is a great deal of advantage to be derived from the fact that a Deputy does reside in his constituency.  I presume he is in more constant touch with his constituents, and that while he may, as the section is worded at present, have to incur larger expenses purely on the head of travelling, as against that by reason of the fact that he resides in his constituency he is relieved of hotel expenses at any rate, and perhaps his postal expenses may be diminished also.  It may be that there is nothing in that point.  On the other hand, there may be something in it.  A Deputy who resides some distance from his constituency, and who wants to go into his constituency, while he may get an advantage on the head of travelling under the section as it stands, on the other hand he may lose by reason of the fact that he has to provide himself with lodgings for the night at his own expense, so perhaps one thing may balance out the other.  This is a matter on which I should like to get some guidance from Deputies.  It is really a point upon which there is something to be said for a more general participation in the discussion than has taken place.  If I were satisfied that the anomaly which undoubtedly has been produced by the section as it stands should be removed, I would be prepared on the Report Stage to try to meet the point of view which has been expressed; but I should hesitate to do so until I was satisfied that the general opinion of the House was that that was the line we ought to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister think that a man living in his constituency can be 100 miles from a given point in that constituency, whereas a <Col N="1214" /> man living outside his constituency might live less than 100 miles from any point in it?  I think the section is unfair to the other Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is an unfair distinction&mdash;an unintended one, I am sure&mdash;contained in that provision.  A Deputy living outside his constituency would have an unfair advantage over those who reside within it.  He can travel free to the various places in his constituency, whereas the Deputy who lives within it has to bear all that out of his own pocket.  There is an unfair discrimination there which I am sure is not intended and certainly ought to be remedied.  There is no use in labouring the point.  It is quite clear that there is an unfair advantage given to the man who resides here in Dublin as compared with the man who lives in his constituency.  My constituency is not a big one&mdash;it has only three members&mdash;but still you can do a journey of 40 miles in any direction.  In the bigger constituencies it must be considerably more.  It is perhaps up to 60 or perhaps 100 miles.  The man who resides here in Dublin has free travelling facilities to every part of his constituency, whereas the man who lives in it has to bear all those expenses himself, and hotel accommodation does not arise at all.  Those provisions are unfair and ought to be put right.</P>

      <P>I should like to give the Minister an example of how it works out.  West Cork was split up, yet, while I live in the constituency, Castletownbere is just 100 miles from my house.  By living in the constituency I can only get travelling facilities to my own house.  Another member of the Dáil, living outside, could get free facilities as far as Castletownbere. I have to bear the personal expenses of getting over the 100 miles. I do not hold for the principle that a man living in the constituency should only get travelling facilities to his home.  The discrimination is very unfair against men who live in their constituencies as against those who live outside them.  For instance, a man living in Cork could get free travelling <Col N="1215" /> facilities to Castletownbere.  That is one example of the difficulty of arriving at a decision in this matter.</P>

      <P>No matter how we do it, when a principle or a general rule has to be applied to particular cases it is bound to raise numerous anomalies.  We cannot avoid that.  We are up against this position, that, because one person cannot take an advantage of the section, arguments are put up that no person should be allowed an advantage.  I am anxious to get opinions from other quarters of the House and from Deputies who have not yet spoken.  If the amendment is withdrawn I will try to limit the terms of the section in such a way as will overcome most of the serious grievances which have been advanced. I cannot do any better than that.  It must be understood, however, that the amendment will limit the privileges extended to some Deputies.  This is a one-way street for the purposes of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could reconsider the whole issue. There is an issue in the section that should be straightened out once and for all.  If a Deputy was a rogue he could get over it, if he wanted.  If Deputy O'Neill, for instance, wanted to get to Castletownbere he would have to go home and come back to Dublin, and then he could get a ticket to Castletownbere.  He can do that according to the Bill.  If Deputy O'Neill wanted to speak in Castletownbere next Sunday, he could get a ticket home to-night, or he could stay in Dublin and get a ticket, but he would have to pay his way back here.  Sub-section (b) allows a Deputy travelling <Col N="1216" /> facilities between Dublin and any place in his constituency.  Dublin would have to be the centre.  If the Bill is left as it is the inducement is there, rather than hire a motor-car, to travel from Dublin and get a ticket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the Bill contains anomalies of that description.  If paragraph (a) or sub-section (3) stand they put a premium on Deputies living outside their constituencies.  That is ridiculous. Deputy Hurley represents South Cork, but he or I would have to go to Cork to get full travelling expenses in the constituency.  I suggest that the whole matter needs revision.  Surely there is intelligence enough in the Department of Finance to deal with the matter.  At the Public Accounts Committee we hear frequently all about those who spend 2½d.  There should be some reasonable way of finding a way out of the difficulty.  I intend to move the deletion of sub-section (3) on the Report Stage, on the ground that a premium should not be placed on Deputies living outside their constituencies. The next matter concerns the extra hotel expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy living in Dublin can come to the Dáil in a bus, and go perhaps once a month to his constituency in the country.  A Deputy living in Dublin can do his business, and then come to the Dáil at 3 o'clock.  Whether he is better off or worse off than other Deputies, if he goes once a month to his constituency, he has to pay a hotel bill for one night only, while other Deputies, who have to come up to Dublin, and in many instances leave home on Monday, are not able to get back until Saturday.  I have a decided objection to putting a premium on absentee Deputies.  When I go home I have to receive deputations at the train, and perhaps another deputation the following day.  Deputies in the rural districts have to interview these people and to take up their cases in order to look after the interests of their constituents.  That is our job. <Col N="1217" /> On the other hand, if the constituents of the Deputy who lives in Dublin want to see him, they have to pay their way up.  The advantages are all with Deputies who live in Dublin.  We do not want to have a Dáil where all the Deputies are living in Dublin, and where the constituencies are let go pot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is room for difference on this question.  I am not resident in Dublin, but I do not think this question is worth all the discussion that has taken place.  The only point made was that some were getting advantages that others were not getting.  There appears to be no question of a revision upwards of the general facilities for Deputies, but rather of limiting facilities for a particular section.  I do not think there is much in the point.  If Deputies who live in the country feel that Dublin men, who represent rural constituencies, have advantages because of the facilities available for them, I would not agree.  As far as I can trace, a Deputy gets facilities from Dublin to any point in his constituency, and back to Dublin, but, if he wants to go to any other point he has to come back to Dublin to get there.  Men resident in their constituencies travel to their home and are more in touch with them than those resident in Dublin.  If those living in Dublin do not keep in touch with their constituents they will suffer at the next election.  I do not think there is any great need for revision if there is not going to be a general increase of facilities for Deputies.  In all the circumstances, a man who is doing the work in a rural constituency knows the conditions there and is deserving of a certain amount of sympathy. If there is no other point in this, except to limit someone getting some advantage, I do not think the matter is worthy of consideration.</P>

Before I withdraw the amendment I suggest that the solution lies in having more extended facilities in the way in which I endeavoured to have at first&mdash;rail and bus passes.  I think that could be achieved.  This is an alternative, so as to try to get the other point emphasised, I have no Deputies and I have no persons in view at all except now that we have an opportunity to level it out and devise a better scheme, we should try to do so.</P>

    <P>(4) Where a member of either House of the Oireachtas is, under the preceding provisions of this Act, entitled, by way of travelling facilities, to repayment of travelling expenses, no payment in respect <Col N="1219" /> of such travelling expenses shall be made unless the claim therefor is, within one hundred days after such travelling expenses were incurred, lodged with, in case such House is Dáil Eireann, the Clerk of Dáil Eireann or, in case such House is Seanad Eireann, the Clerk of Seanad Eireann.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that claims will be made for a refund of travelling expenses within a reasonable time.  The limit is within one hundred days.  A considerable amount of inconvenience has been caused to the Department, and indeed in some cases questions of doubtful issue have arisen because of the fact that a time limit was not hitherto embodied in the regulations by the Minister for Finance.  We have not been able to insist that claims for refunds will be furnished within a reasonable period.

      <P>A point was raised by me on the last stage with regard to a &ldquo;short&rdquo; day.  I was hoping that the Minister would have done something to clear up the position.  Possibly he is prepared to do it now.  According to Section 9, a short day is not a working day.  So far as I can discover there is no definition of a non-working day.  I presume it is a day on which a person does not work.  Therefore if a person works a &ldquo;short&rdquo; day it is not a working day and it is not a non-working day.  What is it?  Section 10, sub-section (6) deals with the question of holidays and non-working days coming before, after or during the period of annual leave.  Supposing a Saturday, as it must, comes in that period, it is not a working day and it is not a non-working day.  How does it stand for the week's holidays?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1222" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered the point raised by the Deputy and I am glad that he reminded me of it, because I would like to tell him my decision. The point I think the Deputy had in mind was whether days added on to annual leave in lieu of public holidays should be full working days or not. I think the answer must be in the affirmative.  I recognise that it could happen that in the case of an employer allowing the whole of the six public holidays by way of days added on to annual leave in the case of a five-day week worker or a six-day worker with a short day, such an employer would have to give, in lieu of these public holidays, five days in one week and one day in the following week.</P>
      <P>On the face of it, that appears somewhat inconsistent with the provisions of Section 10, the section dealing with the annual leave rights of non-domestic workers, which permits an employer to allow annual leave on non-working days when such days occur immediately before or after working days upon which annual leave has been granted. That arrangement is, however, for the purpose of facilitating annual leave being granted for a period of seven consecutive days.  On the other hand, as the day in lieu of a public holiday, when given within a month of the public holiday, must be a whole day or a working day, it follows, therefore, I think, that it is only right and equitable that the days in lieu of public holidays tacked on to annual leave must also be given on full working days.  On these grounds, I feel that we should leave the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further point.  In sub-section (6) of Section 10 there is reference to where any non working day or any two or more consecutive non-working days fall immediately before or immediately after. Now, Sunday must fall immediately after Saturday and Saturday is the usual short day.  But, under this, Saturday is not a working day.  Therefore, the following Sunday will not fall immediately after a working day because there is a day which is&mdash;I do not really know what it is; I asked the Minister and he will not tell me. It is not a working day under his own definition and, if a person works on <Col N="1223" /> it, it is not a non-working day, but the Sunday comes immediately after that and under that section it cannot be included because it does not immediately follow a working day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to pursue the argument a little bit further and put up this possibility to the Minister. I take it that the annual leave can commence on any day of the week.  It terminates a week later.  Surely the commonsense thing is that days in lieu of holidays should be tacked on to the end of that period.  There may be employers who would like to run the period in to have two Saturdays, but I think usually the Minister will find that both the employer and employee want to convenience each other, and is the Minister going to be in this position, that an employee will say to him: &ldquo;I got my period of annual leave terminated on a Friday night.  I was due another holiday.  I had to go back and work the Saturday.  Then Sunday intervened and then I got Monday.  I would far rather have one period following a number of consecutive days.&rdquo;  I think if employees have gone back to their own homes or any distance, he will find that is the case.  To my mind it is an extraordinary idea that because of the Saturday there is going to be a sort of break made in the period of holidays.  Is it not the commonsense thing that if the employee is not given the Saturday he will be called back to work on that day and the cure may be worse than the disease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but we must try to deal with the equities of the case.  Where it is annual leave proper, we allow the Saturday and the Sunday to be counted.  Seven days' annual leave can include a Saturday and Sunday. The particular case Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Benson raised on the Recommittal Stage was not one which related to annual leave proper; it related to annual leave given in substitution for public holidays.  The Bill provides that a worker is entitled to get a holiday on a public holiday.  If he does not get that, he must get a full working day off within a month. If he does not get that, he must get <Col N="1224" /> a day added on to his annual leave. Should that day on the annual leave be the half-day or a Saturday?  Clearly it would be unfair to the worker to say that it should be.</P>
      <P>If the worker gets a full day off on the public holiday or within a month of the public holiday, it is all right; but if he does not get either of those, when it comes to annual leave he should get a full day off.  A worker getting all the public holidays by way of days tacked on to annual leave might have to get one day at the end of the fortnight.  I do not think that case would arise very frequently and I think it is purely theoretical, but, at the same time, it would be inequitable to have any other arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Minister, and I would like to be fair also.  I would like to consider the equities.  I would consider that if the day was put in front of his week of annual leave or behind it, it ought to be considered as part of it, even if it did fall on a half-holiday.  I put up to the Minister&mdash;and he has not answered me&mdash;the case of the worker whose week of annual leave terminated on a Friday.  The position will then be that he will have to present himself for work on Saturday, work the half-day&mdash;he will get, of course, the Sunday off&mdash;and he will then go away on the Monday.  I would like to suggest that a very great number of employees would far rather have a consecutive run, even though it did include a Saturday.  Take the case of an employee who has gone to his home at the other end of the country.  He would argue that if he were given the Saturday he could come back on Sunday night and practically have two days longer holidays.  I would like to put that aspect before the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest that the case that is being made can only possibly happen in one eventuality and that is where a man is deprived of the entire of his public holidays and has them tacked on to him as annual leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, there is no difficulty at all.  You have five full days in a week.  Your only trouble is Saturday, and in any event when an employee gets less than the complete number of his public holidays tacked on to his annual leave, this problem will not arise, and in no instance, in actual fact, will that happen on Christmas Day.  Christmas Day will not be taken from anybody.  That is not going to be tacked on to annual leave.  You will find that it is very rarely this problem will arise at all, because only on rare occasions will the holiday workers be losing their public holiday and having it tacked on to annual leave.  At worst this must happen before the problem arises to which Deputy Benson and Deputy Dockrell referred.  I think it is narrowed down to an infinitesimal problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will arise in very many cases although I do not agree with the Deputy in saying that it would not apply to Christmas Day at all.  Somebody must work on Christmas Day.  Transport workers and other classes of workers must work on Christmas Day, and it will arise in their particular case.  The particular point that Deputy Dockrell was trying to make cannot arise because if those days are added on to annual leave they must be consecutive.  There must not be a break.  The law makes it clear that the days must be given consecutively. That may involve running into the next week&mdash;Monday to Sunday night.  The short day on Saturday can be counted and given in the seven days' leave, that is, a week's holiday in the year; but where it comes to the substitution of days for public holidays then they must be given on full working days.  I think any other arrangement would be inequitable, having regard to the other alternatives which the Bill provides.  The worker is being given a right to a holiday on a public holiday.  It is recognised, however, that a public holiday would not be a holiday for most people unless somebody worked, and therefore some provision must be made for those who have to work.  Employers are given two alternatives.  Either they can employ the worker for the public holiday <Col N="1226" /> on extra pay, or, alternatively, give him another day's holiday within the month on a full working day, or alternatively give him a full working day added to his annual leave.  I think it would be unfair that the employer should get out of his liability in respect of the public holiday by giving him a half day's holiday added on to his annual leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one other point I wish to mention.  I see, of course, that the Minister has adhered to his change of mind on the full day week, and, of course, I suppose, like everybody else, the Minister is entitled to change his mind.  At the same time I would like to suggest to him that that will contain a number of anomalies which may form fresh precedents for various grievances as between one section of the workers and others.  I am not going to suggest that it is a vital principle, or anything like that.  At the same time I think that to pay one worker six-fifths of a day and another a full day is an anomaly which the Minister, at any rate, ought not to have started.  However, as there is no provision for this in the Bill, I am just going to register my regret that it is going through in that form.</P>

      <P>If I may be allowed to intervene again, although I realise I am breaking all the Standing Orders, as we are not in Committee, I would like to deal with the point which Deputy Benson raised.  On the Recommittal Stage he questioned whether it would be in order for an employer to go outside the calendar year in substituting one holiday for another, giving a holiday on New Year's Day for St. Stephen's Day.  The reply to that question is that the position is unchanged and in sub-section (3), paragraph (b) of Section 8, the right is still reserved to employers to substitute, if they wish, the 1st January for the previous St. Stephen's Day as a public holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit a further point to the Minister on the question of these holidays.  He says that there is provision that the short day can be included in annual leave, but I would like to know where it is. <Col N="1227" /> Admittedly, sub-section (6) of Section 10 says that in the case of a non-domestic worker Sunday shall be reckoned as a day of annual leave, but it makes no provision for including the short day, and I submit that this question of the unnamed short day does seriously affect the ordinary annual leave, and it seems to me that, as the Bill stands at the moment, in order to give seven consecutive whole holidays it would be necessary to give from Monday to the following Tuesday week morning to overcome the difficulty of the short day.  If sub-section (6) could read: &ldquo;In the case of a non-domestic worker Sunday and the short day shall be reckoned as annual leave&rdquo; then my qualms would be set at rest, but, as it does not, I think there is a real problem there.</P>

We have found in practice that it is undesirable to bring any of <Col N="1228" /> these Holiday Bills into operation except some time in the month of May. In the case of workers in continuous employment, the period of the year in which they get their holidays is determined by the time the Bill begins to operate, and it is desirable that holidays should be given, if possible, in the summer months.  Therefore, in the interests of the workers, it is better not to bring it into operation until April or May or early June.  That being so, there is clearly no need to rush the measure at this stage except from the point of view of members of the Oireachtas.  I should imagine the Seanad will not be anxious to deal with it before Christmas.  They may not be anxious to meet immediately after Christmas.

      <P>I move, Sir, that the Bill be read a second time.  This Bill, as Deputies are aware, is one of a series of such measures introduced from time to time to confirm Orders made. Under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Acts each of such Orders must be confirmed by an Act of the Dáil within six months of its being made, or will then cease to be operative.  There is a number of Orders which must be confirmed by a measure some time before February or March of next year. Consequently, it is desirable to get this Bill through this session.  In the ordinary course, I think, discussion on the Orders set out in the Schedule of the Bill might be more conveniently undertaken in the Committee Stage than on this stage.  Perhaps it would satisfy Deputies if I give them a rough indication of what the Orders relate to at this period.  The first four Orders contained in the Schedule, reference numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4, provide for variations and impositions of duties.</P>

    <P>The articles concerned were subject to duty but were admitted free under licence.

Reference No. 5 merely inserts an open licensing provision in respect of cotton blanketing. The older order operated to confine the licence to persons engaged in the manufacture of cotton blanketing, but it was found that persons imported this cotton blanketing for the purpose of sale to the makers of blankets and it is thought desirable that they should be allowed to import this material also,</P>

      <P>No, cotton blanketing. It is not made here, but it was found that it could not be excluded from the duty on cotton piece goods; the older Order was so worded that licences could only be given to manufacturers of cotton blanketing, whereas we desired to allow cotton blanketing in to wholesalers and others who sell to manufacturers.  It is a mere change in administration.  The Order in Reference No. 6 effects a reduction on the duty on dried and powdered milk. Reference No. 7 imposed a new minimum duty in addition to the old duty, on knitted fabric imported in the piece.  Reference No. 8 increased the full rate and imposed a minimum rate of duty in addition on certain surface-glazed clay tiles.  The Order referred to in reference No. 9 imposed a duty on golf balls, Reference No. 10 effected the removal of a duty no longer operative.  Reference Nos. 11 and 12 increased the full rate of duty on the articles referred to without altering the minimum rate.  Reference No. 13 imposed a new duty on artificial horn. Reference No. 14 merely adds a licensing provision to the duty in question. Reference No. 15 imposed a new duty on tinned containers.  Reference No. 16 repealed a duty which was ineffective in so far as the articles concerned have not been manufactured here. Reference No. 17 postponed the operation of the duty upon steel from the 1st November to the 1st April, because the new works at Haulbowline are not yet completed.  Reference No. 18 <Col N="1230" /> imposed a new duty on certain advertising signs.  If any Deputy wishes to have fuller information or desires to discuss the desirability of these Orders, I shall deal with them on the Committee Stage, when I think they could be more conveniently dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's line is that he has told the House all about these Orders and that it will be convenient to discuss them on Committee. My attitude with regard to measures of this particular type is that nothing can be conveniently discussed in this way; that these Orders are matters that are dealing with vitally important aspects of industrial life here, and that they should be presented to the House in such a way that there can be discussion, and discussion of a nature that would afford the House some information so that the House can discuss whatever information is before them.  I pointed out on two occasions already that this Act had been passed in 1932 for the purpose of dealing with a grave emergency&mdash;an emergency in which we were entering on a struggle with Great Britain and in which Great Britain was dealing very drastically with the trade of this country.  It was expressly stated that the very wide powers&mdash;and they are very wide powers&mdash;that are taken in this measure were required for that particular purpose and that they would not be used after that necessity had disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, the machinery is entirely impossible if intelligent discussion is to take place in this House on vital matters of industrial business.  The Minister has already in his power previous Acts of the Oireachtas that would enable him to put on a duty or to take such steps as he considered necessary to prevent dumping or to prevent the importation into this country of goods from any other country because of certain special circumstances there.  He has these powers under the Customs Duties Provisional Imposition Act of 1931.  That was an improvement on a previous Act of 1927, but under the 1931 Act it is possible for him to issue an Order putting on any duty to keep out any stuff that he feared was going to come in either to prejudice the establishment of a new <Col N="1231" /> industry here and flood the market or to prevent dumping.  That Act imposes an obligation on the Minister that, within ten sitting days of the Dáil, Dáil Eireann shall pass a resolution approving of such Orders and the matter shall be subsequently dealt with at the expiration of a period of four months.  From the litany we have heard from the Minister, and from the look of the Schedule here and from the Orders, if collected and put together, so far from there being any information available there is nothing but absolute confusion of mind, and any person who wanted to get down and study what the Minister was doing would find it almost impossible.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether, in connection with any one of these items, it would not be useful for him and for the people generally that there should be an opportunity, by a definite resolution here, for his explaining on the Committee Stage what exactly was the effect of the particular Orders concerned.  He says, I think, that Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 are a variation of duties or a reduction of duties, but I read it that item No. 3 is imposing a duty, cutting away a preference.  As a matter of fact, there is not a single one of these items on which we have information as to the policy involved in them, not only with regard to the particular industry concerned but with regard to what practice was going to be carried on by the Department with respect to licences, preferences and so on.  There is no possibility of intelligent discussion of this thing here in the Dáil.  On the Committee Stage the Minister may be able to demonstrate that he is able to afford a satisfactory opportunity to the House to discuss these things.  But I am convinced that it cannot be done and that the time has come to stop this particular type of imposition of duties by Order.  There can be no objection, in important matters, to the imposition of a duty or to action with regard to stopping, by order, goods from coming in here to the country.  But we must ask, when an Order is issued in a matter that warrants it, that a resolution will be put before the House, and that something of the procedure under <Col N="1232" /> the 1931 Act will be introduced.  A scheme of things under which tremendously strong powers of all kinds are retained under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, is entirely wrong, and is cutting this House here out of any serious or reasonable discussion on the details of industrial development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several matters which arise on this in a more or less general way, and without attempting to discuss those items in particular I should like to mention some matters of more general interest arising out of this Bill before us.  First of all, let us take the first four items.  The Minister has said that the duties are being taken off certain articles because they have been better able to describe them.  I have nothing but praise for that, because anybody who has experience of piloting things through&mdash;even to get them exempted&mdash;will agree absolutely that the Minister is doing very well in the first four items.  The only thing is that one wonders why it could not be brought in on a lot of other items.</P>
      <P>There is another class&mdash;variation of duties.  Now, those are in most cases varying upwards.  Of course with regard to the duty on steel the same remark applies, because it is merely postponing the date on which the iron and steel will be increased in price, but I should like to mention one matter arising out of this.  It seems to me that we are now opening the second chapter in our industrial career, and I will tell you what that is.  Apparently in certain instances the duties have not been found to be high enough.  Now they are being steepened up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them have been reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1233" />
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, they have been steepened up in some instances.  The point to which I want to refer is this, that those are only in their turn the raw material for other industries and that the Minister, in order to be logical, ought to bring in the things that follow as logically as day follows night: that when the raw material of a certain industry is steepened up, the finished article could then come in free from the other side on the duty which is at present imposed on it, or in its turn the duty on the finished article will have to be steepened up again.  I should like to submit to the Minister that it is preposterous to suppose that you can steepen up the raw materials of existing manufactures in this country without giving them additional protection on the finished article coming in.  I should like to put before the Minister that that is absolutely logical and follows from those increased impositions of duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter quite apart from Deputy Mulcahy's remarks about those duties.  There is another phase of those impositions of duties.  The ordinary public and the trading community were accustomed to have duties presented to them once a year, and they made their plans accordingly. Now, they may waken up any morning and find that a duty has been imposed overnight.  The Minister may say that that prevents forestalling and has various advantages.  That may be so, but it also has disadvantages. I should like to suggest to the Minister that he has almost broken the back of the demand for a better-class article, or, in a lot of cases, not a better-class but a variation from what is manufactured in this country.  The difficulties and delays in getting this are such that they have created as much depression in industry as would almost balance the increased employment in manufacturing a number of those items.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that great depression has been caused by this whole matter of getting a letter from people to say they do not manufacture a particular article and have no objection to your importing it, and by the various steps which I have outlined in <Col N="1234" /> this House before, running into three weeks at the most favourable estimate and to a lot longer if there is the slightest hitch.  With those few general remarks I should like to reserve any criticism I have of the details for a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Mulcahy in suggesting to the Minister that this is a matter which requires to be put before the House in great detail, and on which we should be given all the information that is necessary.  In this regard, several very vexatious matters arise every day in actual practice.  To give an instance: you have a duty on cogwheels and pinions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only pointing out that the whole thing ought to be examined.  I know, for instance, that harvesting machines are imported free of duty into this country.  If a pinion or cog-wheel is broken in that a particular machine, and has to be imported, there is a demand for 40 per cent. duty on it.  In the meantime, that machine may have to stand still in a harvest field where there is a ripe crop.  There is very vexatious delay arising out of the fact that that matter has to be cleared up.  As a matter of fact, at the present time that pinion or cog-wheel cannot be made in this country, because it is made of a highly-tempered malleable metal.  That kind of article is not produced here at all.  There is no cog-wheel or pinion made in this country to fit a reaper and binder, and I think it is very unfair and unjust to have an article of that sort dutiable at all.  If one of those machines is in operation in a field, and a particular part is required and has to be imported&mdash;most of them have to be imported&mdash;the matter should be speeded up as much as possible.  Otherwise ideal weather conditions cannot be availed of, and a great loss is incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice in reference No. 8 that there is a variation of the duty on certain surface-glazed clay tiles.  I am of opinion, Sir, that we have had during the past few years a great many sewerage systems laid down all over <Col N="1235" /> the country in which clay tiles were used.  I should like to know what this variation in duty actually means.  Are we going to allow glazed tiles to be imported free of duty?</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes may be assured that there is no desire to limit discussion on any single item in the Bill.  I merely suggested in my opening remarks that such discussion could be more conveniently undertaken on the Committee Stage, when we could take every single one of these orders separately, and discuss them. On the contrary, rather than limit discussion, I offered Deputies every opportunity of getting the fullest information at my disposal concerning these items, and if they wanted to single out one they could move to delete it and in that way indicate those about which they are concerned. Deputy Mulcahy dealt with a question we discussed before, namely the need and the desirability of retaining this legislation which empowers the Government to impose duties by order. The Deputy is hypnotised by the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; in the title of the Act under which the orders were made.  While it is true that the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act was introduced in circumstances of emergency, it is also true that if the emergency had not arisen legislation of that character would be introduced in <Col N="1236" /> any event.  If we are going to embark on an industrial protection policy it follows inevitably that the Executive must be given power to impose duties by order.  In the circumstances of this country, where news that a new industrial project was under consideration could spread rapidly, where we have a small market that could be easily flooded with imported products; where we are up against a highly industrialised country, only a few hours' steamer journey away, power to deal expeditiously with the imposition of duties is essential, if a protectionist policy is to be effective at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy.  The Provisional Imposition of Duties Act, 1931, to which the Deputy refers, was passed by our predecessors and proved inoperative in practice.  If he recalls the experience of the Ministry of which he was a member, he will recollect that they were unable to avail of the terms of the Act. They made one Order under it and its legality was questioned.  I admit that they utilised it, but because of faulty phrasing the Act was practically a dead letter.  That Act would have to be repealed or replaced by another measure, even if the emergency of 1932 did not arise.  If it is admitted, and I think it was admitted, that our predecessors and ourselves found that the power of imposing duties by Order was necessary, then the only question that arises is the extent to which that power should be limited.  In that connection the only point of issue is whether the Orders should be submitted to the Dáil within a week, a month, three months, or six months after being made.  Apart from that, I submit that no other question arises than the power of imposing duties by Order, and, therefore, the power is given to the Dáil to repeal or annul these Orders.  Within what time should these Orders be confirmed by statute? The only question that arises, apart from the circumstances of one or two special cases, is the convenience of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Except in certain cases discussion of the Orders took place within six months of being made. None of the Orders in this Bill would expire in default of confirmation until next March.  We took the earliest possible opportunity of coming to the Dáil to get the Orders confirmed.  We propose to do that as a general policy, but we think it wise to leave a fairly wide margin, so that an emergency meeting of the Dáil will not be necessary perhaps to deal with trivial Orders.  Many of the Orders referred to in the Schedule are quite trivial. When I discuss the question of protection with Deputy Dockrell the position is different.  The Deputy seems to think that a higher duty means a higher price.  He cannot conceive a position where it might involve a lower price, that is to say, where an industry that was not manufacturing here is not working to capacity, not getting the fullest output from the machinery and staffs, and in consequence, prices are higher than prices in other countries, where an increased market is available, consequently an increased output, greater efficiency and organisation which enables them to reduce prices.  That is the common experience.  Yet Deputy Dockrell goes on as if such circumstances could not possibly arise.  There is no point in the Deputy and myself having a discussion on these matters, because we would be like two parallel lines that could not possibly meet.  I agree with Deputy <Col N="1238" /> Hughes that it is undesirable that there should be delay in importing articles that must be imported, but it is necessary that importers should co-operate in preventing delay.  The complaint we have is that, in fact, very infrequently do we get that co-operation from importers.  If people are to act on the assumption that they must be allowed the same facilities for importation, as if this was a free trade country, they are bound to be disappointed.  People must recognise the fact that the Government has embarked upon a protectionist policy and that involves the imposition of restrictions upon imports.</P>
      <P>I ask the importers to plan their requirements ahead.  If people are selling harvest machinery and other articles of machinery which require replacement parts, it is only a reasonable precaution for them to maintain a store in the country.  Even the ordinary trader or businessman would make adequate provision for that sort of thing, any man of average intelligence would do so.  These people must not blame the Government if there is delay in trying to get their goods cleared through the Customs.  The whole organisation of industry and commerce is designed to ensure that there will be a minimum delay in dealing with the issue of licences to facilitate the importation of articles that must be imported where a case is made for their importation.  But that organisation will be impotent unless the importers are prepared to co-operate in a bona fide way.  A great many of these importers are hostile to the protectionist policy and sometimes they have allowed that hostility to injure themselves.  I do not think I quite understood Deputy Mulcahy's reference when he referred to weighing scales and component parts.  The effect of the order was to release component parts from duty and this dealt with the manner of doing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets out that the governing body of any voluntary hospital may, pursuant to a resolution adopted by such governing body, apply to the Minister for an establishment order in relation to such hospital. The Minister informed us the last evening that there would not be any establishment order without entire agreement between the hospital authorities and the local authority concerned. There is apparently a certain fear abroad&mdash;I do not know whether it is founded or not&mdash;that the Minister, holding, as he does hold, the right to question the payment of deficits in hospital administration, may force a hospital into the position of not being able to carry on and, consequently, having to apply for an establishment order.  I should like if the Parliamentary Secretary would put us straight upon that, if he feels that there is anything like that in view, although I can scarcely expect him to say there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if there is any cause for <Col N="1243" /> the fears which certain people in the City of Dublin have in that respect? At the moment it seems to be a burning question between the Department and the local authorities with regard to certain amalgamations in the city, and there is an outcry against the delay.  Some of these hospitals are afraid that the Minister may utilise the powers he has of refusing to pay a deficit in order to force certain hospitals into the position of applying for an establishment order.  If anything like that comes to pass it would be a thing that was not looked for and a thing that ought not to happen.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to allay the fears of some of the hospital authorities that feel very concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is news to me that there is any suspicion in the minds of the governing bodies of any of the voluntary hospitals that the machinery proposed to be set up in this Bill will be used for the purpose indicated by Deputy Brennan.  I can assure the Deputy, and anybody else concerned in the matter, that such a thought never entered the minds of the people responsible for placing this Bill before the House.  The Bill has been put before the House on Second Reading solely for the purpose of enabling voluntary hospitals who wish to merge their interests or pool their resources with the local authority, and if, as has been indicated to us, there are some such voluntary hospital authorities in existence at the present time, the necessary machinery will be provided in this Bill to enable them to seek the establishment order mentioned.</P>
      <P>Unless there is complete agreement, both between the local authority and the governing body of the voluntary hospital concerned, the question of an establishment order will not arise at all.  I assure the Deputy and the House that it is not the intention of the Minister or the Department to exercise any pressure, financial or otherwise, on the committee of a voluntary hospital to force them to merge their interests with some other body.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary has explained the position.  It was not in my mind, but it was brought to my notice that the thing was quite possible, and there were certain people in Dublin very much afraid, and I take it now that they will take the assurance that the Parliamentary Secretary has given that there is no such thing going to be done. As I said, I did not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to say it was in view, but I wanted him to assure the people that it is not going to be done, that there is not going to be any financial question of that sort brought to bear on hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary go a step further and say that hospitals will be invited to apply for an establishment order? What the Parliamentary Secretary has said merely arouses suspicion.  In the first place, hospitals here will come under the local authority, and the local authority, if we are prepared to believe all that we read in the papers about their increasing expenditure, can scarcely, unless forced, be desirous of adding to their commitments, and taking over hospitals in these cases will mean that.  I presume that if there are establishment orders indulged in, it will lessen the cost that should fall upon the fund over which the Minister exercises some control, and leave perhaps larger sums available for the smaller number of bodies that would be applying for it.  This Bill, I understand, has to deal principally with Cork Street Hospital.  But it goes beyond that.  It is an enabling measure, and once there is an enabling measure there is very great power, and, of course, influence, in connection with the exercise of the provisions that are in it.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether or not hospitals are going to be invited, directly there is any difficulty, to apply for an establishment order and bequeath their difficulties to the local authority.</P>

      <P>I cannot give any guarantee to the Deputy or to the House that in certain circumstances hospitals will not be invited to seek an establishment order.  If it appears to the Minister <Col N="1245" /> and perhaps to the governing body of a voluntary hospital that the community would best be served by such a hospital merging its interests with the local authority and seeking an establishment order I certainly could not give any guarantee that they would not be invited to take a course of action that was considered to be the best course of action both for themselves and the community they were called upon to serve.</P>

      <P>(a)  the Minister may decide either to grant such application or not to grant such application,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 11 where an establishment order has been confirmed the Minister may from time to time by order amend such establishment order.  The Minister is taking very extensive powers by order under <Col N="1249" /> the section.  Once he has an establishment order at all and it has been confirmed he may, by order, then do any blessed thing he likes, apparently without the consent of either of the two parties.  Now I am afraid that under that section which is rather innocent looking, the Minister as a matter of fact takes all power into his hands. Where an establishment order is first put into operation and certain conditions are possibly not operating in the beginning the Minister may afterwards, by this kind of omnibus power, which he has in this particular section do any and every thing he desires.  I wonder if that is a desirable thing, and I wonder how the hospitals concerned will view that particular section if they are applying for an establishment order.</P>

      <P>There is no ground for Deputy Brennan's apprehension in this regard either.  The section provides for the amendment of establishment orders in due course but provides that the procedure in connection with such amendment shall be the same as the original procedure in making the establishment order.  Exactly the same steps must be taken&mdash;consultation, agreement, publication of the various steps in the Press, etc.&mdash;all these steps must be gone through in relation to any amendment, in the same manner as if it were an original application for the making of an establishment order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the section is at all clear, or that it clearly contains what the Parliamentary Secretary said it contains.  I do not think that any local authority would be entitled to insist upon, say, agreement for any further or subsequent order of the Minister, as they would be in the first instance, where they came together and agreed upon a certain principle.  I quite realise, of course, the necessity of the Minister, possibly, having certain powers to deal with certain alternations, but in this kind of omnibus clause, he is given the right, after bringing those two bodies together originally on some kind of basis, to depart entirely and completely from that basis, and, by order, to put <Col N="1250" /> a new face upon it.  It seems to me that this section is rather peculiarly worded.  It does not seem to be clear to me at all, and I cannot follow the Parliamentary Secretary's view in this direction.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that this Bill be read a Second Time.  This is a Bill to amend the Statutory Declarations Act of 1835. It proposes to remove certain anomalies and overcome certain difficulties that have arisen under that Act.  Section 18 of the Statutory Declarations Act, 1835, authorises certain persons to take statutory declarations, namely a justice of the peace, a notary public, or any other officer by law authorised at the time of the passing of that Act to administer an oath.  Section 21 of the same Act provides that a person who makes a false statutory declaration under the Act shall be guilty of a misdemeanour. Section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, authorises peace commissioners to take statutory declarations, and the Unemployment Assistance (Qualification Certificate Regulations) Order, 1934, made under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, authorises officers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take statutory declarations from applicants for unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Courts of Justice Act, 1924, and the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, however, do not contain any provision making it an offence for a person to make a false statutory declaration before a peace commissioner or an officer of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I am advised that it would not be possible to indict a person under Section 21 of the Statutory Declarations Act, 1835, for making a false declaration before any person other than the persons authorised by that Act to take statutory declarations. The main object of the Bill is to remove that anomaly by making it an offence for a person to make a false statutory declaration before any person <Col N="1252" /> authorised by law to take statutory declarations, and to provide that that offence shall be triable summarily. Sections 1 and 6 of the Bill are intended to achieve that object.  That is really the purpose of the Bill.  It does not make any other changes.</P>

      <P>Well, there is a section here&mdash;Section 6&mdash;into which I should be glad if the Minister would look before the Committee Stage. It speaks of &ldquo;every person who makes a statutory declaration which is false or wilfully misleading&rdquo; and prescribes a penalty.  Now, there are people who make false statements in all good faith, and I presume it is not intended that they should be liable to the penalties here. I have come across cases myself, particularly of elderly people, who give wrong information in the very best of good faith, sometimes to their own disadvantage. Perhaps the Minister would look into that particular section and see whether or not he could frame it in such a way as to bring in &ldquo;wilfully false&rdquo; or something of that sort, rather than just accidentally false.</P>

      <P>The Bill which we are hoping to introduce is a short Bill consisting of seven sections, and is submitted for the purpose of amending Sections 11, 12, 13, 17 and 24 of the Labourers Act, 1936.  The Labourers <Col N="1254" /> Act which became law in that year, and which was introduced and carried through by the Government, has not had the desired effect, in so far as labourers have not availed of that measure, and not a single house has been purchased under its provisions. That would evidently indicate that there is something wrong, because nobody can deny the enthusiasm of the labourers throughout the country for many years in seeking for a purchase measure.  It is obviously clear then that there is something lacking in the measure which the Government put through this House.</P>

      <P>I would submit, Sir, that the necessary steps were taken by the Government following the six months' period to have schemes prepared by boards of health.  I would remind the Minister also that it was a voluntary question for acceptance or otherwise by the tenants.  I am sure that if the communications which have reached the Minister are anything like the representations which have reached me and other members of the Party, he will have to admit that there is no indication whatever of the tenants in my part of the country availing of that measure.  There were two outstanding defects which the Labour Party sought to have amended in the Bill which they tried to have introduced before now. It never reached a Second Reading, but it was printed and circulated. Subsequent to that the Minister, in the Housing Act of 1937, was decent enough to take one of the provisions and incorporate it in that Act.  We were glad at any rate to see one of our provisions being given effect to.  If the Minister had gone the whole hog at that time, and taken the 50 per cent. provision, I think there would not be much difficulty about acceptance of the purchase scheme by the tenants throughout the country.  The main provision <Col N="1255" /> of this Bill which we are seeking to introduce now is to give effect to the 50 per cent. remission of current rents on the annuity system, and one or two other clauses.  The one dealing with the arrears has already been incorporated in the Government Bill of 1937.  There are one or two other clauses dealing with the question of terms for eviction in the event of nonpayment, and asking for four weeks instead of one week, as incorporated at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main part of the Bill is dealing with the 50 per cent. remission.  The labourers feel that they are entitled to that provision.  They feel very strongly about it.  We had an expression of opinion in this House when the Government Bill was passing through. From every side of the House there was a unanimous chorus supporting the Labour Party amendment for 50 per cent.  The Minister was the only one who said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Five Deputies from the Fianna Fáil Benches supported Labour and Fine Gael, but unfortunately, in response to the Whip, those five Deputies voted against their own speeches.  That does not alter the position that if something is not done to improve the Bill already passed, something in the shape of what we are trying to do here, it was only waste of time on the part of the Dáil and on the part of the Government draftsman, in having prepared the scheme which is before the country. The proposals in our Bill are quite moderate.  They are the minimum which I consider are necessary in order to make the Bill sufficiently attractive to have it availed of.  If the House will give permission to have it printed and circulated so that Deputies can study its provisions, we will bring it to a Second Reading, and then if necessary we can amend it further in Committee. I consider it is rather unusual to have this type of opposition offered to the introduction of a Bill.  I am at a loss to understand the Minister's ferocity, if I may use the word.  On the first opportunity he brought us back into Private Members' time, and now it is opposed again.  The Bill is designed to improve the lot of one of the most deserving sections of the <Col N="1256" /> community, and to try to bring their purchase rents into conformity with the existing conditions of agricultural labourers.  I do not think we were entitled to get the hostility displayed by the Minister, and I trust that even now the House will see its way to enable us to have the Bill printed and circulated, so that we may see what it stands for and the modesty of its demands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Labour Party cannot complain that they did not get notice.  On the occasion of the introduction of the measure by Deputy Norton it was objected to.  The normal course in a case of that sort is to put it back to Private Members' time, and that has been done.  In the period from the date of the refusal of the First Reading down to to-day, which was certainly a week and possibly a fortnight, the Deputies had plenty of opportunity for submitting a memorandum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the usual course was taken.  It was to come on in Private Deputies' time, and to take precedence over other business.  I thought the Deputy knew that.  He is long enough in the House to know it. A measure sponsored by the Government was passed two years ago, but it has not yet been enacted.  Deputy Keyes said there was something lacking in it.  It struck me from the introduction of the measure that the occupants of labourers' cottages would have been as well off without purchasing, if they got greater fixity of tenure and <Col N="1257" /> some other privileges that, I observe, are not, in certain cases, conferred on them by statute.  I propose, however, to favour the motion to have this Bill read a Second Time, and, at least, to allow it to be introduced.  I was not satisfied with the Government measure dealing with the purchase of cottages. I would be in favour of <i>bona fide</i> agricultural labourers getting their cottages on even more favourable terms, although I am still convinced that it would be a mistake on their part to purchase them.  Some of these houses are 40 years' old, and the cost of repairs would be heavy.  If the tenants had fixity of tenure, in their own interests, I think purchase would be a mistake.  There is a case for giving some concessions by reason of the Local Loans Fund being finished. On the last occasion it was not finished.  The Government measure was overweighted with conditions.  The present occupants of labourers' cottages are not, in all cases, agricultural labourers.  In the event of certain persons having got cottages during the last few years, who are not <i>bona fide</i> agricultural labourers, it appears to me the State or the House has no right to transfer the cottages to them. These cottages were built originally for agricultural labourers and that is the section of the community that has a right to them.  Even if some other persons are in possession, labourers should not be deprived of these cottages, and, to that extent, I prefer to vote for the introduction of the measure, to see if it will not be possible to improve it and to expedite matters generally.</P>

      <P>The Bill that the representatives of the Labour Party propose to introduce would, if passed, make two important changes in the scheme that has been before the House for the last three weeks.  The reason for the delay is that it was a very tedious, difficult and troublesome operation to get all the information that was required.  As was pointed out on the discussion of the 1936 Bill, many of the documents dealing with the Labourers Acts, and with the building of labourers' cottages, disappeared in the fire at the <Col N="1258" /> Custom House in 1920.  It was only within the last two months that the schemes were finally adopted by the various boards of health, confirmed by me, and laid on the Table of the House.  The bigger of the changes proposed to be made was the reduction of 50 per cent. in the rent when the tenant first occupied the cottage, instead of the 25 per cent. reduction proposed in the Act of 1936.  The second change proposed is that the period in respect of which the annuity would be paid is 50 years instead of 35 years.  As Deputy Keyes pointed out, there are minor changes in the Bill he proposes.  I would not have introduced the Bill, and asked this House to give local authorities power to enable tenants to purchase their cottages, were it not for the persistent demand from tenants in every county. I had to argue the matter before I agreed to ask the Government to allow me to introduce that Bill.  I met deputations of tenants and representatives of various districts, and I put up arguments something on the lines that Deputy Cosgrave mentioned.  These people were fixed in the view that they had a right to purchase the cottages, and that they felt they would be better off: I must say that at that time they did not have the terms of the Bill before them.  It may be easily said that if they had known the terms, they might not have been so enthusiastic, but the fact remains that, in the last six months, I have received resolutions, frequently from cottage tenants and organisations, asking why I was not putting the Act into operation, and giving them the opportunity that they looked for.  I received these resolutions from organisations, political and otherwise, representing cottage tenants.  I am satisfied that there is a strong demand from the tenants to be allowed to buy the houses.  We set up a commission and the recommendations made by it are embodied in the Act passed in 1936. The tenants were strongly represented on that commission.  There were seven or eight members on it, and four were direct representatives of the tenants.  Their recommendations were put into the Bill.</P>

      <P>There is an addendum in the report asking for a 50 per cent. reduction.  The report was signed by all, including the cottage representatives.  The recommendations are embodied in the measure.  I refer the Deputies to the report, as it will show that what I am saying is correct. Repairs to these cottages cost a considerable sum now, but in the report it was stated that the tenants would be better off, if they carried out the repairs, as they could carry them out, perhaps, with greater personal satisfaction and at less cost.  It has to be remembered that boards of health are bound to put all cottages that are purchased into a proper state of repair before they are handed over.  I thought that Act met the situation fairly.  I based it on the report I got from a commission on which the tenants were strongly represented.</P>

      <P>That is not ignoring them.  If the Deputy reads the report he will find that all the members signed it.  They did not make any exception to any of the recommendations, including the one to reduce the charges by 25 per cent.  They did not withdraw from that.  I think it was fair to the cottage tenants and fair and just to the ratepayers, because there was a burden on the ratepayers before the campaign started in 1932 or 1933 to build more labourers' cottages.  That burden was already heavy, amounting to about £144,000 a year.  Since then 13,000 labourers' cottages have been erected.  Deputy Corish will be able to tell Deputy Keyes what a burden was placed on the ratepayers by the building of these additional cottages.  What I am afraid of is that if the burden is too heavy no more cottages will be built.  I want to see every labourer <Col N="1260" /> getting a chance of having a cottage. The one great fear I have is that if the burden is being constantly added to&mdash; and no one will deny the burden on the Exchequer&mdash;and thrown on the local authorities, they may stop building, although there are many thousands of cases to be provided for. I do not want these people to be left unprovided for.  That is the main reason I do not want to give way now. It would not be just to the ratepayers. The cottage tenants are getting a fair and just deal under the Act.  They have been treated justly and generously, and can purchase the pre-1931 cottages, of which the average rent would be 10½d. a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>(Junior): I move the following motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, believing that grave hardship is borne by many school children, whose parents are unable to pay for their school books and school requisites, the Dáil is of opinion that immediate steps should be taken by the Government to supply books and requisites free in all such cases.</P>
      <P>In proposing this motion, I am not unmindful of the work already being done by the State to help to keep children at school who might otherwise have to stay away.  I do not think it is necessary for me to stress the hardships that are still being borne by many school children and their parents owing to lack of the necessary books and materials.  School attendance officers inform us, as a result of their visits to the homes of the children concerned, that many of the absences from school are due to the lack of books.  Cases are only too numerous, indeed, of children being forced to leave school before the normal leaving age or before they would otherwise do so because of the amount of money they would have to bring to school for books in their last year.  Even in their earlier years, the amount of money which pupils have to bring into school is oftentimes well beyond the means of the unfortunate parent or guardian who might be one of the unemployed or one of the many thousands who are poorly paid.  The cost of a set of books in the fourth standard is, we are told, approximately 12/6.  I leave it to the House to judge what must be the dilemma of many parents who have to supply books for four or five or even more children. Furthermore, text books and readers are still changed too frequently to allow of the passing down of books from senior to junior to any really helpful extent.  If books were not changed so frequently, parents might have some consolation from the fact that young children could use the books with which the older children had finished. But that is not the case.  The facts are, briefly, that many parents all over Ireland simply cannot pay for their children's school books and it is our duty to provide the books and requisites in these cases.  I refer Deputies to paragraph 4 of Article 42 of the Constitution, which states that: &ldquo;The State shall provide for free primary education.&rdquo;  I submit that, until we provide free school books and requisites, we shall not be providing free education.  It is a very urgent matter and we should do so as soon as possible.  I have not gone into the matter in very great detail because I know every Deputy must be in agreement with the motion and my appeal to the House is to do this now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in seconding the motion so ably proposed by Deputy Byrne.  In the first place, I must congratulate him on the first occasion he has addressed the <Col N="1265" /> House, on the very clear and concise manner in which he put the subject matter of his motion before the House.  I am not going to deal at great length with the motion.  I am personally aware of the great work done by the Government and the previous Government in the matter of education, by providing primary schools and technical schools, with the sole object of enabling those who want to advance themselves to take advantage of the facilities that are being offered by the Government in that sphere.  Considering that the State at the moment is spending at the rate of almost £3,000,000 on education, I think Deputies will agree that, if the State is to get a return for that huge expenditure, it is necessary that children attending schools should be provided with the necessary books to enable them to benefit to the fullest from the expenditure of such a large amount of money.  Every one knows from experience that a child attending school without books is like a good tradesman with bad tools or no tools at all.  Every one knows that no matter how competent a tradesman may be, if he has not proper tools he is at a great disadvantage.  I submit to the House that there are a great many children attending school at present who, because of the position of their parents and because of the fact that these parents are unable to provide them with books, are not able to get the best results from the education imparted to them.  Those in close contact with the education of the children of the country have stated over and over again that they find their work has been greatly impeded by the fact that numbers of children attending the various primary schools have not the necessary books.  I refer to statements made by members of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation whenever their annual congress is held.  Reference is frequently made there to the desirability of providing free books for necessitous children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must state candidly that I would be the last man to advocate any legislation which would enable the Government to interfere unduly with the family life of the people of this country. I am rather sceptical as to the <Col N="1266" /> advantages of the State interfering at all.  It is only because I am convinced that it is absolutely necessary that the State should do something in regard to supplying free books that I have pleasure in supporting this motion proposed by Deputy Byrne.  I know it is a motion that will commend itself to the support of all Parties in the House. I also know that the Minister, judging by his public speeches, will give it his most sympathetic consideration.  It is just a matter of finance, but I am sure that it will be possible to put the terms of this motion into operation just as it was possible to put the School Meals Act into operation.  That was an Act which, when first passed, possibly gave rise to a feeling of suspicion.  Many people possibly thought that it was not the correct thing to do.  Anyone who is a member of a public body will agree that his experience has been that that Act has been a great boon to the poor children attending our primary schools. In the same manner, I think the terms of this motion should get legislative effect on lines somewhat similar to those observed in regard to the School Meals Act.  I am not going to deal at great length with the motion because I know it is one that will meet with favourable consideration from Deputies and from the Minister.  I am sure that it is only a matter of time until the Minister will be in a position to give legislative effect to this motion so that the grievances from which so many poor children suffer will disappear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. While I agree with Deputy Byrne and Deputy Coburn in most of their statements, I cannot agree with their references to the great work done by this Government or the previous Government for primary education.  I do not think that the fact that new national schools or new technical schools are being provided is in itself any indication that there has been any great improvement in education or that great work is being done for primary education.  I perhaps would draw down upon my head the wrath of senior members of the House if I were to assert that the standard of primary education is not much higher now than it was 20 or <Col N="1267" /> 40 years ago, but I think I can reasonably say that under the system which is in operation to-day, with its overcrowded curricula, the schools are expected to cover in five or six hours a programme that they could not possibly get through satisfactorily in 24. I believe that the provision of free school books is a very desirable object, but I think that I would be understating the position if I did not say that in addition to giving school books, the Dáil should consider the work that the teacher has to do in the primary schools to-day and consider the studies that the children have to undertake. If we provide them with free school books, I think we should also provide them with a new curriculum which would give the teacher a chance of doing something that he can reasonably be expected to do in five or six hours and give the child a chance of learning something that he may reasonably be expected to study within those five or six hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind the great difficulty that exists in connection with the question of providing books for children, is the fact that these books are so often changed.  Not so very long ago the books that were used in one class by a child could be used in succeeding years by other children of the family, or they could be passed on to members of other families because the books used in one class were practically the same year after year.  I find that the great grievance amongst parents is the fact that books are so often changed.  They have to spend very often a sum altogether out of proportion to the income of the family on providing books owing to the fact that books are so often changed for a particular class.  They find that year after year they have to purchase entirely new books, whereas not so very long ago it was quite possible to utilise the books of the elder members of the family for the younger members in after years.  If one takes the position of a family in distressed circumstances, the family in the country where the father possibly is a labourer in bad health or is unable to obtain work or is possibly living on some small amount <Col N="1268" /> of unemployment assistance, and then realise that that man and his wife are expected to expend quite a considerable amount of money in providing their children with school books during the year, anybody could make a case for this motion.  There is ample justification for the motion from that point of view alone but in view of the fact that we are spending well over £3,000,000 on primary education in the year and that the very small amount necessary to implement this motion would not make a terrible difference in that large sum, I do believe it would not be worth while, and it would be very wrong, to attempt any discrimination in the distribution of free school books.  I believe that it is money this House could safely vote.  There is nobody in this country, whether rich or poor, will quarrel with the provision of free school books, particularly when they realise that there are classes in the community at present on whom the cost of school books, and particularly in the case of a large family, or of a family in very distressed circumstances, is a burden which the people cannot reasonably be expected to shoulder.  I ask the House, as Deputy Byrne and Deputy Coburn asked it, to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a new subject in this House, or outside it.  The matter has been raised very frequently in the past here, by way of parliamentary question and otherwise.  I remember on one such occasion the Minister, while professing sympathy with the proposal, expressed the view that there was no great demand for this change throughout the country.  I think he was honestly, but entirely, mistaken in that view, because going through the country and meeting the people who are keenly interested, because they have to be keenly interested in a matter of this kind, one could not but recognise that this was a reform that was very strongly desired and very much required throughout the country.  I think it would be no exaggeration to describe the reform envisaged in this proposal as a great national need, and I hope sincerely that, as a result of the discussion, the Minister, who, in recent public utterances, <Col N="1269" /> we are happy to note, indicated that this matter was getting fuller consideration than it received in the past, will indicate his agreement with the need for this reform and announce his intention to give effect to it at an early date.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the masses of the people in this country have nothing to offer their children but an education, and with the limited opportunities they have in that direction, such educational facilities as can be put at the disposal of the children ought to be freely put at their disposal.  For the masses of the children whose parents cannot afford a secondary education, the only education must be that of the primary schools.  I agree that that, on the whole, has been very good, and the records of these schools over generations show that the boy and girl in the small national school in a remote area have been able to attain very great prominence, and have had the natural talents and brilliant intellects they possessed brought out and given a full and proper place as a result of that national school education.  I think it is most regrettable that, in the process of that education, there should be a position in which a number of the children are denied the full facilities for receiving that education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not an opportunity of making very many new points on this matter, because the points that have been made are those that would strike anybody who takes part in such a debate. There is, however, one aspect which might be mentioned.  Above all others, young children are extremely sensitive, and children attending school who feel that they are not in as favourable a position as the children who sit in the same class or the same room are in a very unhappy position.  We know that children going to school like to feel that they are in a position of equality, in respect of the little things that are necessary in school, with the other children, and the classification of children by reason of the circumstances of their parents and the handicaps imposed on their children because they are not able to compete with their comrades in the class because they have not got these school requisites to the same extent, and because they know, even <Col N="1270" /> in their very early days, that the procuring of such requisites imposes a heavy burden on their parents, is a very unhappy position for such children.</P>
    <P>I agree that a good deal towards the provision of school books for children whose parents are not able to provide them has been done by the national teachers, but I ask again why should that be the case?  Why should the teacher have to call the poor child out of the class quietly and tell him that it will not be necessary to try to secure any money at home for books, but that he or she will be prepared to provide the books?  I know that that is very generally done at present and I think it is very regrettable that our educational system should have such associations as that kind of thing represents.  I give all credit to the teachers who do that work, and I think credit can be extended generally to the bulk of the teachers in the country who are always anxious to help their children and whose main ambition has been to see that the children get the best possible training, and get their intellect and brains and opportunities developed to the fullest possible extent in the school.  It does not need any great emphasis to show that the disabilities of parents of very humble circumstances and with very little means have been intensified by the increasing cost of books.  They are more expensive than they used to be years ago and they are changed very frequently.  Again, we all note with pleasure the fact that the Minister has stated recently that in that connection some changes have been made. I take it that that is the result of the work of the Inter-Departmental Committee which examined this matter some time ago.  That is all to the good, but it does not go far enough, and the Minister would do a very great national service by going the whole way in this matter, and by making it clear that the children of the humblest parents in the country will have the same opportunities in the national schools, so far as school requisites are concerned, as any other children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> I think, and I have always thought, that amongst the greatest tragedies in this country is that type of tragedy represented by the growing boy or girl who has no opportunity in life.  We know that this is a matter of tremendous anxiety to parents all over the country.  Any member of the House, any public representative on local bodies or elsewhere, will know, from his correspondence and from his interviews with the people he represents, that it is one of the problems one comes up against most frequently.  I believe the position in that respect is intensified because children have not got equal opportunities in the matter of getting primary education.  I wind up on the note on which I opened this statement by saying that this, to me, represents one of the most important reforms the House could consider, and I sincerely hope that, as a result of this discussion and of bringing this matter very definitely to the notice of the House, the Minister, who has indicated sympathy and consideration with the general principles of it, will not stop at any half-way house on the road to securing this reform, but will recognise that in bringing about this reform, he is conferring a very definite boon on the parents of these children, and, in the end, is only securing justice for the children of the country, the justice of which their citizenship of the State entitles them to, and which, as Deputy Byrne said, has been actually enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that every Deputy will feel sympathetic towards the motion.  It is laid down in the Constitution that the State should provide primary education for all the children of the country.  Commonsense and common humanity dictate that at the present time an effort should be made to lighten, as far as possible, the burden upon the poorer classes of the community who have young helpless children attending school.  It is a matter of regret that the marriage rate in this country is declining; and that at the present time it has reached a very low level.  If there is one thing that might deter young people from entering <Col N="1272" /> the marriage state it is the difficulty that those who have entered it find in providing for the education of their children.  If the implementing of this motion imposes a slight burden upon the general taxpayers, I am sure they will acknowledge that they are doing a public service by encouraging marriage and the rearing up of families. That, surely, is a social duty which every taxpayer will admit is an obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points that, I think, the Minister should give consideration to if he has decided, as I am sure he has, to implement the motion.  The first is that there should be no discrimination between children.  If it be decided to provide books for the children attending the national schools, then they should be supplied to all the children. Otherwise, the feelings of children and of their parents would, to a certain extent, be hurt, and the motion would, in that sense, probably defeat its object.  Primary education is free to all citizens, regardless of their means.  If the House accepts the principle of supplying free books, then they should be supplied free to all citizens. There is a second point, and it is this: if the State decides to supply free books, there may be a tendency to increase the number of them.  I think the Department of Education should exercise a rigid control over the number of books supplied to children. Otherwise there may be a demand on the part of teachers, a demand which will not be resisted by parents, to increase the number of books which children will be expected to study. That might lead to an injustice so far as the taxpayers are concerned, because books might then be provided that were not necessary.  Deputy Linehan very truly pointed out that the child's mind is not capable of absorbing everything that can be put into print.  It might also lead to a grave injustice so far as the children themselves are concerned, because they would be expected to carry a heavy load of books to school.  That would be a serious thing for children in the country, many of whom have to travel two and three miles to school. The number of books should be strictly limited, in the interests of the mental <Col N="1273" /> and physical welfare of the children. If these points are attended to, then I think the Minister should have no hesitation in accepting the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the motion, and hope that it will be considered by the House in a non-Party spirit.  From time to time I have poor people coming to me telling me of the difficulties they find in providing books for their children.  It is certainly very hard on poor people that they are not able to do that.  It often results in grave injustice to a clever child. Quite recently I investigated the incomes of 709 families, each comprising about six persons, in the City of Cork.  I found that there were 163 of those families living on an income of less than 24/- a week.  The lowest amount which each family had to pay in rent was 3/- per week.  How on earth could these parents afford to buy books for their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from my own experience that teachers and other people in the city, when they get to know of the condition of their neighbours, do help them by buying books for their children. I had a very regrettable case brought to my notice recently.  It was that of a boy of 14 years of age. He was a really brilliant boy, but because of the economic position of his parents he had to leave school and take up work as a messenger. Teachers and other people interested in the boy appealed to his parents to leave him at school.  Eventually the boy's father got employment. After about nine months he was able to return to school, and I am glad to be able to tell the House that the boy has since won a valuable scholarship.  Were it not for the fact that his parents' good neighbours came to their assistance the intelligence and ability of that boy would be lost to the country.  Within the past fortnight I heard of the case of a poor widow with four children whose eldest son has also won a scholarship. In that case also good neighbours came to her assistance.  Members of the House realise that it is quite impossible for workers who are not in regular employment to buy school books for their children.  I would <Col N="1274" /> appeal to members of all Parties to support the motion.  If they do so they may be the means of helping many brilliant children to get the education that their talents merit for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has had some practical experience of the hardships suggested by the motion, I desire to support it very heartily.  I am sure that the Minister, from the experience he has gained in his Department, is in sympathy with it.  There is no doubt but that under the present system very severe hardships are being inflicted on children whose parents are in poor circumstances, particularly the children of men who are unemployed or who can only get casual employment.  People living on home assistance cannot possibly provide books for their children. It is a trait peculiar to the Irish character that parents will make any sacrifice for their children.  I have known cases where that sacrifice has been made.  I am sure Deputies will agree that it is not reasonable to ask poor parents to continue to make the sacrifices involved in this particular matter. As has been pointed out to us here to-night, it is not reasonable to ask teachers to make that sacrifice; I hold it is the duty of the State to make it. That duty has been laid down in the new Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had it in the Constitution in the Sinn Féin days that all education is free.  Now, we have it in the new Constitution that primary education should be free.  This motion is simply a method of implementing that Article. While this duty is imposed on parents and especially on parents of the categories I have enumerated, education is not free and primary education is not free no matter how we talk about it. Very often we criticise things and attribute many drawbacks to the evil of our association with Great Britain.  But, even in the bad old days, there was, in this country, a scheme operated whereby half the cost of the school books was borne by what now corresponds to the Department of Education and what was then known as the Commissioners of National Education. They paid half the cost of the school books and the children or their parents <Col N="1275" /> had to pay only the other half.  In that way there was a reduction in the cost of school books in those days.</P>
    <P>At the present time in Great Britain books and schools requisites are free to the children in the board schools. The only fault I have to find with the motion on the Order Paper is the discrimination between necessitous school children and other children.  In the motion the question of school books and school requisites is confined to the case of necessitous school children.  I suppose on the principle that a half a loaf is better than no bread, one must support the motion.  But I think we should go further and say, as in the Constitution, that primary education is to be free to all the children of this nation.  That being the position, school books and school requisites should be free to all children.  I have had practical experience of the hardships that arise from want of school books, because in my own days if my teacher had not supplied me with books I probably could not have got the education I did get.  As to the teacher at present, he is harried and worried at the beginning of the year over the difficulty of supplying books to children whose parents are unable to pay for them.  We have to tell the children that they have to pay so much for their books and they do this by bringing a penny or a halfpenny weekly.  That is the system adopted by us in Cork in order to perform the duty which should be done by the State.  By that means we have tried to avoid any discrimination.  As Deputy Murphy has pointed out, children's feelings are tender and they feel very keenly this matter of not having the money to pay for their books.</P>
    <P>It is very often through no fault of the parents that this condition of things obtains.  Many of the parents are either in casual employment, living on home assistance or the dole, and it is hardly fair to ask them to shoulder the burden of a duty that the State should perform.  During the past few weeks we have been very generous with regard to dealing with Deputies, ex-Ministers and ex-Parliamentary Secretaries in the matter of allowances <Col N="1276" /> and pensions I suggest that as we are so generous in that matter we should be generous in this matter of school books and treat the future generation, the men and women of this State, with some generosity.  By implementing this motion before the House you give them a chance of getting a proper education, give them a chance of the free education that is their right under the Constitution.  Help the children to cultivate the talents that God has given them.  If we do that we will be doing our duty by the future of the people of this country.  It is a more pressing problem than the matter of pensions.</P>
    <P>At present in Cork City we are carrying through an experiment in compulsory education.  Children of between 14 and 16 years of age are being compelled to attend a further course of instruction.  In that course we have free school books.  Not alone have we free school books, but each child gets a free meal at midday.  The free meal at midday is quite right, but why confine it to the few hundred children involved in this course of education? Why not make it the rule and provide for carrying it out so that the children who attend school from four to 14 years of age as well as those who attend school from 14 to 16 years should be given a midday meal?  If it is possible to provide books and requisites and give a free meal in one case, why not do it for the children concerned in this motion?  I think this measure will have the sympathy of all Parties in this House.  I know that we have the sympathy of the Minister. Having that sympathy and support from all parts of the House, I do not see any reason why such a motion should not be implemented. The principal objection I see against it is that it makes discrimination as between the children of those parents who can buy school books and the children of necessitous parents.  I would like to see the motion include all children and to say, as in the words of the Constitution, that primary education is free in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Department of Education <Col N="1277" /> is concerned, its ability, as this House is aware, to improve educational facilities and to extend them depends very largely upon the financial circumstances.  There are a great many ways in which I, as Minister for Education, could spend money with advantage and which I think would benefit the younger generation considerably if the money were available. But Deputies forget that very large sums of money have to be made available to accomplish comparatively small improvements and this is by reason of the size of the service.  At the present time we are spending over £4,750,000 yearly upon education. That is a considerable portion of our national expenditure.  As I pointed cut recently, if we are to make considerable developments such as, for example, extending the school-leaving age, these will involve us in an additional expenditure of £1,000,000 a year.  If we seek to carry out these improvements we will at once be faced with the problem of how the money is to be raised to provide these additional services.  There is a constant demand for better accommodation with regard to school buildings.  It is not alone that there is a demand that better buildings should be provided but that the maintenance of these buildings should be taken over completely by the State, and also that the heating and cleaning of national schools should be made a State charge.  Each of these items in the way of improvement would run into a considerable amount of money, perhaps £100,000 in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hurley and others who make demands for further expenditure on education forget that we are in a different position in this country from that which obtains in other countries. In Great Britain, for example, a considerable amount of money which is expended annually on education is provided from the local rates.  If Deputy Hurley will look at the rate estimates for Glasgow City, or for Manchester, he will find there that very large sums are provided by the ratepayers towards defraying the expenses of education.  I think that in the City of Glasgow, while the State <Col N="1278" /> provides more than £1,500,000 yearly for education, the citizens of Glasgow, through the rates, provide something in the neighbourhood of another £1,500,000.  As far as I can remember, that is the position there.  The demand here is to place the burden of further education on the State, without examining in the first place whether the expenditure in question is necessary or advisable, and where and how, in the second place, the money is to be found.  As I say, if the money can be found, there is no doubt whatever in my mind but that it can be usefully expended upon extending educational facilities.  Deputy Hurley also referred to the generosity of the House in connection with legislation which is at present being discussed here, but I would point out to the Deputy that the amount of money involved in that legislation is small in comparison with the expenditure that would be necessary to carry out some of the schemes that he and his colleagues desire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>£20,000 certainly would. I do not know whether the Deputy to whom I have been referring is really the most appropriate person to criticise the generosity of the members of this House, as he would term it, to themselves; but I might point out to him that only last week we passed an Estimate in the House for a very much larger sum of money, something in the neighbourhood of £156,000 a year, to improve the remuneration of national teachers.  I simply mention that to show that a comparatively small increase of 5 per cent. in that direction comes to a very large amount of money annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, there are a great many parents and others in this country who do not believe in the principle of free school books.  They have an idea that the fibre of the people is being attacked, and the independence of our people destroyed, by the impression that is being created that everything can be got from the State for nothing, and that parents and members of the community in general have no <Col N="1279" /> responsibilities themselves towards their families.  I think very eminent authorities outside would question whether the State should accept a motion of this kind without examining it very carefully indeed and without being fully satisfied that parents were not, in fact, in a position adequately to carry out their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I have been told frequently by those in touch with educational administration, and who have responsibility for it, that what is got for nothing is not appreciated and that if charges were made frequently for things that are obtained from State sources, they would be more appreciated; those concerned would take greater advantage of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Linehan spoke of the system of education.  I do not know what authority the Deputy has for his statement that education is now inferior to what it was 20 years ago.  The Deputy is not a very old man; perhaps he remembers 20 years ago, but I am inclined to think he has not so long left school that he cannot prevent himself from making grammatical errors in his statement, at least when he is addressing the House on educational topics and lecturing the House and the country as to the defects of the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of school books and the demand that they should be standardised or not changed, the position is that after 1900 a change was made in the system of classification in our national schools and, instead of treating each class separately, certain classes were grouped together&mdash;for example, first and second, third and fourth, and fifth, sixth and seventh standards&mdash;and, as a result of this grouping system, to meet the needs of our small rural schools, it has been found necessary to change school books from year to year.  Last year we recommended the managers and teachers not to change the school books except where absolutely necessary and, where possible, and it is possible in a <Col N="1280" /> great many instances, to maintain the same class books in use for a period of years.</P>
      <P>But the Department of Education is strongly against the idea of reverting to the position that we had before 1900, when we had a separate class book for each class and each class was treated separately.  That would mean doing away with the group system that has been in vogue for over 30 years, a system fitted to our small schools and which seems to have given very good results.  Within that group system it is certainly possible to adopt economies and we have suggested to teachers and managers to adopt these economies where possible.  If these suggestions of the Department are carried into effect, it is anticipated that the cost of books should be considerably reduced.</P>
      <P>In large schools the same books can, as a rule, be used year after year, and, if the teachers train the pupils to keep the books clean and neat, they should be able to arrange that books in good condition could be available to entrants to the class the following year at, say, half price.  In the smaller schools the system of grouping classes together means, in Irish and English, for example, that the group must have a fresh book at least each alternate year.  Where the books are kept in a good state, they could be used by another lot of pupils when, under the group system, they are again in use in the next succeeding year.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to me that the prices charged at present for some of the books used in schools are excessive.  That is an aspect of the matter that I have been considering. If the prices here are excessive, as compared with elsewhere, I have no doubt that that is due in some measure to the fact that the cost of production here may not be as low as it is elsewhere. However, I intend to make further detailed inquiries into that matter, and, if I am satisfied that a case can be made to the publishers to have the prices of some of the books reduced, I shall make representations to them in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole problem, as I have told the House already, has been under consideration by the Department, and <Col N="1281" /> all I am in a position to say at present is that provision will be made in the Estimates for the coming year to enable grants to be made to national schools in aid of the provision of books for the children of necessitous parents. I am not in a position to announce the details of the scheme, but I hope to be able to do so within a comparatively short time.</P>
    <P>I think that covers nearly all the points that have been raised, except that I should like again to warn the House that, while it is comparatively easy to introduce demands for extended service in regard to education or other matters, the Government, and the Minister for Finance in particular, have the responsibility of raising that money.  I would like to point out that, since this Government came into office, the expenditure on education has gone up by nearly £400,000 per year.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other point except that, as regards the question of discrimination, under the scheme, the details of which are still under consideration and have not been finally worked out, I fear it will be impossible to avoid discrimination as between those children who are deemed to be in need of special aid by means of a State subsidy and those other children whose parents are in more fortunate circumstances and who should be expected to be able to provide school books for their children. Moreover, any scheme which is introduced will only deal with school books for the primary school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has drawn the attention of the House to the expenditure involved in carrying out a scheme of this kind.  However, he has not given us an estimate, as far as I can follow him, as to what increased expenditure is referred to.  I think it will be only a mere bagatelle, and I think the fact that he has referred to, the fact that £4,750,000 is expended on education, really makes the case stronger for spending the necessary money to provide school books for those who are unable to buy them.  Indeed, there are more necessitous children in the country than the Minister is aware of.  I am sure the <Col N="1282" /> Minister does not want to have these children going to school without having the means to profit by their attendance, especially since we have compulsory attendance.  It is a rather harsh law to compel poor children to go to school and poor parents to provide them with food and clothing without compelling them also to provide them with expensive school books.</P>
      <P>It has been a general grievance for some time with many parents that the price of books is too high.  They have been extraordinarily high and the binding is not very good.  Some of these expensive books fall into pieces after very little use, and that is a matter to which I would like to call the attention of the Minister.  An effort should be made to get the books bound better.</P>
      <P>I think the standard of some of the reading books could be improved, and would need to be improved.  The standardisation of books that could be passed on from year to year would be a benefit, and I am glad to hear the Minister say that that is to be the policy of the Department of Education in the future.</P>
      <P>I think that, on the whole, even though it may cost a little extra money, no money has been expended by any Department that would do more general good to the community than the money provided for books for children attending school.  If they have no books they are only wasting their time. As I mentioned before, the burden on the parents is very heavy without imposing upon them the necessity of buying books for children who have to attend school compulsorily.  I think there is a good case to be made for the provision of books for school children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that this motion by Deputy Byrne is worthy of support.  Still, after listening to the speech of the Minister, I am satisfied that we are not going to get anything like what this House expects on this motion.  I am quite satisfied that the education of the masses is of the utmost importance to the advance of any country.  I am also <Col N="1283" /> satisfied that the Government here for the last 16 years has done a great deal for the advance of education and bringing enlightenment to our people. I believe myself that the country and rural schools are the most important places where we should concentrate.  I believe that all the money available should be spent on those schools, first, to provide proper schools and, secondly, to see that those poor children who are unable to provide the necessary school books should get those books at the State's expense.  I believe that it is in the ordinary rural schools that we should really educate our people in the future, because the education that we need in this country is what I might term the education of a rural community.  We should see that our children while at school devote most of their time in preparing for an agricultural life when they leave school.  I am not one of those who has too high a hope in what I call the technical or secondary schools.  I believe, of course, that they are what you might call fairly important but, at the same time, they are not nearly as important as the rural schools.  A good many of the people who go to technical schools, where they follow up a certain line of study, find, when they leave, that they cannot get employment, and have to go back to the ordinary humdrum of country life, very often with high notions and a little bit too high education for the life to which they have to adapt themselves. I think it is bad for them because, as you all know, a certain amount of education is all right, but when you have a little too high an education for your surroundings, and have no scope for it, there is a tendency to get a swelled head and look down on the ordinary persons around you.  It is not good for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the child of the poor man has an inferiority complex in most schools when he finds that his better-off neighbour's child has all the books he needs while he has to stand looking on with no book whatsoever.  He has that inferiority complex.  Of course, he had it from the domination we had in the past here of a foreign invader. <Col N="1284" /> We have not got out of that state as yet.  I think, to give the farmer's child his proper place in the life of our country, we should put him on the plane where he will be able to stand in his class on the same level as his rich neighbour's child.</P>
    <P>I know myself that one of the greatest hardships the teachers have in the country schools is that they have to provide books out of their own pockets for nearly all the poorer type of children in their schools.  I know that the teachers do that out of generosity and from knowing that those children need the books.  Still, I think it is unfair that we, with the government in our own hands, should ask our teachers, who have enough to do to look after the ordinary work, to provide books at their own expense.  I believe that at the present moment, when poverty is so acute in our country, free school books are absolutely necessary. I do not believe that it would cost the huge sum that our Minister for Education more or less stated here to-night it would cost.  I believe that £20,000 of £30,000 or £40,000 would certainly go a good deal of the way to easing the position in our schools.</P>
    <P>I do believe that at the present day school books are altogether too costly. Even for the ordinary farmer's child they are too costly, and I think that some steps should be taken towards getting them down to the level that the people would be able to pay for them.  Of course, there is something to to be said against that thing of changing our school books too often.  I believe that we should concentrate on having a book that would last two, three or four years so that it could be handed down from the first child to the second, third and fourth child.  I know, in my school days, the book of the eldest child was able to do two, three and four children afterwards and that meant a great deal of saving to poor people.</P>
    <P>I believe that at the present moment there is too great a tendency to educate our people for a city life.  The whole tendency at the present moment is to be educated, to get away from the country and into city life, whether it be as a typist, a shorthand writer, <Col N="1285" /> book-keeper or something like that. We are all satisfied that there are not enough of those jobs to go round.  We should not be raising the minds of our people and giving them the idea that the only way to make a living in this country is to go into the cities and work in an office and try to get into high society, so called.  We should concentrate on keeping our children at home in the country, giving them a rural training, and seeing that lectures are given more often in the schools on what it means to live an agricultural life in an agricultural community and how useful such a life is for our country and our people.  Undoubtedly, at the moment, the young people are fleeing from the land.  Somebody must stop that flight from the land to the cities, and to put a stop to it you have got to start in the schools and educate the people in the most noble profession of all in our country, and that is to live on the land and work on the land, whether in your own home or your neighbour's home, and not be thinking of getting away to the city and, perhaps, then finding that there is no job for you when you get there and, after a few months' time in the city, being forced to live in the lowest streets and slums of the city, realising that there is no hope for you.  The place for our people is on the land, and our slogan should be &ldquo;Back to the land.&rdquo;  We should endeavour to educate our people from that point of view and imbue them with the idea that country life is the proper life for an agricultural country.  I believe, myself, that something should be done by way of giving free school books to the children. After all, we ourselves united here the other day to help ourselves by increasing our allowances.  I am quite satisfied that what we did was not wrong.  We did it in the light of the circumstances of our times.  At the same time, I do not see why we cannot unite now to put up £20,000 or £30,000 in order to see that our children who are in need of school books should get them.  If we were to concentrate on that, we would be doing something noble and something that is worth doing.</P>

      <P>(Junior): Many citizens of Éire will heave a deep sigh of relief when, in to-morrow morning's paper, they read the Minister's announcement that at last this very necessary reform is going to take place.  Every one of us here in the Dáil welcomes it very gladly, I am sure, and there is no question but the people themselves will be very pleased.  Many speakers, during the discussion, referred to the various reforms in the educational line which have been made by the previous Government and by this Government, but I think that this reform, which the Minister has announced his intention of carrying through, is one of the best that could be introduced or that ever has been introduced.  In view of the Minister's announcement, therefore, we do not intend to press the motion. I should like, however, to refer to one matter.  The Minister spoke of the very large cost of providing school books. I think that the figure he mentioned was that it would be about £1,000,000. I do not believe, for one moment, that it would cost that.  I think you could take an average of 10/-.  You could take the fourth standard as, approximately, 12/6, and it would be less for the lower standards and somewhat more for the higher standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, Sir, I am sorry if I gave the Deputy a wrong impression.  The £1,000,000 refers to an entirely different matter&mdash;the raising of the school leaving age.  Of course, the sum necessary to provide free books for all necessitous children would be very small in comparison with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>(Junior): Yes, I believe the sum would be very small.  I submit, certainly, that it would be very small compared with the amount of good it would do, very small indeed.  Deputy Cogan referred to the burden that was being placed upon the taxpayers, <Col N="1287" /> and he seemed to be afraid that the provision of free school books would tend to increase the number of books. I do not think that would be the case. The Minister for Finance, as we all know, keeps an eye on things like that, and we may be sure that he will keep a good eye on this matter.  Actually, I believe that it will probably have the effect of decreasing the number of <Col N="1288" /> books that are being used.  I have nothing further to say on this matter, Sir, except to repeat that, on behalf of the citizens of Éire, we, members of the Dáil here, congratulate the Minister on his announcement.</P>
