      <P>Sympathetic consideration will be given to the question of introducing legislation to give effect to proposals for a solution of the difficulties referred to by the Deputy, provided that the Government is satisfied that substantial agreement in regard to such proposals has been reached between the various interests concerned.

      <P>Grants of very considerable amounts have been allocated this year from the Employment Schemes Vote to local authorities for expenditure on roads, public health and housing development schemes.  The greater portion of the expenditure under the grants is made to relate to the November-March period and an intensification of employment during the Christmas season is encouraged.  Contributions from local sources towards the cost of schemes will continue to be sought in connection with the allocation to local authorities of grants from the Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated in the first portion of the question.  I understand that there is already a pump situated at the northern end of the village of Aghada, and that an adequate water supply is available therefrom, but that the location of the pump is inconvenient from the point of view of a number of residents at the southern end of the village.  The board of health proposed to provide an additional pump, but the site selected therefor was so near the existing pump that it would be superfluous, so far as the northern portion of the village was concerned, and of no advantage to the southern portion.  The proposal, as submitted, could not, therefore, be sanctioned.  It is a matter for the board of health to arrange for the formulation of any appropriate alternative proposals.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that household flour delivered in Ballaghaderreen costs 41/- per sack, and that the same flour, if imported from Northern Ireland or Great Britain could be had for 22/- per sack; and whether he will cause inquiry to be made into this discrepancy in prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question addressed to me on the 16th instant by Deputy Norton.  The current price for household flour ex mill Ireland is 39/- per sack of 280 lbs.  Flour produced in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is not importable here save under licence, and any figures which the Deputy could produce in respect of such flour delivered at Ballaghaderreen or anywhere else in this country would be hypothetical. The Deputy is possibly unaware of the fact that if flour were imported into this country from Great Britain or Northern Ireland it would probably, under existing wheat quota and subsidy arrangements in Great Britain, be sold at a price 6/- per sack lower than it would be sold in the country of origin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, but for the regulations made by himself and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, the price of shop flour to-day in Ireland would be 20/6 per sack, ex mill, while the actual price is 38/6 ex mill, which means that the average housewife buying a cwt. of flour is charged to-day 18/- per cwt., whereas if the regulations referred to were not in force, she could buy the same cwt. of flour for 9/-.  She is at present paying a tax of 100 per cent. on every cwt. of flour she buys in this country.  Is the Minister aware of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state what is the average yield per statute acre of wheat in the harvest of this year, and <Col N="841" /> whether he has any information as to how the wheat bushelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The official statistics relative to the average yield of wheat of the 1938 crop are not yet available.  Reports received from various parts of the country would, however, appear to indicate that the yield will be between 16 and 17 cwts. per statute acre. Owing to unfavourable weather during the latter stages of growth and the moist condition of the wheat when harvested, it is probable that the average bushel weight is somewhat lower than that of last year's crop and will be in the neighbourhood of 57 lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this scheme is being made an excuse by the millers to levy on the people of this country an annual tax of £2,700,000, and, in view of the facts he has mentioned, does he think it worth while carrying it on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that the millers, because they are required to include Irish wheat in the manufacture of flour, are charging 38/6 for flour which would otherwise cost the people 20/6?  That means that the people are paying 18/- a cwt. for flour which they could otherwise buy for 9/-, and as the people of this country consume 3,000,000 sacks of wheat a year, that represents a sum of £2,700,000 per annum as excess cost in flour.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister right in carrying on this scheme which, <Col N="842" /> according to his own figures, is unsatisfactory?  He mentioned that the yield would be about 16 or 17 cwts. per statute acre, and that because of the unfavourable weather it is probable that the average bushel weight will be lower.  Therefore, the farmers will make little out of it, and I suggest the only people who ever made anything out of it are the millers, who have made £2,700,000 in the year.</P>

I know there is a shortage in Great Britain, too, but I am wondering if the Minister, by admitting increased imports, might not relieve the situation here somewhat.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading, Deputy O'Higgins made a case for the giving of pensions to widows of officers who died between 1922 and 1932 in the service from causes other than wounds. He based his case on the assumption that similar types of cases were covered under the present regulations. As a matter of fact, under the present regulations an officer would require to have 12 years' service before his widow would be entitled to a pension, if he died from causes other than wounds, and a mere extension of the Act or the regulations to cover cases back to 1922 would have no effect in granting pensions to those widows because in no case had their husbands the 12 years required under the present regulations.  Accordingly, making the Bill retrospective to 1922 would not have the effect that the Deputy desires it to have.  Now, if we were going to deal with such cases the regulations would have to be amended, and the Act would have to be amended, making regulations retrospective to 1922.  The question of amending the present regulations is under consideration at the moment, and I am not in a position yet to say whether or not such amendment would cover the case of widows and orphans where the service was shorter than 12 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was more or less aware of the fact that the present Bill could not be extended so as to include the cases to which I referred, but it appears to me that, whether it is the fault of the regulations or the fault of the scheme or the fault of the Department, the position at the moment is that the widow of a soldier or officer who died subsequent to 1932 will receive a pension, but the widow of a soldier or officer who died prior to 1932 will not receive a pension.  It may be that that is the fault of the scheme or the fault of the Bill or the fault of the <Col N="855" /> Department, but it certainly is not the fault of the corpse or the fault of the widow of the corpse, and I do believe that the widows of those who died before a certain date are as much entitled to treatment as the widows of those who died after a certain date.  The question I put to the Taoiseach, when he was in charge, was whether he would look into the matter and introduce legislation to cover the cases of those who had died prior to 1932.  From a reply I got from the Minister during the week to a question of mine, I am reluctantly forced to the conclusion that no consideration is being given to the widows of those who died before a certain date.  My question asked for a mere numerical return of the number of officers, N.C.O.s and privates, who died from causes other than wounds and other than disease acquired prior to the establishment of the forces, and who died between October, 1923, and the date of this Bill in 1932.  The reply I got was to the effect that the Minister could not give such information, that it was not available.  If such information is not available, then their responsibilities are being taken very lightly with regard to those who are past and gone.  It is quite clear that every case sheet that is written up in a hospital shows how, when, and where the disability was acquired, and it was purely a case of consulting the records of the Department concerned in order to get a reply to that query of mine.  No reply was given.  If it was too much labour to look up the numbers, then I am not surprised if it is too much labour to make provision for the widows.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, Sir, perhaps he would answer this question.  He said, at the conclusion of his observations, that he had in contemplation the revision of the regulations with a view to making pensions available to the widows of men who had less than 12 years' service, if it were possible to do so.  In the event of the regulations being so amended, will the amendment be retrospective back to 1922?</P>

      <P>As I said already, that whole matter is under consideration, and I shall not go further into the matter at the moment.  Now, with regard to what Deputy O'Higgins said, his allegation was that no consideration was given to the widows of those who died between 1922 and 1932, and he brought forward as evidence my reply to a question of last week.  I want to point out to him that my recollection of the reply is that I said I was not now in a position to give the numbers of officers who died from causes other than wounds or disease arising out of active service prior to 1923. On the day the question was due for reply, the officials of my Department informed me that they were not then in a position to supply that information, and I said: &ldquo;If you have the numbers, give them, and if the Deputy wants more than that, we can get the other information for him.&rdquo;  It is quite obvious to me, however, that what the Deputy wanted an answer to his question for was for the debate of last week.  I gave him the numbers&mdash;that is, the total numbers&mdash;and it would have required more notice to give the full particulars the Deputy required. We gave him the particulars that we had available, and that required some work to be done.  Now, the Deputy is trying to make the case here that I was in some way at fault in not dealing with these cases from 1922 to 1932, but he is perfectly aware that in 1932 a scheme was agreed to which left them out, just the same as the present regulations do; and this is the first time that a case is being made for them. As a matter of fact, under the regulations agreed to before I became Minister for Defence, widows were not mentioned at all&mdash;good, bad or indifferent, Even in the present, officers' widows would not have got the pensions to which they are entitled under the present regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like a little indulgence to raise just one point on this Estimate.  We are here voting for the principals and assistants <Col N="859" /> in the ordinary and model schools paid by capitation grant an additional sum of £137,000.  There is no question at all as to the purpose for which that is being provided, but when we consider some of the things that are brought to our notice in the recently published report of the Department of Education for the year 1936-37, the question really arises as to why, in the present circumstances, additional money should be necessary even to cover the payments that are mentioned here.  It is for the purpose of drawing attention to one of those points that I intervene at the moment.  It is pointed out in the report that during the three years ended 30th June, 1937, the number of children on the rolls of the primary schools had fallen by 25,000, and in fact the schedules in the report show that the attendance of children in the primary schools between the beginning of that three-year period and the end had fallen by 28,000.  That arises out of the condition that is there shown&mdash;the condition which the Minister says is not his particular question to inquire into&mdash; that there is an almost complete stopping down, in certain directions, of the training of teachers.  The report says at page 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Recruitment for the training colleges in 1938 and until such time as the conditions warrant a modification will be confined to the students of the preparatory colleges, who have already entered upon their course of training, to the members of religious communities, and to persons serving as temporary untrained assistant teachers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The report goes on to say that at the present time there is only one-half of the number of men in training that there were in 1931-2; that the number in residence will be still smaller in the coming year, and that the number of lay women in the training colleges in the present academic year will show a reduction of approximately one-third in the normal number in residence heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To meet a situation in which there is a substantial fall in the number of children attending primary schools, a <Col N="860" /> very drastic method is being adopted to cut down the number of persons in the country who can train as lay primary school teachers.  In view of the very definite and important work which is being done in the primary schools for the restoration of the Irish language, a work the success of which we get very little reflection of in any kind of detail in the report, but a work of the difficulties of which and the comparative results of which some Deputies have very considerable firsthand knowledge, I would ask the Minister whether he would not consider that at a time when there is a surplus number of teachers, so much so that the training colleges have to some extent to be strangled, he should take some of the experienced teachers that are at present available and over a period of, say, five years, send them to examine the conditions which exist say, in the bilingual French-English schools in Canada, with a view to bringing the important work which is being done in our primary schools into touch with what is necessarily a much more live situation in a country where bilingualism is very definitely successful, and the educational machinery which is assisting that bilingualism to strengthen itself and to maintain itself has reached a very definite maturity. We would then, in a situation in which there are surplus numbers of teachers in the country, be making use of the only type of people we can ever have to carry out an examination like that, and to being the fruits of successful work in other countries to our own country here.  They are the only material we can ever use for that work.</P>
    <P>The time is ripe to use some of the men and women we have now for that pupose.  It might be extended to the secondary schools also with very great advantage to the work of education throughout the country, and lead to a more successful prosecution of the work of restoring Irish.  It might be an advantage if 15 or 20 primary teachers were sent within a period of the next five years for about six months to study the experience of places like the French-speaking provinces and the English-French speaking areas of Canada.  I think it is training under <Col N="861" /> such circumstances that will increase the amount of work done by primary and secondary teachers.  The training available in the colleges will be much more valuable because of such an experiment, and only a complement of lay women and lay male teachers would be prevented getting training, while fresh blood and up-to-date experience would be added to the staff. I submit very seriously to the Minister that the circumstances shown here warrant some consideration being given to that immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Mulcahy's suggestion if it were practicable.  The trouble is that between men and women there are 750 teachers unemployed, who were trained, some at the expense of the State and some at the expense of their parents. After seeking for work for three or four years they cannot find it.  The problem in that respect is very acute, and will require a bigger effort on the part of the Department, and on the part of the Government generally, than has been made up to this.  While there is such a very big roll of unemployed teachers, I do not see very much use in increasing the numbers in training for the profession if that standard of unemployment is to continue for some years.  I should like to refer to the superannuation of a certain class of teachers who were compulsorily retired on the 1st October on reaching 60 years of age.  There has been a good deal of dissatisfaction amongst the teaching profession with regard to that very drastic step.  The dissatisfaction is not so much at the early retirement as at the sudden way in which it was announced.  The announcement was made in April that teachers who had reached 60 years on October 1st would be retired compulsorily. Under the rules of the Department, a teacher is not entitled to full pension until 40 years in the service.  These teachers are denied that right to receive full pensions.  I think that was a hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sudden announcement regarding the operation of the rule was also a hardship.  As a rule people look ahead for some time with regard to their financial commitments, and many of these teachers had entered into <Col N="862" /> arrangements about the education of their families well ahead of the six months allowed by the Department. They were certainly entitled to longer notice than that given.  I say that there was a case for teachers who were the victims of this rule getting concessions with regard to pension rights.  A proposal was made that many who had served 35 years, and who had four or five years to serve in order to get full pensions rights, should have some years added to their service. A very good case was made for teachers affected by such circumstances. The Minister was asked to receive a deputation of Deputies who are teachers to hear the views put forward by the organisation, but, in his judgment he did not consider such a course necessary.  While I hold very strong views with regard to early retirement in all industries, no matter whether those concerned are teachers or not, at the same time there should be, at least, discussion with the Minister concerning the position of these teachers.  The principal reason advanced for the retirement of these teachers was that others who are unemployed would be absorbed.  I understood the Minister to say that about 200 women were retired.  I do not believe that 25 per cent. of their positions were filled, owing to the average, so that as far as the primary object of the retirements goes, there was no case for it. If the object was to make room for younger teachers entering the service there was a good deal to be said for it, but when it is found in actual fact that a big proportion of the places was not filled then it fails.</P>
    <P>While certain provisions with regard to the retirement of teachers and pensions have been made, there has been no suggestion of any provision for teachers who have had 40 years' service, and more, and who were retired previous to the coming into operation of the latest pension arrangement.  I refer to teachers who had service in convent schools who, but for the delay in putting this agreement into operation, would have had pension rights. They were denied these rights and denied pensions.  I have already raised the case of these teachers with <Col N="863" /> the Minister.  A motion was before the House asking that their claims should be considered, but nothing was done.  Great as is the hardship on those who had to retire at 60 the hardship is much greater on 50 or 60 teachers who had retired, and to whom no provision will apply.  I should like to know what saving was effected by the retirement of teachers at 60 and over, on October 1st.  I should also like to know from the Minister if it is his intention to make provision for teachers who had to retire previous to the present arrangement.  Another type of teacher that will not have any pension rights, is the supernumerary class in convent and monastery schools, There is a case in Cork City of a teacher who is about to retire after 40 years of highly efficient service, and because he has been a supernumerary there is no provision whatever with regard to pension.</P>
    <P>These are cases that it would be well for the Minister to give attention, to see if something could be done for those concerned.  I know that the Minister has a very keen interest in the affairs of the Department and I know that his sympathy is with the people I refer to, but I should like to have some practical translation of that sympathy into actual facts.  I suggest to the Minister that there is definitely a case to be made for these supernumerary teachers who have not got pension rights.  I also suggest that there is still time to consider the case of those who retired previous to this arrangement, and further that the object for which those who were obliged to retire on reaching 60 years, or over, last October has not been achieved.  Instead of being of any use to the Department in the way of relieving unemployment amongst teachers there has been a saving to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>In pursuit of an arrangement made between the teacher, the Minister and the Department of Finance, the basis of remuneration on which teachers' pensions was calculated was reduced by 5 per cent. some time ago.  Subsequent to that arrangement a very small number of teachers were superannuated <Col N="864" /> and their superannuation was calculated on the basis of this reduced remuneration.  Then, this increase of 5 per cent. came along and the teachers' salaries came back to what they had been, whereupon the basis of superannuation reverted to what it had been.  The net result of this is that the teachers now being superannuated and the teachers who were superannuated before these discussions have the same basis of pensions; but there is a microscopic group of teachers who were superannuated in the interval on a different basis of superannuation.  I understand that the reason for the reduction of the 5 per cent. was different from that for which the increase of 5 per cent. was given.  For that typically departmental reason, less than 100 teachers are to spend the rest of their lives under a bitter grievance.  That is the kind of foolish economy which gets nobody anywhere.  Is there any commercial undertaking or enterprise in the world with a pensions scheme for its employees, who would allow red tape of that kind to leave 1 per cent. of their employees under a bitter grievance?  I know if we are to abide by the strict letter of the law, if we are to submit to be mummified in the red tape of the Department of Finance that a case in the strict letter of the law can be made for the treatment of this altogether insignificant number of persons.  But looking at the thing from the broad point of view and at the amount of money at stake, which is not I believe more than £300 or £400 a year&mdash;a matter of no consequence whatever to the Treasury&mdash;there is the difference between comparative affluence and the very modest comfort of the pensioners.</P>
    <P>I am not addicted to asking people for gratuitous increases to my neighbours' pensions.  But when we all to-day get so flathamhail to each other, we ought not to forget the case of these teachers.  An identical or an analogous case can never arise again and no precedent can be created.  The net result of the generosity which I ask is the disbursement of an insignificant sum of perhaps £500 or £600 at most during a limited number of <Col N="865" /> years.  I put it to the Minister that out of this money he is seeking now he ought to give these people the additional stipend for which they are asking.  I admit that according to the letter of the Estimates they are not entitled to it, but I submit that in strict justice and according to all the rules of fairness they are entitled to it.  I ask the Minister to make this very modest sum available.  Any Supplementary Estimate in regard to education gives rise in one's mind to a wider question than that to which the Supplementary Estimate applies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Unfortunately, that cannot be discussed.  Fortunately, I can look forward in the particular Estimate to an opportunity for doing so. I would like to hear Deputy Hurley's views in regard to the case of this limited number of teachers who have lost 5 per cent. in their pensions as compared with the remainder of the pensioned teachers.  I am sure Deputy Hurley knows them well.  I would like to know whether he agrees with me that the Minister ought to remove these people from the position in which they suffer under this undoubted grievance.</P>

      <P>There is one point, Sir, I would like to make, anticipating your ruling on this matter.  This Supplementary Estimate is brought in within three months of the discussion of the original Estimate.  It has been brought in for an object with which everyone can agree&mdash;that is, the restoration of this 5 per cent. cut.  It is money going back to education.  It is money being spent on primary education.  I would like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that the children who are going <Col N="866" /> to the primary schools at the moment are getting value for the sum of over £3,000,000 being spent on education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education has power under the regulations and for a very long time past has had power to retire teachers at the age of 60.  In the circumstances with which we have to deal I regret to say I had no option but to enforce the compulsory retirement of women teachers who had reached the age of 60.  It is quite true that the rule permitting the Minister to retire teachers compulsorily, at the age of 60, had lapsed for a period.  Nevertheless, the power is there, and it was one of the methods by which we hoped to provide employment for some, at least, of our unemployed young teachers.  There is no guarantee of course, when a young teacher comes out after being trained, that he will secure employment.  The State has, at no time, given any guarantee to trainees that they will find employment.  Unfortunately, the attendance in our schools fell during recent years at a very rapid rate.  The matter first came under our notice in 1934-5 and we introduced concessions which would ease the position of teachers whose security of employment was being threatened.  Subsequently, we found that the decline was continuing and was more serious than we had anticipated, so we had to take further steps&mdash;on the one side to restrict the number of entrants to the training profession, and on the other side to endeavour to create vacancies for the unemployed teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should warn the House and all concerned that, so far as I can see, this fall in attendance in our national schools is likely to continue for a further period of years and may be even greater, according to the information <Col N="867" /> I have, than what we have experienced in the last five or six years. It may, therefore, be necessary to take even further measures.  We had hoped that the measures which we have in contemplation might, if there is to be improvement in school attendances within a number of years, be sufficient to right the situation.  If there should not be some evidence within a few years of an improvement in school enrolment, then, undoubtedly, whoever is responsible for the Department of Education will have to take more drastic measures.  I may find that I shall have to announce further drastic measures if I discover, on further examination of the question, that these are necessary.  The amount of notice that was given to the teachers was rather short, it was about six months notice, but a good many of the teachers who are retired were married to teachers, and I find in a number of cases that the pension in the one case plus the salary in the other seemed to be sufficient for their requirements at that age.  Of course, I would have preferred if we had not found it necessary to enforce this compulsory retirement at all.  I pointed out that the average pension which has been granted to these women teachers is £137, which may not be considered a bad pension in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>With regard to superannuation, it is a very difficult matter indeed to change the regulations regarding superannuation to meet particular cases.  For example, one of the proposals that has frequently been made to me is that there should be added years of service in cases of compulsory retirement of this character.  It would be quite impossible to secure authority for an amendment of the regulations of that kind.  Similarly, while I have no doubt that the cases Deputy Dillon has in mind are cases where one would like to help, I see no prospect of amending the superannuation regulations to cover these particular cases.</P>

      <P>When the question of pensions was discussed some years ago <Col N="868" /> we had to leave out a certain number of cases which we found could not be covered by the superannuation regulations.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no necessity to amend the regulations at all.  We recognise that it would be unreasonable to ask the Minister to amend then.  Ascertain actuarially the value of what these pensioners have lost and introduce a Supplementary Estimate to make an <i>ex-gratia</i> grant to each of them of the amount of the actuarial valuation of their loss.  I believe that will meet the full equity of the case.</P>

      <P>If we introduce <i>ex-gratia</i> payments for particular hard cases, I do not know where it is going to stop. Deputy Hurley seemed to question whether we had, in fact, secured the object we had in mind of creating vacancies for unemployed teachers by these compulsory retirements of women teachers.  Of course, all the cases have not been disposed of yet, but I am told that because of the 203 retirements which have taken place there should be over 170 vacancies to be filled.  We cannot be quite sure if every compulsory retirement will involve new employment through a vacancy, but it seems to me that 170 out of 203 is quite a high proportion. The convent supernumerary teachers, unfortunately, do not come under the pension regulations and I see no prospect of bringing them in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point is the suggestion of Deputy Mulcahy that teachers could be sent abroad.  I do not think that is really going to solve the problem.  At the present moment, we have the position that a large number of our rural schools, 75 per cent. of our schools, are one, two, or three-teacher schools.  Practically all our rural schools, and a great many of the urban schools, come under that category. In all these cases regulations <Col N="869" /> have been modified in a really serious effort to endeavour to give the maximum employment, having regard to all the circumstances, and we have the position at present that in a school of 30 pupils you have two teachers.  I do not think you could go any further than that.  These small two-teacher schools form a very large proportion of the total number of schools.  I do not think the State should be called upon to provide further assistance in the direction of staffing these schools.</P>
    <P>With regard to the larger schools, undoubtedly something more is being done, but there again there is a limit to what we can do in providing for extra employment.  As regards the large classes, we have heard mention from time to time of large classes, but the number of large classes is rather negligible.  I mentioned personally to the inspectors on more than one occasion that wherever the classes were large in the junior standards they should endeavour to see that the rules were carried out in the most rigid manner possible so as to see that a full staff of teachers was maintained.  If necessary, we may have to amend the rules.  Although there may be cases of large classes, it is not a serious matter and, even if we carry out the rules in the most stringent way, I fear not a great many extra teachers will be employed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 13, lines 31-32, Section 23 (3 (i), to delete all words after the <Col N="870" /> words and brackets &ldquo;(outside Ireland)&rdquo; to the end of the paragraph, line 35.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to give people the right to speak their minds in public, because, in accordance with the terms of the Bill as it at present stands, if somebody says something which, in the opinion of the Minister, is prejudicial to the reputation of Irish eggs, he can take the licence away from them.  I think that is an undesirable power to leave in the hands of the present Minister, or any other Minister, and I do not think it is a power that he requires.  It is, in fact, an omnibus power put in there by a Department official who has launched a prosecution and has stubbed his toe against the obstacle that the section under which he sought to proceed was not wide enough to catch the person against whom his wrath was stirred.  Well, Parliament did not intend that it should be wide enough for that purpose, and, if it did intend, it would have made it wide enough for that purpose.  I object to any Minister seeking a general kind of power to go out on a hunting expendition after any citizen who offends him or who offends his sense of propriety. Bear in mind that this is not a penalty on somebody who says or does something which is prejudicial to the Irish egg, but this is a penalty on anybody who does something which is, in the opinion of the Minister, prejudicial to the reputation of Irish eggs.  With great respect, Sir, that is carrying legislation far beyond where it has ever been carried before, and deprives, in my judgment, the citizens of this State of their constitutional rights.  It is not good enough to have a man going into court and having his plea of justification stayed by the Minister for Agriculture of the day arising and saying: &ldquo;In my opinion, this man has done wrong, and once that is my opinion, the processes of this court are void, because the statute says that it is my opinion that matters, not the judgment of the court.&rdquo; It is not the judgment of 12 reasonable men, not the judgment of any judicial tribunal envisaged by the Constitution, but the judgment of the Minister, and in pursuit <Col N="871" /> of that judgment he can impose upon a man who exercises the right of free speech the penalty of withdrawing from him his means of livelihood which is perhaps one of the heaviest penalties which the law could impose.  That is a departure to which I object, and to which I could be no party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, of course, would find it very difficult to argue against Deputy Dillon on the general proposition that it is undesirable that Ministers should have power as laid down here, but I find myself in a great difficulty in this particular case and I think if I were to explain the difficulty that may arise &mdash;and has arisen, as a matter of fact, in the past&mdash;that the Deputy would find it impossible to cover that in any other way.  Our eggs are sometimes, in fact very often, I believe, exported in the name of the consigner and sometimes they are stored in England, say, in the exporter's store.  They are still the property of the exporter in this country but not under our jurisdiction, and we have had cases in the past of eggs being stored for an unduly long time and brought out and sold as eggs &mdash;not as cold-stored eggs&mdash;but just as eggs, presumably fresh eggs, and in that way are injuring the reputation of Irish eggs to a very great extent.  The Deputy knows, and other Deputies in this House who are intimate with the egg trade know, that we have the eggs stamped with different coloured inks and a person might export the eggs, say in August, when prices are rising, and after that store them beyond for three or four months, and sell them when the price is high.  If we bring in code marking under this legislation, I admit we might be able to stop that particular type of case, but we are not sure whether we will be able to enforce the code marking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think about that for a moment.  There is one thing that perhaps I might mention before I go on to that.  Our biggest trouble is that our eggs may be stored in England, and brought out after a long time and not marked &ldquo;cold stored.&rdquo;  In Northern Ireland they must be marked &ldquo;cold stored,&rdquo; but ours are not. The Deputy has made the suggestion to leave out the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister.&rdquo;  I do not know if that would make very much difference.  It would certainly look better in our legislation that the Minister should not have that power, but in any case I take it if I cancelled the registration, a person who thinks he has a grievance may bring me to court to show cause, and I do not know whether the fact that the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; were there or not, would make very much difference in the court, that is, to the person that brings me there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where I have the doubt.  I do not know what they imply.  I must say, as I said in the beginning, that I agree entirely with what the Deputy says on general principles, that the ordinary citizen should be safeguarded against a Minister's arbitrary opinion and I must say that I had no intention whatever of using the section except in that particular case I have mentioned of compelling our exporters here, as far as we can, to market eggs on the other side as quickly as possible when they are outside our jurisdiction.  We have no intention whatever&mdash;I am sure the Deputy recognises that&mdash;of saying to Deputy Dillon or some other person, &ldquo;You made a speech a few days ago which has had a very bad effect on our eggs and, therefore, I am going to cancel your licence.&rdquo;  It was not contemplated that we should use the powers in this section for that purpose, but I quite admit that the Deputy may say that I could use it in that way.  Perhaps I could, but I feel I might have to justify my action <Col N="873" /> in court afterwards if I did.  I am not sure what the implications are, but perhaps I could do one of two things. I could omit it now, if the Ceann Comhairle would allow me, if there was general agreement, but on consideration I might be constrained perhaps to ask the Seanad to put it back again, in which case I would come back here, or alternatively I would consider very fully having it omitted in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Fifth Stage, I do not want to repeat the arguments that were put forward on the Second Stage. In my view, this is the wrong way to do the job and I feel sure that eventually the Minister will be forced to my way of doing the job.  In the meantime, however, the Minister and I, and all of us, have a common interest, and that is to increase the output of eggs. The maize-meal mixture scheme, of course, is a long-forgotten issue and we may take it that it is over between us. The only question now is when that scheme is to be wound up.  Apart from that, I do seriously put it to the Minister that, if we are going to make a drive to get the people back into egg production in the coming year, <Col N="876" /> which I think is a matter of considerable consequence, it would materially help if the price of maize meal came down on the 1st of the New Year.  If we want to get people back into egg production next year we shall have to increase the production of fowl, and the only way to increase the number of egg-laying fowl next year is to persuade the people to set eggs in February.  If they do not set them until April, the hens will not lay next year; they will not lay till the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, a lot of people may say to themselves that the setting of eggs under hens does not matter very much. That is quite wrong.  I think that people will find that all this business of battery brooders and intensive chicken production which has been going on in England for so long is going to be discarded as unsound and as very injurious, in the long run, to the egg production business.  I believe that, as a permanent, normal practice, in the egg and fowl industry in this country, we should base the production of chickens and fowl on the hatching hen and on the small hatching unit in the individual farmer's house, and that we should discourage, if possible, the British mass production methods because they reduce stamina, promote disease, and create ultimately a far greater problem than the problem of scarcity with which we have to contend.  However, that is a matter which, I think, might possibly arise more opportunely on the Agricultural Estimate.  The only point I want to tackle now, is the immediate problem, and that problem is to increase the output at once.  To do that, we have to have publicity and put up an attractive proposition, and the most attractive proposition you can put up now is that eggs will pay.  Now, there has been the deuce of a lot of talk going on about &ldquo;Wheat Will Pay,&rdquo; which, I think, will rather injure that slogan.  A lot of people who accepted that slogan at its face value have been bitterly disillusioned.  However, I think we may assume that very few of the people who grow wheat are the kind of people who are going to be induced to grow chickens and go in for <Col N="877" /> egg production, because that ought to be primarily the purpose of the congested areas.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister now to launch an intensive publicity campaign to persuade the people to get back into fowl, and I believe it would have really valuable results if the cost of feeding were reduced.</P>
    <P>I am going to say now something that, at first glance, would appear to be a direct contradiction of what I have said already.  There are two aspects of this, or two separate problems.  One is what I might call the long-term problem, and the other is the short-term problem.  Taking the long-term view, I am altogether opposed to mass production, but from the point of view of the short-term problem&mdash;that is, the business of getting back into the industry at once&mdash; I think the Minister should investigate the possibility of supplementing the number of hens of the farmers' wives who set in February by a large number of day-old chicks for February and March&mdash;only for this year.  If that were done we should get back a substantial measure of production next autumn, and once we get back into the business, as we all know, it is very easy to expand the fowl population very rapidly.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, ask the Minister to wind up the maize-meal mixture scheme as on the 1st January, tell the people that feeding stuffs will be back as cheap as ever they were, or as ever they can be, tell them that on the 1st January the Department are prepared to receive applications from anybody who wants to get back into the egg-production business, and that, in so far as they can, they will supply day-old chicks which will lay eggs this autumn and that they will encourage all and sundry to set eggs at the earliest possible moment, and produce the maximum number of fowl in the certain knowledge that if anything pays eggs will pay to export; lastly, that the Minister should apply at once to the Department of Finance for authority to extend the Gaeltacht scheme of loans for hen houses to all farmers in the country who wish to avail of it.  It is not an uneconomic <Col N="878" /> scheme.  It is a scheme that will pay for itself.  The people borrow the money, erect the hen houses and pay the money back.  It is merely the provision of credit.  I urge very strongly on the Minister to press forward with that scheme at once.  I gathered from him that he himself approved of such a scheme, and thought that perhaps he had power to put it into operation. Well, if he has, the people do not know about it, and he should give it the widest possible publicity.  If he will do those things we will at least get back into egg production.  Then, when we have the eggs, and see the impact of this Act, as it then will be upon the eggs we have for sale in the British market, we can at leisure make up our minds whether the system I advocated for the control of the egg business or the system enshrined in the Bill is the better to secure the largest return for the producers of eggs in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Bill, I should like to bring before the Minister the necessity for the building of houses for the purpose of housing fowl, as the present accommodation in the country is very poor.  I think that a reasonable sum should be allotted to each county, to go to the county committees of agriculture and be given out to the farmers as small grants.  I would not say grants of £5; I would say grants of £2 or £2 10s. 0d.  That is one of the ways of improving the production of eggs.  The second method I would suggest is that there should be something in the nature of classes in the different areas to instruct the people in the necessity for producing more eggs in winter time. Egg production in this country seems to disappear altogether in winter time, and I believe that that disappearance is due to inadequate housing accommodation. There is another thing which seems to be increasing in the country, and that is the second-quality egg.  It ought to be going out, but instead of that it is increasing.  I believe that is due to the lack of proper housing accommodation, proper food, and matters of that kind, which can be explained to the people at those meetings in the different districts. <Col N="879" /> As everybody knows, the second-quality egg can be of different varieties; it can be weak, it can be watery, or it can be fertile.  That is a problem which ought to be tackled. As far as cleanliness is concerned, I am satisfied that the people are doing their best to market the egg in as clean a condition as they possibly can, but the Minister must bear in mind that without proper housing accommodation it is almost impossible to have a clean egg.  In the absence of that accommodation the people have to pick up the eggs in the ordinary way two or three times a day.  I do not say they have to wash them, but in the case of a large number of eggs they have to clean them.  They have got instructions from the licensed shippers that they must not wash the eggs; that they must clean them with a damp cloth immediately they are picked up.  That is the reason I submit to the Minister that if proper housing accommodation were available for the producers of eggs it would encourage production, and you would have clean eggs of a better quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that if the Minister and his Department are anxious to increase egg and poultry production in this country, they must tackle the problem of housing accommodation. The Government are spending money on schemes like tourist development and that kind of thing. That may be useful, but the possibility of immediate expansion is not very great.  I believe that if you put some money into this industry it would produce an immediate return.  The Bill is all very well in itself, but to my mind the real problem as far as the production of eggs is concerned is the type of poultry house you have in the country. The type of house that there is in the country at the moment is not the type out of which you are going to get clean eggs.  Very few poultry keepers, especially the small ones, have proper poultry houses.  They have no nests set away from the house, as you must have in order to secure clean eggs.  I am perfectly satisfied that if the small poultry keepers in the country are going to continue with the type of <Col N="880" /> house which is generally to be seen at the moment, you are not going to have clean eggs produced.  Some attempt may be made to clean them with a cloth, but I think we all agree that that seriously affects the quality of the egg.  I have no doubt that if we want clean eggs we must have proper housing accommodation for the poultry, and a proper lay-out in the house&mdash;in other words, a modern fowl house.  I think if the Minister could see his way to spend any money on a scheme of producing proper housing accommodation for poultry, the money would be well spent and produce immediate return.  There are tremendous possibilities in this industry if about £250,000 were put into it.  It may seem a very big sum, but there is no doubt about it this industry could be expanded to the tune of £3,000,000 or £4,000,000.  Unless the Minister and his Department are prepared to do something more, this Bill in itself will not produce any great results.  You may secure cleaner eggs, but I do not think the Bill in itself is going to expand the industry.  I think the Minister ought to make some effort to provide sums of money to encourage people to erect poultry houses.  I think that is essential if we are to look forward with confidence to any expansion at all in this industry.  On the basis of the Bill, by itself, I am afraid we can anticipate no expansion, or very little at all events.</P>

      <P>I just want to say a single word on this matter. I am in entire agreement with what has been said as far as housing is concerned. I also would like, in regard to that question, if the Department would carry out a certain number of investigations to see how far the heating of poultry houses in the winter, which may now be done comparatively cheaply, would be a paying proposition, because I think it is pretty well known that hens will not lay in very cold weather.  I wonder very much as to whether those radiators which one sees for sale, and which guarantee to heat a house or quite a large area at a penny or a halfpenny an hour, might not add considerably to the laying productivity of <Col N="881" /> the hen.  There is another great danger to the fowl industry, especially in my part of the country, which I think will have to be tackled before the industry becomes a complete success, and that is vermin.  I happen to be the owner of a certain number of hens, and I find that there are three great enemies.  Number one is the fox &mdash;my part of the country is completely overrun by foxes&mdash;number two is the magpie, and number three is the hawk.  Certainly in parts of the country where the magpie, the hawk, and especially the fox are numerous, it is very difficult to make hen production or egg production a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not care to go into the very wide question which the Deputy raised in the beginning, that is, the merits of the artificial raising of chickens.  There is probably something in what the Deputy says, that the intensive methods used by the big breeders, encourage disease more than the older method of the hen rearing her own chickens.  I do agree with the Deputy, however, that I would much prefer to see an expansion of the poultry industry on the lines of every farmer doing a little more rather than by having poultry farms.  Of course, we could have poultry farms, and nobody will object to that, but I would very much prefer to see every farmer doing a little more.  With regard to the short-term view that Deputy Dillon referred to of trying to raise stock by making day-old chicks available, we have been doing that on a small scale and shall continue to do it.  I do not think, indeed, it met with any great success, but it is worth trying for a few years to see how it may turn out.  The maize-meal mixture scheme, I am afraid, cannot be adapted as quickly as Deputies would like.  I only hope there will not be greater disappointment than there is. I think the Deputy was told, perhaps by a maize miller, during the last four or five years that the reason the mixture was dear was because they had to put barely meal into it.  If he goes back to the miller now and asks if there will be a big reduction he will probably be told that there will be none.</P>

      <P>Not very much.  I saw some invoices recently received by buyers here, which included a price quoted from Northern Ireland, and there was not a big difference.  There was some difference.  With regard to loans for housing, I have got financial sanction, which is the principal thing, and which was the big difficulty, and I hope to be able to produce a scheme in the near future.  I do not think we could make grants as advocated by Deputy Browne.  Loans would be better.  If the loans are not big, with added interest, say for three years, they will not be a very big burden.

      <P>I know that.  With regard to the classes advocated by Deputy Browne, the poultry instructresses in each county are only too willing to give classes anywhere they are arranged for by the county committees of agriculture.  I do not know if it can be claimed that dirty eggs were altogether caused by bad housing. A thrifty poultry keeper, even if she has to put up with bad housing, is able to manage to have clean eggs by using straw, and seeing to it that the hens, as it were, wiped their feet before they leave the nests.  On the other hands, the unthrifty poultry keeper, no matter how good the housing, will not produce clean eggs.  The provision of houses may be a help in other ways.  I am glad to say that we are on the upgrade in egg production, and I hope we will be able to do much better.  There has been an advance this year, and the price of eggs has been better right through.  At present the price is better than the corresponding weeks of last year.  At times the price was considerably better.  That may encourage poultry keepers to go ahead and produce more.  I have no experience concerning the point raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  I have seen the advertisements to which he <Col N="883" /> referred, and one would be almost induced by these advertisements to buy some of the heaters straight away.</P>

With regard to the vermin to which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred, the county committees have power to deal with foxes, hawks and magpies, and to try to have them eliminated as best they can, by having some sort of prize scheme.  I think we will leave it to county committees to deal with these pests. Finally, I can only say that I think there will be good results from the working of this Bill when it becomes an Act, because I believe the first essential is to get good eggs.  If we could get good eggs, and if the eggs are reliable, both at home and abroad, we should get a better comparative price.  If we get a better price increased production will naturally follow.  That is the best way to increase production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever that we are learning by experience that hens do consume a great deal more oats than we through during the operation of the maize-meal mixture scheme, because as the hen population declined, we found that the maize-meal mixture scheme did not increase the area under oats.  I put it to the Minister that we should urge the people to use oats for hens.  We are after a bad harvest, and as there is no doubt whatever that the yield of barley and oats this year is comparatively low, there is not going to be any serious problem of cereals.  Here is one scheme about which we could all co-operate if all sides got behind some popular cry by the 1st January urging people to keep fowl.  Would it not be a good example of co-operation, just to see how we could work, to have all sides urging the one thing?  While the Minister could continue to urge them to grow wheat I could contend that that was all cod, but we could find common ground <Col N="884" /> on the question of eggs.  Would it not be interesting to see what would happen?  I put it to the Minister that there is not the slightest danger of a deluge of cereals this year.  As there is a scarcity of cereals an increased fowl population would use the oats and barley now available.  If there was danger of a deluge of cereals, and if it created a problem, the Minister could look for money to take over the cereals on hands, so as to protect those who have them, and no one would object.</P>

      <P>We may go further.  As to Deputy Dillon's suggestion, whatever views we may have with regard to the maize-mixture scheme we cannot possibly allow farmers with oats and barley on hands this year to be let down.  They grew oats and barley under the impression that there would be a maize-meal mixture scheme, and that there would be a guaranteed market, which would take the crops off their hands.  We must continue, therefore, for this cereal year to get all the oats and barley off their hands. I do not know how long it will take to use up these crops, but we must see that farmers get rid of them if they want to sell.  If we had them off the farmers' hands, and with the merchants, we would have to see how long this scheme must go on, whether up to August or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee (Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in introducting this measure, I might give the House a brief history of the problem with which it deals.  Prior to March, 1932, the salaries of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries were at the rates contemplated by the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, that is to say, £2,500 for the office of President of the Executive Council; £1,700 for the other Ministers, and £1,100 for Parliamentary Secretaries, of which the equivalent of the Oireachtas allowance was free from taxation in each case. The Attorney-General was paid £2,500; the Ceann-Comhairle, £1,700; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, £1,000; the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, £1,200, and the Leas-Chathaoirleach, £1,000.  As from the 9th March, 1932, by administrative action, the salaries <Col N="887" /> which the House was asked to vote were reduced and the following salaries were paid free of tax:&mdash;The President of the Executive Council, £1,500; other Ministers, £1,000; Parliamentary Secretaries, £900; the Attorney-General, £1,500; the Ceann Comhairle, £1,000; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, £700.  The salaries of the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Cathaoirleach were not altered and these rates remained in force until 21st July of last year.</P>
      <P>It is necessary that I should refer to the salaries which were paid during the period from March, 1932, until July of last year, because I want to emphasise that those salaries have been found to be quite insufficient to permit a Minister to meet the demands which are made upon him.  In February, 1937, the Executive Council decided that in view of the approaching general election it was necessary to make the normal provision for ministerial salaries and this was accordingly done in the Estimates for 1937-38.  On the 25th February, 1937, the President of the Executive Council made a statement to the Dáil calling specific attention to this, and he added:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This does not mean that the Ministers and others affected will, during the period of office still to expire, accept the statutory scales. They will accept the same net sums as heretofore.  A general election, however, is due to take place during the coming financial year and I am convinced that it is in the public interest that before the election, and before the new Constitution is put into operation, the question of the position and remuneration of the whole-time public representatives should be fully examined.  At some stage, therefore, when the new Constitution is under discussion, I shall propose the setting up of an independent commission to inquire into the matter of the remuneration of Ministers and other such officers as will function under the new Constitution. The Dáil will then, on receipt of the report, be asked to take a decision on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> This statement was received with approval in all quarters of the House. Some delay took place in securing the necessary personnel for the Committee of Inquiry, but it was appointed on the 4th June, 1937.  The Dáil was dissolved on the 14th June and a general election took place on 1st July.</P>
    <P>The Committee, in the course of its inquiry, heard evidence from the then President of the Executive Council, the then Minister for Finance, the former President of the Executive Council, Deputy Cosgrave, and Mr. J. J. McElligott, the secretary of my Department.  Confidential information furnished on request was received from the then Attorney-General and from the three former holders of that office.  On the 24th November, 1937, the majority report of that Committee was signed by 12 of the 14 members; one member presented a minority report and another member signed neither report.  The report of this Committee is a very closely-reasoned document of the first public importance relating, as it does, to some of the highest and most important offices of the State.  It will repay careful study by all who believe in representative democracy, as it touches one of the problems which that system has to face, that of securing good and clean government.</P>
    <P>The main objects of the present Bill are, first, to implement these recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry which the Government have decided to accept and, secondly, to make the statutory provision required by the Constitution and for the remuneration of the Attorney-General and the Chairmen and Deputy-Chairmen of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The salaries recommended in the majority report of the Committee of Inquiry were: for the Taoiseach, £3,000; the Tanaiste, £2,500; other members of the Government, £2,250; for the Parliamentary Secretaries, £1,400; for the Attorney-General, £2,250; for the Ceann Comhairle, £2,250; for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, £1,100; for the Cathaoirleach, £1,200, and for the Leas-Chathaoirleach, <Col N="889" /> £750, all fully subject to taxation.</P>
    <P>The Government, after careful consideration of the Committee's report, has felt unable, in present circumstances, to accept the recommendations where they would involve increases in salaries.  The rates in the Bill now before the House are, accordingly, in all cases those which were paid before March, 1932, and which have been restored since July, 1937. Although no change is being made in the maximum salaries payable to Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, it has been decided to provide for those salaries in this Bill and repeal the relative provision in the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924. This Bill, when enacted, will thus contain all the legislation relating to the remuneration of the holders of the offices in question, with the exception of the provision which is contained in the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Bill, which was introduced simultaneously with this Bill and the Second Stage of which, presumably, the House will concern itself with this evening.</P>
    <P>I should say that the Government has found itself unable to accept the recommendation that the salary of the Attorney-General should be reduced, because it feels that it would not be in the public interest to increase, in any degree, the sacrifice which the acceptance of that office may involve for a leading member of the Bar.  On the other hand, neither does the Bill implement the Committee's recommendation that the office of the Attorney-General should carry pension rights. Further, a minor departure from the recommendations regarding salaries appears in the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Bill to which I have referred.  It proposes to continue the exemption originally provided for in Section 1 of the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) (Amendment) Act of 1925, in respect of allowances payable to members of the Oireachtas.  All this matter dealing with the salaries of Ministers and other public officers will be found in Part II of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for the <Col N="890" /> payment of allowances for expenses to leaders of the second and third largest Parties in Dáil Eireann, excluding, of course, the Government Party, on the lines of the majority report.  I should like to make it clear that this money is being provided not in any sense as a salary either to the leader of the largest Opposition Party or to the leader of the second largest Party in the Dáil, but is payable mainly as a contribution towards the expense of discharging adequately the duties and functions of that office.  The desirability of making such an allowance will be clear if we consider the theory upon which parliamentary government rests.  In the realm of public affairs there is a function not merely for the initiator, the projector of legislation, so to speak, and for the administrator of the public estate, but for the critic who, to serve the public good, will bring the critical faculty to bear upon all proposals and all actions of the Government of the day.  It is obvious that those upon whom, as the result of public election, this task of critical examination devolves, should be as well equipped for it as possible.  They should certainly not be called upon to bear in their private capacities the full financial burden of discharging that public duty.  It is as a contribution towards the cost of this public work that the allowances set out in this Bill are being provided.</P>
    <P>No one who is familiar with the expense involved in maintaining active opposition in Parliament will pretend that the amounts here provided will cover anything like the whole cost. Nevertheless, since the proposals are largely experimental, the Government has not felt justified in enlarging upon the recommendations of the Committee. Provision has been made in the Bill for the solution of difficulties which may arise in determining the Parties to whom the allowances are payable and for ensuring that what may be merely a temporary reduction in the strength of the third Party, due to a casual vacancy, will not result in the suspension of the allowance.  As it is not considered desirable that the allowances to the leaders of the second <Col N="891" /> and the third Parties should be subject to review annually on the Estimates for Public Services, provision has been made in the Bill for the payment of the allowances out of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill is concerned with the grant of pensions to former holders of qualifying office, and to the widows of such persons on their death, and the grant of allowances during minority to the orphaned children of such persons. Deputies who have compared the provisions of the Bill with the report of the Committee of Inquiry will have observed that, with one major exception, to which I shall refer later on, the Bill is broadly based upon the Committee's recommendations in regard to all its essential features.  The justification for the provision of a pension to an ex-Minister, who has served for a minimum period in office-three years is the period prescribed in the report and in the Bill-is set out in some detail in paragraph 66 of the report of the Committee.  There it is pointed out that such provision as is now proposed would help, firstly, to reduce the extent of the financial sacrifice which is involved in taking ministerial or parliamentary office because of the enforced severance of all active connection with the office-holder's original occupation or profession, and because of the impracticability during the years of office of making any provision for the future of himself and his family.  The severity of this sacrifice may often only be realised after the cesser of office.  Whilst the provisions of this part of the Bill, that is, of Part IV, are mainly intended to cover future contingencies, and admitting that self-government in this country is, comparatively speaking, as yet only in its infancy, there is, unfortunately, already sufficient experience to afford evidence of the need for some means of preventing this consideration from becoming an increasingly powerful deterrent from the acceptance of political office.  It is, therefore, not surprising that the Committee of Inquiry recommended the grant of pensions, not merely for the reasons to which I have referred, but as an inducement <Col N="892" /> towards retaining in political life ex-Ministers who have gained, in the responsibilities of office, a special knowledge of public affairs and a firsthand experience of public administration which makes them, when not in office, the most valuable members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Whilst the Government have felt compelled to depart from the Committee's recommendations in regard to remuneration during office, they have decided to accept in principle the views of the Committee as to pensions and allowances payable on application after cesser of office.  In fact, they have taken the responsibility in one respect of going further than has been recommended.  The general conclusion of the Committee was that Parliamentary Secretaries, who had held office for a period of not less than four years, should be eligible on retirement for the award of a gratuity equivalent to one year's salary.  The Government regret that they are unable to accept that recommendation.  With the special knowledge which they possess of the services rendered by Parliamentary Secretaries, and of the risks and sacrifices, actual and prospective, which they, equally with Ministers, incur in thus serving the public, and of the disabilities under which they likewise suffer as regards providing for the future of themselves and their families, the Government have in this Bill provided for the grant of pensions to and in respect of Parliamentary Secretaries, but at two-thirds of the rate appertaining to ministerial office.  That is an approximate proportion to the differences in their salaries and their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The rates proposed for children's allowances are identical in each case, and I have no doubt that they will meet with the approval of the House.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the main provisions of this part of the Bill are based broadly on the recommendations of the Committee.  In the case of widows' pensions and of orphans' allowances during minority, which were recommended in principle, the Committee found difficulty in prescribing a detailed scheme and in specifying definite amounts, but the Government <Col N="893" /> have accepted as pointers the tentative conclusions of the Committee in a certain paragraph of the report that widows' pensions should not exceed £250 a year; that the allowance for each orphan under 18 years of age should be at the rate of £30 a year, and that special provision should be made to meet the case of orphans whose parents were both dead.  It will, I think, be generally accepted by this House that the pension for which her deceased husband's service in office would have qualified him, and that the allowance payable to an orphan during minority should be raised from £30 to £50 if deprived by death of the support and guidance of its second parent, and the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Turning to the definition of ministerial office, it will be seen that it applies both retrospectively and prospectively, and covers all those who have already held Cabinet office under the first, second, or third Dáil Eireann, or who have been members of the Provisional Government or of the Executive Council of Saorstát Eireann, or who held the office of Ceann Comhairle in this House, as well as those who now function or will in future function as members of the Government under the new Constitution or as Ceann Comhairle here.  All this is in accordance with the views which the Committee expressed in the report.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps make a particular reference to the position of the Attorney-General.  As I have said, the Government has felt unable to accept the recommendation to make the post of Attorney-General a pensionable one.  Let me say at once that the Government has not reached this conclusion without much hesitation.  I know that it may be argued against it that the Attorney-General shares with Ministers under the Constitution the obligation to vacate office on the resignation of the Taoiseach, that as generally recognised head of the Bar he has to maintain a social position higher perhaps than if he were engaged purely in private practice, that whilst theoretically or in fact he does not relinquish the practice of his <Col N="894" /> profession he must at least temporarily relinquish his professional connection &mdash;an important sacrifice representing the accumulated results, the goodwill, so to speak, of a long time of effort.</P>
    <P>In addition, it may be urged that he has, in common with the Ministers of the Government for which he is acting as legal adviser, to meet the vicissitude of resignation and to try, thereafter, to re-establish his private position at the Bar against the competition, not perhaps of better minds, but certainly of men of fresher and, possibly, younger physique, and that, in an occupation and profession so labourious as the Bar, is admittedly a very heavy handicap.  I admit at once the cogency of every one of these considerations. The Government have given them all full value in their examination of the question of pensionability. But there are countervailing circumstances which, on the other hand, we have not found it possible to ignore.  To begin with, the Attorney-General, unlike most Ministers, remains, during the period of his office, in touch with his profession, and it is only to be expected that the enhancement of professional status, which results from his occupation of the exalted position of Attorney-General, and the specialised knowledge he thereby obtains of certain branches of the profession, should secure for him, in the event of his leaving office, a place among the leaders of the Bar.  These, as I said, are the pros and cons of the problem, and, rightly or wrongly, the Government has come to a conclusion opposite to that arrived at by the Committee of Inquiry, and accordingly no provision is made in this Bill for making pensionable the office of Attorney-General.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to go into other matters of detail, embodied in the Bill, which are either consequential on the conclusions already mentioned, or are of minor importance in the framework of the scheme.  Before concluding, however, I should perhaps call attention to sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph (d) of sub-section (4) of Section 13, in the first portion of which double pensionable value is given for <Col N="895" /> services rendered before the 11th July, 1921.  As the House is aware there are statutory precedents for this.  In the Military Service Pensions Act and similar Acts there are precedents for making special provision for particular services, and I think this House will accept that sub-section without question as being merely what is due to those who bore the brunt of the leadership in that historic period.  Most of the surviving Ministers of that day are already qualified for maximum pension under the other provisions of this Bill and would not need the reckoning of that period of service in the manner prescribed but a few former leaders who have gone have left dependants but ill-provided for, dependants who would not otherwise be eligible for awards, and the Government have felt that it would be invidious and entirely contrary to the wishes of this House if a provision of this nature were to be made for those now surviving and the others to be excluded.</P>
    <P>In submitting and recommending this Bill for the approval of Dáil Eireann, I welcome the opportunity of paying on behalf of the Government, a tribute to the thoroughness with which the Committee of Inquiry discharged the duties entrusted to them, and to the good sense and careful appreciation of the public interest which they displayed in the recommendations embodied in this report. They have facilitated the preparation of this difficult and, in some of its personal aspects, to this Government, rather invidious measure.  In framing the Bill, the Government on their part have done their utmost to emulate the spirit of the Committee and to weigh with equal care what they genuinely and sincerely believe to be the best interests of the country.  We have tried to have just and due regard, on the one hand, to the standards on which the State can afford to base the life of its public men, and, on the other, to the financial prospects which those who devote their abilities to the necessary service of their fellow-men in a political career must perforce abandon.  We have taken some time to <Col N="896" /> reach the conclusions embodied in this Bill, and much thought has been given to its provisions.  We submit it now for the consideration of Dáil Eireann, in the belief that it will contribute materially towards attracting high-minded, competent persons to office in the service of their country, and towards preserving proper and right standards of democratic government here in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the principles of this Bill, I should like in the first place to call attention to the fact that this is not a Bill produced, in itself, by the Government, and certainly not, as has been alleged, a Bill produced as a result of a conspiracy between the various political Parties in this House.  Deputies who were present here two years ago will recollect that a suggestion was made from the Government Bench to refer the questions included in this Bill to a commission or committee whose duty it would be to take evidence and inquire very fully into the advisability of providing pensions, and into the adequacy of Dáil officers' salaries.  A large committee was got together, fairly representative of the political Parties, representing the professional classes, representing the industrial classes, and-perhaps the highest percentage of members on that Committee -representing the agricultural community. That Committee was made up of people of very different classes, different religions and different political affiliations and, as one member of that Committee&mdash;no matter whether their recommendations are popular or unpopular&mdash;I should like to say that I never witnessed any committee or any group of men who went about their work as sincerely and as impartially as the members of that particular Committee. It sat for many months, held very many meetings, took evidence from a considerable number of persons, consulted authorities from practically every European nation, and at the end of months of very genuine and sincere work compiled a report making certain recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the main, the recommendations are incorporated in this Bill.  They based those recommendations, not <Col N="897" /> prompted by the idea of trying to do better for X, Y or Z, but prompted solely by the idea of trying to do the right thing for this country as a comparatively young, democratic State, and guided by the experience of 18 years, assisted by the evidence of members of two Administrations, they came in the first place to the conclusion that, after a period of ministerial office, some provision should be made by way of pension.  That was establishing no new precedent in Dáil Eireann.  Many pensions Bills of different kinds have gone through this Dáil, pensions Bills for holders of high office, pensions Bills for people who rendered military service and, instead of having to defend or justify the procedure of giving pensions to those who served the State, in my opinion the boot is on the other foot.  In my opinion, if there are any opponents of this particular Bill, or of the principle contained in this Bill, the responsibility is on them to justify a situation under which the only officers of the State who would be non-pensionable are those who hold or have held the highest office; those who have carried on their shoulders the greatest responsibilities; those who have held an office by virtue of which, to all intents and purposes, they are rendered unemployable for a long period after they have left that office.</P>
    <P>I speak not only as a member of the commission but as a person who is an intimate friend of those who have been Ministers in this State.  All Parties at least will believe this, that after a man has ceased to be a Minister, when his political fortunes are down, when his political Party is down, he is the one man in all Ireland who can be regarded as unemployable.  In other countries the same thing does not prevail.  In other countries when a man ceases to be a Minister, having had administrative experience, having had years of experience in dealing with statistics and trade and finance, every big corporation, every big industrial board is running after him to get him on their board of directors, but in our country our experience has been that, whether a man belongs to the commercial or professional classes, certainly for years after he has become an <Col N="898" /> ex-Minister he is definitely untouchable. His cause is down.  His Party is unpopular.  We cannot all the time expect people to serve the State only by making the very gravest sacrifices. In the past people did it.  When they embarked on a political career most of them were single.  When people enter into wedlock they take on their shoulders responsibilities which they dare not and cannot ignore, and in my opinion no young man with a prospect either in professional life or industrial life would, with the experience that we have had, embark on a full-time political career unless some provision were made for the time after he ceases to be a Minister.  We know this, that if there is any business or any position which is designed and calculated to be the most difficult, it is that of the political head of a Department in any country, because when he is doing his job it is the duty of all other Parties in the Parliament to criticise his every act.  That is what keeps him up to the mark.  That is the assurance the public outside has that nothing will go through without full examination, full consideration and full discussion, but the result of all that is to harass and break down the political head of any Department.  He is faced with opposition, faced with criticism, faced with having to justify every word and every line of every Bill.  Outside, in commercial and industrial life, three or four times the salaries paid to Ministers here are paid to and well earned by people whose responsibility is not a fraction of that of any Minister at any time in this country.  Everybody is there to help them, and no one is there to criticise.</P>
    <P>Do any of the critics of the principle contained in this Bill really make allowance for the strain under which Ministers have lived in the past, for the strain under which they live at the moment, or the strain under which they will always live?  Does anyone make allowance for the amount of mental energy that is used up in a few years in a Government Front Bench?  Does anyone make allowance for the amount by which a life is shortened by the strain and responsibility?  Does anyone think of the generous way in which <Col N="899" /> this Irish Parliament has in the past treated others who gave good service to the State?  Do they think of the precedents established, and can they think of any sound reasons for departing from those precedents in the case of a couple of dozen men?  One of the earliest Acts of this Parliament was to provide pensions for those who founded this State.  Five or six days' service under arms was reckoned as service of years.  Every man, no matter how young, who carried firearms in Easter Week was pensioned, and rightly pensioned. Yet, criticisms are aimed at this Bill on the ground that the men concerned are comparatively young. They are nearly 20 years older to-day than when that Bill was passed with acclamation, and I see no real distinction between the men who struggled to lay the foundations of the State and those who built on the foundations that were laid by others.  We in this country, which prides itself on being one of the leading democratic States, have, in the light of experience, to choose between keeping this Parliament a real democratic institution, or in the course of time reviving a situation whereby this Parliament will only be the hunting ground of the comparatively rich.</P>
    <P>Speaking with knowledge, I can say that not two out of the previous Ministry could have afforded to go back into the Government if the political tide had been otherwise at the last two general elections-not two out of the whole lot.  A burnt cat dreads the fire. These men, in their time, had experience of giving up six, eight or ten of the best years of their lives to the work of the State, and then in the forties, with families, they found themselves faced with the job of competing with comparatively young men, to resume their previous profession or business careers.  Nobody suggests or believes that any Minister who fulfils his office with credit, as the representative of a young State, is in a position to put by money, no matter what his salary is. What he spends or what he has to lay out is not spent or laid out as an individual, but as one with the high political responsibility of office.  When a <Col N="900" /> Minister goes to other places, he has got to spend money, not as an individual, but as a representative of the State.  He has got to meet representatives of other States, and all that is costly.  No Minister has ever succeeded in putting by money as a Minister. There is no Minister that I have known who did not leave office considerably poorer than on the day he took up office.  If this Bill is opposed, it will be opposed on the grounds that we must all the time expect people to make sacrifices; that we must all the time expect people to serve their country only by doing an unjust thing to their dependents and those who rely upon them.</P>
    <P>From an Opposition Bench I support this Bill with pride.  I think it can be said that there are very few Bills coming from the other side that I support.  I support this Bill with pride, because I think it is doing a just thing by people who, at least, deserve justice.  We will, I expect, have a type of carping criticism, that we are pensioning a person after three years' work, and that such was never heard of before.  Of course, it was heard of before.  That argument is about as honest as if I were to say that you are giving a pension of £500 a year to a man who was a Minister for 30 years.  Any of us could take up an experiment and argue on it, if we were sufficiently dishonest to do so, by saying that this Bill gives a pension of £300 a year to a Minister who has been only three years in office.  That is true.  But this Bill gives a pension of £500 a year, and only a pension of £500 a year, to a Minister who has been 33 years in office, and it would be as fair to argue from one end of the scale as from the other.  The fact of the matter is, after 18 years, and two, three or five Governments, I do not think there is any Minister pensionable after such a short term as three years.  The normal life for a Minister is, at least, one whole Parliament. According to our experience the average life of a Ministry is two whole Parliaments.  The average man who, in the course of time, will be pensionable under this Bill, is a man who has served for ten years, and if the <Col N="901" /> ordinary ebb and flow is similar to other countries, there will be a return now and then of one or two lots, who may be on pension or be ex-pensioners, to become Ministers.</P>
    <P>The amount of money involved in the Bill is rather small.  At its peak point, I expect the cost will not amount to £6,000 per annum, allowing for practically two whole Ministries being on pension at the same time.  I have heard arguments against this Bill on the ground of the increased taxation. Any argument that is really honest should be patiently listened to.  I have not taken a pencil in my hand, but roughly I would say that we have something over 1,000,000 taxpayers. Some are well-to-do, and some are very poor, but the cost of this Bill would be something less than 1d. per taxpayer per annum.  I do not believe any taxpayer is going to get excited about the cost to himself or herself of 1d. per year.</P>
    <P>There are some points in the Bill of which I do not approve.  In the first place I think discrimination between the Attorney-General and a member of the Government, is neither defensible nor justifiable.  Whatever arguments could be advanced&mdash;and they are unlimited&mdash;with regard to a Minister's loss of contact with his trade or profession during his term as Minister, everyone of these arguments apply with equal force to the Attorney-General. It is my belief that they apply with greater force to an Attorney-General than to any other member of the Cabinet.  The Attorney-General in this country is a barrister.  A barrister makes his living, not so much from the public as through being the direct agent of so many solicitors.  It is the custom with solicitors to have their leaders and their juniors.  When a man leaves the Bar and comes here as Attorney-General, every one of these solicitors has got to get some other leader in his place.  At the end of five, six or seven years when the Attorney-General returns to the Bar what is the position?  Every one of these solicitors has got another leader, a man who has done their work adequately, competently and honestly.  No solicitor could say to a man who had been representing him for seven years: &ldquo;You have <Col N="902" /> got to get out now, because X or Y is back.&rdquo;  These solicitors have got to maintain the connection with the man who served them for seven years. In my opinion, the Attorney-General's lot in returning to his profession is, at least, as hard as that of any Minister.</P>
    <P>I cannot see justification for discriminating between the Attorney-General and any other member of the Government.  In fact, we all know that he is a member of the Government, carrying perhaps greater responsibility than any of the others, because he is the adviser of all in a crisis, sitting as a member of the Executive Council in all but voting.  In every sense of the word his task is equal to that of the others, and on leaving his plight is, at least, as bad as any of the other members of the Government.  On every matter there is a certain amount of division of opinion, but I strongly urge that there should not be discrimination against one individual.  A Government is a team.  The Attorney-General is one member of that team.  Discrimination against one man is unjustifiable.  His time, his responsibility, and his loss of contact with his normal work, equals that of any other member of the Government, and instead of disimproving it, this Bill would be improved by treating the Attorney-General as one of the team.  I ask the Minister to bring under the consideration of the Government the inclusion of the Attorney-General in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another point on which I have to criticise this Bill, and it is a point in which it departs from the recommendation of the commission.  In its very early days it came under the notice of the commission that there were certain hardships being imposed while the commission was sitting; that if the ultimate recommendation was in the direction of a pension for ex-Ministers, or the dependents of ex-Ministers, then delay by the commission would be adversely affecting such persons.  The commission itself was then faced with the task of doing the work in a hurry, meeting three, four or five days a week, or doing it in a way <Col N="903" /> that suited their own convenience better by merely meeting once a week. It suited the members better only to meet once a week, but that meant very long delay in bringing in the report, and consequential delay in bringing in a Bill.  One of the earliest decisions taken by the commission, therefore, so as not to prejudice any potential pensioner under the Bill, was that whatever recommendations were made by the commission should apply as from 1st April, 1937.  The commission met only once a week.  Their work was interrupted by a general election.  That election suspended the work of the commission for quite a long period. Finally, the report was circulated and the implementation of the report by way of a Bill was again interrupted by another general election.  It might be unreasonable now to urge that the date fixed by the commission be adhered to, but at least it is reasonable to urge that the provisions contained in this Bill should be given effect to as from 1st April of the present financial year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision made for widows and children, I think the provision made for children is entirely inadequate, particularly a child who is left without either father or mother. In this Bill we give half the Minister's pension to the widow and we allow £30 per child up to the age of 18.  In the event of the mother dying and the child being left without either parent, we increase the £30 to £50.  I consider that that is an absolutely inadequate sum.  That child, in the first place, has grown up in a Minister's household.  Subsequently, between the mother and itself there is an income say of, £300.  Then the mother dies and the child is thrown on the world with £50 per year behind it.  It is entirely out of proportion and entirely inadequate.  I believe that some more generous provision should be made for children than is made in this Bill, particularly in the case of a child left without either of its parents. With regard to the age at which the child allowance ceases, I think nobody will differ from the suggestion that the allowance should be continued up to 21 years of age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> There is another type of case to which I should like to call attention. The principle contained in this Bill is more or less as between Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries; that time served as a Minister counts higher than time served as a Parliamentary Secretary. In the rough, I would say it is in the proportion of three years to two years; that two years as a Minister is equal to three years as a Parliamentary Secretary.  Where a person has served as a Minister and subsequently as a Parliamentary Secretary, or first as a Parliamentary Secretary and subsequently as a Minister, then the sum is more or less made up by counting two years as a Minister as equal to three as a Parliamentary Secretary.  I suggest, without departing from that principle, that where a Minister has served only as a Minister, and not in both capacities, he should have the option of converting his period in office into that of a Parliamentary Secretary and getting a pension accordingly.  I am referring to a case, say, where a Minister spent two years and 11 months as a Minister.  Under this Bill, that would be equivalent to five years as a Parliamentary Secretary. If he were allowed five years as a Parliamentary Secretary, he would be pensionable; but if we stick rigidly in that case to his Ministerial service and do not allow conversion, then he is a month short of getting anything.</P>
    <P>Generally, with regard to the Bill, I have only one further word to say. This report and its recommendations have been before the country for something more than a year.  The report was published in full.  Every daily and provincial newspaper published the outlines of that report. The full recommendations were within the knowledge of everybody capable of reading.  We had a general election since, and no individual that I am aware of, and certainly no Party, challenged the recommendations.  In other words, it is reasonable to say that if any Bill got the approval of the people, at a time when the people had an opportunity of expressing approval or disapproval, that Bill got the approval of the people.</P>
    <P>I know that it is politically attractive to criticise this type of measure. <Col N="905" /> I know that there is a big political attraction in criticising expenditure, not because of the volume of the expenditure, but because it is particularly attractive to criticise expenditure when that money is going to individuals, no matter how and when the money has been earned.  There is something characteristic about people that they can look on without being perturbed at the expenditure of millions, even the misspending of millions&mdash;it will create no excitement. But the reasonable expenditure of pounds, if it is going directly into the pockets of any known individuals, particularly if these individuals happen to be in public life, will rouse all the patriotic fervour of people talking on behalf of the oppressed taxpayer.</P>
    <P>This is an Assembly that is spending money week after week in one direction or another.  If a case is to be made against this particular Bill on the grounds of the increased taxation which it will mean, then I would ask the person who makes that case to calculate exactly what it will mean to the individual taxpayer.  Remember that we have got to choose between having a Government of wealthy people or having the position that the seats of Government should be open to the comparatively poor or to the very poorest. If we were a highly wealthy nation, dealing with a people of great resources, then there would be no necessity to consider a measure of this type.  But this measure exudes the real spirit of giving expression to what democracy should mean&mdash;that the seats of Government are open to the poor and are not the monopoly of the rich.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the previous speaker that this Bill has been before the country for the past couple of years, or that it has been subjected to the approval of the people at the recent elections.  As far as I am aware, the plain people were absolutely unaware that any such measure as this was intended.  There was, of course, in various newspapers a hint that there was some question of introducing legislation to increase salaries for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, but suggestions of this kind <Col N="906" /> were always denied.  People were told that there was nothing in them, and the people accepted that view.  They generally felt that for some time to come there would be no alteration in the salaries of the Ministers and Secretaries, and in the allowances to members of this House.  As far as I am concerned, as one member of this House, I must say that this Bill came to me as a complete surprise.  I had no idea that such measures were contemplated, and I was completely astounded when I received copies of those two Bills now under consideration.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with the previous speaker that the people of this country are satisfied that this measure is necessary; that it is so urgently necessary that it should be passed this year.  At the present time we must remember that the people of this country, particularly the people engaged in the agricultural industry, are passing through a very severe economic crisis. It is no answer to these people to say that the amount of money involved in this Bill is comparatively small.  I admit that the amount directly involved is comparatively small.  But there is a principle introduced here which will certainly impose a further increased burden upon the taxpayers of this country.  If we agree that the members of the Government and the leaders of the political Parties should be provided for to such an extent that they should not suffer any loss, and that all their grievances should be looked into, are we not faced with the fact that every paid official in this State, every servant of the Government, will have an unanswerable claim for having his grievances looked into and redressed, and for having his income increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the measures which are being introduced now we will have demands from every paid official of this State and from every pensioner of this State for a review of his position in the light of this measure.  If we start at the lowest rung of the ladder, if we start with the lowest body of pensioners, the old age pensioners, what do we find?  We find people who have worked for 50 or 60 years and have reached the age of 70 compelled to <Col N="907" /> make application to a local committee. Their means are investigated by a number of inspectors, and if they have any means whatever these means are taken into consideration in assessing their pensions.  The mere fact that these applicants for the old age pension are living on a small holding, which belongs not to themselves, but to their children, is taken into consideration and they are awarded a pension of 5/- or 6/- a week.  They are not awarded the maximum pension allowed by this State.  These people will now feel they have a grievance&mdash;that they have been treated very harshly in comparison with people in higher positions.</P>
    <P>There is another effect which a measure of this kind will have&mdash;that is its psychological effect upon the taxpayers of the country generally.  I refer to its effect on the people who are struggling to meet the calls and the demands that are made on them.  These people will naturally feel that they are being unfairly treated.  As they are being called upon to make sacrifices they will, naturally, ask why it is that those in higher positions in this State are not also asked to make sacrifices. If an army engaged in warfare in a very difficult and dangerous position find that their officers are in a position of comparative safety the effect upon the ordinary rank and file is demoralising.  The ordinary rank and file here are the taxpayers.  These are engaged in warfare against acute poverty.  They are engaged in a desperate struggle to maintain themselves and to secure for themselves the very barest living.  Now if these people find that the men who are directing the affairs of this State and making the laws under which they have to live&mdash;laws which they find to a great extent harsh&mdash;are given these large increases, they will come to the conclusion that they are labouring under very strong grievances.  This will to a great extent deter them from continuing their struggle.  That will have a bad effect on the economic prosperity of the country.  If we are to have close co-operation between all sections in this country, if we are to have close cooperation between the people and the Government of this State, then we have <Col N="908" /> to get down to hard facts and get to look at things in such a way that it will be clearly understood by the plain people of this country that there is no advantage whatever in occupying the position of head of the State.  It must be made clear to the plain people of this country that those who occupy important positions in the State are not to use those positions to improve their own financial positions.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that a measure of this kind, introduced at a time when the country is labouring under a huge economic depression, must certainly have a demoralising effect on the entire community and must add to the discontent which already exists in a very large measure.  We know, and all statistics prove, that the economic condition of the country is bad.  The main industry upon which the nation has to depend is in a deplorable plight. All the figures that have been produced before us confirm that the overwhelming majority of those engaged in agriculture, whether farmers or agricultural workers, are living in a condition of poverty.  In addition to that, we have the fact that the volume of agricultural production is declining, and that shows that the people engaged in agriculture have not either sufficient capital to carry on the industry, or they have lost courage and given up all hope of making it a success.  The result is that the agricultural industry is declining and the economic condition of the country is becoming steadily worse.  In the circumstances, it should be the duty of the Government to give a lead to the people and ask them to make whatever sacrifices are necessary to get the country on its feet, and they should set an example by making whatever little sacrifice may be involved in postponing a measure of this kind for some time.</P>
    <P>I find that the general principles of this Bill are absolutely unsatisfactory. There may be minor portions of it with which most people would agree; that is, the making of provision for those who suffered during the struggle for the independence of this country&mdash; making provision for the dependents of Ministers.  So far as providing pensions for ex-Ministers is concerned, <Col N="909" /> that principle is one which I think no reasonable person could support.  It has been said by one Deputy that there is a precedent for this in the provision made for pensions for those who took part in the struggle for independence, I submit that was an exceptional circumstance. It does not often happen that a nation is engaged in a war of independence, and I think that could not be accepted as a precedent for making provision for Minister, which is a position that will always arise.</P>
    <P>If we are to make provision for pensions for Ministers, you may have a demand for pensions from everybody who devotes a certain amount of time to the public service.  You will probably have a demand for pensions from ex-Deputies and ex-Senators, and possibly, after a time, you will have a demand for salaries and pensions from members of local bodies, county councils, and the like.  After a time there might be a demand for remuneration for jurors or anyone else who considers he has given service to the State.  I think the whole principle of pensions for able-bodied people should be reconsidered.  It was necessary in the case of those who took part in the struggle for independence, but beyond that I think the principle should not be extended.  It may be said that people who occupy positions as Ministers are at a disadvantage by being dissociated from their ordinary business activities for a number of years. But we ought to remember that people who hold such high offices gain considerable prestige which will help them to secure important positions in commercial life afterwards and that would completely outweigh any disadvantage that might arise from dissociation with their private business during their period of office.</P>
    <P>I think, on the whole, there is really no disadvantage and no financial loss involved in the holding of ministerial office.  I think the Committee were over-generous in their estimates and did not take into consideration the conditions of the overwhelming majority of the people, who have to put up with various disadvantages and make various sacrifices and who have completely to finance measures of this <Col N="910" /> kind.  It is not the actual amount involved in the Bill, but the consequential amounts that will be involved through increasing demands from every section of the Civil Service and the national service generally.  Such demands must be considerable and they will impose an exceptionally heavy burden upon the taxpayers.  Therefore, so far as I am concerned, I cannot support this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>With the underlying principles of this Bill, and its conception generally, there can be very little disagreement in the House.  The restoration to the full of the statutory allowance previously in existence in relation to ministerial salaries will be accepted, I am sure, by most Deputies. We know now that that full allowance has been drawn for some months past. With the pensions it is different.  I agree entirely with the point of view put up by Deputy O'Higgins, that any man who served the State should not be put in a position of embarrassment. I am quite satisfied that any person in the country, no matter what his limitations may be, would not deny anyone who filled ministerial office a reasonable security; but I do not feel that the mechanical application of regulations of that kind quite fulfils the idea. There was an implication of censure in Deputy O'Higgins' statement when he referred to carping criticism with reference to the £300 a year after three years' service.  I think a man after three years' service is hardly entitled to a pension of £300 a year for life.  It is quite possible that one may arrive early in life in ministerial office and he may retain office for five years. He would then be entitled to a pension of £500, irrespective of his private position.  These are, however, points that can be argued on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one phrase used by the Minister that I can hardly understand. He said that this Bill guarantees good and clean Government.  I would be very sorry to think that we would have to bribe our Ministers to do their duty properly.  Experience has convinced me that no matter what remuneration you give a dishonest man he will avail himself to the full of his opportunity, <Col N="911" /> and no matter what the limitations of an honest man are, he will endeavour to pass his name on unsullied to his family and his country.  I do not think that line of argument should be used, Sir.  Coming to the main portions of the Bill, I agree, and I think the House will agree, that consideration ought to be shown for men who filled ministerial positions.  For anyone filling ministerial office, who has compromised his own opportunities in life by devotion to the public service, I believe it should be shown.  I believe the mechanical application of the Bill is not the most desirable and we will endeavour and hope on the Committee Stage to apportion that to what we think is just between those who are to receive and those who have to pay. There is no use in dividing the House on this matter, Sir.  We can see from statements in other places that this Bill has the support of the entire majority.  I, too, support the underlying principle of the Bill, but I reserve the right, on the Committee Stage, to amend the Bill so as to give what I think would be a just apportionment between those who hold office and the people who have to maintain them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Cogan that this Bill was before the people on the last election.  As far as I see, there is no use opposing it because the people now have got what they voted for at the last election. I am surprised at the change of front on the part of the Government. I remember the time they were in opposition when they said that no man was worth £1,000 a year.  Their mentality is changed now, which shows that they can change from one day to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter I would like to bring up on this measure.  The Minister for Agriculture, in reply to repeated requests from the farmers of this Party for help for the farmers, said there was no money to help the farmers in the position they are in at present.  There is money for this thing.  This Bill or such Bills as it will tend to the growth of Communism in this country, because the people who are in poor circumstances, poor <Col N="912" /> people, a man and wife living on 7/6 a week in the country, and I know lots of them, will say to themselves: &ldquo;Look at these people in high positions. Might not we as well help ourselves?&rdquo; The position in the country at present is that every second person has a pension. Some, no doubt, deserve it, but I want to know where is this all going to end.  I hope that this will be the last measure for pensions to be brought into this country or into this House. I am glad that the Government have not thought it well to go back as far as Brian Boru.  It looks as if it were tending in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one proposal in this Bill that nobody except the Minister for Finance has attempted to justify and before he speaks I would like to ask him to support that proposal with greater force than he has done before I could say I would be prepared, as Deputy, to vote for it, and that is the provision made in it for the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the third largest Party in this House.  I suppose it is right to say that a certain amount of responsibility rests on the shoulders of the Leaders of the two second largest Parties in the House but, at the same time, the men who occupy those posts are men who have been chosen for those posts by the organisation and by the members of the Party elected by that organisation, and I think that if any man is so chosen that he is chosen because of some outstanding qualifications, and that he can only show those qualities if he is called upon to exert himself and to make all the sacrifices involved in hard work and endeavour. I think that, while the allowance that is proposed in this Bill is not regarded as a personal allowance (as the Minister for Finance has pointed out, it is regarded as an allowance in order to provide him with the necessary assistance to study and make up measures that come before that House), that individual in accepting the leadership of a Party should be called upon to take the full responsibility that that position entails.  In so far as the substantial portion of this measure is concerned and the provision that it makes for those who have <Col N="913" /> to break their connections to take up Ministerial posts, I am perfectly satisfied. I fully agree with the reservations that were made in the report by a member of the committee that was set up to examine this whole matter and I agree with the reservation made by Deputy Moore regarding the payment of this allowance to the two Leaders of the two largest Parties.  I do think that it is carrying this thing a little bit too far, and I, like Deputy Broderick, would feel like supporting an amendment that would after that provision when this measure comes before the House on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that, like Deputy Broderick, I agree in principle with what is in this Bill, and I am rather amazed at Deputy Smith's trouble over that particular point, because he says the Minister did not make a case for it.  The Minister made a case for the Bill, and, whatever my feelings are about the principles for which this Bill stands, I think the Minister made the wrong case, and made the wrong case altogether.  This is the only reason I am speaking on the Second Reading of the Bill at all. First of all, he said that the provision of pensions for future Ministers and present Ministers, and the provision of the salaries fixed in the Bill would lead to representative democracy; that it would help something that was not helped in present circumstances; that we would get a type of people coming into public life with the knowledge that they would not be asked to make sacrifices, and that the position would not be as it is now, that the present system was a deterrent to the acceptance of public office.  If that was the reason for supporting the Bill, I would not support this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like it to go from this House, or to go out from anyone in this House, no matter what we think of the principle in this Bill, that the one good reason or that a good reason for supporting this Bill was the fact that we thought we would get better people into politics, and that the Irish people were of such a nature and such a kind that the only way to get proper representation <Col N="914" /> of public opinion was to increase the bidding.  I do not agree with that.  It is not so very long ago in the history of this country that there were Irish Parliamentary Parties and good representatives of Irish Parliamentary Parties when there was no parliamentary salary at all.  Agreeing, as I do, that anyone who gave service to the State ought to be rewarded, that anyone who gave good service should not be thrown on the wayside, I regret very much that the Minister or anybody would see fit to put forward, as even one justification for this Bill, the fact that present circumstances acted as a deterrent to some people to come into public life in this country, and that the provision of increased salaries, or pensions, or anything else, would lead those people into public life.  If there are people in public life in this country or people who have ambitions to go into public life, and they do not feel like going in under present circumstances, and who can only be induced in by the provisions of this Bill, then I say I hope they will stay out of public life in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in the position of having to submit to the proper authorities a statement that I was not in favour of this Bill, that I was in a position that I could not support it, and I think it my duty to say so here publicly.  I am not at all satisfied that this is the time for increasing salaries or providing pensions.  There is no doubt about it that we want a good Government, and that if we have a good Government they should be paid well and paid a salary sufficient not only for their expenses for the period they are in office, but also sufficient to enable them to protect themselves after quitting Ministerial office.  Therefore, it is not on the question of the Ministerial salaries that I would suggest opposition, but certainly it is on the question of the principle of providing pensions.  I think this whole Bill means an invitation, a general invitation to all and sundry to look at politics as a career.  That is a very unwholesome thing to have in this country.  If this Bill and the other Bill pass, hundreds will undoubtedly get it into their <Col N="915" /> heads that a political career is for them &mdash;or maybe thousands&mdash;and I do not think that would be good for the country.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the effect that no newspaper made any suggestions or offered any opposition to these measures when they were first published.  I would refer members of the Opposition to the fact that their own paper opposed it, and not only opposed the measure, but opposed it in an offensive way.  They sent out a questionnaire, or sent out reporters, asking for individual opinions and they printed these individual opinions, and many of these individual opinions were such as to bring this Chamber into contempt.  It is only a few days ago, and you can procure the newspaper. If you, over there, do not read it, you ought to read it; it is your own journal. That is the class of talk that has been going about amongst the people of this city&mdash;the people that I reach. I found none of them in favour of this proposition.  I found none of the working class, with whom I am in daily contract, in favour of these proposals. Quite the contrary.  I do not know for what reason Ministers should be pensioned. I say that, when political opinion becomes unstable and Ministers do not get support and have to go out of office, they should look for a job, and their ability, their training and their experience should recommend them to any amount of people who would be satisfied, and very welcomingly satisfied, to accept their services. That is the position.  Or else they could go back to the professions or the positions they occupied or practised before taking office.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to speak very long on this matter.  Indeed, a few minutes is all that is necessary.  A short speech has long results, but unfortunately that is not adopted here now.  It is a matter here of long speeches and very short results.</P>

Some people seem to think that this Party is very hide-bound, and the accusation of being &ldquo;yes men&rdquo; is often thrown at us.  There are no &ldquo;yes men&rdquo; on this side.  When it comes to a matter of conscience and a matter of political honesty, we are free to express our opinions.  Certainly, if there is a division on this measure, I shall not vote against the Government, but I shall not support it.  I will not support any measure calculated on these principles.  I cannot do any more than that.  I cannot go out in rebellion&mdash;I will not do that, because I am satisfied that the Government we have is the best Government the country could get.  I do not want to weaken their position even by my slight voice or vote, Nevertheless, I think it is only right that the position should be clarified, and I want to make it clear here and to my constituents in the City of Dublin that I am not satisfied to support this measure.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to say anything at all on this particular Bill had it not been for the speech delivered by the last speaker. Some people in this House, and perhaps many outside the House, may be inclined to treat the speech of Deputy Tom Kelly as of no importance, but he is a Deputy of this House.  The Deputy gets on his feet and talks first about the principle in the Bill, and then goes on to talk about political honesty, and his conception of political honesty is that he is not going to vote either for or against the Bill.  The Deputy, of course, gave away the whole point in the end of his speech.  He wants to let his constituents outside know that he does not agree with the Bill.  The difference between Deputy Tom Kelly and, perhaps, a good many people in all parts of this House is that he has blurted it out quite plainly and that many others will not.  Deputy Tom Kelly and some of the other speakers here, if they were to be logical, would be against any salary being paid to a <Col N="917" /> Minister or any allowance being paid to a Deputy of this House.  Either salaries or allowances should be adequate for the carrying out of the business of the nation or they should not be paid at all.  I think, if I might say so, or if it is possible to say so without offence, that both inside and outside the House there is a great deal of hypocrisy about this measure.  Deputy Tom Kelly and others have told us here in the House that this is not the time to put further burdens on the people, that the people are already bearing such crushing burdens that they are not able to carry them.  We heard very little from those particular Deputies, either inside or outside the House, when hundreds of thousands and even millions of pounds were being placed on the backs of the taxpayers of this country.</P>

The Deputy can never see any position in this House except that side and this side&mdash;your newspaper and our newspaper.  The Deputy should face up to the facts.  We are told that this is not the time to impose an additional burden on this country, and that the people cannot bear an additional taxation of, roughly, £14,000 or £15,000 a year.  Within the last six months, however, two measures alone passed through this House&mdash;were passed by this House, whether they were wise or unwise which put £1,500,000 each on the taxpayers of this country.  Numerous measures have been put through this House, and received the sanction of the House, to place very heavy burdens on the poor of this country and on the poor of the City of Dublin, but I did not hear <Col N="918" /> Deputy Tom Kelly get up and mention them.</P>

Like every other member of the House, I have constituents to answer to also, and I have no doubt, that there are people in my constituency who are against this measure, but I am going to vote for it.  I am going to vote for it because it is a just measure.  That is number one.  Secondly, I am going to vote for it because I believe that the people of the country will be repaid a hundredfold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I did not hear the early stages of this debate, but I should like to make a few remarks, induced principally by the remarks of Deputy Kelly, The comparison between this country and England is not quite correct.  The British members of Parliament have been paid salaries for only a comparatively small number of years.  I think they were paid before the Irish Party left the British Parliament finally&mdash;I do not want to state that definitely, but I think it is correct&mdash; and the salaries have been increased since.  Now, we all know that the labourer is worthy of his hire, and while I do not think it is justifiable that a political career should be the <Col N="919" /> goal of the people who come into this House, we have to remember that when members do come in they have certain expenses.  The people who go into the British House of Parliament are moneyed men, or have the control of money, and perhaps can act more independently, but the people who come long distances to this House week after week have a perfect right to get at least sufficient remuneration for that.  However, coming back to the particular Bill we are discussing now, in the British Parliament pensions are granted to Ministers who require them.  Ministers were not supposed to ask for pensions unless they did require them.  There is one instance; I do not care to mention the name, but he was a brother of the Leader of the House, and he got a pension of £1,200 a year because he was not well off when he retired, and he had only been a comparatively short time a member of Parliament.  He occupied a rather prominent position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tom Kelly also said that when a Minister left this House he could, owing to his abilities and experience, get a good position outside. I do not think that is correct. I do not think there is any job which makes a man more unsuitable for ordinary business work than that of a Deputy or Minister of this House. They get too hide-bound in their opinions; they do not change sufficiently; they do not suit positions outside as well as people who have been brought up in trade or commerce. I am in favour of this Bill, and I will vote for it if there is a division. I should like to say something with regard to widows' pensions. Most men who are married and have families live their lives for their families, and they hope to make provision for their widows and families if they are not cut off.  Two Ministers have been cut off in this House, and I understand that their widows are not at all well off.  I certainly think they should be treated in a very liberal fashion.  If the Bill could be made retrospective to the time of the death of those people it would be a very good thing.  I think that Ministers <Col N="920" /> and ex-Ministers and their widows are entitled to pensions.  After a man has been a Minister for ten or twelve years he is not well suited for any other position outside.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill with certain reservations.  I am surprised at the attitude adopted by Deputy Tom Kelly on this matter. While his conscience pricks him about this Bill, he cannot give a ballot to his leader.  Outside of that, if anything would make me support the Bill it would be the speech of Deputy Cogan.  He places the matter on the patriotic side.  He talks about the dependents of those who fought in the I.R.A. and all that.  I think it is time we gave that up.  It is time that we should have in the Government the best people who are to be had in the country, no matter whether or not they were children 15 years ago.  It is time that we should have in the Government the best people and the best brains in the country.  In the past we had very good men as Ministers in this country, and because of their lack of private means they could not live up to that job.  I think it is a very sad state of affairs that when a Minister is ousted he should have to look for some paltry job outside, only to be told that he is a politician and will not get the job.  As I said, I think we should have in the Government the best material and the best brains that can be had, because those people are dealing with more money than any firms or anybody else outside. We should have the best brains and material, and the cost does not matter, because it will be so small in the end that it will not count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But what is the position?  It is gradually coming to this, that in the future you will have very few big men wanting to come into the Government in this country because they do not want to ruin their career.  They will say that after six or seven years of service in that capacity their business or their profession will be gone.  You are not going to get them to come in unless some provision is made for <Col N="921" /> them.  You are not going to get a great university professor to come in here, and destroy his career, unless some provision is made for him.  I think that if a Minister had some prospect for the future when the public ceased to give him their votes he would be a better Minister.  Mind you, we are all human.  Everyone of us in this House is human, and if we have not very good prospects we are inclined to do things which we would not do if there was a big career ahead of us.  If I am a Minister, and I am afraid I am going to lose the votes of the public by doing what I think is right as far as this country is concerned, I am very likely not to do the right thing.  I am very likely to take the wrong line in order to obtain the votes of the people.  A realisation of the necessity for guarding against that inclination is one of my strongest reasons for supporting a pension to ex-Ministers.  I may be wrong, but I have watched the last six or seven years carefully, and I am watching the present moment carefully, and I think that if a man had prospects for the future he would not be likely to take the wrong line in order to obtain a salary or obtain a living.  I do not want to reopen old sores. It is a terrible thing to be standing here and supporting the people opposite, but I intend to do so in the interests of the country.  I believe this will lead to better government and to the making of better men.  I have not more to say except to refer again to my very honest friend, Deputy Thomas Kelly, who, I hope, will be rebellious when the time comes to vote.</P>

      <P>I felt sorry for my friend, Deputy Thomas Kelly, when he was speaking.  I am not going to vote for this Bill, and I will give my reasons.  I am sure Deputy Kelly had a reason for the attitude he adopted. My attitude, I expect, is just the same.  I am not going to vote for the Bill, because I think it goes a little too far.  On the other hand, I am not going to vote against it, because, in principle, I believe in providing for Ministers.</P>

      <P>I believe that conditions could be worse if Ministers were, at the end of their terms of office, in financial difficulty.  I would not like that.  I would not like the nation to show ingratitude&mdash;and I regard this Bill as a matter of gratitude&mdash;to Ministers.  I am convinced that we will get the very same type of people at the salaries, but I believe the country would be inclined to show gratitude towards those who had served it in some responsible position. No one would wish to see these men in difficulties at the end of their term of office.  There is no doubt that if they have to break up their business they cannot later pick it up in a day or two.  For that reason, they are entitled to consideration, but I think giving a life pension for three years' service is going too far, as is also the provision for widows and children. We have to take into account the conditions under which the majority of the people have to live.  We have to remember that this is a poor country, and that the principal producers are making sacrifices for its freedom. Even though they have felt these sacrifices, especially during the struggle with Great Britain, they were satisfied to make them for the freedom of the country.  It is not too much to ask that people in all walks should make sacrifices.  I suggest that pensions might be given for a limited number of years, and that no ex-Minister with three years' service should draw a pension for 20 years, even though the pension is not very big.  At a further stage the Bill might be amended.  On the Committee Stage I am prepared to support others in reducing the amounts proposed to be expended.  That is why I am not prepared to vote for the Bill now.  At the same time I am not prepared to vote against it because, in principle, I believe in providing as decently as the country can afford for Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill expressed gratitude in that manner I believe it would be expressing the mind of the people generally.  I would not agree to the setting up of a pensions scheme that <Col N="923" /> would provide for a fresh crop of Ministers every three years.  It is possible that every three years 22 or 26 men might qualify for pensions.  I do not expect that will happen, but it is possible.  It would be a bad precedent to set at a time when the country is faced with financial difficulties. The Report of the Banking Commission has been published, but without any such report we know from experience that the condition of the country is anything but prosperous, and that this is not the time to set a headline that other parties might follow. I hope that the Minister will look at all sides of the case, and be prepared to consider some reasonable amendments on the Committee Stage. I am preparing an amendment designed to cut down and to set a limit to the expenditure.  While there is a limit to the number of Ministers who can draw salaries, there is no limit to the number who can draw pensions. There should be a limit to the number of persons and a limit to the amount of money to be spent.  If the Minister looks into the matter and is prepared to consider reasonable amendments we can get along nicely with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to protest against the manner in which Deputy D. Morrissey attacked Deputy T. Kelly.  In my opinion Deputy Kelly has always shown himself to be as responsible a member of the House as Deputy Morrissey.  He is, I might add, a respected member of this House, and is not on the same plane generally as Deputy Morrissey.  I say that openly. Deputy Kelly spoke out his mind, and I hope every other Deputy will do the same.  This is as distasteful a Bill to us as it is to the Deputy.  It is a distasteful Bill, and one, undoubtedly, that will create a certain amount of adverse comment in the country, where we will have people saying: &ldquo;Oh, you were up last week giving a pension to so and so.&rdquo; At the same time, we must look on these matters in view of our responsibilities here.  I hope that this country will never elect Deputies on the same mentality as members are elected to the British House of Commons. <Col N="924" /> I consider that Deputies come here with an entirely different viewpoint. They come here having very definite views as to what the country requires, and they want to carry out those views to the best of their ability. Therefore, I would never expect to have any comparison made between the position of Deputies or Ministers here with Ministers or members across the Channel.  The position in the two countries is different.</P>
      <P>I should like if this measure could be looked upon as one that would not be used, as one that Ministers or ex-Ministers would not avail of except in case of necessity.  I think that is the line on which it was introduced.  It is the light in which Deputies, Ministers and ex-Ministers will look upon it.  I do not think that this country could expect that any man should give the best years of his life to its service and afterwards find himself and his family in penury.  That is the view I take. I intend to vote for the Bill.  I wish honestly that some other means could be found by which men who devoted their whole time&mdash;as Ministers undoubtedly must&mdash;to the service of the State, would not, when things change at any time, be faced with want, as a result of their services to the nation. I do not think anybody would expect them to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a certain amount of unreality in this, I suggest that it is due to Deputies who come in here and object to this and who, in their local councils, add five or ten years to a dispensary doctor's service in the hope that the Local Government Department will sanction it and that the doctor will get an increased pension.  You have the same line running through the whole of this debate here.  There are men who devote their whole time for five or ten years, and in some cases 15 years to the service of the State, and the nation should at least make some provision for them afterwards.  You do it with everybody else: with the dispensary doctors, the Civil Service and every other branch of life.  I see no reason why Ministers, who have to give up their home life and their business to come in here to serve the State for <Col N="925" /> a certain period should not know at least that they are not going to drive themselves and their families into penury and want.</P>
    <P>That is my viewpoint in connection with this, and I express it honestly here.  I think that that is the manner in which this Bill will be availed of afterwards, namely, that an ex-Minister will have the knowledge that that money is there if he requires it, that it will not be drawn by ex-Ministers who will not require it.  I would prefer if some other means could be got of getting over the difficulty, but I cannot see any other means of getting over it.  As far as the allowances to leaders of the Opposition are concerned, I will say this much: that we were here from 1927 to 1932 as an Opposition, and we were a fairly effective Opposition.  There was no Opposition here afterwards as good as we were.</P>

They are not going to get the voluntary assistance that was given when we were in Opposition.  They are not getting that voluntary assistance.  It is plain to be seen that from 1932 to the present time that voluntary assistance has not been forthcoming.  You have Deputies opposite contradicting one <Col N="926" /> another upon every measure brought in here.  Deputy Dillon will get up and, as a responsible leader, will make a statement, and when he sits down we have Deputy Bennett or some other Deputy getting up and contradicting every word he said.  If there was an effective Opposition we would not have that occurring.  Either Deputy Dillon would be curbed before he came in, or the other fellows would be curbed before they came in.  At least the Opposition should speak with one voice and not with divers tongues. Therefore, I see the necessity for giving the Leader of the Opposition secretarial assistance and typists; also the Leader of the second Opposition, whoever he may be, and that is the object of this.  Therefore I am going to vote for it, and I make no bones about it.</P>
      <P>I know that I will get a bigger hammering down the country over this measure than over any other measure we can dream of introducing.  I know well that as soon as I go down the country they will say, &ldquo;Last week you voted for a pension for so-and-so&rdquo;; but I think Deputies should have the courage of their convictions.  I consider it wrong that a Deputy who will go to a county council meeting and 6 or 12 months before an official retires vote him an increase of £100 a year in order to increase his pensions, or add five years to a retiring official's service in order to increase his pension, should come in here and say, &ldquo;I object to this measure.&rdquo;  I do not believe in that kind of thing, and that is the reason I am supporting the measure. I believe that the pension will not be drawn, that it will be held there as something that an ex-Minister can fall back upon if he considers that he and his family are in want.  I look upon it in that light alone, and I am sure that Ministers and ex-Ministers will also look upon it in that light&mdash;that there will be something there which will at least provide that they and their families will not be in want on account of any service they render to the nation. That is my sole reason for voting for it.</P>

That argument carried great weight down the country.  I know because I was in that campaign and I saw the people deeply impressed by that argument.  I myself heard the Taoiseach say from a public platform that no man in Ministerial office or in the Civil Service was worth more than £1,000 a year and I heard the crowd go delirious with enthusiasm with this Daniel-come-to-Judgment when he indicated the leader of the Opposition, Mr. Cosgrave, with having battened on the public and robbed them for ten years.  He indicted every one of my present colleagues who was then a Minister with having robbed the public for ten years, with having lived in luxury at the expense of the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He indicated every Minister of the preceding Government with having drawn from the State a salary far in excess of what he was entitled to, and he impressed the electors.  Then, when he came into office, he reduced the salaries of his own Ministers to £1,000 a year.  Now, he comes out at the Ard Fheis in a white sheet and says that every one of them ran into debt.  Whether was it better, as Deputy Cosgrave did when he was Prime Minister, to give Ministers a reasonable salary and let them pay their bills or to make what appears to me to be a dishonest political gesture and have them running into debt? Having run them into debt, the Taoiseach comes in here and advances their salaries.  The truth is that he should never have reduced them.  The salaries fixed by the first Government of this country were modest salaries&mdash; in my opinion, too modest&mdash;and nobody would have taken them but patriots. I saw men who took those salaries and who spent the best years of their lives in the public service leave office without 6d. in their pockets.  Poor men, they had to go down the country in competition with boys who had only just been called into their professions before <Col N="929" /> the last Government went out of office. Having been ten years Ministers of this State, these men, without 6d. in their pockets, have had to go back to their jobs and struggle up from the bottom.  Such of the Ministers as had not time to take up a profession owing to the work they were doing for the country at the inadequate salary given them by their leader, and by the Oireachtas on his recommendation, were actually looking for jobs and finding it hard to make ends meet&mdash;after giving the best part of their lives to the service of the country.  These were the men who were held up to public odium by the Prime Minister as having robbed the country and battened on the State.  Now, we are told he made a mistake&mdash;just a little error of judgment. But it was an error of judgment which blackened and slandered honourable men.  There is no retraction, no apology, no explanation when it is now known that the statements uttered on every Fianna Fáil platform throughout the country were slanders and that, far from getting an excessive salary, these men got too little.  There is just a casual observation by the Prime Minister that he found he made a mistake and that, when he put his scheme into operation, all his Ministers ran into debt.  The astonishing thing about the man is that he got full political advantage from the slander, while there is not an old lady in Rathmines who is not now saying: &ldquo;Is he not a wonderful man; when he is wrong how freely he admits it; he is so honourable and so courageous that he is never afraid to admit he is wrong.&rdquo; It is a gift, I must say, I wish I had. If I make a mistake in a public speech, there is a riot.  If I admit subsequently that I made a mistake, there is a hue and cry for six months and everything I say is aspersed because it is held that I must be wrong since I made a mistake previously.  If the Taoiseach makes a mistake, far from detracting from his reputation, it elevates him into the ranks of the saints.  At the same time, it is desirable that slander so effectively put over should be publicly repudiated.  I do not hope that the Taoiseach will repudiate it but I take his words at yesterday's Ard-Fheis and I interpret <Col N="930" /> them as meaning that every word he and his colleagues said about the Ministers who went before them getting a penny more than was their minimum due was a slander&mdash;a slander of which every member of the Fianna Fáil organisation ought to be ashamed to-day.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of giving Ministers of this State not only a fair salary but a good salary, and I want to tell you why.  The bulk of our people are small farmers.  It is notorious that if there is one group in the country whom it is difficult to organise in their own interest, it is the small farmers. They are divided into sections&mdash;political sections and other sections&mdash;and they seldom or ever get together in defence of their own material interest. Every big vested interest in this country must ultimately get its plunder out of the small farmer.  When a vested interest is gathering to spring, for the purpose of sucking blood out of our people, the first thing it does is to scour the world for the ablest man it can get to make its case. I have in mind at the moment a vested interest in this country whom I saw send abroad for and hire a man at £10,000 to make their case.  It was made so well that they have plucked the people of this country to the extent of about £2,000,000 in the last three or four years.  Our unfortunate farmers, instead of seeing the vital necessity of getting for the defence of their interest the very best men money can buy, are encouraged by obscurantists to grudge their representative every pound he gets.  They want to cut his salary down to the last penny&mdash;pay him the lowest penny for which they can persuade him to work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot blame them. It is because of that that they have got the type they have at present. If they paid a decent salary, they would get competent men.  The Minister for Finance will excuse that &ldquo;aside,&rdquo; because it was more a debating point directed against the Deputy who interrupted than against himself. <Col N="931" /> Ministers are leaders of their Party. The mistake that the agriculturist makes is that, instead of realising that he has got to have as able a man to defend his interests as the vested interests have to attack them, he thinks he can get as good a man as the vested interests have at one-tenth of the salary.  The ultimate result of that will be that no really able man will be able to afford to go into public life at all.  A lot of people will say that that is a queer reflection to throw at my own colleagues.  That brings me to the last point I want to make. We are forgetting that practically up to yesterday this country has been involved in a patriotic struggle to be free.  Throughout the period of that struggle the leaders of our people were prepared to work for nothing, and did, in fact, work for nothing.  The leaders of the Irish Parliamentary Party lived in tenement houses in London.  The late Thomas Sexton was perhaps the greatest orator in the British House of Commons, and yet he lived in penury becoming a pauper on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. He lived there because he had no other place to live.  After them, equally ready to make sacrifices, came the later leaders and they worked for this country for nothing.  The first Ministers who established this State did work for which no money could pay them.  They devoted their whole lives to it.  They took their lives in their hands.  They risked their lives every day.  No money could pay them for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not deny, though I profoundly disagree with the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party, that they came to their task at first with a kind of ecstatic devotion, born of the idea that they could make some radical constitutional change in the State which would add lustre to its glory.  That day is over. We all realise now that that phase of the national work is done, that the country is now ours to do what we please with it, and that all that exalted enthusiasm can no longer be expected in the public life of this country, any more than it is expected in the public <Col N="932" /> life of any other country.  We are now getting down to the pedestrian business of administering the affairs of State.  We have got to protect ourselves against allowing that immensely important work to fall into the hands of mediocre men.  If we want to get the best type of men, I do not suggest that it is practical politics to compete against the highest salaries that their intellects can secure in the commercial world, but we ought to do this: we ought to go as near as we can to provide them with a standard of living analogous to that which they would enjoy if they were reaping the rewards of a commercial career.  I should not wish them to look to politics as a source of wealth, but we have got to make up our minds that unless we can reassure men, in the rising generations of Ireland, that Ministerial office in the service of the State is going to give them a standard of living as high as they could get in commercial careers, without its luxuries, we are not going to get the right men into politics at all.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows the circumstances obtaining in many other countries realises that a very similar mistake has been made in other democratic countries.  Of that mistake has been born mediocrity in public life, and, what is worse, corruption, because the evil of inadequate remuneration is one which plays into the hands of mediocrity.  When mediocre men have become complete monopolists of public affairs, the vested interest discovers that it is cheaper to buy the Government than it is to oppose it.  We may resist that for one generation or two generations, but if you allow the standard of ability and independence of the public man to fall, as a result of financial exigencies, sooner or later you are going to be confronted with the horror of corruption in public life. It would ill-become me categorically to name any particular State, but any one of us who has travelled the world knows that we are not without examples, if we chose to point to them, of countries where corruption has ridden public life, and, once it has ridden it, these countries cannot get rid of it.  There is no means of getting rid of it.  Once corruption has got a <Col N="933" /> fair strangle-hold on public life there is no means of clearing it out without a revolution in the system of Government. We believe in democratic government here.  It is the best form of government, I think, even though, God knows, it is fairly exasperating sometimes.  I should like to see it maintained.  One of the greatest menaces to it is the possibility of corruption creeping into it.  I want to make Ministers of State of this country, no matter to what Party they belong, independent men into whose minds will never come the temptation to accept financial bribes, or bribes of any kind, from any vested interest, no matter how powerful or wealthy it may be.</P>
    <P>Now, I fully sympathise with the first reaction of certain Deputies who, I think, perhaps, have not given to this matter as careful reflection as they might have because, to judge from the emphasis with which they spoke, one would imagine that they were resisting a heavy burden of expenditure out of the taxpayer's pocket.  What is this Bill going to cost?  The outside expenditure is £9,000 a year, much less than the President's salary.  The wheat scheme is costing over £2,000,000 a year.  The beet scheme is costing £1,000,000, and we are delighted with both these schemes.  We voted £500,000 for the alcohol factory a few days ago and thought we had done a good job.  We vote millions in this House, and nobody gives a hoot, but we work ourselves into paroxysms of rage when a Bill is introduced, the maximum present vote under which cannot exceed £9,000.  Really, that is not prudent.</P>
    <P>The last word I have to say is this. I say it without consultation with anybody, without any authority to speak for anybody.  I referred to the sentiment of patriotism that moved men at great personal sacrifice to fight for this country years ago.  Most of them are gone.  Most of them are dead.  Some of them remain&mdash;a very few.  To those of us who were their colleagues they mention difficulties under which they labour now.  I break no confidence when I freely admit that in regard to some of them, those of us who are more fortunately circumstanced than they <Col N="934" /> have had to help from time to time. That was a pleasure and a privilege for those of us who could do it, though we would have preferred that those men should have enjoyed an independence which would deliver them from the necessity of accepting any benefaction, even from their most intimate friends and warmest admirers.  Their number is few.  There are a few who have left widows in circumstances of very acute distress.  They are a rapidly diminishing number.  Neither they, nor I on their behalf, have ever asked anything from this State, nor do I now, but I do feel that in a Bill which makes provision for everybody who took part in the struggle, an option should be left to them, if their circumstances demand it, to turn to our Government and get such assistance as might make it possible for them to end their days in modest comfort.  It may not be possible for their friends to meet the circumstances as they have in the past, and it would be very bitter knowledge to us that any of them should find themselves confronted with real and inescapable destitution.</P>
    <P>I cannot think that anybody would wish to deny them the security which such an offer would make, and, therefore, I suggest to the House that if it is proposed to go forward with this Bill, provision should be made that any man who spent his life fighting for this country in the ranks of the Parliamentary Party, or as a parliamentary representative in any other Party which spoke on behalf of Nationalist Ireland between 1880 and 1918, should be entitled to consideration on the same lines as that provided for ex-Ministers, and that a consideration similar to that envisaged under Section 18 should be made available for his widow who survives.  The request is trivial.  Their number is small, and rapidly diminishing.  It is a request which I make with some hesitation. Frankly, I would prefer not have to make it at all, but circumstances demand that I should mention the matter, and I have no hesitation in doing so in the light of their services, because if ever men deserved well of this country, they are those who, without recompense of any kind and <Col N="935" /> without any hope of profit, rejected all offer of advancement, rejected the thousands of bribes that were offered to buy them, and stood fast to the principles in which they believed, a sovereign and independent Ireland. Though they were rejected by the electorate of this country in a general election, I think many of them look back with pride now on the fact that those who rejected them have come to know that they were honourable servants of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill upon which it is quite possible for people to hold entirely divergent opinions, and to hold them conscientiously and honestly, and, realising that fact, the Labour Party has decided to allow this matter to be decided by the free vote of its members, so far as its attitude to this Bill and to the other Bill dealing with increases in Deputies' allowances is concerned.  I am, therefore, expressing at this stage my personal views on the Bill.  Deputy Dillon, having opened with a very high tribute to those who served the State since 1922, wound up on a note which warned us that this Bill was necessary to prevent the possibility of the growth of corruption here.  He told us of other countries where corruption has so vitiated honesty in public life that liberty and parliamentary government had been seriously menaced.  I do not regard this Bill as necessary to guarantee purity and honesty in Irish public life, and I do not believe that Ministers who have served this State, who do serve this State and who will serve this State in the future, will find it necessary to have cheques of the dimensions contemplated in the Bill to keep them honest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said before, and I want to make my position clear on this Bill now, that if any person serving the State in the capacity of a Minister does so for a substantial number of years, and, through that service either finds it necessary to abandon his private or professional employment, or suffers a loss as a result of that service, it is the merest justice on our part to try to make good to that person the loss which he or she has sustained in the <Col N="936" /> national interest.  We ought to recognise the value of that service to the State, and so far as it is possible for us, we ought to compensate the person who loses in the interest of the State, but in my view we are doing much more than that in this Bill.  We are here providing a pension of £300 per annum for life to a Minister who has served the State for three years.</P>
    <P>We had, during the discussion on this Bill, many references to the position of persons who had given the best years of their lives to the State.  This Bill does not grant pensions to those who gave the best years of their lives to the State; it provides for the payment of a pension of £300 per annum to a Minister who has served the State for a period of three years.  A Parliamentary Secretary who has served the State for less than four years will get a pension of £200 per annum.  When we talk, therefore, about providing pensions and compensation to persons who gave the best years of their lives to the State, let us remember that this Bill does not confine pensions to such persons, but that it opens up the possibility of pensions of £200 and £300 per annum for life to persons after relatively trifling service to the State.  If we want to make compensation to people who have served the State for a substantial number of years and who have suffered loss on that account, it is quite possible for us to evolve a scheme by which allowances, gratuities or pensions could be paid to such persons for a limited period in order to enable them to rehabilitate themselves in their private or professional employment.</P>
    <P>But are we doing that in this Bill? It is possible under the Bill for a person who has served as Minister for seven years to receive a pension of £500 per annum.  Let us know now what we are doing, and if we propose to do it, let us do it with our eyes open.  There are many persons serving the State at present in a Ministerial capacity who are now entitled to a pension of £500 per annum, having served for a period of seven years. Many of these people are not yet 40 years of age, and for that seven years' service to the State we are going to <Col N="937" /> pay them a pension at the rate of £500 per annum for another 25 or 30 years. If that person could show, or if from our examination of the position we believe that he has suffered certain losses by serving the State, I, for one, am prepared to make generous restitution to him, but I am not prepared to stand for a Bill which provides a pension of £500 per annum for life to a person of 40 years of age after a short period of service, measured in the Bill as seven years.</P>
    <P>Those who want to support this Bill, and those who tell us that these allowances are only reasonable&mdash;that they are a necessary insurance premium on the continuance of honesty and the avoidance of corruption&mdash;might tell us in what other service in this country or outside this country: in what other service in any other comparable State in the world, is it possible to get pensions of £500 a year after seven years' service, or £300 a year after three years' service.  We are now setting up in this State by this Bill a specially privileged Ministerial pensioner class. We are going to make it easier for them to get pensions on this generous scale than it is for any other citizen in the country to get pensions.</P>
    <P>This Bill, we may be told, is founded on the recommendations of the committee that dealt with the question of salaries and allowances; but, after a very careful consideration of all the issues involved, that committee recommended that no pension should be paid to parliamentary secretaries on the grounds that parliamentary secretaries had not reached the plane of responsibility that justified them in being put into the category of Ministers. But, notwithstanding the fact that the committee recommended that there should be no pensions paid to parliamentary secretaries, we find in this Bill pensions provided for parliamentary secretaries&mdash;if they have served for three years, £200 per annum; and if they have served for seven years, £333 per annum.  I do not know on what grounds it can be contended that a parliamentary secretary elevates himself to such an important position in public life that he cannot resume whatever private or professional appointment he had prior to his <Col N="938" /> elevation to the rank of a parliamentary secretary.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in this Bill to which I would like to make a personal reference.  It is the one which provides for an allowance of £800 per annum to the leader of the second party, and £500 per annum to the leader of the third party in the Dáil. So far as I am concerned, as one who would be entitled to benefit under that section, I do not want to handle one farthing of that sum of money, and I do not propose to handle one farthing of it.  What the leaders of Parties in the Dáil want is not an allowance but some assistance to enable them to discharge their parliamentary duties.  The leader of a Party is placed in a position where he must express the viewpoint of his Party; to consider and examine Bills with possibly greater care and detail than the ordinary members of the Party.  He needs secretarial assistance in that capacity.  He needs the assistance of somebody capable of reading a Bill, and of getting up material relevant to an informed discussion on a Bill.  That assistance is, at present, unfortunately, not provided, either by Party headquarters or by the State. A contribution which would lead to a detailed examination of the provisions of Bills is a valuable contribution to parliamentary work in this House and to this country.  I would very much prefer if, instead of allowances to leaders of Parties, the State were to recognise an obligation to provide secretarial and research assistance of that kind which, I think, would be much more valuable to the leaders of Parties and much more useful in the matter of making an informed contribution in this House, than the provision of allowances such as are contemplated in Section 9 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>My general complaint, however, against the Bill is that it is excessively generous in the matter of granting pensions: that it provides pensions for short periods of service and on a basis not experienced in any other walk of life in this country.  I think we are far too generous in the amount of the pensions, far too generous in the duration of the pensions, and that we are singling out for specially generous <Col N="939" /> treatment in this regard a very small section of the community while tens of thousands of people in the community cannot get their economic and financial difficulties listened to with the same ease, the same understanding and the same sympathy as has been bestowed on the recipients under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a few words on this Bill.  I am opposed to the paying of pensions to Ministers or ex-Ministers.  I, like many other speakers who have spoken here to-day, realise that perhaps in certain cases just recompense should be paid to men who have given the best days of their life for the country's good, and who have given up their way of making a livelihood for themselves and their families.  What I do realise is that the country has been taught in the wrong way, perhaps, because there were men who gave their services to the country free of charge for over 50 years.  That happened.  Perhaps people have now come to think that when we have here a Government of our own that that responsibility of the country is finished.  Well, that apparently is not so since we find that this Bill is being introduced.  I suppose I should say that I believe it is justifiable to make up to a Minister who has given the best days of his life for the good of the country.  That may be so in certain cases.  On the Committee Stage I would like to have this thing fully inquired into.  I would like, for instance, to see some kind of committee set up that would investigate special cases that need attention; but as for this system of pouring out pensions of hundreds of pounds to able-bodied men, I think it is a disgrace. I think it ill befits any Government, or any ex-Minister to accept such a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, people come in here and take up the duties of their office for the sake of the country.  They get a salary, and in my opinion that salary should be a good one to compensate them for leaving whatever walk of life they were in.  At the same time, I do not think it is quite the thing for a <Col N="940" /> man to come in here and take a good salary, and then at the end of his time to find this magnificent pension waiting for him.  As the last speaker said, he might get that pension at the early age of 40 years.  I do not think it is fair to the ordinary taxpayer in the country.  The ordinary taxpayer, the man who is bearing the burden of the taxes levied in the country, has no pension to look forward to at the age of 60.  During all his life he has been striving to earn enough to provide for his wife and children and, after his death, for his widow and dependents.</P>
    <P>I think we are accepting this thing too lightly.  It has not been examined with sufficient care, in my opinion.  I think that if we all speak our minds truthfully, honestly and sincerely, we will agree that this whole business ought to be examined carefully.  I presume that it will be, on the Committee Stage.  If there are necessitous cases, then let a pension be given&mdash;but let it be a nominal one and not one of hundreds of pounds, and certainly not £500 a year to a man who has given perhaps seven years' service.  Seven years is not a very long period.  There are men in this country who have been working for 50 years and have no pension coming to them.  Everything that one takes up is a venture, whether it is farming, a business or a profession. After all, if you do take up a position in public life, if you decide to become a Minister, then I say you must be prepared to take it for what it is worth.  You must be prepared to understand that the country expects something from you, and that you must be prepared to shoulder your responsibilities just the same as the ordinary taxpayer, and that you cannot expect to be put in a privileged position.  You cannot be relieved from the obligation of providing for your wife and family.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I think the commission has been extra generous in apportioning such large pensions to young able-bodied men.  The question is where are all these pension schemes going to end in this country.  Everybody at the present time is drawing a pension of one kind or another.  The people are being taxed out of existence. <Col N="941" /> Every other day we have Bills being introduced here which are putting additional burdens on the taxpayers. We hear a great deal about this&mdash;that it would only mean a small amount, but where is it going to end? In the case of an ex-Minister it may go on for 40 years or for a much longer period in the case of his widow and children, if they are to be provided for.  I would ask that the whole matter be carefully looked into.  If, as I have said already, there are necessitous cases, then let some kind of a committee be appointed to look into them. The proposal here is to grant £500 a year to an ex-Minister after seven years' service.  After all, seven years is a very short period of time to give to the service of one's country.  Again, I want to ask the House to realise that the country cannot afford to keep on paying pensions.  I ask Deputies to realise that this committee has been far too generous in apportioning such large pensions to ex-Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.  I think in justice everybody will say that there are certain cases that are probably necessitous and that pensions are needed, but, on the whole, I think it is a bad precedent to set up here.  We are setting up a precedent that a body of men just after three years in office should find themselves ready and qualified to draw pensions from the State.  The people are getting sick of these pensions. They are losing confidence in us. The people who sent us here, as their representatives, think we are too much engaged in providing for our own future and not thinking much about the needs of the ordinary people and their future.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, ask that I be allowed, on the Committee Stage, to put forward something in the way of amendments to this measure.  We should call a halt to these pensions.  I believe that in this House there are many others equally opposed to this measure as I am, but who do not feel like expressing their views in that way. I want to say that I think we have been too generous.  Generosity is a good fault but not in dealing with other people's money.  I would ask the Minister on Committee Stage to redraft the <Col N="942" /> Bill.  I know there are many people who will have suggestions to offer on this measure.  There is one thing every member of this House should keep in view and that is rather than introduce new pension schemes we should cut down the old ones.</P>

      <P>As far as this side of the House is concerned, I am afraid there will be very little opposition to the principle of the Bill so far as ministerial salaries are concerned, because it enshrines very little that is new.  But when we come to the question of pensions, I should say that that portion of the Bill has been very crudely drawn up and the drafting has not shown sufficient discrimination when dealing with those to whom pensions are to be given.  With regard to the amounts of the pensions, to my mind they are rather on the generous side.  No conditions seem to be laid down.  What I mean by conditions is the fact that there are no restrictions as to what personal resources a man may have after leaving office.  That is to say, no restriction is put upon a man's own financial position.  As the Bill stands, it would be possible for a man after leaving office to fill either an important commercial or industrial position in the State.  He could fill a high position in a semi-State capacity such as chairman of the Currency Commission or chairman of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Bill makes that quite clear.  He could not draw a pension then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I know he cannot draw a double pension, but he could draw a salary and still have a pension.  At all events, the Bill as it stands does not make it clear that a man may not be in independent circumstances, holding some position, semi-State or otherwise, in an industrial or commercial undertaking, and still draw a pension. He may be a comparatively young man; he may be able to take up a big position outside and still, as an ex-Minister, <Col N="943" /> draw a big pension.  At the moment we have an ex-Minister on the judicial bench, and under the Bill as it stands it would still be possible for him to draw a ministerial pension and fill the position of judge at the same time.  I see nothing in the Bill that would prevent that being done.  These are a few of the snags in the Bill.  I see much necessity for a pension scheme of this kind.  The general principle is one that I can, within certain restrictions, commend.  No matter how much anybody may speak against pensions, I am aware that there have been cases of hardship which none of us would like to see.  None of us wants to see that any Minister who, in a self-sacrificing way, gave service to this State, should be deprived of the means of living or that he should find himself in a state of penury.  A person at the age of 40 or 50 years, after serving as a Minister, may find it difficult to start in another way of living.  He himself and his dependants should be preserved from penury and want, and there should be some assurance that they would be above financial difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not, however, think that the pension portion of this Bill has been properly conceived.  I recommend to the Minister that, on Committee Stage, he should have amendments brought in and that, in fact, he would re-draft that whole portion of the measure.  As the Bill stands, it is very badly drafted. There is a committee of three persons appointed to deal with qualifications. But the only qualifications on which they have to decide is his holding of ministerial office.  They do not decide as to the person's need for the pension. I think power should be given to this committee to function in such a way as to inquire into the means.  There should be a test as to whether the person really needed the pension.  The pension should not be given if it is not needed.  If the pension is needed the requirements of the particular person should be very carefully looked into. I again appeal to the Minister to have these particular points elaborated when the Bill is going through Committee and to make it clear that it is only the person who needs a pension who will <Col N="944" /> get it.  I am in agreement with the spirit of the Bill.  I think it is a good Bill and a very necessary one.</P>
    <P>I do not at all cavil with the salaries paid to Ministers.  I do not want to find fault with the Government because of the fact that at one time they thought that Ministers were too well paid.  A good man is worth his salary.  Too many people in this country are inclined to fall into the ten shilling mind.  Many people think they ought to get a first-class engineer for the wages of a village carpenter.  If we want to have important positions in this country filled by men with good brains we should be prepared to pay these men adequately.  Ministers have always done their work honestly.  I do not think there is any fear that at any time people holding the important positions of Ministers and Secretaries will give way or become a prey to corruption. I think we will always be above that.  We have been above it up to this.  A man who gives service to his country and does it in a self-sacrificing way should be well paid.  I think in the future that men serving in a ministerial or secretarial capacity will not depart from the line that has been followed up to the present.  In the future the running of this country will be looked upon more as a business proposition than as a patriotic one. The best patriotism perhaps is founded on business lines.  By paying them a decent salary we will get good men, we will get good results and the country will be satisfied that it is getting good value for the money.  I again appeal to the Minister to have this whole Bill recast in Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>In what I have to say I will not detain the House much longer. I am one of those who believe that the labourer is worthy of his hire.  I quite agree with the last speaker on that point, but when it comes to pensioning a man for his lifetime after he does three years' service, I think it is rather too much for the country.  We thought some years ago when a change of Government came about that the country was really going to change and that our taxation was going to be reduced, but instead of that it has been multiplied many times.  I think that <Col N="945" /> granting a pension to a person after a few years' service, as recommended in this Bill, is totally absurd and there is no justification for it.  The man who takes up a position as a Minister should be well paid.  I do not think the salary in this case is overdone.  Indeed, I would be inclined to give more than that.  A man who takes up a position as Minister in this House has to devote a lot of time to public work.  He has to spend not only his days, but often his nights here attending to the requirements of the House.  A man in public life outside getting the same salary would be finished at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  Here Ministers very often have to spend until 11 o'clock.  That is very hard and trying and I think they should be extra well paid.</P>
      <P>When it comes to giving a man a pension after three years' service, that is nothing short of absurd.  Deputy Dillon said that the whole cost would be £9,000.  It might be £9,000 for this year, but to what amount would it accumulate?  Suppose we have a new Minister every five years, in the course of time it will reach an absurd figure. How do people in public life in the country fare?  Take the case of a dispensary doctor.  There is a regular hullaballoo if he gets a pension a few years short of his time.  I am appealing at the moment for a man who is dying in harness.  He cannot get a pension; he cannot get any compensation. I would be inclined to pay Ministers well, but the idea of giving men pensions after three years' service is too absurd.  Some person said that the average man would live for 30 years afterwards.  Thirty years at £500 a year would amount to £15,000.  That is not fair, particularly when you consider the position of the farmers, some of whom have the greatest difficulty in making ends meet.  Many of them have been trying to pay their annuities and their rates and they find it extremely difficult to do so.  It is unreasonable to put this extra burden upon them when they are quite unable to pay their way in other directions. It is for those reasons that I will oppose this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to deal with the point raised by Deputy Cogan, that this proposal has <Col N="946" /> not been before the country.  I have already read the statement made by the Taoiseach in the House, in February, 1937, in which he stated that a committee would be set up to consider this question of the salaries paid to the holders of public office and that, when that committee reported, the report would be brought here to the Dáil for consideration and decision.  There was an election in June, 1937, and during that election one of the questions which was canvassed before the country was this proposal to deal with the salaries of public office holders and the provisions to be made for their future.  In fact, when the matter was raised in the House, the question, not merely of considering the salaries to be attached to these offices, but also the desirability of giving those who had held ministerial office more security for the future, was mooted for consideration. That question was mooted here, and was embodied in the terms of reference of this committee.  The matter was canvassed in the newspapers, up and down the country, and in this House, and if Deputy Cogan has been unaware of it, perhaps, because he has not read the newspapers, that is no reason why he should ascribe equal ignorance and unawareness to every other person in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know there is no substance in what Deputy Cogan has said.  If there is one proposal which has been before the country for a considerable time, it is this one and, with this proposal before them at two general elections, the people of the country returned the Party and the Government which made itself responsible for initiating the matter.  Why did the Government take that step?  Because, having taken responsibility for submitting a new Constitution to the country, it had to consider how best the organs of government set up under that Constitution could be permitted to function in the manner in which those who drafted the Constitution and the people who accepted it hoped they would function: that is to say, so as to give the country good and clean government.  That is the primary problem which democracies have to face.  There are governments <Col N="947" /> elsewhere, some of them good and some of them bad, but there is one thing that I can say, and that is that bad and corrupt government is more often associated with cheap government than otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is well known that there are many countries, many States in the world, which pay their representatives, their Ministers of State, very much less than the committee recommended, possibly less even than is proposed in this Bill. There are countries which make no provision for the future of their Ministers, but I think it will be found as regards the person who holds office in those States, that it would be the exception if he died a poor man.  I do not for a moment allow myself to be put into the position in which Deputy Broderick said I put myself.  I do not for a moment contend that you should bribe a man to be honest; but I do say this, that, unless you make proper provision for those who have to carry the responsibilities of State in this country, you may find it very difficult to get honest men to accept those responsibilities and to accept the disabilities which the holding of Ministerial office, in particular, imposes upon an individual.</P>
    <P>We have heard it said here that this Bill is all right so far as the salaries go.  I think there are people on both sides of the House who, in private life, earned higher salaries than they are earning now, and I am sure it will be admitted that, in comparison with the salaries which are paid in the commercial sphere and the incomes which may be earned in the professional sphere, the salaries proposed in this Bill are moderate.  It was found previously, and certainly it was found during the period from 1932 to 1937, that the reduced salaries drawn were quite insufficient to enable a Minister to meet all the demands upon him.  I understand that those who had experience in the previous ten years found themselves in the same position, even with the salaries proposed in the present Bill. Therefore it is clear that if the position is that the present figure is the minimum which would allow a Minister <Col N="948" /> to meet all the demands that are made upon him&mdash;and there are many demands not apparent to the public made upon a Minister&mdash;if that sum is just sufficient to enable him to meet all the demands made upon him, it certainly does not permit him to make any provision for the future.</P>
    <P>What is a Minister called upon to do when he assumes office? First of all, he has got to make a complete break with his previous career.  We have heard it said here that there would perhaps be young, able-bodied men of 40 going out and drawing pensions under this Bill.  I should like to contest that straightaway. I do not know that there are any Ministers under 40.  I do not know that there are any ex-Ministers under 40.  Therefore, so far as the question of the age at which a person may become entitled to a pension is concerned, we may rule out that figure straight away.  Even if there were Ministers going out at 40 years of age, what is the position?  Here is a person of, I should say, exceptional talent and ability&mdash;because he would be an exceptional man who, in the circumstances of the future, would be called to public office at so young an age as 40&mdash;here is that man asked to accept the responsibility for administering one of the great Departments of State &mdash;a Department where he has a great deal of power and a great deal of influence, and therefore a Department which imposes upon him great responsibilities towards the public.  He is asked to assume those responsibilities and all the worry, all the toil, all the envy, all the criticism and all the ill-feeling, mind you, which those responsibilities involve.  He is asked to assume those responsibilities, and to assume them at a salary which would be much less than commensurate responsibilities or proportionate responsibilities would carry in ordinary private life.  But not merely is he asked to do that, but he is asked to do it with the knowledge that he is merely going to be, so to speak, a tenant at will, for he has no security of tenure.  When we talk of people employed in a similar situation elsewhere, not merely do we think of the salary which that post carries, but we also have the feeling <Col N="949" /> that if a person once is appointed to a post of that sort and is placed in that sort of predominant position, then so long as he fulfils the duties of that post with ordinary zeal and ability, he will have a life tenure of the post; he will not be put into it to-day and be subjected possibly to eviction from it to-morrow.  Therefore, the person called to ministerial office not merely has to carry heavy responsibilities, and carry them at what would be regarded as less than the normal salary, but he has absolutely no security in that office.  He may be there for one year, two years, three years or four years. A question of great public policy may arise which will compel him to relinquish the office before he is in it 12 months.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, all this element of insecurity, but not merely that; the moment he is in office he has got to cut himself adrift from all his former avocation.  He has got to do that if you are going to have clean government in this country and if you are not going to have a Minister for Industry and Commerce who will be, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, seeing how his legislative proposals are going to affect his business down the country, in the City of Dublin or in the City of Cork or elsewhere; or if you are not going to have a Minister for Finance seeing how the fiscal proposals which he brings before the Dáil are going to affect his business, profession, or avocation.  The fact of the matter is that the moment a man becomes a Minister he has to make a new career.  So far as I can see, he has to break definitely and finally with his former career.  I think that was the experience of our predecessors. That certainly has been my experience and it is only out of personal experience that one can talk about these things.  He has to break definitely and finally with his old avocation and start on a new career. Therefore, it is not after three years' service, it is not after four years' service or five years' service as a Minister, that you are asked to give this pension but because you know that a Minister wound up one life when he became Minister and had to start a new one <Col N="950" /> afresh, and that, when he leaves office, he will have to try and restart life again for the third time.  How can a man do that?  How can a man with family responsibilities, with a household to maintain, with commitments that have accumulated during the period that he has been a Minister, do that unless special provision is made for him?</P>
    <P>You are taken completely out of one sphere into another when you become a Minister.  You meet quite a different set of people.  You have to be ready to meet them.  You have to provide yourself with a house in which you can receive them, and you have to involve yourself in a thousand and one responsibilities and expenses that you never would contemplate if you were a private individual.  Then, suddenly, you are to restart life again&mdash;according to some Deputies here, you are to restart life for the third time, having passed the meridian, having passed middle age.  Remember, there are few Ministers who are not bordering on 50.  There are few ex-Ministers who are not bordering on 50 or past 50. Moreover if, by reason of the revolutionary movement and of the history here since 1916.  Young men were called to ministerial office, that is not going to be the position for the future.  In future, it is not going to be young men of 30, 35 and 40 who are going to occupy these benches but it is men who will have grown grey in the service of the Dáil, who will have spent years in that service.  Most of us, on both sides of the House, have already spent over 20 years in public life.  Those who come here in future as Ministers will at least have to give as long an apprenticeship as we have had to give.  It will not be a case of giving pensions to young men of 40, after a few years' service, but to mature men who have had to put their own careers behind them and who will not be in a position, as you have been told here they should be, to go out and take up an ordinary commercial career or an ordinary professional career.  It is to meet the position in which these men may find themselves&mdash;and will find themselves, if they are honest men&mdash;that the pensions provision in this Bill has been introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> Mark you, I said, if they are honest men, because that is the kernel of the whole situation.  Undoubtedly, as Deputy Broderick said, you cannot bribe men to be honest, but there is one thing about it&mdash;if you attach such conditions to the public service as will make it impossible for men to accept ministerial office and fulfil the responsibilities of that office, unless they are prepared absolutely to sacrifice themselves and their families and to find themselves at the end of a term of office with the prospect of having to go around with the hat to their friends asking them to help them to get on their feet again or cadging to get a job from some person or another, then you will not get men of capacity and you will not get honourable men to accept public responsibility under those conditions.  That is what is going to happen.  You will not get honest men and you will not get honourable men and men of capacity to accept office and help to form a Government under those conditions.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say that there are not in this Dáil many men who would just as easily fill my portfolio as I fill it.  I am not going to say that there are not people in this House and outside this House who could not fill it quite as capably, but I wonder how many of them would be prepared to fill it under such conditions as have been laid down by certain Deputies in this House; that having, as the Minister for Finance has, control and supervision over the expenditure of £34,000,000 of public money, having had to carry a very heavy burden and responsibility, and having cut himself adrift absolutely from every other avocation he would, at the end of his term of office, have to go out and start life anew.  How many men of even average intelligence and average ability, with any sense of family responsibility, would accept ministerial office under those conditions?</P>
    <P>As I say, there are any amount of people who could fill the office, but how many men will you get to accept it under those conditions in the future? If you do not get first-class men, if you do not even get second-class men, <Col N="952" /> is the position going to be that, for the sake of £9,000 a year, or even twice that amount&mdash;it might be for the sake of £18,000&mdash;the people are going to be content with third-class government, or fourth-class or even fifth-class government, even if it should be honest government at the end of that time?  That is really the kernel of this Bill: that because of the fact that you want your Ministers to be in a position to discharge the responsibilities of their office, completely and entirely independent of personal interest, they must first of all cut themselves adrift from their own ordinary private avocations in order to serve the State and that, when they have come in here and have served the State to the best of their ability for such a period as would mean that their former professional connections would be altogether severed, you must then at any rate ensure that they and their families will not be reduced to complete penury and want.</P>
    <P>That is one reason why the pension provision is in this Bill, but there is another reason.  Undoubtedly, the most useful people in public life, in Opposition as well as in Government, are those who have had experience of ministerial office.  I have no doubt that when, in the course of time, some of us find ourselves in Opposition, when some of us go back there, we will be better in Opposition because of our previous experience here.  I have no doubt that if members of the former Administration had full time to devote themselves, as they ought to be enabled to do in the public interest, to public affairs here in this country, we would have a first-rate Opposition. Now, I do not want to be throwing bouquets any more&mdash;I would very much prefer to throw bricks at the Opposition&mdash;but in any case it is quite clear that a person is a better critic of governmental office himself and consequently knows what the requirements and limitations of public office are.  I have pointed out what is the position, from a personal point of view, of the individual who has held public office. Now let us consider what is the position from the point of view of the State.  Is it not quite obvious that if <Col N="953" /> such a man has held public office, and if the people compel him to relinquish office, they ought to make it easy for him to continue in public life?</P>
    <P>Now I want to say, in regard to the pension provisions of this Bill, that it is not a fact that people will get these pensions as a matter of course.  First of all, persons have to apply for these pensions, and not merely that, but since the pensions are a charge on the Central Fund, the particulars as to the recipients of the pensions and so on will be printed and published in the ordinary Financial Accounts.  Of course, there are people who, when they get out of office, may be more fortunate than others, but so far they have been the exception.  There are some who are fortunate enough to fall on their feet, but mainly it will be found to be those who have cut themselves altogether adrift from public life and who, having envisaged what was likely to be the fate of former Ministers in this country if no proper provision was made for them, decided that henceforward, instead of looking after public affairs and serving the public good, they were going to look after themselves.  There are one or two people, as I say, who having retired altogether from politics, have been fortunate enough to fall on their feet, but we may be quite certain that those people who are in an independent position are not going to come along and apply for a pension, thereby holding themselves up to the public odium of applying for a pension when it is well known that they are in comfortable circumstances.</P>
    <P>That is the protection you have in this Bill to ensure that its provisions will not be abused.  I should hate it to go forth, however&mdash;and one of the purposes of the Bill would be defeated if it should go forth&mdash;that the fact that you have to apply for a pension is going to deter any ex-Minister, who wishes to remain in public life, from applying for a pension which would enable him to give more effective service to the people here in the Dáil. That is not what we want.  We want, on both sides of the House, men of experience and men of first-hand knowledge of the various problems; and we cannot get that in this country of ours, <Col N="954" /> where most of the people who man the public offices are men of limited means, unless the State makes up its mind that, as their services are essential to the State, it is going to put them in a position to render these services, if need be.  That is why I hope, and sincerely hope, that no person will be deterred&mdash;no person who feels that he can render good service in public affairs will be deterred&mdash;by anything that has been said here from applying for a pension if this Bill goes through, because, otherwise the effect would be to defeat the secondary purpose of this Bill, which is to make it possible for men of experience to continue their public services when they have reached such an age as to make it impossible for them to devote attention at the same time to their private concerns and to the affairs of the Dáil and of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Another part of the Bill which has been criticised is the provision which is being made for an allowance to enable the leaders of Parties other than the Government Party to meet their secretarial expenses.  Now, I think Deputy Norton quite misunderstood the purpose of that provision. Deputy Norton said that, speaking as one who was personally affected by this Bill, as one who would be entitled to benefit under the Bill, he would have nothing to do with it; but he completely misconceived the position. This allowance is being voted, not that the leader of the second largest Party in the Dáil, or the leader of the third largest Party in the Dáil, should personally benefit by it, but that his whole group&mdash;the groups which these leaders lead&mdash;and the Dáil and the country as a whole, should benefit by it.  It is given in order that they may provide themselves with that very assistance which Deputy Norton said was necessary in order to enable these Parties to fulfil their proper function in this House, namely, the function of examining and criticising every proposal that is put before the Dáil.  That is where the effectiveness of Parliamentary Government comes in.  That is what distinguishes representative democracy from the system which prevail elsewhere&mdash;that the critic has a <Col N="955" /> useful function in the State; that it is one of the primary duties of those who are not in the Government Party, of those who do not support the general policy of the Government, to criticise the proposals which the Government is submitting.  And the country expects them to carry out that function and to discharge that duty.  The purpose of those two paltry allowances of £800 and £500 is to enable those Parties and those groups which are charged with that function to discharge it more efficiently and more effectively.  Of course, it is anticipated that it will be utilised for the purpose of providing secretarial assistance, for the purpose even of providing the professional advice which is necessary in order properly to criticise a complicated measure.  While it is true that when we were in Opposition we did that without any grant, nevertheless I should say quite frankly that that was a severe strain on our Party, and particularly upon those who were charged with the primary responsibility of advising the Party as to what its policy should be in regard to certain measures.  It is a strain which, I think, so long as we accept the system of representative democracy, ought not to be imposed on private individuals and it involves an expense which they should not be called upon to bear out of their private purse.</P>
    <P>Those allowances may be criticised on the grounds that they do not go far enough, that they are small and insecure; but I say it is an experiment and we have got to see how it works. But certainly it is no substitute for those allowances to suggest, as Deputy Norton suggested, that the Government, out of Government funds, ought to provide public servants to do that work.  Now, there is one thing you have got to be quite certain about, and that is that every civil servant can serve only the Government of the day. You cannot have, in any Government Department, three sections&mdash;one section looking after the Government side of a Bill, the second section looking after the interests of the second largest Party in the House, and the third section looking after the interests <Col N="956" /> of the third largest Party in the House.  It would be quite impossible to run our State upon such a basis. The Civil Service and civil servants can have only one loyalty, and that is to the Administration of the day. Therefore it would not be possible for us to second members of Government Departments to go and help the leader of the Opposition when he is criticising the leader of the Government, or the leader of the third Party when he is criticising both the leader of the principal Opposition Party and the leader of the Government at the same time.</P>
    <P>The only way in which you can get over this problem, and provide what Deputy Norton admits he requires, is by saying to each of the responsible leaders of those Parties: &ldquo;We will give you a small sum, £800 in one case and £500 in the other, and let you select and employ for yourselves the persons whom you think are best fitted to advise and help you.&rdquo;  That gives to them the maximum liberty of choice within the limits which are imposed upon them by the sums which are allocated for that purpose.  But let me repeat, and let me emphasise that it would be quite wrong to consider those allowances as some personal perquisite of the leaders of those Parties.  Of course, the leaders of the Parties, because they carry the primary responsibility, will naturally decide in what manner that money is going to be disbursed, and we are not going to interfere with their discretion, but it would be a great mistake to imagine that either Deputy Norton or any other Deputy is entitled to regard this as some personal benefit conferred upon himself.  It would be quite wrong, and it would be a grave injustice to himself to the members of his Party, and to the members of the other Opposition Party, if he for one moment were to lead the public to believe that those allowances were intended to confer personal benefits upon the Deputies who for the time being happen to be leaders of the second and third Parties in the House.  The Deputy, therefore, was talking quite beside the book.  If his Party wants the facilities which he said are necessary in order to enable <Col N="957" /> it to do their job properly here, the only way in which they can be provided &mdash;and I think that the public purse should make some contribution towards the provision of them&mdash;is the way which we have laid down here in the Bill.  In the course of his speech Deputy O'Higgins referred to a number of matters.  I can only say I will give to all those matters serious consideration, as indeed I shall give to everything said here for and against the Bill, but it has to be remembered that this matter ought to be discussed entirely independently of the personalities involved.  It has not been an easy job for me&mdash;any more than I am sure it has been an easy job for the people in the Opposition who have supported this Bill and accepted the principle of it&mdash;to bring in this Bill.  It has not been an easy job.  It was a most invidious thing to bring it in here, but somebody had got to face up to this problem, and somebody had to ensure as far as he could that those who are called upon to serve the State <Col N="958" /> will be able to enter into the responsibilities of ministerial office with the assurance that at the end of that period, when they go out of office, they will not have to go around begging favours of any man.  If some members of the House feel that that is not a sound principle, let them face up to the other side.  Let them say whether they want the position to be this: that a person will enter the Government of the State, will accept responsibility for a big public Department, and during the whole of his period of office have this in front of him, that, at the end of the time, whether he be 40, or 50 or 60 years of age, whether he has served three, or five or seven years, he is going to be beholden for the future to some one citizen or other of this State for the very bread which he eats, and the clothes which he puts on his children's backs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was explaining on the last day of this debate that the setting up of this commission is, in the opinion of the majority of farmers, a means of shelving the issue, of enabling the Government to evade their responsibility for doing justice to the agricultural community.  A number of Deputies have dealt with this motion, <Col N="961" /> and it has been claimed that my action in declining to withdraw my motion was delaying the setting up of this commission.  If those Deputies who spoke in this strain were sincere, they would, in order to facilitate the setting up of this commission, have avoided taking any further part in the debate. But I, for one, do not accept the view that my action in refusing to withdraw my motion had any such effect.  I hold that if the Government had come to a decision to set up a commission that there was absolutely nothing to prevent them from going ahead with the setting up of the commission.</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, we were to accept the view that, because a motion dealing with agriculture was before the House, a commission could not be set up, it would follow that, when this commission has been set up this House will be debarred from discussing any question in relation to agriculture.  I presume that is the intention of those who are so strenuously advocating the setting up of the commission.  They want to have all questions connected with agriculture shelved completely.  So far as I am concerned, I hold that there are questions connected with agriculture which cannot be shelved.  In fact, the whole position with regard to agriculture cannot be shelved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only to-day I received a letter from a farmer whose entire stock of cows had been seized in respect of annuities. He was left with only one old cow. That farmer was supplying milk to the City of Dublin.  How is that farmer to carry on his business while the commission is in session?  How is he to continue for the next four or five years? In this particular case the man is a struggling farmer who owed money to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and under pressure paid that money. He owed rates, and under pressure from the rate collector, met the demand for rates.  Then, on top of that, the Land Commission came down and demanded their pound of flesh. They demanded the full arrears due, and insisted upon collecting them by seizing his entire stock and putting him completely out of business.  That farmer has absolutely no means of saving himself.  Many pitiful stories <Col N="962" /> have been told to-day about the condition of ex-Ministers and people of that kind, but there seems to be no sympathy whatever for an unfortunate farmer, with a wife and family depending on him, whose cows, upon which he is depending to earn his livelihood, are taken from him and probably will be sold for a small price, so that he will still be alleged to be in debt to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands, when dealing with this question of annuities, stated that a deputation, of which I was a member, waited on him and that he refused to fund the arrears over a number of years.  I think the Minister's recollection of what happened is a little at fault.  What really happened was that Deputy Moore and myself had an interview with the Minister, and we put up a case for the spreading of land annuities over a number of years. Deputy Moore made a very strong case in support of this claim.  He pointed out that a farmer who is at present in arrears might be in a position to pay his current annuity; that if his arrears were spread over a number of years, he might be in a position to pay something to the Land Commission.  But, when he is confronted with a demand for the entire arrears and faced with the fact of his entire stock being seized to meet that demand for arrears, he is put completely out of business and cannot pay the current annuities.</P>
    <P>What does the Land Commission or the State gain by seizing a farmer's entire stock and putting him completely out of business?  They cannot get money out of a derelict farm; they cannot get money out of starving children.  In this particular case which was brought to my notice to-day, one of the children is actually dying.  What use or benefit is it to the Government or to the State to press unfortunate farmers so severely?  Surely, they must realise, leaving out of consideration altogether the economic war or anything else, that since 1930 the farmers have passed through an abnormal period.  You have had an abnormal period of agricultural depression all over the world.  Even without considering what farmers were forced to sacrifice in connection with the dispute <Col N="963" /> with Great Britain, it ought to be recognised that the abnormal conditions through which farmers have passed entitle them to some measure of relief. Surely the minimum measure of relief would be the funding of arrears of annuities, and yet even that has been refused.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands said that he gave us a definite refusal.  I can say that the Minister did not give us a definite refusal.  He told us that he would sympathetically consider our demand, that he would have it investigated by his officials and would put it before his fellow Ministers.  I think that was not a definite refusal.  It was only afterwards that I was informed that the demand for a general funding of the arrears of annuities had been turned down.  The Minister, in his statement, offered, I think, to meet the claims of individuals in arrears if they were brought before him and to make some concessions in regard to arrears.  That is not a business-like method of dealing with the question. It is not business-like to put the majority of the farming community&mdash; the majority are in arrears, to a certain extent&mdash;in the humiliating position of having to go hat in hand to the Minister or his officials and ask for some concession.  In view of the sacrifices the farmers have made during the past five or six years, the least the Government should do would be to have a general system of spreading the arrears over a number of years. That demand is contained in my motion and I think it is a very reasonable demand and one against which no fair-minded person could go.</P>
    <P>It might be said that numbers of farmers who could pay refused to pay. If there was any farmer who could pay, the intensive pressure brought to bear during the past year or two would have extracted any money he could possibly raise.  In the case I mentioned to-day, there was absolutely no means by which the farmer could raise money.  There was nobody to whom he could go for a loan.  He had already exhausted his credit completely in trying to meet the demands of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and <Col N="964" /> the rate collector.  The Minister for Agriculture has told us that the benefits derived from the halving of the annuities more than counterbalanced the refusal of the Government to meet the demand in regard to de-rating. A moment's consideration will show that that is not true.  Take the total amount of rates paid in 1932 or 1933 and the sum of less than £2,000,000 required for de-rating.  Surely nobody who knows anything about agricultural conditions would say that during the past five years the rates have not been doubled in most counties.  They have been more than doubled in County Wicklow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>They should be very near £2,000,000.  If the progress made in increasing the rates during the past three or four years continues, the rates will, in a few years, far outbalance not only the halved annuities but the total annuities.  It is quite clear that the policy of the State and of the Government is directed to increasing local expenditure in every direction.  There seems to be absolutely no means of checking that tendency.  We know that the local government franchise has been extended to every adult.  This means that in every county the ratepayers who are perhaps in a minority at present will be in an absolutely insignificant minority in the future. We must remember that the ratepayers are not the largest section of the community nor are they the most powerful or the most influential section.  They may have been 300 years ago when, as Deputy McGovern pointed out, rates were first introduced.  At present, we have a large- influential and ever-increasing section of the community who are, to a large extent, exempt from liability for local rates.  We have the official classes, the professional classes and, to a large extent, the commercial classes&mdash;an increasing section of the <Col N="965" /> community who are exempt from any contribution to the upkeep of local services.  These are the people who are for ever agitating for increased local expenditure, for better roads and better social services of every kind&mdash; simply because they have not to make any contribution to the upkeep of these services.  The whole system is antiquated and should be abolished as speedily as possible.  The first step to the abolition of that system is the derating of agricultural land, because agriculture and agricultural land are the chief victims of that system.  The greater part of the rateable valuation of every county is represented by agricultural land and it is only by de-rating agriculture that an important step will be taken towards the financing of local services on a sound basis.</P>
      <P>Everybody recognises that it is his duty to contribute to the upkeep of local as well as national services according to his means.  Surely it will also be recognised that if a man can possess an income of £5,000 and make no contribution to the upkeep of local services while a man whose family are hungry must make a contribution, the system is unsound.  The farmer to whom I referred to-day was left with only one old cow.  Some members of his family are ill and others are young and helpless.  If that man is compelled to contribute a large amount to the upkeep of local services while a person with a large income or pension is exempt, surely the whole system is rotten and should be abolished as soon as possible and a sound system of financing local administration introduced. I think it was Deputy McGovern who said that the intentions of the Minister for Agriculture were good.  Nobody will dispute that.  I should be prepared to go further and say that the Minister for Agriculture is incapable of either a malicious or mean intention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister for Agriculture has made many tremendous blunders with regard to agriculture.  He has been taken seriously to task in regard to the admixture scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has abandoned the admixture scheme, and he appears to be floundering from one blunder to another.  I understand that, when the admixture scheme was first suggested to the Minister, he did not altogether approve of it.  He said it was the best scheme he could think of at the moment.  Now, he has abandoned the admixture scheme and has publicly announced that anybody who grows oats or barley will grow it at his own risk&mdash;at the risk of failing to get a satisfactory market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if the Minister for Agriculture looked into this question a little more carefully he would see that he was inflicting a very grave injustice on people who cannot grow wheat.  He has suggested the growing of wheat as an alternative to the growing of oats. Had he considered the question more carefully, he would have seen that he was inflicting a grave injustice on the people whose land is not suitable for the growing of wheat.  Moreover, what is going to happen is this.  Perhaps next year, if a large quantity of oats is grown and there is no market for it, the farmers will be forced to give it away practically for nothing.  The result will be that possibly in the following year a very small acreage of oats may be sown and the price may be excessive.  That again may tend to increase production in the subsequent year, and thus you will have a violent fluctuation in acreage and in the price of oats and barley.  There is certainly <Col N="967" /> a limited market in this country for oats and barley.  If the Minister considered the question more carefully, I think he would have deemed it necessary to substitute some scheme for the admixture scheme.  In my opinion, there is only one solution that will meet the case, and that is that we should operate a system of State purchase of oats and barley.  Some Deputies might be inclined to criticise that suggestion a few weeks ago, but in view of the fact that the Deputy-Leader of the Opposition has taken up the position that the State is justified in entering very largely into industrial and commercial undertakings, I am sure that this suggestion will receive fair consideration from every section of the House.  There is absolutely no other means by which the price of oats and barley&mdash;and it may happen also in the case of wheat, in the near future&mdash; can be stabilised.  The State should take upon itself the task of providing storehouses or granaries through the country, and of collecting the surplus supplies of oats and barley.  These surplus supplies could be stored, and released on the market whenever required.  That is the only way by which prices can be stabilised.  The action the Minister has taken will only lead to violent fluctuations in the price of oats.  It is going to injure unfortunate farmers in occupation of inferior land who must grow oats and who may find themselves without a market for it.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Corry suggested that the only remedy for agricultural depression and the only hope for the agricultural industry lay in the drastic reduction of public expenditure.  I am afraid that to-day he has not practised what he preached, because he voted in favour of a Bill which was absolutely unnecessary, and which is calculated to increase public expenditure.</P>

Those who have control of the administration of the country's affairs must set a very definite headline before the officials of the country generally, in being satisfied with what perhaps is less than adequate for what they consider to be their needs.</P>

      <P>I have been subjected to a certain amount of criticism for raising the farmers' grievances in the form of a motion and for having continued this debate after it had been decided by the Whips of both political Parties to bring this debate to a conclusion on the last day.  As far as I am concerned, I have absolutely no use for Parties or Party Whips.  I do not believe in a system of Party government, or I do not believe in a system under which members are tied to support a political Party or to vote according as they are directed by their Party.  I believe that Deputies elected to this House come here as representatives of the people, and they should have a certain amount of freedom and liberty to advocate the rights of the people they represent.  They should be treated as ordinary human beings, given a certain amount of discretion, and not tied down as the Party bosses dictate.</P>

I must say that many members have spoken altogether in favour of the motion.  Deputy Fagan, I think, made a very strong case in support of the motion.  He made a very strong case in support of derating of agricultural land and in support of some relief in regard to the pressing burden of annuities.  I hope that when the question goes to a vote, he will vote in support of the motion.</P>

      <P>I accept Deputy Fagan's explanation, but the remarkable thing is that there is nothing in the amendment proposed by the Fine Gael Party in regard to arrears of annuities.  In my motion it is definitely stated that arrears of annuities should be funded. I think that anybody who has the interests of the farmer or the interests of the country at heart will not be prepared to oppose any of the suggestions contained in the motion which I have proposed.

If anybody asks about the farmers' position he will be told that the matter is receiving the consideration of a commission.  I do not think that is going to deceive anybody. The farmers have no objection to the Government setting up a commission, or as many commissions as they like, but they are not going to release the Government from their responsibilities towards agriculture.  They are going to insist and continue to insist on their demands being heard and considered. They are going to continue to agitate for their lawful rights, and they are quite entitled to do so, whether a commission is in session or not.  They are not going to accept the setting up of a commission as an answer to their claims.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan, I think, referred to the Banking Commission, and he seemed to have a very great opinion of the majority report of that commission.

      <P>The people of this country have absolutely no faith in commissions, and they are not going to be deceived by the commission which it is proposed to set up to inquire into agriculture.  The only hope for the improvement of the farmer's position lies in the farmers' own intelligent co-operation for the achieving of their rights.  There is no very difficult problem in connection with agriculture which requires a commission to sit down and solve over a period of years.  The whole question of agriculture revolves around the simple fact that the farmer is not getting sufficient for his produce to make the cost of production and enable him to live.  Deputy Dillon suggested that the solution of the farmer's problem lay in the reduction of his costs so that he will be able to sell his produce at the world market price and make a profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that the principal market for the produce of this country is the home and British markets jointly. <Col N="972" /> These two markets will absorb all that the agricultural industry can produce. I do not hold that the price which the farmer gets for his produce in the home market should be governed absolutely by the price that prevails in the British market.  I do not think that is a solution of the farmers' problem. Take the average price of agricultural produce at present.  It is slightly higher than in 1913, perhaps by 10 per cent.  Take, then, the average cost of production and you find that it is at least 100 per cent. higher, and, in some cases, 200 per cent. higher.  I should like to know how Deputy Dillon proposes to reduce the cost of production to the 1913 figure, because you must do that if you are going to leave the farmer any margin of profit.  I do not believe it can be done.  I do not believe you can force the agricultural labourer to accept the wages that he was prepared to accept in 1913, which was one-third of what it is to-day, and I do not think that any of the various items of expenditure on the farm can be reduced to the 1913 figure.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said about what has been called &ldquo;blind industrialism&rdquo; and I think it is time that the farmer's attitude towards industrial development generally should be made clear, because many people have got up in public places to speak on behalf of the farmer and have represented him as being opposed to industrial development in this country. The farmer is not opposed to industrial development.  It must be remembered that industrial development places a certain additional burden on the farmer.  Yet the farmer is not going to say: &ldquo;Because industrial development places a certain additional burden on my shoulders, I claim that industrial development should be discontinued and that any industries which have to be aided by the State, or by the general community, should be closed down at once.&rdquo;  I do not think the farmer would take that view, and that means that he is definitely in favour of continuing the industries at present in existence, and of endeavouring to advance still further in the direction of industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> Any attempt to put the farmer in the position of being hostile to the industrialist in this country is not in his interest.  He realises that the existence of this nation as a nation depends on the continuance of industries and their continued development and expansion; that the country cannot be absolutely dependent on agriculture alone, and that the industrial arm of this nation must be developed. Otherwise, you will have a lopsided. crippled nation and no farmer wants that.  He wants a well-balanced and properly developed nation and he is prepared, I think, to stand in with the Irish manufacturer in helping to achieve that ideal.  The State, on the other hand, must recognise that in its endeavour to establish new industries and extend existing industries, a certain burden is being placed on the farmer's shoulders.</P>
    <P>The farmer must be assisted to meet that burden.  There must be sound economic planning as between industrial and agricultural development. The farmer must not be compelled to face increased burdens for everything he has to buy, while at the same time only getting for his produce practically the same as he got in 1913.  He is now paying more than 100 per cent. over the 1913 prices for his requirements, while he is only getting 1913 prices for what he produces.  In those circumstances how can farmers hope to continue.</P>

      <P>The Government are making very generous allowances for themselves, their dependents and everybody remotely connected with them.  I hope they are prepared to listen to what I have to say with regard to the farmers' grievances.  The farmer's case is absolutely unanswerable. The agricultural population has declined.  The output of the agricultural industry has declined steadily during the past 30 years, or more, in spite of all that has been done by governmental action.  Tillage, which is supposed to be such a pet of the Government, has declined to an enormous extent.  I do not think that at any time in the history of agriculture has tillage been so unpopular as it is at present. That is an alarming state of affairs, and the Minister for Agriculture should take serious note of it.  Tillage has been pushed to such an extent, due largely to the fact that the market the farmer had was closed to him, that the fertility of the land has been exhausted. In that way farmers have suffered very severe losses.  The growing of wheat requires fertile land, but the land is now in such an impoverished condition, because of the intensification of Government policy, that it is not able to give any return. I think if the Minister makes inquiries he will find that the average yield per acre of millable wheat this year has been exceedingly low.  That shows that there is urgent need for the Government to come to the assistance of the farmers.  You cannot farm without capital.  A man requires capital to buy cattle, but that in general a man can grow wheat or beet without any capital has been proved, to the grief of thousands of farmers, to be false.  You cannot carry on tillage without ample capital, to provide manures, the best possible seeds, machinery and other implements required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea prevailed in this country many years ago, when control was in the hands of the landlord class, that the best way to improve land was to fertilise it with high rents.  I am afraid that in the minds of Ministers at the present <Col N="975" /> day the same idea seems to hold good.  They seem to think that the best way to get the farmer to get the most he can from his land is to impose on him high burdens by way of rates and taxes.  If you compel the farmer to exhaust his capital completely, then you are not leaving him in a position to improve the output of his farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to make the point that you are not going to get more out of the agricultural community by harassing and hunting those who are engaged in it.  Deputies know that if you turn a cow out into a field and send two logs after her, and if these keep chasing her around the field all day, she is not likely to produce a big pail of milk in the evening. That is the way the farmers are being treated.  They are being harassed by flying squads with various types of inspectors who come after them with smiles on their faces and some of them with processes in their pockets.  While you have that situation, you are not going to get a full output from agriculture. The great need at the present time is to get the last ounce of production out of every acre in the country, because it is that production that is going to support the whole population.  So far as I know, the League of Nations has no fund to provide pensions or other forms of assistance <Col N="976" /> for the farmers of the country. If this country is not able to produce enough wealth mainly out of the land to maintain its present population, then the present population are going to starve and die.  I hope there is not a Deputy in the House, who has the interests of agriculture at heart, who is prepared to vote against the motion.</P>

      <P>(a) The all-in cost of 10,134* houses eligible for contributions under Section 6 (1) (a) (i) of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, was £3,585,531; (b) the building cost of these houses was £3,060,428; (c) the amount of the all-in cost which is being borne by the Exchequer is £2,142,262; it should be understood <Col N="850" /> that the figures given at (a), (b) and (c) are compiled partly from exact information and partly from information that is, at this date, not fully complete.</P>
      <P>*The number of new houses, 12,021, mentioned in the question and given in reply to the Deputy's question on the 2nd instant was compiled from particulars given by the local authorities at the end of June last.  On subsequent examination of the claims for payment of contributions to annual loan charges it was found that the number of completed houses eligible for contributions under Section 6 (1) (a) (i) was 10,134.  The decrease in the number is counter-balanced by a corresponding increase in the number eligible for contributions under Section 6 (1) (a) (ii).</P>

      <P>A notice of intention to resume portion of the holding of Mark Mellett in the townlands of Gortanieran and Kilscohagh on the Ward estate for the purpose of relieving congestion was published by the Land Commission, but a petition against resumption was presented by the tenant.  The hearing of this petition has been deferred owing to difficulties of procedure arising out of a judicial decision concerning the powers of the Land Commission in regard to resumption.  Provision for the settlement of these difficulties is under consideration.</P>
