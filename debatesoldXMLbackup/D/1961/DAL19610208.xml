    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of jobs required each year to provide the objective of full employment.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether his statement that employment calculated on the basis of the average weekly number at work is now increasing at the rate of 9,000 a year, is intended to be a firm estimate of the actual number of new jobs provided between June, 1959 and June, 1960; what was the net increase in employment during this period; and the total number of new jobs required to provide work for those (1) leaving agriculture, (2) leaving schools and (3) at present unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Numbers 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>An estimate of the number of new jobs required in each year to maintain a full-employment situation would have to be based on a number of assumptions, such as:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the extent to which emigration due to non-economic causes might continue,</P>
      <P>(b)  the extent to which the number of persons occupied in agriculture might be expected to become stabilised and</P>
      <P>(c)  the extent to which improved employment opportunities in this country might attract home Irish workers who had previously emigrated.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that no reliable estimates under these headings are possible and that individual judgments regarding them may vary considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, some definition of full employment is necessary.  During the adjournment debate last December, I <Col N="4" /> mentioned that one authority on the subject defined full employment as a situation in which not more than 3% on average of the labour force was unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the difference between the number of those who finish their schooling each year and the number of persons annually leaving the labour force through death or retirement is roughly 25,000.  For a number of reasons, some proportion of those who finish their schooling would not enter the labour market.  From this figure, it would be safe to conclude that approximately 20,000 new jobs annually would maintain full employment, if the other factors which I have mentioned are left out of account. The attainment of a state of full employment assumes the employment of those at present unemployed.</P>
    <P>My statement that employment is now increasing at the rate of 9,000 annually was based on insurance stamp purchases in 1958, 1959 and to the latest available date in 1960.  It is not possible to calculate from such purchases the amount of insured employment at particular dates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the figure of 20,000 which the Taoiseach quoted assume that the rate of emigration will continue at the rate it has, say, during the past 10 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out, one has to make a number of assumptions and one of the questions that necessarily arise is the extent to which emigration due to non-economic causes might persist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wanted to ask the Taoiseach is this.  Is that related to the 20,000 he has just quoted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned all these points.  It will be appreciated that any calculations of this kind will not of themselves put anybody into a job.  I have been asked to estimate what we must achieve in order to bring about the objective of full employment. I did so.  It is clear from the information I have given in reply to the questions and the statement I made on the Adjournment debate that we must try to double our present rate of economic progress at least in order to bring about a situation of full employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach to what degree the Government's implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has been successful in combating unemployment and emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is satisfied at this stage that the Government's proposals, as outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> are adequate without revision to ensure the requisite expansion in the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to a similar question on March 23rd, 1960, the Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> does not purport to be a detailed plan based on pre-determined production targets but, rather, an outline of the more important contributions to economic development proposed to be made by the State, the underlying principle being that the private sector will continue to be the principal source of new productive projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elimination of the economic causes of emigration is a primary objective of the Government's Programme. The present level of emigration is a matter of gravest concern, although the available indications are that the position has improved somewhat relative to the mid-1950s.  Unemployment and emigration are, in the main, different aspects of the same <Col N="7" /> national problem and it is reasonable to assume that progress in reducing unemployment will operate, although with some time-lag, to reduce emigration as well.  In this context, in particular, it is relevant to mention that the Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has been in full operation for less than two years.</P>
    <P>The rate of unemployment in 1960 was the lowest ever recorded and, so far in 1961, there is a further improvement in this regard over 1960.  The numbers engaged in Manufacturing Industries and in Industries Producing Transportable Goods were higher in 1960 than ever before.  Average insurable employment, calculated from insurance stamp purchases in the months January to September, appears to have been 9,000 higher in 1960 than in 1959 and 18,000 higher in 1960 than in 1958.  The economy generally has expanded substantially since 1958. In 1959 real national income is estimated to have increased by 3 per cent., and it is believed that 1960 will show a further increase of the order of 4 per cent. as compared with the annual increase of 2 per cent. assumed in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>The Government have never considered themselves to be bound rigidly by the terms of the Programme.  For example, I would point out that, in the Programme, the public capital expenditure estimated for 1960/61 was £44.49 million, whereas in the 1960 Budget the provision was increased to £54.37 million.  The Government have constantly under examination proposals for bringing about a further acceleration of the country's economic progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach give a figure for persons in employment, which is a very significant figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have done that.  In so far as the purchases of social insurance stamps are an indication of that position I have given the Deputy these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that <Col N="8" /> there were some thousands less in over-all employment in 1960 than there were two years before, taking into account agricultural, industrial and other types of employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Taoiseach has been in effective control of this particular policy since 1932 and since that time half a million to threequarters of a million people have emigrated and therefore is not this alleged prosperity just one gigantic bluff?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he will make a statement on trade relations with other countries, with particular reference to the lack of balance in trade with those countries from which a substantial quantity of goods is imported but which purchase very few goods from this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with this question on a number of previous occasions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that international trade relations generally are at this juncture in somewhat of a transitional stage having regard to the problems arising from the existence of European economic regional groupings like E.E.C. and E.F.T.A. and also, insofar as this country is concerned, from our approach to the G.A.T.T.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So long as there is an overall balance in our external payments, it is generally to our advantage to buy import requirements in the cheapest markets, even though this may involve a lack of balance in our trading with individual countries.  On the other hand, we think it reasonable to expect countries from which we buy considerable quantities of goods to be <Col N="12" /> prepared to grant us import facilities in return.  The constant aim of the Government in trade relations with particular countries is to secure the greatest possible expansion of exports in return for the import facilities we afford and we have at present under consideration the question whether there are any steps which could usefully be taken to secure this objective more effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Government, in this regard, remains as was stated in the course of a lengthy reply to a similar Question given by the then Taoiseach on November 21st, 1957.  I am aware that there is some public concern, although this is, I think, mainly due to very exaggerated reports of the extent to which agricultural land has been sold to non-nationals. The information available to the Government suggests that sales of agricultural land to non-nationals in a recent period of twelve months have not been abnormal and were, indeed, somewhat less than the yearly average of similar sales for the ten years' period 1941-50.  The Government are, however, keeping the position under close attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that one of the top members of the Land Commission, a lay commissioner, stated publicly in Galway that over 100,000 acres of the finest land in Ireland had passed into the hands of non-nationals and that as a result of that statement that man was removed on a sealed order by the Government?  In view of the statement made in that regard some years ago by a member of the Land Commission and in view of the fact that no action has since been taken by the Government to tighten the loopholes in legislation which allow agricultural land to be <Col N="13" /> purchased by non-nationals, will the Taoiseach now state, so as to relieve public uneasiness, what actual steps the Government proposes to take to ensure that the terms of the Constitution are carried out, namely, that the maximum number of families are put into economic holdings in Ireland?</P>

      <P>Up to date&mdash;and we have carried out a fairly exhaustive examination of the situation&mdash;it does not appear that there have been transactions involving the sale of agricultural land to foreigners to any <Col N="14" /> greater extent than in previous years in recent history.  I have said, however, that we are aware that public anxiety exists, perhaps because of exaggerated reports of the extent to which these transactions are taking place, perhaps because of anticipation that they may take place on a greater scale in future.  We are keeping the matter under attention and will deal with it if action appears to be required.</P>

      <P>The last occasion on which the basis information needed to make the estimates asked for by the Deputy was collected was at the Census of Population, 1951. In view of the lapse of time since then, and of the very inadequate nature of the information on changes in the proportions of the numbers at work in the categories specified, it is not considered that a reliable sub-division of the total at work can be made on the lines required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to say that because of the policy which the Irish Medical Association continues to pursue it has not been possible to engage in any discussions with it.  In view of the terms of the question it is necessary for me to make it clear that no difficulties whatsoever have been experienced in the administration and provision of health services on that account.  All medical posts proscribed by the Association since I took office in March, 1957, have been filled by the appointment of eminently qualified personnel; from which it would appear that many members of the medical profession are not in accord with the attitude which the Association continues to pursue. With this in mind I have endeavoured to ensure that fair and full consideration is given to the just claims of those who staff the health services, and I do not feel that they have been prejudiced by the impasse which exists.  At the same time it is regrettable that the impasse should continue and I venture to hope that even now the Association may see its way to reconsider the proscription which it has imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions numbered 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>It is intended to keep statistics of old age (contributory) pensions from which details such as those requested by the Deputy will be available.  However, it has not yet been possible to extract these statistics as the staff have been concentrated on the essential work of deciding claims and arranging payment of pensions awarded.  Compilation of statistics will be started when the present pressure of work eases within the next few months and I will then have the figures requested made available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the overall position is that up to and including the 4th February, 1961, 36,329 claims to pension had been received.  Decisions have have been given on 23,920 of these claims, comprising 19,556 awards of pension at the maximum rates, 1,380 awards of pension at reduced rates and 2,984 claims rejected.  The 20,936 pensions awarded were, with the exception of some 400 cases, payable from 6th January, 1961, the commencement day of the scheme.  Approximately 9,100 of the total pensions awarded include an allowance for a wife or dependent husband.  It is not possible to give separate figures for men and women at this stage.</P>
      <P>The 12,409 claims still on hands, together with claims which are being received at the rate of 150 each day will be dealt with as quickly as possible. In a very high proportion of these claims the pensions awarded will be effective from the 6th January, 1961.</P>

Of course the Deputy will also understand that no real comparison can be made between the rate at which these claims come in and the estimate I gave on which the scheme was based.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason why the free fuel scheme has been discontinued in the case of those now in receipt of contributory old age pensions and allowances, especially in the case of those who qualified for such pensions <Col N="26" /> at a greatly reduced rate and who now receive an increase less than the value of the fuel vouchers formerly received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>No hardship has been occasioned by the withdrawal of facilities for cheap fuel to persons in receipt of non-convenanted old age (contributory) pensions.</P>
      <P>The cheap fuel scheme was introduced in the Winter of 1942 during the period of acute fuel shortage occasioned by the Emergency in order to assist necessitous families to obtain a regular supply of native fuel, and in particular turf, in areas then classified as non-turf areas, where there were special difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies.  The emergency which gave rise to the scheme has long since passed and I see no reason why the scheme should be extended in order to admit the new contributory pensioners who are not subject to a means test or in general are not in necessitous circumstances. Many of them, in fact, are still in employment or in receipt of superannuation payments from their former employers.</P>
      <P>As a result of the transfer from non-contributory to contributory pension a substantial and completely uncovenanted increase in income which heavily outweighs the loss of fuel vouchers is being received by virtually every one of those concerned.  The number formerly in receipt of cheap fuel as non-contributory old age pensioners who have been awarded only the minimum rate of contributory pension and are at a net loss is infinitesimal. Where such persons are genuinely in need, they are eligible for home assistance and entitled to obtain the fuel free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>29.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the terms of the circular issued by his Department to local authorities in connection with the issue of fuel vouchers to old age pensioners who qualify for contributory old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="27" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local authorities were informed by circular dated the 23rd December, 1960 that in accordance with the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960, old age (contributory) pensions would be payable from the 6th January, 1961; that persons in receipt of this pension, for which there is no means test, would not be eligible to receive cheap fuel and that arrangements should be made to ensure that vouchers were not issued to them.</P>
      <P>Special attention was drawn to the fact that persons receiving non-contributory old age pension who qualified for the new contributory pension would thereupon cease to be eligible for fuel vouchers.</P>
      <P>In this connection it should be noted that 99.2 per cent. of the persons concerned have had their pensions increased by from £10 8s. to £143 0s. per annum, according to their marital condition, age of spouse and contribution record.  These increases, which are entirely uncovenanted benefits, give no shadow of claim to the provision of further benefits (such as cheap fuel for those who reside in certain districts) at the expense of the taxpayers.  It is possible that a very small number of persons&mdash;perhaps less than 100 out of 27,000&mdash;who receive an increase in their pensions, may lose slightly on withdrawal of their fuel vouchers but only if they are refused home assistance because they have other means or if the Public Assistance Authority concerned ignores the fact that, as the pensions are now contributory, the first ten shillings thereof must be disregarded when assessing income for Home Assistance purposes.</P>

They were informed that Section 5 of the Act amended Section 14 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, by the inclusion of an old age (contributory) pension as a benefit and that, accordingly, in granting home assistance they may not, under Section 62 of the 1952 Act, take into consideration any such benefit except in so far as it exceeds ten shillings per week.</P>
      <P>The authorities were also informed that the Social Welfare (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations, 1953, had been amended by the Social Welfare (Overlapping Benefits) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations (1960), so as to apply to old age (contributory) pensions and that, accordingly, public assistance authorities were entitled to claim and be repaid out of any arrears of old age (contributory) pension which might be payable, any excess of home assistance paid to a person claiming the pension while his title to it was being determined.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in the assessment of means for the purpose of widows' and orphans' non-contributory pension, the income from a legacy inherited by <Col N="31" /> a son or daughter under sixteen years of age is regarded as means of the applicant; and, if so, if he will consider a change in the regulation which provides for this procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Rule 4 of the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the means of a widow for purposes of a widow's (non-contributory) pension are deemed to include the means of not more than two qualified children normally residing with her (excluding any cash income derived from personal exertions). The means of each child are taken to be the average of the means of all the children.  Accordingly, while income of the nature mentioned in the Question would be taken into account, the actual amount assessable as means would depend on the number of qualified children normally residing with the widow.</P>
      <P>Prior to the coming into operation of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, an increase of widows' (non-contributory) pension was payable in respect of each child and the means of all children were taken into account.  The 1952 Act restricted increases to two children and as a corollary limited the assessable means of the children to the means of not more than two.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1960, reintroduced the principle of increases of pension in respect of all qualified children but the provision for assessing the means of only two qualified children was retained, with consequent advantage to the widow with more than two children.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to introduce legislation to amend the existing provisions.</P>

      <P>Works have been completed under the Corrib-Clare drainage scheme on a channel flowing <Col N="43" /> through the townlands of Mountkelly and Clooncon West to the north-east of Glenamaddy, which I presume is the area which the Deputy has in mind. I cannot accept the contention that conditions in the area have been worsened by the works.  In fact, I am advised that considerable benefit has been brought to some 140 acres of land. There is, however, a small area of less than an acre adjoining the swallow hole which it has not been found possible to improve; but it has not been worsened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs what effect the withdrawal of troops from the Congo by certain countries is likely to have on the objectives of the United Nations in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to forecast <Col N="45" /> at this stage the effect of troop withdrawals by certain nations from the United Nations Force in the Congo. It is to be hoped that withdrawals indicated by certain countries will, if completed, be offset by a sufficiency of new contingents from other countries or preferably by the effects of conciliation among the Congolese leaders and forces.</P>
      <P>If, however, the present efforts at conciliation should fail and the United Nations Force should fall below the minimum strength necessary to restrict the risks of civil war and foreign intervention, the outlook for the welfare of the Congolese people and their African neighbours and perhaps for world peace would be very grim indeed.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware the situation in the Congo is being discussed at present in the Security Council and it is hoped that the results of its deliberations will relieve many of the difficulties which have arisen.  The Government are following developments closely and consider it most important in the present circumstances to continue to support United Nations efforts in the Congo and maintain our contingent there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take questions Nos. 50, 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>In reply to the previous question I have commented on the Government's attitude to maintaining their contingent with the United Nations' force in the Congo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have at all times made it abundantly clear that they fully support the United Nations effort to prevent intervention in Congolese <Col N="47" /> affairs, not only by Belgium but by all other foreign powers.</P>
    <P>We fully support also the efforts being made by the Conciliation Commission, consisting of representatives of African and Asian States, which has been working in the Congo since the beginning of January.  We hope that these efforts will result in bringing together, at a round table conference, all the principal Congolese leaders including Mr. Lumumba.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lumumba who, like all other representatives of the Congolese people, was offered the protection of the United Nations forces, unfortunately decided of his own volition to abandon that protection&mdash;an action which led to his imprisonment by the Leopoldville authorities and his eventual transfer to Katanga.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General with the approval of the Advisory Committee, of which Ireland is a member, has pressed and is continuing to press for the release, or impartial trial, of Mr. Lumumba and the United Nations Conciliation Commission is also working towards this end.</P>
    <P>As regards the continued reinforcement of Mr. Tshombe's armed forces, the following is an extract from the Secretary-General's statement to the Security Council in the matter on 1st February:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The immediate aim of the United Nations operation was to provide for the withdrawal of all Belgian combat troops.  That target was met at the end of August.  Later on, however, outside interference has reoccurred in new and subtler but not less dangerous forms. Although it is difficult to determine the extent of such interference in concrete terms and to substantiate the findings, its existence is an incontrovertible fact and its effects are strongly negative.  Thus we know for certain that, both as regards arms and men, the military potential of various factions has been reinforced from the outside and that foreign mercenaries have been recruited on an increasing scale.  Recent bombings speak their shocking language. <Col N="48" /> This development may in some cases have come about without the active co-operation of this or that foreign Government, but it must be assumed that it has at least been tolerated by some foreign Governments.</P>
    <P>Volunteers or sales of arms from private companies are time-honoured forms for military assistance maintaining a seeming neutrality for the governments most directly concerned.  It is my firm conviction that such interference must be stopped, but I have not so far found a sufficient legal basis in the resolutions for effective counter-measures by the United Nations. Such counter-measures would not have been, or be, necessary if the Organisation had been or were now able to count on the loyal co-operation and assistance from all its member-governments.  Such cooperation has not always been forthcoming.  Is it too much to hope that at the present serious phase of the development the United Nations will be able to count on all its members so that they would not only avoid giving any military assistance themselves but, furthermore, take the necessary steps, which undoubtedly are within their power, to stop any such assistance in other forms, less accessible for counter-action through the United Nations and its organs?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government fully supports the Secretary-General's statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the Secretary-General found no legal formula by which he could prevent the reinforcement by arms from outside states.  Could the Minister say under what legal formula did Mr. Hammarskjoeld&mdash;in my view, rightly &mdash;prevent Mr. Lumumba's army receiving reinforcements from the Russians at an early stage of the Congo problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says it is hoped that the Conciliation Commission will be able to bring about a meeting of the leaders of the Congo under Mr. Kasavubu and that one of the persons <Col N="49" /> at that conference will be Mr. Lumumba.  In the course of his reply, the Minister further stated that he hoped, and had advocated, that Mr. Lumumba would be released and brought to trial.  Could the Minister say how he can correlate the suggestion that Mr. Lumumba, the democratically-elected Premier of the Congo, should be released and brought to trial?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply was very lengthy.  I am concluding now, Sir.  If Mr. Lumumba is a leader who should be with the other leaders of the Congo, why should he be brought to trial and on what charges? Finally, could I ask the Minister whether he believes that the decision of the Casablanca Powers was an ill-considered decision and ill-founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked a long series of Supplementary Questions. First, I did not say that Mr. Lumumba should be brought to trial. The Congolese situation is very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see in my reply what the Secretary General said and what the Advisory Committee said.  Unfortunately, there is very little we can say here that is going to help the situation.  If the Security Council cannot help the Secretary General to improve the situation in the Congo, we are all facing a very grave crisis, and the Congolese people are facing it. To improve the situation requires not only good-will on the part of the Security Council, the Secretary General and the states that have co-operated and given help to the Congolese, but it requires also the minimum contribution from the Congolese people and particularly from the Congolese leaders that they are prepared to make the compromises necessary to set up some sort of civil government that could keep order in the country.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves the Summer Time Order, 1961, made by the Minister for Justice under the Summer Time Act, 1925 (No. 8 of 1925).</P>
      <P>The Order provides that the period of Summer Time this year will be from 26th March to 29th October.  If the Order were not made, the period would be from 16th April to 8th October.  In effect, it lengthens the period of Summer Time by six weeks altogether&mdash; three weeks in the Spring and three weeks in the Autumn.</P>
      <P>The period now proposed is that which has already been fixed for Britain and the Six Counties and it is to synchronise with them that we have made the Order.  I do not have to stress that failure to make such synchronisation would cause serious inconvenience to the public, particularly to the business community.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> I should perhaps explain that we have this synchronisation of Summer Time with Britain and the Six Counties every year, but this is the first year since 1952 that it has been necessary to make a special Order to provide for it, as the British have not, since 1952, departed from the ordinary period of Summer Time which is the same here as in Britain.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
    <P>State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) Order, 1960</P>
    <P>a copy of which Order in draft has been laid before the House.</P>
    <P>The National Building Agency, Ltd., is a Company registered under the Companies Acts, having a nominal capital of £100 divided into 100 shares of £1 each.  Its title in Irish is Foirgníocht Éireann, Teoranta.  The establishment of the agency in its present form has been sponsored by me with the approval of the Government to meet a special need which, it is recognised, is not adequately catered for within the existing statutory and administrative machinery.</P>
    <P>The primary objects of the agency are to facilitate the provision of housing and ancillary services at centres where industrial developments necessitate the recruitment and housing of personnel whose requirements cannot appropriately be met by local authorities and are not otherwise met by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>The availability of suitable housing is a prime factor in determining the location of a new industry or the practicability of expanding an existing concern. In the normal course, the demand for housing for workers living in a particular area is met by the housing authority and, in the case of owner-occupation, by private initiative.  In an area, however, where the supply of housing cannot meet an immediate demand for additional accommodation for managerial, executive and skilled personnel being recruited to that area, industrial development creates a special problem which calls for a special solution.</P>
    <P>Industrial promoters find it necessary to direct their capital initially to immediately productive investment. They do not, in fact, expect to find themselves confronted with the necessity to undertake the provision of housing, on however small a scale, at the formative stage when their enterprise and skill are devoted to the task of establishing the new industry.  This is a problem of which my Department <Col N="59" /> has become increasingly aware with the growth of recent industrial promotion.</P>
    <P>In his public reference in September last to the proposed establishment of this agency, the Taoiseach expressed the Government's view and, I anticipate, that of the House, when he said that &ldquo;this is a problem that we do not mind at all having to cope with&rdquo;. Having considered the many aspects of this rather urgent problem, including the necessity to have machinery available as soon as practicable which would be capable of acting speedily and efficiently to meet even the most modest requirement in any particular area, the National Building Agency, Ltd., was incorporated with the intention that it would be scheduled to the State Guarantees Act so that the Minister for Finance can guarantee its capital borrowings.</P>
    <P>The procedure was decided upon to facilitate the Company in undertaking such operations as might be required of it immediately following its incorporation. The necessity for such an agency has proved itself by the extent of the demand for its services which became apparent following the public announcement of its establishment.  If inquiries so far in train mature into firm projects, the amount of the guarantee now sought would be fully utilised in a comparatively short period.  While it is too early as yet to forecast a continuance of demand at its present rate, it is already apparent, however, that consideration may have to be given to making more adequate long-term arrangements available for the financing of its operation.</P>
    <P>The National Building Agency will provide a service which in so far as it is availed of by industrial and commercial undertakings, will be paid for by these undertakings.  For example, it will provide such houses as a new industrial promotion requires to overcome the difficulty in recruiting from other areas workers possessing special skills, subject to an agreement that the industrial interests concerned will underwrite the rents, leases, or mortgage repayments of the houses and <Col N="60" /> services provided or otherwise accept responsibility for recoupment to the agency of its capital expenditure.  In this way, the establishment of new industries need no longer be handicapped because of a problem of housing for executive and key personnel.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the National Building Agency may, apart from the purpose I have outlined, fulfil other functions for the State, such as the building of houses for Gardaí and other Government officers whose duties make them liable to transfer from one district to another and who sometimes encounter re-housing difficulties.</P>
    <P>The operations of the National Building Agency in its present form will be entrusted to personnel serving in the Civil Service whose experience and responsibilities are closely linked with the administration of national policy on housing and related services, on finance and on industry.  By virtue of its having the form of a registered company, the directors of the agency will be in a position to take immediate action where circumstances so require, by entering into direct agreements with industrial interests to ensure that housing and other related services will be provided according as they are required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, any body set up to further the promotion of housing is always welcome.  We are particularly glad that this agency will cater for the Garda, Army and other such Government officers.  That has been badly needed for a great many years.  I wonder if the procedure will become rather cumbersome?  We are setting up an incorporated body which may proceed to build houses with State guaranteed funds and rent them, lease them or sell them to individuals.  The directors of this company have no experience of building.  I presume these houses will be built by contract or by direct labour.  First of all, there is the administration of the company; then there are the profits of the builder; and then the profits of the developer.  It may make these houses very expensive to the personnel for whom they are being built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> While I welcome the proposal, one thing worries me.  The Minister states the primary objects of the agency are to facilitate the provision of housing and ancillary services at centres where industrial developments necessitate the recruitment and housing of personnel. &ldquo;At centres,&rdquo;&mdash;are we to build new towns?  Where will these houses be built?  Take Shannon.  As a result of setting up industries there, it may be necessary to house the personnel but are we to take them away from Ennis? Are we to build the houses in Ennis or in its outskirts, or in the immediate vicinity of the factory?  Is this an effort to set up new towns with new shopping centres, thereby depriving existing towns and shopkeepers of a livelihood?  The Minister should look into that point very carefully.  Possibly he has done so and perhaps he might explain his intention.</P>
    <P>I can visualise a project, say at Ards. If houses were to be built there for personnel, they should be built at the nearest village or town, not in the immediate vicinity of the factory because then we would be creating new towns which would be in competition with towns which at the moment can scarcely exist from a business point of view.  If the Minister assures us the agency will not operate in that manner and that new towns and new shopping centres will not be created, I think the House would be more contented.</P>
    <P>The town of Ballyshannon comes to mind.  During the boom years when the E.S.B. were developing power there, we had a big influx of workmen, as high as 800, into the town.  The local authority was encouraged to provide homes for those people.  Unfortunately, when the project reached completion, the employees had to move back to their original habitation or to procure employment somewhere else, with the result that we now have a number of houses in Ballyshannon which we are unable to let even at an uneconomic rent.  The agency would be very wise to move slowly.  If the Minister can assure us that mushroom towns will not spring up in a very short period which will go into competition with towns already in <Col N="62" /> existence, I am sure the House would welcome the project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this Bill will ultimately prove a useful piece of legislation.  Its possibilities for aid are not confined even to the establishment of new industries, although I recognise at once its importance in that field.  So far as Government services are concerned, there is need for services of this kind.</P>
      <P>Take the Post Office as an example. A person is offered promotion only to find that the place at which the promotion is offered has no suitable housing accommodation and that there is no residence attached to the post office.  After a few visits to the town in which he hoped to get the promotion, the officer has finally to give up, although he might otherwise like the town, and lose his seniority because somebody else will have to get the promotion.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the officer there loses the opportunity of getting what is his right and legitimate promotion, simply because there was no suitable accommodation in the town.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill, the new housing agency will contact the Post Office and provide houses in all these towns where suitable houses are not available for persons promoted to these towns, that is, promoted from an appointment in another part of the country to a higher one in that town. It is not worth while for an officer to try to buy a house if he remains in a place for only three, four or five years and then goes to some other place. He cannot develop a long-term interest in the house.  It is uneconomic in such circumstances to buy houses with the expense of acquisition, in the first instance, and then disposal when he ultimately leaves the town. It would be much better in such circumstances if the house were the property of the Post Office so that it would be available for those whom the Post Office appoint to positions of chargeship of offices in these towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can do very useful work from the point of view of housing members of the Garda Síochána and the Army who are transferred from one place to <Col N="63" /> the other and people whose conditions of employment make them liable to such transfer.  I hope that both the Garda authorities and the Army, together with the Post Office, will utilise this agency for the purpose of supplying what is a long felt want among persons employed in these different services.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill fills a need so far as new industries are concerned.  As the Minister pointed out, many of those promoting a new industry are concerned to ensure that the finances are directed to a type of investment which will aid the industry and give a return to the investors.  They do not cheerfully contemplate having to spend a substantial sum of money in the purchase of houses which they regard as aside from their main activities and not of a character to bring a reward.  Very frequently, a number of these industries find it necessary to bring in key personnel.  In fact, in many of these industries, the whole success depends upon the ability of the key personnel to direct the firm's activities and to impart to untrained local labour the skill which the keyman has acquired after long years of experience.</P>
    <P>These keymen have found it extremely difficult to get suitable housing accommodation.  I have known cases where because of that and other factors, the keyman himself found it necessary to go back to his original place of employment.  It has been suggested from time to time that the local authority should provide for these people.  It is easy to say that until you come up against the reality of the situation.  If a number of people are seeking houses from the local authority, people who have been born and reared in a particular town, and they see some person coming in from overseas and getting a house to which the locals felt they had a right, there can be great dissatisfaction.  A good deal of agitation can arise from housing an outside keyman in a house which a local person legitimately believes ought to be allocated to him and his family.  This, however, would remove the housing of the key executives from the realm of controversy and would enable the local <Col N="64" /> industry, through its association with this housing agency, to provide houses up to its full requirements and on conditions which would not impose any onerous burden on the firm concerned.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that since this project was first mentioned, there have been many inquiries as to the facilities which will be made available and when they will be made available.  So that we might judge the situation by the extent of the demand, perhaps the Minister would give us some information as to how many inquiries were made and the directions from which they came.  Have they come from industries?  Have any come from semi-State bodies or from Departments?  I should like to see to what extent we are likely to find this scheme embraced enthusiastically by all those for whom it is intended to cater.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I welcome the Bill. I think it can be a very useful piece of legislation.  Because of the fact that it is a registered company that is concerned, with considerable flexibility, it should be possible to provide these houses without any frustrating formalities or obstacles which in the course of time might be found to carry with them so much irritation as to blunt a real keen interest in what I think can be a very useful piece of housing legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome very much this new development in the provision of houses for certain persons.  For some time, I have been making inquiries and discussing this matter in order to overcome what appeared to be a difficult problem but which is now solved.  If an industry starts in any part of Ireland, outside the metropolitan area, the skilled operatives have to be brought along and no housing facilities are available. Possibly the operative could apply for a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  That was, in a sense, difficult because of the many cases where skilled operatives remained for a certain time and were then changed.  The difficulty was that the person to whom a loan was made and who entered into commitments had no guarantee of a sufficiently long term <Col N="65" /> of service to cover his liabilities in regard to repayments.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will make it clear that where a factory starts in a town and requires skilled operatives, the firm itself can have the houses built under this agency through an arrangement similar to that under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. In other words, the factory will have the houses built and will be liable for the repayments over the requisite period of years and will be able to have these houses occupied by their own special workers.</P>
      <P>That is one of the points which concerns the industrialists, as Deputy Norton pointed out.  The amount of money necessary for this registered company will be somewhat similar to that required for operations under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. I take it that in regard to the Post Office, the Army or whatever other authority requires houses for its members, that authority will be responsible for the repayments of moneys on houses built to meet their requirements.  In time, therefore, it will not be a question of money spent which is never recoverable, but a case of large scale advances recoverable over a period of years with appropriate rates of interest to cover the moneys borrowed by the authorities from, I take it, wherever they will get it, from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to make it clear that the position has now been reached that where a factory starting in a certain town finds it necessary to build a certain number of houses for some of its special workers, the factory can borrow, from this agency, the money required to build the houses; under the same arrangements, if you like, as apply to local authorities where they are operating the Small Dwellings Acquisition Loans.  If that is the case, a very great need will have been met and a very great service will have been done for the decentralisation of industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure and I should like to say that the objects which it may achieve will <Col N="66" /> not be fully appreciated for quite some time.  It is rather amusing to think that Government Departments have in this instance cut a stick to beat themselves.  Over the years, various Governments have promised to bring in a certain amount of decentralisation of Government services. For instance, the Department of Lands on a number of occasions was prepared to bring in decentralisation, perhaps to set up a certain section in Athlone or Galway, or to set up Forestry in some other part of the country.  Social Welfare was to be decentralised, as well as various other Government services.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest arguments put forward by the various Government Departments against decentralisation was the lack of suitable housing accommodation for the higher civil servants and their families.  Now we have the position that the Department of Lands can apply to this agency and say: &ldquo;We would like 30 houses built in Athlone. We propose to set up a section of our Forestry Department there.&rdquo;  As far as Galway is concerned, the Department of Lands can say: &ldquo;We are going to reconstitute the Congested Districts Board and we need 30 or 40 houses.&rdquo;  As time goes on, the benefits of this measure will become more and more apparent.  Apart altogether from the industrial end, a great deal of good work can be done in regard to housing the staffs of existing State and semi-State concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little vague about what the Minister has in mind with regard to immediate construction work, especially as regards existing State and semi-State bodies.  We have the E.S.B. carrying out their own building programme and Bord na Móna also have a special housing section for constructing houses for engineers and technicians. Will the position arise that this will be a State agency which will be in a position to control the building activities of bodies like the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna?  To give an example, we have the position where in town &ldquo;X&rdquo;, the E.S.B. have a number of houses which they are not able to fill with workers and side by side Bord na Móna are carrying out their functions <Col N="67" /> and are not in the position to get the vacant E.S.B. houses for their own workers, due to the fact that legislation precludes them.  Therefore, you have two semi-State bodies which are not co-ordinating their housing problem.</P>
    <P>It is a fantastic situation to see some of the houses controlled by E.S.B. vacant, while Bord na Móna workers are not able to get houses for themselves. This agency should be in a position to examine the building problems of State bodies and co-ordinate them.  If there are houses available in a particular locality which are held by Bord na Móna and which are not being utilised, the agency should have power to direct that these houses be handed over to another State body which may be in the locality.</P>
    <P>The question of helping industry is very interesting because to a great extent building carried out under this measure will be for industrial workers. Most of our State companies are engaged in industrial work.  If we take the Sugar Company, or Bord na Móna, or the fruit and vegetable body, we see that all those companies are engaged in industrial development and this building agency should consult with these boards which are already in operation and suggest to them that they are prepared to carry out building work so that the companies activities can be expanded in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure about this, but I feel the Minister has remedied what I felt was a weakness.  I was afraid, with all the talk about attractions for industrialists, that we were embarking on a building programme for foreign industrialists, with no onus on these people to buy these houses when they had been constructed.  I gather from the Minister now that as far as private industrialists are concerned, this agency will just build the houses but these people will have to buy them and pay for them.  The situation could be very serious if we had the position that the Government, first of all, were giving 50 per cent. of the grant for the construction of a factory, 50 per cent. of the cost of training the <Col N="68" /> workers for the factory, giving perhaps 30 per cent. of the remainder of the money in a loan, giving them tax-free profits for a period of ten years and allowing them to take whatever profits they made out of the country, and then, in addition, embarking on a housing programme for these industrialists.</P>
    <P>I would hope that that will not take place under any circumstances and I would like the Minister when replying to nail down that position so that people will not come in here with the impression that the Government, on top of all the facilities they are already making available to attract industrialists to this country, are now going to provide them with houses as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with the welcome that has been extended to this measure.  In the event of decentralisation taking place, will the company take steps to provide the necessary houses?  I can see a big demand for key personnel in Departments.  I know that there are dozens of young men and women who are employed in this city who, in the event of decentralisation of any Department, would be very keen to return, say, to Galway. Housing would be required for the key personnel of those decentralised Departments, as in the case of factories.  I welcome the measure because it will help to relieve a headache that local authorities have.  I should like to know if it is the intention to bring members of the Defence Forces, the Gardaí, or other Government employees within the scope of the measure.  Further, will the company have powers in respect of site acquisition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very gratified at the reception of this measure in its general intent by the House.  Deputies who have spoken feel, as all of us have felt for some time, that there was a gap to be closed in regard to housing, not only in regard to industry but also in regard to some Departmental staff, such as Gardaí and others who are moved around, and having in mind transfers of personnel that might take place because of decentralisation of <Col N="69" /> any Department or any part of a Department to any part of the country where houses would not be readily available for such staff.</P>
      <P>Lest there might be any wrong ideas about the situation, it should be said right away that this company is a company which builds houses or causes houses to be built only after they have ascertained whether or not houses can be obtained in any other way or through any other agency. If a private builder or a local authority have houses available or if speculative builders have plans to provide houses to meet the need that would appear to exist in any particular case, this agency would not build in competition with either of these groups.  It is not the intention that they should be competitors; rather is it the intention that where houses are not being provided under any other heading or by any other group or agency, this agency when called upon to do so, whether by an industrialist or a Government Department, will make itself available to provide houses, as requested by these people.</P>
      <P>It is only right that it should be made absolutely clear that this agency is not a building construction company in the commercial business of building in competition with private enterprise.  Neither is it to supersede in any way the functions of local authorities who have their own responsibilities and priority classes whom it is their duty to house.  Again, this Company is not intended to overlap that duty of local authorities or local housing authorities throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy O'Donnell and the House the agency is being set up to provide new centres.  From that, the House may have taken it that the intention is to build new towns.  Towns will not be built and it is not the intention that they should be built merely for the sake of building new towns. In fact, I do not envisage any great development in this direction.  Rather do I see it in this way: Where an industry is set up, the development of employment in that industry may overtax the number of available employees <Col N="70" /> in the district at the time and may involve bringing in workers from the surrounding district, the surrounding counties or back from England or even in some cases bringing in foreign skilled personnel to train workers and houses will be built for those people but only at the behest of the industrialists concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan expressed the fear that the houses would be provided free for the industrialists.  That is not so. The houses will be provided on order from the industrialists and there will be suitable and acceptable guarantees from the industrialists that they will repay the cost of the houses when they have been constructed or over a period of years thereafter.</P>
    <P>Having built any given number of houses at the request of an industrialist and subject to his guaranteeing repayment of the outlay of the building agency, the houses will then pass to the industrialist for the housing of his workers.  The industrialist can let them, can subsidise them, can put his workers into them free of rent.  That will be entirely his business at that stage.  The main purpose, of course, is that no industry will be curbed in its activity or development in future through lack of housing for necessary personnel who cannot be housed by the local authority or by private enterprise. That is the kernel of the need and it is that need that we hope to meet by this building agency in the time that lies ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton has sought information as to the extent of the inquiries that have been made and asked for a general idea as to where they emanated from.  I shall give very rough figures on that.  To date 31 known industrial undertakings have been inquiring and, in some instances, pursuing their inquiries to quite a considerable degree.  In addition, 15 individual inquirers, such as solicitors and accountants, have indicated their interest in this new building agency and have been seeking information relative to its operations from their point of view on behalf of industrialists.  Whether all of the inquiries are genuinely in the interests of some industry or not we do not <Col N="71" /> know, but 15 such inquiries have been received and replied to.  There have been 31 firm inquiries and certain discussions have taken place with known industrialists in the country.  Two or three of our Departments of State have initiated certain discussions and inquiries have been received from, I think, four others.  So that, in the short time since the intention to set up this building agency was made public, there has been a very decided indication that there is a need for it and from the preliminary discussions that have taken place, some of them more definite than others, it is quite clear that they were not just idle and curious inquiries, that the inquirers were very definitely interested in many of the cases I have mentioned, and I am quite definite that certain developments in the provision of houses in these cases will take place in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that the directors of the company, through inexperience of building operations, might increase the cost of houses.  I want to say again that this will not be a construction company or a building company in the sense of doing the actual building themselves. Rather will they in the ordinary way make known their requirements on a particular site, and their specifications will be available.  Contractors will be asked for their price and no doubt it will be some of these contractors who will be successful in pricing the specification most keenly who ultimately will come to build the houses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We shall try for a while.  To allay any fears Deputy O'Donnell and the House may have, may I say these directors are very well-learned <Col N="72" /> in dealing with contracts, pricing, specifications, planning and all the details of a building job.  The personnel of my Department are specially chosen because of their intimate knowledge of house building generally throughout the country.  There is the person who deals with local authority housing in the section in the Department. Then there is the person from the grants section.  Naturally a great deal of knowledge must come through to this gentleman.  Again, he is a member of the board.  We have available to us in the Department of Local Government excellently qualified personnel for the operation envisaged in relation to this Company.  I do not think it would be possible to pick out from any other walk of life people as suitably qualified for the job we have in mind under this National Building Agency.  I am satisfied that with people having that knowledge there can be no question of our having expensive building.  On the contrary, it is my hope and belief that through the expert knowledge of these people operating as the directors of the company the costs of housebuilding under this agency will be under rather than over the normal costs throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe mentioned the method of repayment for these houses and sought some word from me that the occupiers would ultimately come to be treated in the same manner as S.D.A. loan recipients.  I cannot give any particular assurance in this case because this Company will build at the request of an industry.  The industry will conform to the conditions of guarantee of repayment of the total cost of the houses concerned.  The houses are being provided for the industry's workers.  Surely it would be for the industry who will then be the virtual owners of the houses to determine whether or not they are to be given over for permanent occupation by those whom they have put into them or whether, in the peculiar circumstances of their industrial business, it would be tying them up to put in any particular person for all time rather than be able to facilitate others coming into the industry who might need houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> The first people who took up the houses may be able to build their own houses.  If the first occupier became the owner-occupier, the purpose behind housebuilding for these people by the company would be defeated. However, it is a matter which the industry concerned can deal with in their own time, and I have no doubt that they will do whatever is best in the long-term interests.  I do not think it will be the job of this company, after the houses have been built, to pursue exactly how these houses are being handled or occupied.  That would be going very much beyond what the duties of this company would be.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan expressed the fear of duplication of building by State companies and asked whether this new agency would control all building for the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna, to mention but a few.  He instanced a case in his own constituency of houses belonging to one of these State boards being vacant while houses are being sought by workers of the other State board in the same area. There are houses vacant belonging to these State boards in particular counties.  Local authorities are anxious to provide houses there and all that really would be required, if the company no longer needs the houses, would be some amendment to enable them to let the houses to these local workers rather than that the local authority would have to build new houses.</P>
    <P>That is not a matter entirely for this company, but I can give the House this assurance, that one of the Articles of Association of the company obliges the National Building Agency Company to furnish the Minister with information on matters incidental to or relating to any of the objects of the company, which is house-building and ancillary services.  That means that I can obtain from them the result of an investigation which they could be asked to carry out in regard to availability of houses, whether E.S.B. or Bord na Móna houses or what you will, in any part of the country.  The results of that investigation could be brought to the notice of the appropriate <Col N="74" /> authority for joint action if joint action were required.  In other words we can co-ordinate to some degree these activities as a result of the information furnished by this company.</P>
    <P>Talking about guaranteeing, it is not so that in all cases the National Building Agency, where it is called in, will in fact proceed to build houses themselves as a company.  It may well be, as a result of their inquiries negotiations and ascertaining of the need arising in any particular area, that the problem will be resolved by advice, for instance, to the local industry or the workers of a local industry to get together in a public utility society and build their own houses with the aid of S.D.A. loans. It is only when this Company has found out there is no other way of providing housing that it will operate. I do not want this to be taken too literally; this building Agency is a builder of last resort.  That does not mean you have to wait 50 years for them to operate.  In fact, the underlying intention of setting up this Company is that they will have freedom to move more quickly and efficiently than is the case with our own local authorities who are circumscribed even by the operations of my own Department. That is part of the reason for the company, but, nevertheless, it is still right to say it is a builder of last resort rather than a company that will rush to build houses here, there and everywhere.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate the Minister has used that phrase &ldquo;builder of last resort&rdquo; having established a good reputation for the Agency.  That means that in a town of 10,000 people you must have almost a local inquiry to disclose whether a house is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me point out again how this comes in.  We have in the Department, from which the directors of this Company are drawn, a vast amount of information about the housing situation in every local authority <Col N="75" /> of every housing authority in the country.  When an inquiry is received I think it is prudent for the company to avail itself immediately of the information available in my Department in regard to housing in that locality. Having seen at a rough glance the situation, as it is known to us, it is quite easy to ascertain if that information needs revision by ringing up or going to the local housing authority down the country, whether county or urban council or corporation, and finding out on the spot if the information we have about housing is up to date and, if it is not, to bring it up to date.</P>
      <P>If it is found that, in fact, all the houses are needed beyond question and that the facts and figures we have are confirmed and that so many houses are needed and that there is no other way of providing them, then the building agency would set to work to provide the additional houses for the project whatever it might be.</P>
      <P>When I refer to the agency as a builder of last resort I wish it to be understood that that is only on the ground that it is not a competitor with private enterprise.  I know it is possibly regarded as unfortunate that we should use that term, but nevertheless I think we should make it abundantly clear that the agency will not supplant the duties or obligations in regard to houses of local authorities.  It should not be regarded as supplanting anybody or being in competition with anybody and, considered in that way, the description of &ldquo;builder of last resort&rdquo; so qualified is not at all as unfortunate as it might at first appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we take it that the tenants who are going to occupy the houses and pay rent for them will have some voice in determining the kind of houses in which they are going to live?  In other words, the house would be made for the tenant rather than the tenant made for the house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If, for instance, a worker or workers are to be brought in from abroad&mdash;they may be Irish nationals returning or, through force of circumstances, they may be foreign <Col N="76" />&mdash;the company or the industrialist comes to the National Building Agency and says: &ldquo;We need six houses for six key workers.  Let their nationality be what it may, we want them.&rdquo;  They tell us what size house, approximately, they want and what price they will pay.  It will really be the industrialists who will order these houses and guarantee to pay for them. The wishes of the worker will be expressed, I am sure, or will be ascertained by the industrialist, but the workers will certainly not be interviewed as to their wishes or likes or dislikes by the building agency.  I take it that prudence will dictate that if the company is trying to entice key personnel to their factory and that if the housing question is raised by these workers, naturally, the management of the factory will try to satisfy the expressed needs of the workers in regard to the houses required.  It is the industrialist who will come to the building agency, not the actual workers.  Whatever may be done between the workers and the industrialist the worker does not come to the agency to have a house built for him.  It is for the industrialist the houses are built and he gets them built for his workers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan of Galway was very anxious to know whether the building agency would provide houses for the decentralisation of Departments.  It would be quite happy to do so if and when particular Departments call on it for that purpose and houses are not otherwise available.  Three Departments have so far interested themselves to some degree in this matter, and it is quite possible that some decentralisation building may not be too long delayed so far as the operation of this Company is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I can only repeat what I said already, that the Company is there to fill a need.  Whatever our various views may be on that matter, I think we are all pretty well agreed that industry should not be held up for want of houses throughout the country.  Departmental personnel, who are subject to transfer and who have no real stake wherever they are that would induce <Col N="77" /> them to build or own their own houses, are in a special category.  Nobody provides houses for them at the moment, and they constitute a group that can be looked after, and which it is intended shall be looked after, by this Company. The over-all idea of the Company, while doing that Departmental work, I should like to think, will be to provide added help&mdash;not an incentive&mdash;to the expansion of our industries, to the initiation of new industries so that we can say hereafter that no industry has been cramped in its expansion programme through lack of housing or that no town or village has lost an industry because it was apparent that there were not sufficient houses for the personnel who would have to come and work there.  I think this Company fill that need, and I am satisfied that the years immediately ahead will show that the welcome of the House for this measure was well-founded and that it will, in fact, do a good job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where an industrialist seems convinced that he needs housing accommodation for key workers&mdash;and in the long run they are the people upon whom the success of the industry depends and it is very frequently essential to get them housed quickly so as to have them on the spot&mdash;will the fact that the agency is a &ldquo;builder of last resort&rdquo;&mdash;the phrase used by the Minister&mdash;operate to delay the provision of houses in such cases?  Will the Minister give us an assurance on that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly readily give that assurance.  The &ldquo;builder of last resort&rdquo; is intended to convey to those who have been doing the building that has been done over the years that this is not a new competitor. There is still a large amount of work to do and there will continue to be such work to be done over the years by housing authorities and by private enterprise.  When this building agency gets a request from an industrialist they will have at their finger-tips, as it were, a vast amount of information on the housing situation in any part of the country and they will also have access to the local authority information on the spot and they will go and make their own investigation. <Col N="78" /> That will not mean a long delay; it can be done in a matter of days.  If it is evident after some days, just as readily as it would be after some months, that these houses are required as an urgent necessity for the wellbeing of some industry set up or about to be set up then the National Building Agency, subject to getting a guarantee of repayment of the cost of the housing, can immediately get on with the job, and there will be no question of delay in that case.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with the Bill proper, I would draw attention to a printing <Col N="80" /> error which crept into page 4 of the explanatory memorandum as circulated with the text of the Bill. Deputies doubtless will have noted it when reading paragraph 9 of the memorandum.  The sixth line of that paragraph is clearly an intrusion, which in the context does not make sense.  It is in fact an accidental repetition of a line, the proper place of which is 9th from the bottom of the page, where in fact it correctly appears.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is two-fold: it proposes in the first place to make some desirable, but not fundamental changes in certain of the provisions relating to patients which are contained in the Mental Treatment Acts; and in the second, to bring mental hospital staffs within the general scope of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956.</P>
    <P>The Mental Treatment Act, 1945, introduced what were then fundamental and far-reaching changes in the law in regard to the care and treatment of people sufferng from mental illness.  I think we can reasonably claim that its provisions were, at the time of its enactment, in line with what was then progressive thought in regard to the mentally ill.  The intervening period has, however, been a time of considerable change and development in psychiatric thought, because of which I propose to institute a comprehensive examination into our provisions for the treatment of the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>In our district mental hospitals at present, we have more than 19,000 patients.  Our aim must be to cure, as speedily as is possible, as many of these as is possible.  Many, of course, at the present level of medical science, are not capable of cure and must be retained in custodial care.  But the outlook for very many others is much more hopeful.  They can be cured, or their condition may be sufficiently ameliorated to permit them to return to their homes, their families and their friends.  Many, however, who could otherwise be discharged with advantage to themselves, have no relatives who will accept them and no homes <Col N="81" /> to go to&mdash;and these must be provided for otherwise.  Up to the present very many such cases have been retained in the mental hospitals where they contribute greatly to the present overcrowding, thus impeding the treatment of other patients and retarding, even, it may be, preventing their recovery.</P>
    <P>The problem, of course, does not end with the 19,000 patients at present in the hospitals.  New cases are coming forward daily and have to be dealt with.  Very many of these are suffering from disorders that are now susceptible to treatment, and these may be either completely cured or, at worst, be considerably alleviated.  It is most important that patients in these categories should not be retained longer in hospital than is necessary.  Indeed it should be the aim of those responsible for our mental health services to keep out of custodial or even therapeutic institutions as many as is feasible of those who may be suffering from mental illness&mdash;with due regard, that is, to the interests of the patient himself, his family and the community. With this in view, there is now an increasing emphasis on out-patient treatments; which may be given in general hospitals, at clinics, or even in specially provided psychiatric day hospitals to which the patient goes each day, returning each evening to his home.  This is a concept which was scarcely thought of, even so recently as a decade or two ago, when treatment was generally regarded as being secondary in importance to custodial care.</P>
    <P>We have made very considerable advances in health matters in the period I have mentioned.  Our general hospitals, on the whole, bear comparison with similar hospitals anywhere as regards staffing, facilities and structure. We have done much to improve specialist hospitals, so that, to mention only two specialties, our T.B. sanatoria and our orthopaedic hospitals are now of the highest standard.  The facilities in such homes for mentally handicapped as exist are likewise good&mdash;the difficulty is that we have not enough of them to cater for those needing care. Our homes for the chronic sick, the county homes, are not good; but at <Col N="82" /> least we are getting down to the problem of improving them on a nationwide comprehensive scale.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, we have as yet no such programme for the mental hospitals. It is true that major improvements have been carried out in a number, and these are now of reasonable standard; but the general picture is one of overcrowding and inadequate facilities.  Much more extensive improvements than have been attempted up to the present are necessary and will be undertaken with all the speed that our resources and the competing demands on them permit.  In the meantime, as I have said, the advances in psychiatric medicine, which have taken place since the Mental Treatment Act of 1945 was enacted, justify an investigation into our existing facilities for the treatment of mental illness, so I am setting up a Commission of Inquiry to undertake it.  It will be the first comprehensive examination of the problem in this country to be undertaken in the light of modern knowledge.</P>
    <P>The work of the Commission will be complementary to the work of the Commission on the mentally-handicapped which has just been set up, and the two Commissions will, I hope, work in close conjunction.  It may be said indeed that their investigations, starting from opposite ends of the wide spectrum of mental infirmity, will ultimately overlap and merge.  This may involve some problems in the reconcilement of their respective recommendations; from which it might be argued that the problems could be better examined by one commission rather than two.  But when all its aspects are considered, the field to be covered is so wide, that if it were to be examined in detail by a single commission, the labour of that body might be unduly prolonged, and the benefits which should accrue to afflicted persons from developments in mental therapeutics might be unduly deferred.  In these circumstances, I decided that the advantage lay with the establishment of two commissions. The establishment of the new Commissions will not, of course, operate <Col N="83" /> to defer the carrying out of improvements in the existing hospitals.</P>
    <P>While a comprehensive review of the entire position in regard to the mentally ill is proceeding, it would be inappropriate that I should propose any radical amendment to the Mental Treatment Act of 1945.  Experience has shown, however, that it is very desirable in the interim to make some minor changes in those of its provisions which regulate or prescribe the procedures for the certification, chargeability, custody and registration of patients; and these are proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this procedure involves a good deal of &ldquo;legislation by reference&rdquo;; and this no Deputy any more than myself welcomes, involving, as it does, the need for reference back to an original provision which, itself, may have been amended already.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill should be of help to Deputies in that connection.  More recently, however, following discussion in my Department, it was felt that it would be desirable to publish eventually a booklet setting out the procedure in relation to the reception and detention of patients and quoting the relevant statutory provisions as they will be amended if this Bill is passed.  A preliminary draft of that booklet is available now to Deputies. I trust that not only will it obviate much of the labour of looking up the parent sections, but that it will give a better picture of what the code will look like if the amendments now proposed are accepted by the Oireachtas. The value to Deputies of the draft booklet will, of course, be greatest when the Bill is being considered in Committee and on its later Stages.</P>
    <P>There is one respect in which the booklet will not be of value.  It does not cover the superannuation provisions. These are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum already circulated with the Bill.</P>
    <P>The principal change which the Bill will make in relation to patients is the extension to all medical practitioners of the power to make a recommendation, <Col N="84" /> or to sign a certificate, in respect to the admission of a chargeable patient to hospital.  This extension is provided for in Sections 6 to 12, and in Sections 16 and 19. A chargeable patient is, broadly, a patient in a local authority hospital who is in the lower or middle income group and is, therefore, eligible for hospital service free, or at less than the full cost.  At present, whenever a recommendation or certificate is required for such a person, only the authorised medical officer can provide it; and he normally is the district medical officer of the dispensary district where the patient resides.</P>
    <P>The effect of this restriction is to preclude a patient, or his relatives, from availing himself of the services of the family doctor, should he not be the local district medical officer; in this way, it debars the majority of doctors, including psychiatric specialists, from providing their patients with the necessary certificate or recommendation.  I am satisfied that this disability should be removed and that the power to make a recommendation, or sign a certificate for reception, in the case of a chargeable patient should be conferred on all medical practitioners, subject, however, to certain disqualifications&mdash; grounded mainly on relationship to or financial interest in a patient.</P>
    <P>Section 3 gives the Minister power to make regulations authorising the making of payments to patients in respect of work done.  There is at present no specific statutory power for this, although, in practice, payments are made in some places.  In general, I visualise the making of token payments to encourage patients and to offer them an incentive to occupy themselves usefully, that is to say therapeutically.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is intended to operate in cases where it is believed that a person is of unsound mind and, as a matter of urgency for the public safety or the safety of the person himself, should be placed under care and control. It puts beyond doubt the power of a member of the Garda Síochána to enter upon premises and to take <Col N="85" /> into custody such a person and to bring him, if necessary, to a Garda Síochána station.  This is a power which should, of course, be used in very exceptional circumstances only. It is true that Section 165 of the 1945 Act, as it stands, may be construed as conferring it.  Nevertheless, in view of the fundamental right which is involved, it is desirable to remove any possible doubt as to the legal position.</P>
    <P>Under the existing code, whenever it is desired that a patient should be admitted to hospital for detention otherwise than as a temporary patient, the applicant must be at least 21 years of age.  There is no such restriction in the case of an applicant for the reception of a temporary patient whether chargeable or private.  As it is desirable that nobody should be compulsorily detained in a mental hospital otherwise than on the application of a mature person, it is proposed that the age restriction which I have mentioned should apply also to applicants for the reception of temporary patients.  Provision is made accordingly in Section 16 in relation to chargeable patients and in Section 17 in relation to private patients.</P>
    <P>In addition, Section 17 will remove an inconsistency in the code.  The whole basis for the reception and detention of patients is medical certification; but, at present, the reception order in the case of a temporary private patient is made by the person in charge of the private hospital concerned, and he may happen not to be a doctor.  The section provides that, in future, in all cases the reception order must be made by a registered medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>The change proposed in Section 18 is an important one.  The section transfers from the Minister to the chief medical officer of the institution concerned the power to extend the period of detention of a temporary patient. Such a patient is, broadly, a person who is believed to require for his recovery not more than six months' suitable treatment, or an addict who by reason of his habits should be detained for his own sake in a mental institution for a limited period.  At present the initial period of detention is six months. Under the 1945 Act, power is vested in <Col N="86" /> the Minister for Health to grant extensions of this period up to a total of 18 months; so that in the case of a continuing temporary patient, the unbroken period of detention cannot exceed two years.  In the case of an addict, though the period of detention can be extended to two years, it has been my practice, and the practice of my predecessors, not to grant extensions beyond a period of one year. The practice is based on the belief that if his addiction is not successfully treated within 12 months, there is little prospect that the addict will ever overcome his propensity.  In asking the Oireachtas to transfer the power to grant an extension to chief medical officers, I propose, under subsection (1) (a) (i) of Section 18 that, in the case of an addict, it should be restricted to an extension or extensions not exceeding six months.  In the case of persons other than addicts, extensions up to 18 months may be granted.</P>
    <P>This House has always been, and very rightly so, extremely jealous in guarding the liberty of the subject and, before deciding to transfer from the Minister to the chief medical officer the power to grant an extension, I gave very careful consideration to the question of the extent, if any, to which in doing so I might be withdrawing a safeguard on the freedom of the individual. It will be appreciated that in deciding whether or not to grant an extension of the period of detention of a mental patient, the person who happens for the time being to be Minister has to rely on his professional advisers. In view of the number of extensions involved&mdash;about 3,000 per year at present&mdash;they in turn have to rely, to a very large extent, on the recommendation of the chief medical officer of the mental institution concerned; for it will be by sheer and rare accident that they will know the patient <i>qua</i> patient. Even in the exceptional case where they may remember having seen the patient, it will usually have been once or twice only and for short periods. Very, very rarely can they be in a position, from their own knowledge of him, to decide whether he should or should not be detained.  While in practice all applications are carefully <Col N="87" /> considered, invariably the word of the chief medical officer of the institution has to be accepted and the extension granted.  It will be appreciated, therefore, that the present procedure provides very little, if any, real safeguard.</P>
    <P>The new procedure which the Bill proposes to substitute for that now in force will, I suggest, not only preserve every possible existing safeguard but will constitute a more effective protection for the patient.  Under it the patient and the person who applied for the original reception order must be advised that they can send to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals an objection to the proposed extension.  On receipt of such an objection, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals will be obliged to call on the medical officer of the institution to submit a full report on the patient.  If, on consideration of this report, the Inspector has any doubt regarding the propriety of the detention of the patient, he must visit the patient, possibly several times, and take such other steps as he may consider necessary to satisfy himself on the matter.  If, having done all this, he still feels that the patient is improperly detained, he is obliged by Section 239 of the Principal Act to report this fact to the Minister, who, on the basis of all the considerable information then available, will decide whether or not to discharge the patient.  Furthermore, paragraph (b) of Section 33 imposes a duty on the inspector, on the occasions of his statutory visits to mental institutions, to pay particular attention to the condition of those patients in them whose periods of detention have been extended since his previous visit.</P>
    <P>Another important change, similar to that contained in Section 18, is contained in the section on repeals. Sections 197 and 202 and subsection (4) of Section 208 of the 1945 Act provide for the submission to the Minister of a mass of documents. Under the sections, notices of all receptions, departures, escapes, removals and deaths have to be submitted to the Minister.  In the case of temporary patients and persons of unsound mind, copies of the reception <Col N="88" /> documents and a report on the condition of the patient 21 days after his reception have also to be submitted. In all, this prescription applies to something like 38,000 documents each year.  The requirement is one that has obtained in this country since the middle of the last century.  In the circumstances of the times, it was probably assumed to be a safeguard against improper detention.  Therefore, when these documents reach my Department, they are examined closely to ensure that the facts recorded on the forms create a <i>prima facie</i> justification for the acts to which the forms relate.  But since the patient is not examined by my professional advisers, this routine scrutiny of documents cannot ensure that the statements made on the forms are accurate, or that any diagnosis made is correct.  As a safeguard to the patient the value of the whole procedure is, in fact, so limited as to be negligible, and I am satisfied that its continuation is not warranted.  I may say that a similar conclusion was reached by an expert committee of the World Health Organisation&mdash; Technical Report Series No. 98&mdash;and by the recent British Royal Commission on the Law Relating to Mental Illness and Mental Deficiency.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are in the Mental Treatment Acts real safeguards against the improper detention of patients.  Among them are:</P>
    <P>1.  The right which every patient has to have a letter forwarded, unopened, to any of the following: the Minister, the President of the High Court, the Registrar of Wards of Court, the Mental Hospital Authority and the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  In Section 36 of the Bill, the Oireachtas is being asked to add to these the Visiting Committee of a district mental hospital.  Arising out of any such letter, the Minister may arrange for an examination of a patient by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and for his discharge where justified; while similarly the President of the High Court may require the Inspector to visit and examine any patient detained and report to him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> 2.  The fact that any person may apply to the Minister for an order for the examination, by two medical practitioners, of a detained person and that the Minister must consider their report and may, if he thinks fit, direct the discharge of the patient.</P>
    <P>3.  The fact that the law specifically requires that a person who has recovered must be discharged.</P>
    <P>4.  The penalties which are imposed by the Act for detention otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>5.  The provision that the Inspector of Mental Hospitals must visit all mental institutions and that where the propriety of detention is doubtful, or where he is requested to do so by the patient himself, or by any other person, he has a duty to give special attention to the state of mind of any patient detained.</P>
    <P>6.  That any relative or friend may apply for the discharge of a patient and that, should the application be rejected by the medical officer of the institution on the certified ground that the person is unfit for discharge, an appeal lies to the Minister.</P>
    <P>7.  That every mental hospital authority must appoint a visiting committee, whose duties include a requirement to hear the complaints of any patient, and if requested to do so, to see him in private.</P>
    <P>I think that the House will agree that in removing the necessity for the submission to my Department of a great number of useless documents, I am not in any way increasing the risk of improper detention of any patient.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 and 20 dispense with the requirement for a medical recommendation for admission of the patient to a mental institution in the case of a voluntary patient, except in respect of a person under the age of 16 years.  I consider that a person over that age, <Col N="90" /> who feels that he should enter a mental hospital as a voluntary patient, should not be unduly discouraged by formal procedures, and that in such a case the requirement that a medical recommendation should be produced may be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 21 is similar to that of Section 13, viz. to provide that a reception order shall be valid irrespective of the place of ordinary residence.</P>
    <P>Section 22 and Sections 26-30 transfer to the resident medical superintendent of a district mental hospital the functions hitherto vested in the manager in relation to the release of patients on trial, to the giving of notices of recovery and to the discharge of patients.  I think that on consideration it will be generally agreed that the resident medical superintendent should be in a better position than the manager to exercise these functions.  He knows the patients and should be in a position to decide, from his own expert knowledge, whether it is appropriate that the particular patient concerned should be allowed out on trial or discharge. Similarly, it is proposed to transfer from the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to the person in charge, functions in relation to the release of a patient for a trial period&mdash;initially not exceeding 30 days&mdash;from a private mental institution.  The inspector will seldom, from his own knowledge, be in a position to say whether a patient should, or should not, be released on trial.  It is also proposed that, in a private institution where the person in charge is not a doctor, any notice of recovery must be given by a doctor.</P>
    <P>Section 31 gives a health authority a specific power, though subject to the sanction of the Minister for Health, to arrange for the after-care of patients. At present, apart from the very limited powers contained in Section 223 of the 1945 Act, regarding the visiting of a patient by a medical officer after discharge, there is no specific power in regard to the after-care of patients. The organisation and development of an after-care service under the Section should permit the earlier discharge of <Col N="91" /> patients and, in many cases, obviate the necessity of re-admission.</P>
    <P>Apart from those I have mentioned, the provisions in the Bill which relate to patients are mainly of a consequential, technical or administrative nature. I do not think any major principle is involved in any of them; and I would suggest that it would be more appropriate to deal in Committee with any points which may be raised on this Stage in regard to them.  So much for patients.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that the main purpose of the superannuation provisions is to bring mental hospital staff within the general scope of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956.  They will also transfer, from the Minister for Health to the Minister for Local Government, functions in relation to the superannuation of that staff.</P>
    <P>The Mental Treatment Act, 1945, and the Asylum Officers Superannuation Act, 1909, govern the superannuation of mental hospital staffs and under these Acts functions appertaining to the code are exercised by the Minister for Health.  The superannuation of all other local authority staff (with the sole exception of staff employed by harbour authorities) is governed by the Local Government (Superannuation) Acts&mdash;in particular the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956&mdash;for which the Minister for Local Government is the appropriate Minister.  With the exception of mental hospital staff, all staff otherwise engaged on health duties come within the scope of these Acts.  Since the coming into operation of the Health Authorities Act, 1960, and the abolition of mental hospital authorities as such, it is, I submit desirable to end the present anomalous position under which two separate superannuation codes are being applied to the two different groups of officers and servants engaged in the health services. Accordingly the Bill provides, by Section 41 and the First Schedule, that mental hospital staff shall be brought within the framework of the code relating to local authorities generally, with the Minister for Local <Col N="92" /> Government as the appropriate Minister.</P>
    <P>In the application of the Local Government code to mental hospital staffs, however, it is necessary to make a modification to reflect the special position of mental hospital personnel who have the care or charge of patients in the normal course of their duties.  In the Bill it is proposed to apply to them the same provisions as already apply to fire brigade officers and servants.  The effect of these provisions will be to continue the arrangement under which in the calculation of superannuation, each year of service in excess of twenty will count as two, and retirement is possible at the age of 55 instead of at the age of 60.</P>
    <P>To preserve certain rights of existing officers in the mental health service, however, it is proposed to make a number of special provisions.  At present mental hospital staffs pay a 3 per cent. superannuation contribution and other local authority staffs first appointed on or after 1st April, 1948, pay a higher contribution&mdash;5 per cent. for officers and 4 ? per cent. for servants.  It is proposed that any existing officer or servant in the mental hospital service will not be required to pay a higher contribution than 3 per cent. during such time as he continues to be employed in the local authority service.  Furthermore, staff who are now in the service and who have the care or charge of patients in the normal course of their duties and are subject to the superannuation provisions of the 1945 Act, have the benefit of an existing provision which enables a superannuation award to be made to the widow and/or orphan of a person dying in the service from any physical or mental illness contracted in the service &mdash;not necessarily in the course of duty. Under the Local Government code, such awards can be made only if death results from injury sustained in the course of duty.  The rights, which existing officers and servants enjoy under the 1945 Act, are thus being preserved under the Bill.  Officers and servants, however, who are still governed by the 1909 Act have not the right to <Col N="93" /> which I have just referred, as they opted out of the superannuation provisions of the 1945 Act.  Under the Bill, however, they are being afforded a second opportunity of acquiring it.</P>
    <P>Detailed discussion of the very complicated superannuation provisions is a matter for Committee Stage but it may be convenient if I put on record now the main respects in which, as I see it, mental hospital staffs, present and future, stand to gain or to lose under the present proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I propose to enumerate, first the main gains.  These may be summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Allowances and lump sums will be calculated, normally, on the basis of remuneration at the date of retirement and not, as at present, on the basis of an average remuneration over a period of 3 years.</P>
    <P>2.  If an officer or servant sustains an injury, in the course of duty, and he dies, within 7 years, as a direct result of the injury, a gratuity or allowance may be paid to the widow or widower, as the case may be, to a dependent father or mother and to, or in respect of, dependent children.  Under the mental treatment code the position is, broadly, that not only must death occur in service, but gratuities, or allowances are payable only to widows and children and not to widowers or to dependent parents.</P>
    <P>3.  A short service gratuity will be payable after 1 year of service.  A minimum qualifying period of 10 years is necessary under the 1909 Act and of 5 years under the 1945 Act.</P>
    <P>4.  An allowance and lump sum will be payable, on reaching an age limit, after 10 years' service.  The qualifying period under the mental treatment code is 20 years.</P>
    <P>5.  In the case of officers added years for superannuation purposes may be granted in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956.  The chief advantages of these provisions are that years may be added in respect of professional qualifications, in respect of temporary <Col N="94" /> service immediately preceding permanent service and in cases where the officer retires due to an age limit imposed after his appointment.</P>
    <P>6.  Superannuation benefits will be payable to servants who are not continuously employed but who work more than 200 days, in a year.</P>
    <P>The items on the debit side I should emphasise apply to future entrants only.  They are, I think, two in number.</P>
    <P>The first is that future entrants will have to pay the normal Local Government superannuation contribution, 5 per cent. for officers and 4? per cent. for servants as against a flat 3 per cent. as at present.</P>
    <P>The second is that future entrants will be eligible for allowances for widows and orphans only if death is due to injury sustained in the course of duty, and not, as at present in respect of death in service, whether it is due to injury or not.</P>
    <P>I have not listed as a credit or a debit the fact that future servants will be superannuated on the basis of sixtieths with no lump sum as against the present eightieths plus a lump sum. According to the circumstances of the individual concerned, it could be either.</P>
    <P>In general, I am satisfied that the new provisions will be more advantageous than the present ones for existing staff.  In case, however, any officer or servant may feel that the existing provisions are more favourable in his particular case, he will have the option of deciding, within 12 months of the coming into operation of Section 41, that the new provisions shall not apply to him&mdash;and that instead he shall remain as he is while he continues to be a mental hospital officer or servant.  It is my intention, in due course, to have a detailed memorandum prepared in language as simple as so complex a subject permits, setting out the differences between the two codes, so that each officer and servant can decide for himself whether he wishes to exercise his option to remain subject to the provisions which at present apply to him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> Section 40 covers the position of a person who was a civil servant, before a mental hospital officer, and then became a civil servant for a second time.  The section is designed to remove a doubt as to whether his first period of service in the Civil Service can now be reckoned for superannuation purposes.</P>
    <P>It will be noted from Section 43 that the provision in regard to superannuation shall come into operation on the 1st day of April.  This requirement is necessary to keep these provisions in line with those in the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956. It is my hope that it will be possible to have this Bill enacted in time to bring into operation, on 1st April next, the special provisions contained in the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, in relation to servants who are not continuously employed, but who work for a minimum of 200 working days per year.</P>
    <P>There is one further point which I think I would like to mention.  Most of the proposals for amendment of the superannuation provisions are contained in the First Schedule.  The Bill was drafted in this way solely in order to avoid what could otherwise have been a very clumsy section containing sixteen subsections.  On Committee Stage I shall be fully agreeable to whatever latitude the Chair may be prepared to allow to ensure that the many provisions contained in it be debated in as much detail as is desired.</P>
    <P>I have already suggested that this Bill is one more appropriate for detailed discussion on Committee Stage than on Second Stage, and I trust that the Dáil will agree with that view. Before the Committee Stage, which I propose to suggest should not be ordered for a date less than a fortnight hence, I shall give careful consideration to any views which may be expressed in the course of the debate or to my Department later.  If I cannot meet Deputies in relation to the matters they raise, they will still have the opportunity of tabling their own amendments, and these can be debated in detail in Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which the Minister has moved is largely an administrative measure and I agree with the suggestion which the Minister made that the discussion on it will be largely a Committee discussion. While the Bill is an administrative measure, since it relates to mental treatment and to the problem of mental illness it is true to say that many Deputies may have been looking for something new in this Bill and some more concrete proposals in relation to the mental health service.  In fact, there is nothing of that kind in this Bill.  There are a few minor amendments of the Mental Treatment Act providing for certification and reception and for the increase in the periods under which temporary patients may be detained, but these amendments do not amount to a great deal.</P>
      <P>The problem of how best to organise the mental health service remains virtually untouched.  The Minister knows, and most Deputies realise, that the mental health service continues to be the Cinderella of our health services. It suffers from years of neglect; it suffers from lack of attention in the past and I should like to express regret that at this stage the Minister is not in a position to offer any concrete proposals for a new deal in mental health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the fact that there are 19,000 to 20,000 patients in our district mental hospitals.  That figure has been pretty static throughout the years.  It is a very high proportion for our population. So far as I am aware it has not altered in any way in the last 20 years or so, and certainly not since the Mental Treatment Act of 1945.  The fact is that in many of our district mental hospitals patients are maintained&mdash;not treated, many of them cannot be treated&mdash;in appalling circumstances.  The conditions of overcrowding in certain hospitals amount to a public scandal.  That problem has naturally not been created by the Minister.  It has been there for a long time.  It is a problem which was there before the Minister went into office.  What I complain <Col N="97" /> about is that the Minister has no suggestion to make in regard to it.  He talks about a commission.  A commission is a very old Ministerial gimmick to have a problem forgotten by having it discussed by a commission.</P>
    <P>The problem of overcrowding in the different district mental hospitals is, apparently, going to remain unattended. Everybody knows that in many of these hospitals there are numbered amongst the patients old, senile cases, chronic bed cases, poor old people who are suffering from mental deterioration as a result of old age and who normally would be accommodated and looked after in county homes.  In fact, many of them are in our hospitals and that leads to overcrowding and apparently no real progress has been made in bringing about a change.</P>
    <P>While I am critical of what I regard as the lack of progress, I should not like to say that the Minister is wrong in any way in having the problem of mental treatment examined even now. He has told us that he is establishing a second commission to work with the commission already announced, which is dealing with the problem of mentally handicapped children.  That is probably a good thing.  It comes a bit late but at least it may mean an examination will take place now of the whole problem and that from the work of the commission sometime in the future concrete proposals will be announced and a change may come about.  It is a pity that that is only being done now but I suppose we should be thankful that at least it is being done even at this late stage.</P>
    <P>The amendments of the Mental Treatment Act so far as patients are concerned are generally desirable.  I always thought it anomalous that a patient could be certified only by a particular doctor and that frequently the doctor, who might be a family doctor or indeed a specialist in mental illness, was not authorised or in a position to certify.  That amendment is a desirable one and I welcome it. Other amendments mentioned by the Minister are in relation to the question of authorising payment for services rendered by patients of mental hospitals <Col N="98" /> and this has been a difficult problem over the years.  I suppose there are two points of view on it but I accept what the Minister says, that it is desirable that authorisation should be given in recognition of a situation which apparently already exists in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in providing that the chief medical officer should have the restrictive power to extend the period of detention of temporary patients.  In the way the Minister proposes to amend the law it will mean there will be a real consideration by a person having a direct responsibility to make an extension of the period of detention.  In the long run that is more in the interests of the individual.</P>
    <P>The other change mentioned by the Minister, the transfer from the manager to the resident medical superintendent of the power to approve of the discharge of a patient, is an eminently sensible change.  Obviously, it was quite wrong that that power should have been exercisable&mdash;I know it was done on advice&mdash;by a lay person. It is obviously much better that that power should now be given to the R.M.S. of the hospital concerned.</P>
    <P>Generally, the Bill being an administrative one, I would support the changes suggested by the Minister. With regard to the superannuation provisions, we might all feel that it would be better to discuss those in detail at a later stage.  Obviously, there may be particular points about those provisions on which we might seek further information from the Minister at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should begin by expressing my appreciation of the comprehensive speech of the Minister and of the way in which he has handled the introduction of this amending Bill.  The Minister has given us a very comprehensive report and has had the courtesy to distribute copies of it.  He had already supplied Deputies with a very comprehensive White Paper dealing with the Bill with additional documentary information that would help any Deputy who was anxious to understand the effects of this Bill as against <Col N="99" /> the various Mental Treatment Acts that have preceded it.  That is a headline that might very well be copied by other Ministers and I express on behalf of my Party our appreciation of that treatment.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this is not a Bill for Second Reading speeches. If there is any useful work that can be done on the Bill it will come on Committee Stage and it is on that Stage that the document supplied by the Minister's Department within the last week will be of great use and will obviate the necessity for the awful research work that many of us cannot undertake because of pressure of other business with the result that we cannot be as well informed as we might be as to the intention of legislation.</P>
      <P>I think I would be correct in saying that the Minister has had discussions with the various trade unions who deal with the welfare of staff.  If he has not had such discussions, he must have some inside knowledge because many of the proposals and amendments desired by trade unions at the early stage are incorporated in the Bill.  The Minister was very wise in his attitude in that regard.  In dealing with the superannuation of staffs, he has made provisions that should be suitable to all concerned.  In particular, he was very wise in giving to existing servants the opportunity of opting to accept the provisions of this Bill or to remain under the preceding Acts.  That was very wise and should lead to general acceptance of the position by those in actual charge of patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not necessary to state to the Minister or to anybody else that a contented staff dealing with mental patients is of the utmost importance. Patients suffering from mental disorders need all the kindness, consideration and attention that it is possible to give them.  Such patients try the nerves of those dealing with them.  If you have a discontented staff or a staff labouring under the belief that they have been treated wrongly or shabbily, that will have a detrimental effect on the running of the hospitals. The Minister has gone a long way to <Col N="100" /> avoid that.  It is on the Committee Stage that necessary alterations can be suggested.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Higgins, I welcome the Minister's decision to legalise payment of patients.  Even though it is only in a small way, that provision will encourage patients to take up employment of various kinds.  As the Minister knows, payment, if not in cash, was certainly given in kind by many resident medical superintendents who felt it desirable to encourage patients to rehabilitate themselves and to prepare for final discharge.  It is well that these things should be done openly and that they should not have to be done behind doors, as it were, rather than in the open light of day.</P>
    <P>There is one very minor matter which occurs to me.  The Minister proposes to give members of a mental hospital visiting committee the right to receive letters or complaints from patients.  It seems strange that he has not seen fit to include a provision whereby a member of the Oireachtas would have the same right as a member of a mental hospital visiting committee. The person most likely to receive complaints in a letter smuggled out or sent out openly is a member of Dáil Éireann.  Deputies are in the public eye and I have repeatedly received letters from patients and, where I felt it necessary to do so, have investigated. I was aided, of course, by the fact that I was also a member of a mental hospital committee but if I should find myself in the position of being a Deputy and not being a member of the health authority, I would be excluded from the right to receive a private letter from a patient if the R.M.S. so decided.  I do not feel that there is any danger but it might be just as well to include members of the Oireachtas as well as members of the mental hospital visiting committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  It depends on how anxious people are to interest themselves in mental patients. Most people are quite happy to leave them there and forget about them and <Col N="101" /> to say, if they get a letter from such a patient, &ldquo;He is certified as insane.&rdquo;  A complaint from a mental patient can be ignored on, the grounds that the person making it is insane.  That is the gravest danger.  Personally, I pay more attention to a letter that I get from a man who is certified as insane than I do to the letter from the insane people outside who are not certified.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that consideration should be given to the problem of overcrowding.  It was regrettable that some years ago an order went out from the Department to transfer all feeble-minded people from county homes to mental hospitals. That was done about the time the war started, if my memory is right. It was a mistake.  It resulted in grave overcrowding, certainly in my constituency. Many old people of feeble mind rather than mentally ill, were transferred from the county home to the mental hospital and occupied much-needed beds.  A reversal of that policy would be very desirable but I may be anticipating a matter that will be dealt by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the commission.  They have a big task. There is another commission to report on mentally handicapped children.  I do not know whether or not it is a good thing to have two separate commissions, but I accept what the Minister has said.  The problem is so big that it might delay recommendations that are urgently needed if one commission had to deal with all aspects. The after-care of patients is of the utmost importance.  In the past I have taken a very keen interest in the question of mental treatment and also in the problem of after-care on the discharge of the patient. Not only is there necessity for after-care on there is grave need for a rehabilitation scheme.  I remember the case of a man who was discharged from a mental hospital and who because he could not secure employment went back repeatedly to the mental hospital.  Through the co-operation of a good employer he was given an opportunity of engaging in useful employment and he made good.  That was years ago and now he is a well-conducted and dutifully-working citizen.  The R.M.S. agreed with me <Col N="102" /> that it was due mainly to the fact that he was unable to get employment that he had to return to the hospital repeatedly in the past.</P>
    <P>Some agency or some body of people will have to be established to ensure that these patients secure employment when they are discharged from hospital. Whatever about delay in the case of people who are physically afflicted, there is great danger for the person who comes out cured from a mental institution and is unable to secure employment that will occupy him.  There is greater danger of his going back again than in the case of a person physically affected.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my Party I welcome this Bill.  We shall co-operate with the Minister in seeing that it is passed into law before the date he suggests, 1st April.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with other speakers in welcoming this Bill. I agree with Deputy T.F. O'Higgins that mental treatment and mental health have been regarded as the Cinderella of the services.  That attitude is changing now and changing rapidly. There is abundant evidence of people going voluntarily for treatment for mental illness.  That is a new development and a very welcome one.  In Cork we had to increase the number of clinics for treating people who come voluntarily.</P>
      <P>We all agree with Deputy Kyne that overcrowding is a very serious drawback. I am glad to say that in Cork we have been able to improve the position to some extent by providing an ex-sanatorium for some 180 to 200 old ladies.  I am firmly convinced that there are too many people in mental institutions whose only fault is that they have grown old.  I wonder are they fit and proper inmates for a mental institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Minister is treating the staffs sympathetically. Anybody who has to deal with mentally ill patients is a man or woman with a special vocation and it is well that there should be no impediment to the proper performance of the service they give to those unfortunate people.  On behalf of my constituency, which contains a very big mental institution, <Col N="103" /> I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for his interest in these mentally afflicted people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this Bill goes I welcome it.  I realise the Minister and his Department have put a great deal of study into the matter of producing a Mental Treatment Bill.  It is one of those Bills that could very easily become unconstitutional if it were not very carefully looked into. In fact I have heard the rumour that there have been several previous attempts to produce a Mental Treatment Bill and the legal advisers of the Government of the day advised that they would want to go carefully at it if they were to confine themselves within the Constitution.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a complex matter in mental health, a matter which one can truthfully say has been somewhat neglected over the years in relation to other medical services that have been introduced. When he was introducing the Bill the Minister could perhaps have endeavoured to embody in that Bill provisions to deal with the outstanding mental problems that face us today. While saying that, I fully appreciate what the Minister has said, that this is an instalment of things to come, that he has set up a commission and that he prefers to wait until that commission issues its findings or its views before moving further in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals mainly with the ordinary district mental hospitals in relation to chargeable patients and private patients.  However, it is impossible to divorce them entirely from the mentally defective child.  Unfortunately in many of our hospitals we find mentally defective children.  Through force of circumstances they are being put into these hospitals.  There is nowhere else to put them.  The waiting list is so extensive that parents, finding for domestic reasons, and so on, they cannot keep these children at home, have to send them somewhere and there is nowhere to send them except to a mental hospital.  As regards the overcrowding referred to by Deputy O'Higgins, a great deal of that could be eliminated if there were some <Col N="104" /> immediate accommodation for the mentally defective child.  For that reason I regret the Minister and his advisers have not been able to think out some scheme for dealing with this problem as a matter of urgency so that it would receive the degree of attention that is so vital to it.</P>
    <P>Our tremendous difficulty in Ireland is that we have not been able to deal with the problem of the mentally defective child.  There is the continuous inflow of these cases and there is no outflow.  The Minister might consider on a later stage of this Bill embodying a provision to deal with the damming-up in the mental institutions which are available to children so as to release at one end some of the cases in order to make room for the urgent cases that are waiting in many families.</P>
    <P>As a man with medical qualifications I receive correspondence relating to this problem and I am cognisant of a case in my own constituency of a family where there are three mentally defective children waiting for admission to the hospital.  Their ages are ten, nine and seven.</P>
    <P>Anybody with any knowledge of mentally defective children knows that unless they are taken at an early age for treatment, they have no chance of ever benefiting from it. That is the immediate problem facing the Minister and his advisers.  No one can directly blame the Minister or his present advisers for this state of affairs; it has existed and has become aggravated throughout the years.  A really practical approach should be made to it as soon as possible to enable at least some defective children to be taken to hospital for immediate treatment.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the devoted services of the St. John of God Brothers and I should like to pay tribute to them for the work they have done over long hours with small staffs, with no reference to trade union hours, because they never consider anything but the service they give to humanity.  The same applies to the Sisters of Charity in respect of the female patients.  These Orders find themselves short of staff because, I suppose, in this material <Col N="105" /> age, there are not so many religious vocations or perhaps it is because there are more outlets for religious life and more people may go into foreign fields to give their services there.</P>
    <P>The institutions are under-staffed and over-stocked with patients.  In most cases, they cannot get rid of patients: once taken on, it is found that in spite of all the service and treatment given, the same patients or a majority of them are still there at the end of a period.  I suggest that the Minister and his Department should give serious consideration to the possibility of having a full discussion with these religious Orders and with other institutions doing similar work&mdash;I think the Church of Ireland institutions also do it.  It could be considered whether it would be possible for them to acquire premises with State funds where they might lay off those patients who are not acutely affected, who have improved to some extent, so that they might run a farm. If the Orders were able to buy a fairly big estate, they might get some of the patients to work on the land and provide food for themselves as well as employment, so that they would feel they were leading useful lives.  They might even help to provide food and keep down expenses in the existing institutions of these Orders.  It does not seem to be a very difficult problem if faced in that way.</P>
    <P>On average, I think one might say that of 100 patients who go in, probably 20 or 25 per cent. could be laid off in that way.  That would considerably decrease the heavy charge on existing institutions and to a large extent it would obviate the need to send cases into ordinary mental institutions, cases that were never intended to be sent there, cases that can never benefit from being there and are sent there only for domestic reasons and because they must be sent somewhere.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister and his advisers would consider that point and see if they could tackle the problem in that way as an acute emergency, on a temporary basis, while awaiting the report of the Commission.  Commissions <Col N="106" /> always give devoted service but take a long time to produce reports because they must get all the evidence and facts.  A great many of the facts I have cited are fully known to the Minister and his officials.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I regret that something has not been done already to deal with this acute problem.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister and his advisers are alive to it.  I welcome the Bill and the idea behind it, which is to keep in line with modern trends and development.  As the Minister said, some years ago, people went into hospital and stayed there perhaps indefinitely.  There was not anything like the proportion of recoveries that we find today.  Now, with modern medical aid and therapeutic treatment particularly&mdash;I think the electric shock seems to cure people quicker than anything else&mdash;many who previously would stay in institutions and become chronic cases now recover within a comparatively short time and can be discharged.</P>
    <P>Two things appear to be necessary: to get patients who require treatment into the treatment centre as quickly as possible and to get them discharged with the greatest possible facility. Therefore, I am glad to see several innovations in this Bill.  One practically amounts to a choice of doctor.  The family doctor, in spite of the tendency towards State medical services, is still the confidant of the people he treats and for that reason the advice he gives will be taken and acted on.  It is always difficult to advise relatives that it is necessary to send somebody to a mental institution.  It is not difficult, of course, when they have six or 12 months or two years' experience of trying to look after the patient but it is difficult in the early stages when it is so vital to get the patient transferred to hospital for treatment immediately. The person who will now give that advice is the family doctor and his advice will be taken.  The anomalous situation up to this was that he could not certify the patient and that is one of the big difficulties removed in this Bill.  I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Any family doctor, district medical officer or whatever he may be called <Col N="107" /> under the modern medical service code, is now free to certify a patient and send him to an institution.  Previously, when a patient was about to be discharged, he had to go through cumbersome machinery and have the papers sent to the Minister.  I have not been a Deputy for 10 years without knowing what sending papers to a Minister means.  It means the documents go to the advisers who send them to experts in the Departments; the experts send them back and gradually they go up to the top.  Eventually, they come to the Minister and the patient is discharged.  That procedure is abolished under this Bill and as far as I can see, it is the doctor who is attending a patient, who is in a position to know his health, at the time he is to be discharged who will now be free to discharge him.  He is really the person who knows.  Not having much experience of medical matters in mental hospitals, I imagine if a doctor were discharging a patient through this complicated, antediluvian machinery which existed, he would want about three months' notice unless the Minister and his officials were prepared to work overtime.  Three months was the minimum required because of all this unnecessary machinery.  The doctor had to approach people who really knew nothing at all about the patient.  I welcome the proposed change.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that there is a certain element of risk.  There is also a certain element of risk in the admission of a patient.  The papers may not be sent on and the Department may not be cognisant of what is actually taking place.  I think there are adequate safeguards in this Bill.  It is our fundamental duty to protect these people because they are unable to protect themselves.  If it is felt there are not sufficient safeguards that is a matter that can be discussed on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly which hitherto existed is also being removed by this measure.  The Minister is now making it possible for an ordinary practitioner to seek the assistance of the Garda to take a patient to hospital and the <Col N="108" /> responsibility is on the Garda to provide transport.  There have been cases where people with no means had to be taken to mental hospitals.  Transport had to be provided.  There were often considerable delays in getting the necessary order and the necessary authority.  That delay will be obviated under this measure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill subject to the reservations I made at the outset. Steps should have been taken to deal with mentally defective children so as to avoid their being admitted to ordinary wards in mental hospitals.  A lot of useful discussion lies ahead of us on the Committee Stage of this measure. I confess I have not read the Bill <i>in toto</i> but I have read the Minister's speech.  I glanced through the White Paper this afternoon.  Subject to the reservations I mentioned, I welcome the Bill.  I have no doubt we will have a very useful discussion on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other speakers in welcoming this Bill.  I agree with them that it is very largely a Committee Stage Bill.  There are, however, one or two points I should like to put forward at this stage.  I endorse what Deputy Esmonde has said with regard to mentally defective children.  They present one of the most urgent problems in the sphere of mental health.  I must admit that in my county we do not suffer from the problem of overcrowding. I understand overcrowding is a very serious problem in other areas. In our mental hospital, while everything in the garden is not lovely, there is really no serious overcrowding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of the visiting committee for a number of years and I appreciate that the problem of mentally defective children is a serious one.  Hospitalisation after the present fashion must be bad for the children and distressing for some of the adult patients.  Like Deputy Esmonde, I welcome the improved machinery for committal and discharge.  On the question of transport, I shall have a word or two to say on Section 12 of the Bill on the Committee Stage.  The section does not appear to me to be <Col N="109" /> absolutely clear as to whose is the responsibility in the matter of transport.</P>
    <P>I believe that the biggest handicap in the treatment of mental disorders is financial.  I think this should be treated as a national problem.  I am not a member of the local authority and I have no particular local gun to fire but I believe that if we dealt with this as a national problem there would be greater uniformity of treatment in the various areas.  At the moment conditions in the different hospitals vary very much.  One of the first things that should be provided in a mental hospital is a completely different type of surroundings from those which obtain at present.  I am not a medical man.  I can only speak as a result of my own observation and in the light of the experience gained from hearing medical men discussing the problem.  One of the most important steps in the treatment of mental illness is to get a condition of greater normalcy around the patient.  Confining people in such obviously institutional-like buildings can scarcely be conducive to a speedy return to mental normality.</P>
    <P>Another disadvantage arises in regard to admission.  Different types of patients are banded together in one admission block.  A voluntary patient suffering from nervous strain, for instance, may find himself in a ward with two or three mentally defective children who scream all night.  That is the worst possible environment in which to place someone suffering from some mild neurosis as a result of being run down.  We have attempted to improve on that situation in Donegal.  We have improved admission conditions but, for financial reasons, we have not been able to do any more than tinker with the problem.</P>
    <P>I believe the State should come in on this and not leave so much to the local authority.  As a result of ten years of experience on a local authority, I know that one of the first cock-shies when an attempt was being made to reduce the rates by one penny in the £ was the mental hospital.  No one seemed to want to know that there was a mental <Col N="110" /> hospital, and the first thing that would be done to reduce the rates was to dock the mental hospital.  I believe things have improved slightly, but there is still this shocking problem with regard to finance.  With the rates running at close on 50/- in the £, one can well appreciate that the members of the local authority have to be very, very cautious indeed.  That is one of the main reasons why I contend that the treatment of mental health should be a national problem.  It is not easy for an ordinary member of the public who has not much experience of the work of a mental hospital to appreciate what is really needed.  The ordinary county councillor looking, for instance, at St. Conal's Hospital, Letterkenny, will see it is a very fine building and that everything is extremely good.  Topographically, the situation is excellent.  The building, even though it is very fine, has the slight defect that a good deal of money would need to be spent to make it less institutional.  We have endeavoured to provide better furniture and to create better conditions and we have provided a canteen.  I welcome, therefore, the provision in the Bill by which the patients can earn some money to spend at a canteen.  Having the patients able to do at least that much, in the same way as they would do it at home or outside, is a very great help.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to see that extended.  I should like to see a far more dynamic drive.  That drive must, I think, come from the centre.  It cannot be left to the local authorities, who do not know very much about it.  This problem is one of getting away from the institutional atmosphere and providing better amenities for the people who have the misfortune to suffer from mental illness.  In the long run, it will be cheaper for the State because modern developments over the past ten or 15 years have brought down tremendously the average length of stay.  It could be reduced very much more if we could get into the mental hospital more of the outside atmosphere.</P>
    <P>One thing that should be striven for is a getting away from the segregation <Col N="111" /> of the sexes.  In the better mental hospitals across the Irish sea, the patients are allowed to mix in the canteen.  I shall not say there is a club atmosphere there, but a club atmosphere would be an excellent thing and a very great help in restoring many people to better mental health.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as a step in the right direction.  I hope the Minister will not rest at this and that he might even be tempted to do a bit more before he gets the reports from the Commissions. As an ex-Minister for Finance, the Minister knows just how much chance he has talking with the present Minister for Finance about more money.  It is not altogether a question of spending more money than is being spent at present.  I should like to see the charge removed from the local authorities and put on the Central Fund, not so much to save the local rates as to get more equality of treatment, better standards all through and a more dynamic approach. I do not think that can come from anywhere but the Department and I hope the Minister will be encouraged to go on those lines.</P>

      <P>This Bill will be accepted, I feel sure, as a progressive development of the very enlightened and humane measure introduced by Dr. Ryan in 1945 and passed by this House. The Minister must be complimented on its provisions.  They will lead to a better approach to the whole question of mental treatment, thus giving the people a more confident feeling about the prospects of a cure.  Formerly people were committed to the mental hospital if they got a serious nervous breakdown or something of that kind. However, in 1945, Dr. Ryan envisaged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Dr. Ryan was Minister at the time and Dr. Ward was Parliamentary Secretary.  It was set out at that time that there would be a period of observation before a patient was committed so that there would be a chance of curing the ailment, as very often happens, in the first three or six months.  Unfortunately, there were <Col N="112" /> not sufficient facilities to carry out the provisions of that Bill and it is only now that in certain places the Minister has made arrangements to have separate institutions available so that patients will not have direct contact with the mental hospital until a stage is reached when an immediate cure is not anticipated.</P>
      <P>As far as children are concerned, the Minister is wise in treating that problem in a different manner by setting up a separate commission.  Experiments have been carried out for some time on what may be done for the treatment of mentally defective children. As Deputy Sheldon has said, provision is being made whereby contact with the home is not broken.  Those who are less seriously ill go home every night and those who are more seriously ill are kept in the hospital until the weekend, but they go home during the weekend.  They are being attended to by nurses and teachers who are specially trained.  They are being cared for in institutions which are partly schools and partly clinics.  However, that is another day's work.  But a start has been made and I am sure it will produce very good results.</P>
      <P>I am glad also that the Minister in this measure has given the opportunity to the very few workers in the institutions who did not avail of the pension provisions in the previous Acts to benefit now.  Generally, I think this Bill is a great step forward.  We all welcome it and congratulate the Minister on its introduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is mainly a consolidation Bill revising many of the sections of the previous Mental Treatment Acts to give us more streamlined legislation in relation to this problem of mental health.  Because of the rapid advance in the science of mental health treatment over the past 20 years, legislation should be modernised to keep pace with the progress made.  To-day we have the situation where the number of persons undergoing mental treatment who are discharged perfectly fit is far in excess of the number who have to remain in hospital for long periods or permanently. Previous to this, it was regarded almost as a miracle if a <Col N="113" /> patient recovered and was able to come out.  With the increased tempo of modern life, many people are affected mentally one way or another, but modern treatment can cope with them and they can come back into ordinary everyday life and occupation very soon.</P>
      <P>It is a boast in the mental hospitals of Dublin city and county that the number of their patients at the moment is about 20 per cent. of the total number treated during the year.  In other words, four times that number of persons have been treated, cured and sent back to ordinary everyday life during the year, but there is a very great accommodation problem in Dublin city and county.</P>
      <P>There was an overflow from Grangegorman Mental Hospital and it was necessary to obtain accommodation in a T.B. sanatorium to which the surplus mental patients could be moved. In fact, two T.B. sanatoria have been, if you like, commandeered for that purpose.  That demonstrates the very great lack of accommodation in our existing mental hospitals.  In order to cope with the demand for treatment of mental cases and accommodation for them, instead of being driven to build extra hospitals or extend the existing ones, we may be obliged to move our mental patients into the sanatoria which are falling empty as a result of the fact that T.B. is now almost a thing of the past and does not require as much accommodation as it did.  The problem of providing accommodation for mental patients is a real problem in Dublin city and county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear mention of juvenile mental patients being housed with adult mental patients in our hospitals. That is a very serious problem and one which should be dealt with as soon as possible.  The question of handicapped children has been neglected for a long time.  We have had the situation in which parents to whom a mentally handicapped child for whom they cannot secure suitable accommodation away from the home, is a hindrance or a nuisance in their efforts to rear the rest of the family. <Col N="114" /> That problem is being tackled now and it is to their credit that a number of organisations got together and established institutions of their own where these mentally handicapped children could be accommodated and catered for, and treated as they are at the present time.</P>
    <P>With regard to patients who are fit to work being paid in return for work they are capable of performing, I think that is a very good idea.  I know that in Portrane quite a number of male patients are fit, well and capable of doing a man's work on the land, cultivating crops, looking after cows and pigs, and feeding and watering livestock in the farmyards.  They are certainly doing a good day's work and they deserve to be paid.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to mention is that in these institutions one frequently finds a person who is lost to the world.  He is there in the institution and has no one to take him out, or no one to go back to.  It seems that he just got in as a mental case and was left there.  Something ought to be done in order to steer those people back out into the world.  They appear to be quite sane, but, as I say, they do not seem to have anyone to claim them out.  That was the technical position&mdash;possibly it has been remedied but the impression is still there.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section of the Bill in which there is an option in relation to superannuation.  In the 1949 Mental Treatment Act, there was a clause giving the staff the option of coming under the proposed new superannuation scheme or of availing of the benefits provided by the previous Mental Treatment Act of 1909, I think.  A number of people who decided at that time that the existing scheme suited them found later that the 1949 superannuation scheme gave greater advantages.  They were not able to avail of those advantages because there was a time limit and when they did not opt to avail of the new scheme within the time limit, they had to remain in the scheme in which they were already included.  Naturally enough, it took time for a number of them to see that they would be better off if they accepted the new scheme <Col N="115" /> that was offered to them.  This Bill now gives them the option of coming under the new superannuation scheme, having regard to modern conditions and in the light of their experience of the old superannuation scheme.  That is a welcome inclusion in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree that this is mainly a Committee Stage Bill.  The question of accommodation will have to be tackled.  The old buildings&mdash;although some of them have been improved and extended&mdash;are not capable of accommodating the large number if patients who have to avail of mental treatment at one time or another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will be generally welcome particularly in respect of some items which will help towards the rehabilitation of patients in mental hospitals, for instance, the provision to give payment for work done, which will make patients feel they have a useful part to play in society. Again, I should like to extend a welcome to the provision dealing with after-care and the general rehabilitation of patients.</P>
      <P>Probably the only real way of securing the rehabilitation of patients would be to try to do away with some of the horribly gloomy buildings in which they are locked at the moment, and the horribly gloomy clothing which they seem to be compelled to wear.  They are gloomy and depressing and they create an atmosphere which I imagine is completely contrary to the atmosphere we should all like such people to exist in. Like Deputy Rooney, I should like to pay tribute to the people who have done so much for the mentally handicapped and retarded children.</P>
      <P>I should also like to make a slight reference to the manner in which the Bill was presented to the House.  The arrangement of sections and the description is inadequate.  We are simply given the section of the old Act and an indication that it is an amendment. That does not indicate to the practitioner or anybody reading the Bill what each section deals with.  Maybe something could be done with that at this stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to acknowledge the help the Minister has given in the presentation of this new Mental Treatment Bill.  All of us agree, from the speeches we have heard, that the Minister has gone out of his way in a complicated Bill of this kind to provide us with all the information possible. He has done it in three different ways&mdash;(1) in the Bill; (2) in an excellent White Paper and, more particularly, (3) in this booklet to which he has just referred and which he proposes to tidy up when the Bill is passed.  It is very necessary that a book of that kind should be available to enable not alone those engaged in mental treatment to be conversant with complicated Acts of Parliament but also the general public because it has been a source of mystery to some people how people can be committed, detained in or discharged from a mental hospital as well as the functions of doctors, nurses, managers, and so on.</P>
      <P>It is a good thing, too, that the Minister did not represent this Bill to be anything more than it is.  It is not intended to be the last piece of legislation to deal with the problem of mental illness.  The Minister made that clear at the beginning of his speech.  He said the Bill was designed to effect desirable but not necessarily basic changes in the 1945 Act. Therefore, it would be wrong for any of us to read into the Bill more than is in it.  The provisions are pretty small.  They have nothing to do, really, with a genuine improvement in tackling the problem of mental illness. In effect, they are tightening up a lot of things that needed to be tightened up since the 1945 Bill was enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated he is dependent to a very large extent on the two commissions he has established to gather information and to report to him on the problem of mental illness.  I do not know whether or not he is wise in that.  I do not say I am against the appointment of a commission. We have had a plague of commissions in recent years not alone by this Government but by the last Government and by the one that went before it, and so on.  I expected when I set up the Commission on Workmen's <Col N="117" /> Compensation that it would report in a matter of at least 12 months. Now we discover it has gone on for at least four years.  I know it is very difficult to get people and to expect them to devote a good deal of their time to a commission of this type and to report within a reasonable period. I merely ask the Minister to do what he can to get the commission to collect this very necessary information and to make a report as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The problem of mental illness is very urgent as was the problem of T.B. in this country some ten or 15 years ago when it can be said the disease or illness was at its peak.  I wonder, therefore, whether we should not tackle the problem of mental illness in the same manner as Ministers in the course of the past 15 or 20 years tackled the problem of T.B.  That problem was successfully tackled in a relatively short time.  Full credit must be paid to the various Ministers for Health engaged in that work and also to the departmental officials, doctors, nurses, members of local authorities and officials of local authorities. I should like the Minister to tackle the problem of mental illness more or less in the same manner and not to be too dependent on the two commissions to which he referred today.</P>
    <P>There are certain problems in regard to mental ill health.  It is not a disease of the body but one of the mind and a disease of the mind cannot be tackled in the same manner as any other disease.  There have been tremendous scientific advances in the treatment of mental illness in recent years.  I should like to be assured by the Minister that this country has taken full advantage of these scientific advances in methods of treatment and in new drugs that have been introduced in other countries.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to the problem of T.B., in relatively recent years I think there were made available to us the most up-to-date drugs and information on the most efficient and up-to-date treatments for that disease. As far as one can see, one of the greatest problems for the Minister and for the members of <Col N="118" /> local authorities is that of overcrowding. We have had that problem of overcrowding in regard to T.B. and it was successfully tackled.  I am not a member of a local authority but it seems to me that accommodation for mental patients in this country has not improved in the past 100 years.  If that is an exaggeration I should like someone to correct me but that is my information. Therefore, I do not believe we can afford to wait for a commission that might report back to the Minister for Health in anything, say, over nine or twelve months and certainly not two, three or five years.  It is an urgent problem and must be tackled.  It appears that the problem of overcrowding and the problem of acquiring additional accommodation are two of the biggest headaches facing the Minister and the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am sure every Deputy freely admits that in one respect there is not the same problem with regard to mental illness as there used to be.  I refer to the fear not alone of mental illness occurring to people themselves but of the fear and what can be described as the shame of families and relatives of the stigma of mental illness.</P>
    <P>Ministers for Health had that problem with regard to T.B.  People mentioned T.B. in a whisper.  They called it by various names to avoid mentioning the words &ldquo;tuberculosis&rdquo; or &ldquo;consumption&rdquo;.  Gradually, through education by the Department of Health and local authorities and through the efforts of good social workers, the fear of a stigma was removed entirely. People whose families were ashamed to mention the words &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; or &ldquo;tuberculosis&rdquo; twenty or twenty-five years ago now approach the problem of mental illness in the same way. If, some relatively few years ago, ten or fifteen years ago, one had occasion to go to a mental hospital or clinic to be treated for mental illness it was mentioned in a whisper because the first thing that was said was that the person was mad, &ldquo;looney&rdquo;, &ldquo;bats&rdquo;, crazy&mdash;and that was the end of it. Now people have come to recognise &mdash;again through our health organisations&mdash;that mental illness is just another disease that can be cured. Again, let me put emphasis on &ldquo;they <Col N="119" /> can be cured&rdquo;, because the medical men of this country, with the assistance of the Department and the local authorities, have proved how successful they can be in the cure of mental illness.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need for me to stress the necessity of expanding accommodation.  In the beginning of this century those who were patients in mental hospitals or lunatic asylums as they were then called were people who, though mentally ill, were put into those asylums because they were dangerous, were an inconvenience to their families or could not fend for themselves.  Now we have a new situation&mdash;a desirable situation&mdash;where people who are mentally ill are becoming voluntary patients or who are sent to those hospitals in order to be cured.  In addition to all those people who were patients in the hospital in the past 30 to 50 years we have these additional people who volunteer for treatment in the mental hospitals.  That means that there must be and should be more accommodation for mental patients in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the possibility of a domiciliary medical and nursing service.  I think he will have the support of the House in that connection. He may not have referred to the matter specifically.  I think he should consider strongly the idea even now of setting up such a service.  There are people who are reluctant to go to mental hospitals.  They are not 100 per cent. mentally ill but are border-line cases.  They have a phobia, naturally enough, about going to a mental hospital because they believe that as soon as they go there they are doomed as far as mental illness is concerned. Therefore, if there could be a scheme or a service whereby these people would be treated in clinics or in their own homes it would be desirable for themselves.  It would also tend to relieve the strain on some of that much-needed accommodation in the mental hospitals.  There could also be treatment in different centres in the functional area of the local authority whether it is the county council or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the local authority <Col N="120" /> also have a big responsibility in regard to this matter.  We should try to encourage the idea of social workers in this particular branch of medicine. These social workers who are equipped and experienced to deal with the public might, if given a certain amount of inexpensive training, do very valuable work not alone in the treatment of these people but, more important still, in their rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>Much emphasis was placed in recent years on the rehabilitation of people who had tuberculosis.  How much more difficult is it to rehabilitate people who have suffered from some mental illness?  Therefore, if the Minister can do anything to encourage that type of worker, whether he be voluntary or employed by local authority, he would be making an advance as far as certain of these patients are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one other small thing in respect of this Bill that I should like to say.  The Bill retains the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;detention&rdquo; smacks too much of prison.  It smacks too much of confinements.  I do not know what other word the Minister could substitute but with his ingenuity and the ingenuity of his officials there is the possibility that some other word could be substituted or some other phrase employed to get rid of this word &ldquo;detention&rdquo;.  Being detained in any place means to most folk that they are under arrest or confined in some prison or other place of detention</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to expand his observations further on the rôle the Garda should play in the escorting of patients to a mental hospital. We know there is power in the Bill to provide escorts.  We know that in the Bill there is provision for the employment, so to speak, of a member of the Garda Síochána.  I think the Minister should try to get local authorities and the officials of these hospitals to use the Garda Síochána to the minimum.  I am not being critical of the personnel of the Garda Síochánna.  I am merely being critical of the position they occupy. I am especially critical of the fact that they wear a uniform and of the fact that, when a person is seen in the company of a uniformed member of <Col N="121" /> the Garda Síochána, there is associated with it the idea of arrest or some misdemeanour.</P>
    <P>That may happen in only one case in a thousand or one in a hundred but there is that feeling.  Especially is that feeling strong in the case of the patient whose confused and befuddled mind becomes more confused and befuddled and much more suspicious when he or she sees a member of the Garda arrive in full uniform to take him or her to a mental hospital. I would suggest that, where there is necessity to have the services of a member of the Garda as an escort, a direction should be given to the effect that the member of the Garda should not appear in uniform but in plain clothes.  I do not know whether that could be arranged with the Commissioner of the Garda.</P>
    <P>The rest of the Bill is contained in the Schedule.  Might I join with the Minister&mdash;I assume that his plea would be accepted by the Chair&mdash;that special facilities would be given to the House in dealing with the Schedule on Committee Stage?  We had this in some other Bill.  I think it was one of the Referendum Bills.  I think it should be made abundantly clear or otherwise by the Chair that similar treatment will be meted out in respect of this Schedule and that Deputies will have the opportunity of discussing the different sections of the Bill one by one and that they will be entitled to vote on these sections singly.  The Minister submitted to the Chair that the provisions in regard to superannuation were embodied in a Schedule to facilitate him and the House.  In the ordinary course of events, these provisions would be in the form of ordinary sections of the Bill.  Therefore, I would join with the Minister in asking the Chair to allow the different sections of the Schedule in this instance to be treated as sections for the purpose of discussion and a vote if necessary.</P>
    <P>As far as the Schedule is concerned, I am not going to go into any detail whatsoever on these sections on this Stage.  They are somewhat complicated and one needs to refer back in some cases to the 1909 Act and in <Col N="122" /> other cases to the Act of 1945.  I would say&mdash;and I think I speak on behalf of some of the workers engaged in mental nursing&mdash;that these workers are not completely satisfied with the various provisions in the Schedule.  If I understand it rightly, they may be under a misapprehension about certain sections of it.  Therefore, we propose on the Committee Stage to table certain amendments and discuss certain of the sections.  If the Minister can reassure these workers, through the House, that will satisfy us.</P>
    <P>There is the view that this Schedule means that there will be a worsening of the conditions, not so much of those at present employed in mental nursing but of those who will be recruited after the passage of this Bill.  Many members of the House will agree that there should be a special position given to mental nurses over and above&mdash;and I might say I used be one myself&mdash;local government officials.  There are special superannuation provisions for members of the Garda Síochána.  I think all will agree that the life of a mental nurse is a rigorous life, a strenuous life, a life which has many complications and hardships and which involves a difficult task.  Therefore, a good case could be made and the Minister could well consider any proposals that these people might make, through us, on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is a good idea, or should I go further and say it is a wrong idea, that these mental nurses, for the purposes of superannuation, should be put under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Local Government, or be his responsibility.  I suppose in respect of local government service generally, whether one works in the department for roads or health or general purposes, that for the purpose of superannuation, they are the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government, but the problem is not quite the same as regards health and especially is it not the same as regards mental nurses.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting point which needs to be cleared up.  This Schedule says that for the purpose of superannuation, the Minister shall be <Col N="123" /> the Minister for Local Government, but there is another section which says that an appeal can be made to the Minister and it is not quite clear to me which Minister is meant.  I may have missed something in the Bill but superannuation is determined by the Minister for Local Government and one of the sections in the Schedule says that an aggrieved person may appeal to the Minister.  That point can be cleared up on the Committee Stage but as far as I can see the Minister is not specified. I assume, therefore, that while superannuation is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government, the appeal may lie with the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>There are many points that can be raised with regard to superannuation but, as I say, they are points for Committee Stage.  There are grievances with regard to the period after which a mental nurse can retire.  These are matters which will be raised on Committee and I mention them now merely to stake my claim to submit amendments. There is also dissatisfaction with regard to the method in which superannuation is computed.  As I understand it, at present, superannuation is assessed in accordance with the salary paid over the past three years. The proposal now is to assess it on the last years of service.  There is also a submission which will be made on Committee Stage that unestablished service should be reckoned because there are peculiar circumstances in mental nursing where it is necessary to have unestablished service.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to expand a little more on the idea of patients working.  I do not object, and I do not think anybody would object, to the idea of an effort being made to have these people who suffer from mental illness rehabilitated, or to get them back into the ordinary run of their lives and to use their heads and hands again.  However, there are dangers in that as well.  The tradesmen in these mental hospitals also have a life to live.  They follow a trade.  They expect to get employment and security of employment and there should be some safeguards <Col N="124" /> against the possibility of any of these patients engaging in tradesmen's work. I know it is not the Minister's desire that these should become plasterers, carpenters or masons, or what have you, but it could be that an R.M.S. would have these people working and displacing a carpenter, plasterer or a mason, or any such tradesmen.  As I say, I do not object to an effort being made to have these people rehabilitated but I do not believe that work which is appropriate to a tradesman should be given to somebody who has no idea of the trade but who, for the sake of saving money for the institution, would be given these jobs.</P>
    <P>I must confess that since I said that, I have looked again at the Minister's excellent explanatory memorandum which says that the provisions in regard to patients are contained in Sections 2 to 39 and Section 42.  The principal provisions include paragraph (b) which reads:</P>
    <P>To enable the Minister to authorise, by regulations, the making of payments by mental hospital authorities to patients for work done (Section 3).</P>
    <P>I trust that the Minister when he is making these regulations will safeguard the position which I have just described.</P>
    <P>Again, in Sections 2 to 39, I see that the Minister proposes to dispense with the requirements regarding the submission to the Minister, as a routine procedure, of copies of documents relating to the reception, departure, removal, escape and death of patients. I assume that up to now, and at present, in any of these cases the Minister would get a report from the R.M.S.  Nobody minds dispensing with a requirement regarding the submission to the Minister of a copy of a document relating to the reception of a patient, or the departure of a patient, or to the removal of a patient, but I wonder is the Minister wise in dispensing with that provision which requires the R.M.S. to give him general information and documents with regard to the escape or death of a patient&mdash;perhaps not an ordinary death of a patient, but deaths of <Col N="125" /> patients in hospitals in circumstances which in some cases necessitate inquiries.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not believe that in the case of an escape or death of a patient in certain circumstances, he should as heretofore have submitted to him documents and information in connection with it?  Otherwise, we would have members of the House tabling questions bringing to the Minister's notice the fact that some person died in a mental hospital in unusual circumstances and the Minister telling the House that he knew nothing about it but would inquire from the local authority.  In these two connections, the Minister should continue the present procedure and ask the R.M.S. to send on these documents.</P>
    <P>Section 162, subsection (2), quoted on page 4 of the Explanatory Memorandum, provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>An application for a recommendation for reception may be made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  by the husband or wife or a relative of the person to whom the application relates.</P>
    <P>If my memory serves me correctly&mdash; I am not sure about this and that is why I am raising it&mdash;there is reference in the booklet that the Minister proposes to produce to a definition of &ldquo;relative&rdquo;.  I must confess that I could not find it.</P>

      <P>First of all, I wish to endorse what Deputy Corish has said, that too much must not be made out of this Bill.  It is a Bill to improve the present administrative machinery and at the same time to make certain changes in the position in relation to superannuation of the personnel of the mental health services.  It does not purport to do more than that and it is not necessary that we should amend the existing law to enable us to do more than that.  The mental health services will be continued to be improved so far as our resources permit, our judgment dictates and according to our ability to absorb the advances which have been made in psychiatric medicine.</P>
      <P>I should not like the House to take too literally what my predecessor said, suggesting that there had not been any very marked advance in the mental health services for a great number of years.  It is true that we have not had any spectacular new building programme. We have not had the money to enable us to carry one out, even if we were satisfied that the problem of overcrowding in our mental hospitals could be solved or should be solved by providing additional buildings, rather than by adopting the measures which we have already initiated here in our own country and which are more widely favoured elsewhere, of trying to get people out of mental hospitals and to keep them out of mental hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that the number of patients in our mental hospitals is probably as large as it was some years ago.  But there has been this remarkable change, that there is a very greatly increased turnover in the number of patients.  The number of admissions has gone up and the number of discharges has gone up.  There has been a great change also in the status of the patients who are going into our mental hospitals.  There has been an increase of almost 50 per cent. in the number of those who go in <Col N="127" /> there as temporary patients, patients with the hope that, within six months or perhaps a little longer, they will come out cured.  There has been also a very substantial increase within a comparatively short space of time, in the number of persons who are attending out-patients' clinics.  That number has increased very remarkably and in 1959 the number of attendances was something over 14,000.  In addition to all this, we have now reached the stage that we shall be opening shortly, in the Monaghan-Cavan Mental Hospital District, a day hospital where patients can come for treatment during the day and return to their homes in the evening.</P>
    <P>In addition, we are, of course, endeavouring to improve the standard of our mental health nurses. Wherever it is possible for us to retrieve&mdash;and I use the word advisedly &mdash;sanatoria which are not fully occupied&mdash;very often, we have to overcome stubborn opposition in order to enable us to do that&mdash;we are diverting these buildings for the purposes of relieving overcrowding in mental hospitals or, in some cases, as in the case of Monaghan again, converting them into modern admission units.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that there has been stagnation in regard to our mental health services.  On the contrary&mdash; and I am not claiming any particular credit for it; it has been the desire of us all here since 1945, when my then Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, piloted the Medical Treatment Bill though the House&mdash;we passed that Bill as the foundation which was necessary in order to enable us to ensure that the appropriate authorities throughout the country would be enabled to provide the type of services which we hoped to build upon it.</P>
    <P>A lot of things happened.  The programme did not work out as we hoped it would but, let me emphasise again, there has been no stagnation.  Within the limits of our resources we have progressed I think reasonably well, in step with those who have been working elsewhere on this problem.</P>
    <P>But, there is this thing about it&mdash;and <Col N="128" /> it is my great reason for setting up not only the commission on the mentally handicapped, but also the commission on the treatment of mental illness, which I propose to set up and in respect of which I have already made approaches to secure the requisite personnel&mdash;that we have not had an exhaustive investigation of what should be done, and what can be done in that field in this country in the light of modern knowledge.  In fact, I doubt if we have had in the last century any serious investigation of the problem at all.  There is a tendency for traditional procedures to become inbred.  And I should like that outside minds should combine with such professional ability as we may have at our disposal to have a fresh look at what we have been doing here over the years and what we are now trying to do.  The fact that we are asking these new minds to come in does not mean at all, as was suggested by my predecessor, Deputy Thomas O'Higgins, and to some extent reechoed by the Leader of the Labour Party, that we are going to stand still. We are going to carry out the programme which we have mapped out, as I said, to the extent that our resources will permit.  At the same time, we intend to bring over people to have a look at what we are doing and to give us the benefit of their knowledge and experience. There will be, I am sure, an exchange of views between ourselves and these others which will be advantageous not only to us and to them but to the general field of psychiatric medicine as a whole.</P>
    <P>That is what we are trying to do and I do not want this Bill to be taken as any more than as I have described it.  It is a machinery Bill which enables us to deal in a simple way with many of the minor defects in the 1945 Act.  It will enable people if they require the services of a psychiatrist or if they require treatment for mental illness, to go and secure that treatment with the least possible embarrassment to themselves. And it will also ensure that those who have benefited by the treatment and can be discharged with safety to themselves and to the community will also find it easier to secure a discharge. <Col N="129" /> Then there are the other proposals to give to the new entrants into the staff of the mental health services such advantages as they might secure from the Local Government Superannuation Code of 1956.</P>
    <P>Those are the main purposes of the Bill.  I shall study what has been said here by the various speakers; I shall, of course, consider any amendments that any Deputy may wish to put down and will be prepared to debate them in a reasonable way and to take counsel with them.  However, it must be remembered that I cannot impose any very great additional burden upon the health authorities or upon the Exchequer.  We must not expect that if the personnel of the health services are going to secure all of the advantages of the Superannuation Act of 1956, a great deal more will be super-added thereto.  I shall be reasonable, I hope, but I have to remember that in the end the ratepayers as well as the taxpayers will have to bear some part of the burden and I shall have to be guided in some of these matters by the opinion of my colleague, the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a very interesting statement that he was very anxious to have the least inconvenience caused to relatives having patients submitted to a mental home. I have long experience on a mental hospital committee and have come across some cases, not really mentally defective but nervous cases who would not be patients fit for Grangegorman or Portrane.  Their parents would be in the middle income group and it would involve great hardship to send them to the home in Lucan or elsewhere because no allowance is made towards the weekly cost.  This involves great hardship for these people.  I would ask the Minister to consider such cases.</P>

      <Col N="130" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That in view of the insecurity of employment at the Arigna mines and the failure of private enterprise to fully develop them and so provide a stable industry, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that steps should be taken by the Government for the fullest utilisation of the resources of these mines under the auspices of Bord na Móna or of a separate semi-State body.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputies McQuillan and Browne.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion suggests that one solution of the problem of providing a market for the Arigna coal mines is that of nationalisation.  As I had very little opportunity for speaking on the previous occasion, I thought fit to give a brief account of the position of the mines as they are today and the problems connected therewith. The coal deposits of the Arigna Mountains consist of friable semi-bituminous coal, 17 per cent. volatiles, of comparatively high ash content. Most of the coal is either mined as, or becomes eventually, 70 per cent. slack and as a result is more useful for industry than for domestic purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coal consists of two main types: a main crop of coal whose ash content varies from 18 to 26 per cent. the seams being situated to the west of Lough Allen and forming 80 per cent. of all production.  Of this coal it is reckoned that there are one and a quarter million tons in reserve.  Found elsewhere is what is known as crow coal whose ash content tends to be very high, 45 per cent. and more in a great many cases.  Certain tracts of this coal have an ash content of 18 per cent. to 35 per cent. and it is this type of coal <Col N="131" /> which forms the remainder of the production, mainly, 20 per cent. of the total production from the Arigna mines.  This coal is difficult to extract. The seams vary in thickness and in depth and in quality and there is considerable risk attached to the exploitation of crow coal because the sale is dependent on the ash content which in the ordinary way is at the 18 per cent. to 35 per cent. level rather than the higher level of 45 per cent. and over.</P>
    <P>There are six mines in Arigna and in the outlying districts of counties Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo and there are three very small owners. Recently a mining company was registered, Connaught Collieries, to exploit the mineral rights of some 500 acres at Barrenmeenagh, County Leitrim. They intend mining about 15,000 tons of coal per year and employing 70 men.  I have not had any recent reports as to whether they have commenced activities.</P>
    <P>The number of men on the books of the existing mining companies was 423 in 1958; 413 in 1959 and 404 in June 1960.  The number of men on the books does not enable me to say how many are actually employed on a shift basis and what the general employment is, but it does give an indication, generally speaking, of the employment position in that the men who are on the books of the company are, in general, in employment.  That indicates that although the mines have been going through a very difficult period, the number of men on the books has not greatly decreased.</P>
    <P>The total imports of coal into this country are 1¼ million tons.  In relation to that, we can note the production of the two main coal areas.  The production of anthracite in the south midlands area was 120,000 tons in 1938 and 200,000 tons in a recent year. The production of coal from the Arigna area was 20,000 tons in 1938; in 1956, it was 60,000 tons.  There was an intermediate year when it rose to 80,000 tons.  In 1959, it was 64,000 tons and I have not got the figures for 1960.</P>
    <P>So much by way of general information <Col N="132" /> on the Arigna mines.  Surplus production of coal in a number of areas has pushed prices down everywhere in the world and the increasing use of electricity and oil for certain industrial and domestic purposes has aggravated the position here.  The position was also affected by imports of coal from the United States, Poland and Germany and all coalminers have had to face a very difficult position and an intensely competitive market. Despite the severe competition experienced by the Arigna mines, it is absolutely true to say that they are now in a stronger position than ever before, because, in October, 1958, the Electricity Supply Board's steam station at Arigna was commissioned and that station takes 45,000 tons of coal per year; it is capable of using 45,000 tons of coal per year and that is two-thirds of the total production.  That places the district in a far more secure position if one considers the total production at Arigna and the total amount immediately absorbed by the steam station.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan suggested that the nature of the contract between the E.S.B. and the Arigna colliery had something questionable about it. Therefore I want to read a statement by the E.S.B. stating their policy.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The size and consequently the cost of the station at Arigna was determined on the basis of information given to the Board by the Geological Office in regard to the total quantities of coal available. The station life was fixed at 25 years and the cost was approximately £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>Having regard to a capital expenditure of this size, the Board had to make forward contract arrangements to ensure steady annual supplies for 25 years.  With the exception of Arigna Collieries Ltd., all other producers were relatively small and at the time could give no guarantee of quantity over such a long period; they did not wish to be tied to one purchaser if market conditions for their coal improved. The normal designed consumption for the station for a 25 year life was <Col N="133" /> 45,000 tons per annum and Arigna Collieries Ltd., was prepared to confine its produce to the Board and to enter into a contract to supply a minimum of 35,000 tons per annum over the lifetime of the station.  This contract ensured reasonable running and protected the Board's capital investment.  The remaining tonnage is being supplied by other producers in the area.</P>
    <P>I think that it is a reasonable explanation of the continuity of the contracts made and it seems to me that it is essential to the life of the station.</P>
    <P>The E.S.B. also purchase certain quantities of coal for the Ringsend station in Dublin.  The use of Arigna coal in that station is completely uneconomic. It operates at lower efficiency.  Oil has to be used in order to ensure that the coal can be burned and there is a very much higher maintenance associated with the various parts of the installation as a result of using it.  The purchase of that coal by the E.S.B., together with the coal purchased for the Arigna power station, constitutes five-sixths of the total production of the Arigna mines.</P>
    <P>Coal and turf are fighting a competitive battle with other fuels at present and, as the House surely knows, it is impossible for us under the Anglo-Irish Agreement to impose a tariff on coal.  So far as the recent renewal of the Anglo-Irish trade relations is concerned, it has been made evident that, in return for the access we have to the British market for our cattle and agricultural produce and for many industrial products, there can be no tariff imposed upon coal imports. It is not possible to impose a duty to forward the interests of either the anthracite mines or Arigna, nor is it possible for me to make the use of Arigna coal compulsory.</P>
    <P>Frequently, my Department has communicated with State bodies and, through the Minister for Local Government, with local authority institutions and we have done our best to persuade them to use Arigna coal. Reference has been made to the use of Arigna coal by Cement Ltd.  That <Col N="134" /> is not a State company; it exports cement at highly competitive prices. I understand the Board are willing to pay economic prices, based on calorific value for Irish produced coal and it is a matter for the colliery owners to decide whether they can accept the prices suggested to them by the company and which the company say are fair and equitable.</P>
    <P>Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann has also been mentioned.  That company purchases anthracite, not Arigna coal, although it did purchase Arigna coal formerly.  In present circumstances, if they were to start purchasing Arigna coal, they would have to substitute that coal for anthracite and there would be no purpose in so doing.</P>
    <P>Recently, I asked the Arigna Collieries to form an association to work together for the common purpose of increasing production and securing better sales and I understand there is a new association called the &ldquo;Western Colliery Owners' Association&rdquo;.  I welcome the formation of that body because it will assist in the exploration which is now taking place and to which I shall refer.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Government made available £150,000 for the exploration of the Leinster and Connaught coal-fields. By arrangement with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, contracts to bore up to 14,000 feet in County Leitrim have been entered into&mdash;I think the work will be completed in January, 1962&mdash;in order to find out what seams of main coal and crow coal can be found in the area which are capable of economic exploitation.  At the same time, an investigation is being conducted into ways and means of securing better cleaning, preparation and burning of Arigna coal.  We are trying to find out whether it is possible in some way to separate the coal from the non-burnable material or whether it is possible to burn coal with a high ash content in some new type of furnace.</P>
    <P>These investigations are not complete. I am not very optimistic in regard to them, but I can assure the House that everything is being done to discover whether this coal can be burned or processed in a better way. <Col N="135" /> If, as a result of these two types of investigation, sufficient reserves of burnable coal can be found in Leitrim, consideration will be given to the erection of a second Electricity Supply Board station.  It would be unwise obviously to initiate a new station, unless the company would be reasonably certain of a real continuity of supply of the right kind of coal for burning in the station.  Equally, it is important to ensure that if coal of a high ash content has to be used, some economic method of burning it will be found.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that we are doing all we can in the circumstances.  I can see no justification for the nationalisation of this industry.  If the coal is there, if it is of the right type, and if there is a market, I believe private enterprise will succeed better than any nationalised enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Private enterprise will succeed.  I said.  Most of the difficulties raised by Deputy McQuillan and by those interested in preserving this very valuable employment in Leitrim and Roscommon would not be eliminated by the formation of a State company to exploit the deposits.  A State company could not compel the E.S.B. to buy unsuitable coal.  It could not persuade Cement Ltd., to increase its costs of production.  I do not believe a State company could find markets any more successfully than the private producer. In no circumstances would we agree to a subsidy being available for the sale or marketing of Arigna coal.  Bord na Móna is having to face very severe competition in the sale of its briquettes. If a State company were formed, there could be no change in regard to protection. Under the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, it is impossible to impose a duty on imported coal.  That situation would not alter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already indicated the best type of State intervention.  If exploration of the coal seams proves successful, if the technical investigation into the preparation, processing and burning <Col N="136" /> of the coal produces good results, that will be State action.  If, as a result of that, it is found wise to establish a second station to absorb greater quantities of Arigna coal, that station will be erected by the E.S.B., after the matter has been considered by the Government in the usual way as part of the programme.  A State company will be entering into the production of electricity, using Arigna coal.  Under two heads, therefore, the State is already playing a part.  If all goes well, a State company will pay a further part as a result of the exploration and technical examination carried out.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I can say.  We have gone into this matter very thoroughly.  When I last met some of the colliery owners, they seemed reasonably satisfied that the most practicable course was the one which I have outlined, namely, examination of the coal deposits and examination of the technical problems surrounding the burning of this particularly difficult type of coal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the remarkable chances of political life here in this Republic that one of the most politically conservative Ministers should find himself in executive control of the one Department which has almost complete control over our publicly-owned concerns.  It must create for the Minister a very severe strain on his sense of responsibility to the people that he should continue to operate as Minister in control of a series of great industries systematised as publicly-owned or nationalised industries. It is an almost inexplicable enigma of our political life.  It is a puzzling experience to listen to the Minister for Transport and Power here and abroad telling his listening public of the remarkable achievements of our nationalised or publicly-owned concerns.  He is, of course, quite right to talk about the remarkable achievements of Bord na Móna, the E.S.B., Aer Lingus, Irish Steel Holdings, Irish Shipping, and even C.I.E. under its present management.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the Minister's remarkable approbation of, admiration for, and pride in all these nationalised industries, we find him here this evening, replying to this motion, stating that private enterprise will succeed better than nationalisation. He can see no justification for nationalisation.  In view of the facts, facts with which the Minister is more conversant than anybody else, how can be maintain that this industry should remain as a complete anachronism, controlled by private enterprise? It is just one remaining power segment of our power and transport economy.  How can the Minister argue that it should continue to exist outside the ambit of responsibility in regard to the power and transport concerns over which he, as Minister, exercises control?  It is absurd to have these mines other than under the control of some public concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that private enterprise will succeed better, despite all the evidence to the contrary.  He made no effort to discuss the insecurity of employment to which specific reference is made in the motion and which is inseparable from this private enterprise type of set-up.  We believe this coal mine should be brought under the control of the Minister.  We believe that not only would the industry be better run, but the employees would have greater security of employment and better conditions of working than they presently enjoy.  I do not think that even the most conservative Minister for Transport and Power would make the claim, for instance, that it would be better to hand back C.I.E. to private enterprise.  I do not think he would make the claim that our bus services, or transport services generally, were better operated under private enterprise.  I do not think he would make the claim that the average lorry driver is better off under private enterprise, with his insecurity of employment, very often defective equipment, indifferent protective clothing, lack of pension rights and sickness <Col N="138" /> benefits whereas workers employed by industries such as C.I.E., operated on behalf of the public, have no such disadvantages.</P>
    <P>Whether you look at it from the point of view of the efficiency of our transport services or from the point of view of the employees, there can be no comparison between the operation of private enterprise transport services and publicly-owned transport services.  That is true also of Aer Lingus, the E.S.B., Irish Steel Holdings and Irish Shipping.  I do not think anybody can deny that the man employed by any of these companies is infinitely better off.  He has security of employment, magnificent conditions of service, pension rights and sickness benefit.  Through trade union activity, admittedly, he is in a situation in most of these publicly-owned bodies which he would not change for private enterprise in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>Every one of these publicly-owned concerns was commenced simply because private enterprise had failed to operate them efficiently.  They had failed to provide continuity of satisfactory employment, security of employment, good conditions in retirement and in sickness and good conditions from the point of view of the type of equipment supplied and its maintenance.  In addition to all that, these services are infinitely more efficiently and competently run than they were under private enterprise.  If the Minister honestly believes that private enterprise, as he said, will succeed better than nationalisation, he has a responsibility to the Government and to the people to come in here and say: &ldquo;I do not think these different concerns over which I have accepted control and which I now know and understand very intimately are being efficiently run and we should hand them all back to private enterprise. Private enterprise will succeed better than nationalisation and we will have better shipping services, better air services and the steel industry, which was privately run at one time, will be better run and the employees will be better off than they are with C.I.E. and the other State companies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister seriously <Col N="139" /> believes that.  I am surprised at a person like the Minister, who has a reputation for believing what he says even if he does not always say what he believes, making a statement like that which is so palpably and demonstrably untrue in fact.  I do not think there is any case at all for the continuation of this small coalmining industry outside these other great transport and fuel industries.  There is no doubt about it: this one could be carried within these other industries, integrated into them, kept going and protected from the shocks bound to come to a small industry like this, surrounded by British, Polish and American coal.  It could be absorbed into a unified transport and power authority and an outlet could be found for all the products of these mines.</P>
    <P>The case is made by the Minister that we cannot cut the importation of British coal under the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, that we cannot restrict it in any way or impose tariffs on it.  That may be true but the restriction of British imports is not the only way in which we can increase the market for home-mined coal.  It is quite clear that as long as Polish, American and British coal is coming into this country, there is a market which could be developed for the home-mined coal.  It is a complete admission of failure and defeat for the Minister to say we cannot stop the British coming in.  We can see that coal mined in Leitrim and North Roscommon is made available in the country at prices competitive with coal coming from Britain, from Poland and even all the way across the Atlantic from America.</P>
    <P>Surely the reason that has not been done is that the mines are not being competently and efficiently run?  They are being run by a small group whose only interest is to create enough wealth for themselves and their families.  That is all permissible under our capitalist society and private enterprise attitude to exploitation of industry; but from the point of view of the country and the employee, that does not mean and has not meant that you got substained exploitation of the raw material in the ground.  It is a bit late in the day now <Col N="140" /> for the Minister so say his Department is to have a geological survey carried out to see whether there are greater resources of coal there and, if there are, that this company will be encouraged to mine them.  This State has been established 40 years now.  What would we say if Bord na Móna came along and said they proposed to examine the possibility of making peat briquettes or thought it would be a good idea to consider the question of generating stations running on milled peat?  These advances have already been made under a publicly-owned company.  Bord na Móna is a live company.  It is a magnificent enterprise and has well proved its worth.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister that turf is engaged in a death struggle with coal.  I think turf has virtually won the battle.  The vast majority of people now accept turf, particularly the briquette type, as being far superior to coal.  That has not been achieved because Bord na Móna sat back and sent a horse and cart around from house to house, as used to be done in the old days, with 6/- or 7/- worth of wet turf, badly cut from the top of the bog.  It was because this publicly-owned company sat down and appointed scientists, technologists and technocrats of different kinds to devise ways in which it would be possible to meet modern demands.  As a result, we now have this very difficult-to-mine fuel, turf, being cleanly and efficiently burned in small flats in cities like Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and people are delighted to use it.</P>
    <P>It was because of a positive effort by Bord na Móna to see how they could make the best appeal to the consumer that it was possible to provide this magnificent fuel, turf, as peat briquettes.  We now have this quite remarkable achievement&mdash;and goodness knows, it is not often I talk about achievements of the various Governments of this country over the past 40 years&mdash;this striking and magnificent achievement that we are now selling peat briquettes in Britain.  That was inconceivable, and it is a great tribute to the minds of the people and the politicians who had the enterprise in their earlier and more radical days to <Col N="141" /> set up this publicly-owned company and to take a chance on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude is that private enterprise will succeed better than nationalisation, but it was clear that private enterprise was not succeeding in developing our bogs. Private enterprise provided turf which could be used in the country all right but they did not provide a fuel which could be used in the small, overcrowded city flats.  They did not make the best use of our raw materials.  They did not provide the optimum or the best possible conditions for employees on the bogs, and politicians at that time decided they would entrust the development to a publicly-owned company. They were justified in their beliefs, and there is just as good a case now for taking over these mines in Arigna and absorbing them in Bord na Móna with the other power groups under the control of the Minister&mdash; taking them over and putting the same dynamic management in control in the Arigna coal mines as paid such wonderful dividends in Bord na Móna over the past 30 years.  I do not know how long the Minister has to wait before a self-evident reality is proved to him.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there is no comparison between the conditions of work of the miners in Arigna and the conditions of employment of E.S.B., C.I.E. and Bord na Móna workers. There is no comparison at all between the measure of efficiency of these publicly-owned companies and the obviously grossly inefficient organisation in the Arigna mines.  They are quite clearly taking the line that if they can get the local E.S.B. to provide them with a ready outlet for their products, they are prepared to mine the coal.  As I said before, if Bord na Móna had taken that view, turf would not be burned anywhere except on the Bog of Allen or the other great turf-burning areas of the country.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the organisation at Arigna have a very limited outlook. They have not taken the same aggressive attitude as Bord na Móna took, with the result that not only do we sell turf outside the great turf-burning area of the Bog of Allen but we sell it in Dublin and other cities in <Col N="142" /> our own country, and abroad.  In Arigna, they appear to be content to carry on, if they can sell to the local E.S.B. station and get a guaranteed market for a number of years.  They are prepared to go ahead on those conditions only.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious from an examination of the number of men working in the mines, and an examination of the output of the mines, that there is, at best, complete stagnation, virtual stagnation.  If one produced the figures of employment in the turf-burning industry over the years, and showed they had not changed appreciably, there would be wide criticism, and justifiable criticism, of failure on the part of the people in charge to develop the industry as it could be and should be developed.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes it clear that there will be no protection, no subsidies, and no compulsion.  Those are all very curious directives from the Minister's Department because they cut right across Government policy over the years&mdash;permissible policy in certain circumstances, and inevitable policy in certain circumstances.  What is the Minister's great objection to protection?  Surely practically all our industries are protected.  It has been one of the corner-stones of both Government and Opposition policy over the years to protect industries.  Most people believe that the time has come when that protection should be reviewed, and in many cases removed, but the case was made, and justified on both sides of the House&mdash;and I agree&mdash;that at a certain stage of an industry, protection is permissible, desirable, inevitable and essential.  Yet the Minister seems to take the view that this whole idea of protection is anathema, unthinkable, and cannot be considered.</P>
    <P>Of course it must be considered.  If we are to set on foot a really fine mining industry in this country, of course protection must be permissible and must be considered.  I cannot believe the Minister seriously believes otherwise.  When Bord na Móna were under consideration, if he were told by Mr. Andrews: &ldquo;This is what I envisage for Bord na Móna; these <Col N="143" /> are the prospects that I believe in&rdquo;&mdash; as I once heard him say&mdash;&ldquo;we will drive coal out of the grates of the city of Dublin&rdquo;; if he came to the Minister and said: &ldquo;I could do that if I had the authority, the power and the protection to do it,&rdquo; is it a fact that the Minister's attitude would be: &ldquo;No, you cannot because we do not believe in protection?&rdquo;  Carts and horses would still be trundling loads of turf in the midlands and Bord na Móna would not have developed to their present stage&mdash;or the E.S.B., Irish Steel Holdings, or Irish Shipping Limited&mdash;if the Minister had been in control.  How can the Minister take that view?  It is completely cuckoo.</P>

      <P>The Minister keeps telling the world about the wonderful success of our publicly-owned industries. He was in the headlines two days ago telling about the remarkable expansion of our industries, our transport and power industries, the E.S.B. and other industries.  He is very conscious of those remarkable achievements, and so are we all proud of them, but surely it is logical to say that we think the process under which these successes have been achieved is the process which we should now carry to another part of this fuel and power industry.  It is in the position to-day that Bord na Móna were in when they were first taken over and when public enterprise first invested the people's wealth in the establishment of these new industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absurd for the Minister to say there will be no protection.  Bad and all as things are in the country, any of our great achievements are due to the fact that some Minister at some time or other&mdash;because of a certain radical outlook, optimism, youth, an ambition to see something done for the country&mdash;decided it was permissible to <Col N="144" /> protect the industry and, when it was a going concern, to remove the protection and allow it to stand on its feet. There can be no question but that the Minister is wrong.  He is going contrary to Government and Opposition policy in taking that view.  Time out of number I have heard the question of protection argued here.  I do not think there is any Deputy who does not accept the case for protection.</P>
    <P>Similarly with regard to subsidy.  The Minister says there will be no subsidy. There is not one of our publicly-owned industries which has not had at some time Government support by way of subsidy.  It is quite inconceivable that these great industries could be established if the Government had not decided to call on resources of the Exchequer to provide the machinery and to allow for the initial losses that are inseparable from the establishment of such great industries.  Of course, the public must bear the initial impact in the form of subsidy in the hope that, in time, these industries will become so successful and prosperous that they will not only pay their way but certainly justify their existence and maybe pay back the capital invested in them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recently bought some jet aeroplanes for the development of our air services.  Surely he did not expect Aer Lingus or Irish Air Lines to find the money for this investment which he believes essential for the expansion of that industry? Similarly, C.I.E. has to have vast sums given to it in order to provide for the dieselisation of that service.  Subsidy is not a new idea.  It is as old as the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>They have all had to have support in their early days in order to have some kind of initial capital to mechanise the undertaking and to provide for its most effective running.</P>
      <P>On the questions of protection and subsidy, there is no doubt but that the Minister is once again running completely contrary to Government policy in his assertion that neither of these things is permissible in the circumstances of these mines which are providing a very indifferent service under poor employment conditions.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any serious need to consider the question of compulsion. I suppose every industry protected by means of a tariff produces an end product which we are effectively compelled to buy.  To that extent there is compulsion in relation to many of our industries.  I have no objection to it in certain circumstances but it is not a unique or unusual suggestion.  There are circumstances where it is permissible.  For instance, from a certain date one can buy only home-grown tomatoes.  I am all for it.  At the same time, we are virtually compelled to buy them.  Good; I accept that.  However, I am trying to show that in saying that there cannot be any compulsion the Minister is talking through his hat.  There is compulsion in many aspects of our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions of employment of these workers are quite scandalous, bearing in mind the ordinary conditions of coal mines.  The nationalisation of mines in Great Britain has brought about a remarkable improvement in conditions of service in the mines there.  I refer to facilities such as the provision of pit head baths and mechanisation to such a degree that men are relieved of the appalling, dirty drudgery so often associated with coal mining.  That is something that had to wait&mdash;and in our country, too&mdash;in Great Britain <Col N="146" /> until the mines became publicly owned.</P>
      <P>There was then a remarkable advance in the mechanisation of mines. Obsolete equipment which private enterprise had used was replaced by magnificent modern equipment which made coal mining quite an acceptable career for anybody.  In a condition of surplus, the mines in Great Britain were able to continue in operation because of the organisation and planning possible under public ownership, and the employees had secure employment with good monetary reward.  The employees there did not have the appalling fear of insecurity of unemployment which the unfortunate employee in the Arigna mine continues to face.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has made any case for the continuation of this situation.  One often hears of the failure of planning under Socialism. If we consider any of our publicly-owned industries it is quite clear that every one of them, up to and including C.I.E., was subsidised.  Every effort was made to ensure that the management of the enterprise would be dynamic, would look for markets rather than sit and wait for them. That is the record of our publicly-owned companies.</P>
      <P>From listening to the Taoiseach and every one of his Ministers we know that that is not the record of the privately-owned companies in this country.  We have to beat them out of the country; we have to beat them into the export market.  They are sitting on their backsides living behind protective tariff walls and making no attempt to expand.  That is the record of private enterprise in this country. Quite contrary to the Minister's statement that private enterprise would succeed better than nationalisation, it did not.  It failed all along the line, with a couple of exceptions which can be named, such as Messrs.  Guinness, Messrs. Jacob and Messrs. Dwyers.  It has failed all along the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made no case for the continued use of private enterprise in the operation of these mines. One is often told about the activities of the doctrinaire socialists.  We are <Col N="147" /> looking at the activities of a doctrinaire conservative.  The Minister is taking this stand simply because he is ideologically opposed to this idea of public ownership.  It is a most scandalous thing that the Minister should continue to hold a ministry in which he is asked to conscientiously discharge his responsibility to these various publicly-owned industries which he does not think operate efficiently or which he thinks do not operate as efficiently as they could under private enterprise.  The Minister has made no case at all for the continued control of these mines by private enterprise.  I should like to ask him, in the light of the clear-cut case against the continued use of private enterprise in Arigna, to reconsider the matter and take it into the ambit of the affairs of the many companies over which he has control and of whose success he is so proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has met this case fairly.  He has pointed out that a survey had been undertaken. If, as a result of that survey, sufficient coal can be guaranteed to run a second power station, a second power station will be erected.  He also showed that there was an increase in the output of coal from Arigna, although I did not take a note of the figures.  One of the difficulties was pointed out by Deputy McQuillan, that the price at which they were able to sell the coal at Drogheda would be uneconomic.  They would want to get that price at the pithead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as subsidy is concerned, there would be a case for the subsidisation of the transport of coal.  I cannot understand how the British can sell their coal much more cheaply here than they sell it in the Six Counties.  There must be a subsidy on the export of coal. Anybody with a knowledge of the trade relations between the two countries knows that there cannot be any such thing as a prohibition on British coal coming in.  That is part of the Trade Agreement.  We have the British market for our agricultural produce and they have free entry for their coal here.  The only thing I can think of, pending the erection of a new power <Col N="148" /> station, is a subsidy on the transport of coal.  That would not be a new thing It has been done in regard to such transport as beet.</P>
    <P>There is no comparison whatever between the mines at Arigna and other enormous mines, and it is ridiculous for Deputy Dr. Browne to suggest that there is.  When the survey is completed, it may be found that there are very big deposits.  Anyone who is acquainted with Arigna knows that the veins of coal are very light.  It is very difficult to get them out.  There is plenty of this crow coal.  The Minister has pointed out that an investigation is under way to see what can be made of that.  If there is an economic way of burning it, another power station could be erected, even though some more good coal may not be found. Already the State has interfered to this extent.  In connection with the survey, I think the sum of £150,000 was mentioned.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne and the others who say the State should take over the whole affair, if it is discovered that there are such deposits of coal there that private enterprise could not exploit them.  That may happen and I hope it will.  The small mines there are quite capable of being handled by the people who are running them at present.  They are now being encouraged by the Minister's Department. I am satisfied that the people of Arigna know that well, too.  The Minister ought not to close his mind to the possibility of enabling these people to sell their coal at a price that would at least just pay the mine owners. The only way that can be done is to subsidise its transport.  I should like to know how the British are able to sell their coal here much more cheaply than they sell it at home or in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bogs were there for everybody to exploit and everybody knew they were there, but nobody could exploit them but the State.  No private enterprises <Col N="149" /> could do it.  The railways broke down and if they were to continue at all, they had to be taken over by the State.  The same thing applies to Irish Shipping.  If the State had not started that company it would not be there at all.  The mines are there and there is a certain amount of coal that cannot be sold at a price that will pay. I do not know if nationalising them would make things any better.  I do not believe it would.  If as a result of the survey, larger deposits are discovered, then there would be a case.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any case to answer.  Certainly, neither the Minister nor Deputy Boland has changed my views with regard to the absolute necessity of nationalising the mining industry in Arigna.  I feel disappointed that a matter of such importance to western constituents has met with such little interest in the House from other Deputies who come from the Counties Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon.  The least they might have done, irrespective of Party, was to come along.  Those Deputies from the Counties Roscommon, Sligo and Leitrim should at least come into the Dáil, sit in the House and contribute something to this debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Minister was speaking for about seven minutes and that, while speaking, he dealt with the charges I made before Christmas on the monopoly that had been created in the Arigna area, with regard to supplying the generating station, by one company, namely the Arigna Colleries Company.  I understand he suggested this was the only company that was prepared to supply coal to the generating station for a period of 25 years and that other producers in the area were not inclined to tender or to supply coal on a long term basis.  I may be misquoting the Minister; if I <Col N="150" /> am I hope he will put me right, but if that is the Minister's viewpoint let me tell him that it is not the viewpoint of the majority of the miners in the Arigna area because they were never asked by the E.S.B. to tender for 25 years, or 25 months.</P>
    <P>One company got practically the whole concession with regard to the supplying of this publicly-owned generating station.  We have the extraordinary position that the State owns the generating station and a private company, in the next ten years, will have created such a position that they will almost have a complete monopoly for the supply of coal to that station. Is it not the position at the moment that this generating station consumes 45,000 tons of coal per year and of that 45,000 tons one company, namely Arigna Colleries, have a firm contract for the supply of 35,000 tons for the next 25 years?  That leaves a total of 10,000 tons which is distributed amongst three other small producers in the area on a very doubtful year-to-year basis.  There are four more minor producers in the area who have no contract and no outlet for their coal. Is it right that the State, through the E.S.B., should create such a position, that one company supplies 35,000 tons out of a total of 45,000 and, by the grip it has established, will be able to increase its hold and squeeze out the small owners who are left?  It is only a matter of a few years because the other owners are not able to get an outlet for their product.</P>
    <P>I quoted the Minister's letters before Christmas.  He had the audacity to write to mining producers in the area that a certain semi-State company was prepared to take coal from Arigna provided it was able to compete with the coal coming in from abroad.  I pointed out that that was coal which was subsidised by the British, to get rid of it, by a figure of 35/- to £2 a ton.  The unfortunate miners and producers in Arigna were asked to compete with subsidised coal produced by the British with up-to-date machinery and the best skill in the world.  That is the answer we get from people in a remote area like Arigna:&mdash;&ldquo;The Cement Company will certainly take coal from you provided <Col N="151" /> you can compete with what is coming in.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne mentioned tomatoes. The big end, shall we say, of tomato growing is around the city of Dublin and there are times when no foreign tomatoes are allowed in under any circumstances so that these well-off farmers in County Dublin will be protected and will have a very high price for their tomatoes.  There is protection but these tomato growers are men of influence and strength and they are in a position to put the squeeze on the Minister for Transport and Power and members of his Party.  The same applies to the Opposition, depending on whichever is in Government.  I do not suggest that they intimidate the Government or the Opposition merely by throwing the tomatoes at them. There are stronger ways of dealing with political Parties and a squeeze is generally put on through failure to subscribe generously when the hat is being passed around for a general election.</P>
    <P>The Minister is all for freedom of enterprise, open fields and open skies, but there are several items being manufactured in this country the raw material for which comes from abroad. Practically no part of the equipment in these finished products comes from raw material in Ireland.  All the raw material comes from abroad and the products are simply assembled in Ireland and they have strong protection. Here we have a raw material which is in the ground, in the mountains and the valleys, and we are told that that industry must look after itself, that there is no question of protection of any description.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to the Minister that although a case can be established for protection on the same lines as that given to State industries I am not seeking protection for the coal in that sense at all.  I am not asking the Minister to put on a tariff.  I am not asking him to offer a subsidy although I could justifiably, on the basis of the way subsidies are being given to industries for which the raw materials are brought in.  I think he can save <Col N="152" /> this industry, put it on its feet, expand it and give good employment without doing any of those things.  I believe by handling it over to a body like Bord na Móna he can achieve success.</P>
    <P>I want to quote the Minister's contribution and I think the House will see the fallacy of all his arguments in this statement which is reported at Col. 1226, Volume 185, for the 14th December last.  He said:</P>
    <P>I should make it clear at this point that under the Anglo-Irish Agreement it is impossible for the Government to impose a tariff on coal coming from Great Britain.  It is one of the key factors of the Agreement and the maintenance of the arrangement relates to other privileges we have in the English market which are absolutely vital to our economy.</P>
    <P>That is the case the Minister makes to me and he seeks to suggest by implication that my argument is that we must protect by subsidy or else we must stop the British coal from coming in.  I have not made such a suggestion but I ask the Minister when he does make a statement like that will he tell me what trade agreement we have with Poland, and what trade agreement we have with the United States of America?  Have not both of these countries been flooding up with coal and does the trade agreement with Britain cover Polish coal and American coal?  How does the Minister reconcile that position?  He cannot have it both ways.  The Polish and American coal was as harmful to the Arigna people as the British coal. The Minister cannot suggest to the public that Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Dr. Browne are trying to prohibit the importation of British coal and that we cannot do it because of the trade agreement.  The Minister forgets to tell the public that there is plenty of American and Polish coal coming in.  In other words, the Minister is trying to suggest that we want to raise the price of coal on the housewife in Dublin and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that Arigna coal be burned in fireplaces or used for domestic purposes but I am suggesting <Col N="153" /> that for industrial purposes Arigna coal cannot be surpassed and, in calorific value and ash content, is superior to British coal for industrial purposes.  I would suggest that the Minister should get some of his advisers who are surveying Arigna at the moment to read the reports of the technicians who installed the equipment at Ballinasloe Mental Hospital which to-day is one of the biggest consumers of coal from Arigna.  Their report is that Arigna coal is superior to imported coal and does not harm furnaces and equipment and that the authorities are highly pleased with the results.</P>
    <P>Coras Iompair Éireann, Cement Limited and other people suggested that Arigna coal was unsatisfactory in various ways.  This objection to Arigna coal can be traced to the fact that a number of the people who control the policy of some of the groups I have referred to had closer associations with British groups than they would like to admit.  They were prejudiced in favour of the foreign article, prejudiced against Arigna coal, sometimes on the grounds that during the war years, when the demand was very heavy, an odd wagon-load of very poor coal found its way to industrial concerns.  Prejudice was created as a result and has been used as an excuse ever since to decry Arigna coal.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he could not direct or influence the E.S.B. or any of these companies in regard to the coal they use.  Of course, he could, as Minister.  The question of policy is decided by the Government.  The question of administration is a matter for the company.  If the Government make an announcement or issue a directive to State companies that it is Government policy that a percentage of the fuel used by those companies must be native coal, that solves the problem. Undoubtedly if the Minister were anxious to secure a continuous demand from State and semi-State bodies for native coal the industry could flourish.</P>
    <P>At this stage we are not asking private enterprise to burn Arigna coal because private enterprise is not interested. There is no good in asking the <Col N="154" /> people of some town to burn Arigna coal unless the State itself sets the example. When I am able to show the Minister, beyond doubt, that Ballinasloe Mental Hospital has found Arigna coal to be the most successful coal that they have used to date, why cannot other State institutions and bodies use Arigna coal?  If it is successful in Ballinasloe Mental Hospital, it will be successful anywhere and all we want is that the Government should direct, as it is empowered to direct, State companies to use Irish coal.  We cannot direct private companies to do so but in the case of a State company run by the people, for the people, owned by the people, we should ensure that the company is national to the utmost extent, especially if the native fuel supplied to it is equal to what it can get from abroad and can be produced at a competitive price.</P>
    <P>In Arigna at the moment the good coal that is being produced is unmarketable for the majority of producers.  On 16th December, 1960, the Minister was written to by one of the producers in the area who asked him could he use his good offices with the E.S.B. and Cement Limited to purchase up to 10,000 tons of coal.  I do not know what the Minister did about that request but that coal was available up to December. There was no outlet for it and the men who mined it had to be laid off. It is nearly time that the human factor was taken into consideration. Families must be considered and the workers must have a sense of security if they are to remain in the area.</P>
    <P>For 40 years we have had native government in this part of the country and private enterprise has failed to give stability, to expand and to produce. Now the Minister comes into this House and says with his tongue in his cheek that he believes that private enterprise is the only successful way to accomplish development of the mining industry.  Is not that the death knell so far as these people are concerned?</P>
    <P>I have here a quotation from the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> of 14th May, 1960, under the heading &ldquo;Work Slack in <Col N="155" /> Arigna&rdquo;.  It states that for the second time in recent months it was found necessary to reduce the working week by a day owing to marketing difficulties; that as far as one of the big factories in Arigna was concerned at that stage 300 of the employees were told that there would be no work on Saturdays and Mondays; that there was wholesale emigration from the Arigna and Drumshanbo areas since the previous Christmas and that, with the threat of a further reduction in work, men were going every week, particularly the younger ones; that more were preparing to go; that whole families had already gone, including one family of eleven; that that fact was being keenly felt, not alone in Arigna but in Drumshanbo, the market town of the miners and their families, and in the surrounding towns.</P>
    <P>The <i>Roscommon Herald</i> is a paper that adores the Fianna Fáil Party.  They thought that the situation was so bad that they could not hide the truth in the Arigna area.  Even though I am trying to force them into the open, I believe that they will not publish a line of the discussion that has taken place in this House about the Arigna area.  They published that report last summer of the conditions in the Arigna area as they saw them.  That was from the Government's newspaper in the locality and if the Minister is not prepared to accept what they say, I cannot persuade him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Boland will have to collaborate with me after this motion to print copies of the entire discussion and have it sent around to <Col N="156" /> the chapel gates in North Roscommon so that people will know that there has been a discussion of their circumstances.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne mentioned the conditions under which the miners work in Britain.  Twenty years ago, the conditions in the mines in Britain, if they had obtained here, would have horrified the ordinary Englishman or Welshman.  They have now first-class health services, first-class washing facilities, sanitation and so on; they have protective clothing, good hours and security.  What is the position in Arigna?  They do not know from day to day how long their employment is to last.  There is no issue of protective clothing to any man.  He must buy it himself.  If you walked along in the evening in any part of this area, you would swear you were in Africa when you meet these men&mdash; no washing facilities, no interest whatever taken in them as human beings by the private groups that exploit them.  That will all be changed if a body like Bord na Móna is charged with the responsibility of running these mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The patience shown by these people is remarkable.  It has reached the stage now where they have lost hope. <Col N="157" /> Their patience is gone and by degrees, they are drifting out.  When the figures are shown after the next census, the general public and the members of this House will receive a great shock when they realise the number of families who have left this area and who will keep on leaving because when one group moves, they create the pool which will draw their neighbours and their friends as the years go by.  That is the situation that has developed; there is only one way to stop this economic and social disaster and that is for the State to step in in time and so organise the industry that these families that are there will have security and those who are gone will have the opportunity of coming back.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that part of the investigation going on at the moment in Arigna is into the possibility of utilising large deposits of what is described as crow coal.  As I have pointed out already, that is admirable and it is high time that such an investigation took place.  However, that is only part of the difficulty.  The major difficulty is to get a market for high-grade, deep-mined coal which is being mined there as well.  There is no market for that outside the limited one for one or two companies.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that if he is not prepared at this stage to accept this motion as it stands, he should be prepared to say to all the producers in the area: &ldquo;I want you to come together to form a united group, agree to submit from each colliery a certain amount of coal into a general pool.&rdquo;  Thus the Department of Industry and Commerce in conjunction with the mine owners, would allocate so much of that coal to various State and semi-State bodies. If that were done as a start, it would mean that each of the producers in Arigna would know he had a market for a certain amount of coal and he would be able to make arrangements for the following 12 months to employ a certain number on a continuous basis and a certain immediate stability would be brought to the situation. The only way that can be done is by taking all the owners into the Minister's <Col N="158" /> confidence.  There must be no favouritism; all must be consulted and a general pool created to which all will subscribe.  I hope the Minister will consider that.  I do not think he has considered it so far.</P>
    <P>There is another very important point to which the Minister has not referred in any detail, that is, the nature of the investigation and the exploration going on in the Arigna area.  I am speaking purely as a layman with no technical knowledge at all, but I am informed on what I consider to be fairly reliable authority that the investigation going on now into deposits is confined to the top of the mountains in Arigna and that in areas a number of bore holes have been put down to examine whether there are certain deep seams of coal in the mountains.  These borings that have been made are close to borings that were made years ago and some of the local people who are familiar with the matter can make a rough estimate of what amount of coal is in the mountains.</P>
    <P>Will there be any investigation by the experts who are in Arigna into the question of coal deposits under the Arigna river?  I understand some Scottish and English experts over the years maintained that the richest seams of coal in that countryside are to be found under the Arigna river.  To my knowledge, no borings have taken place to test the accuracy or otherwise of that.  I want the Minister to take note of this now.  I am giving him warning that over the next few months, I intend to extract from him, by questions, whether this investigation that is going on will include borings of the Arigna river bed itself and well under it.  He is getting notice in time so that we will have the position established whether or not there are very large deposits in the area.  Deputy Boland is now on record as stating that if these large deposits are found in Arigna, he is in favour of nationalisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means.  I do not think there is much point in delaying the House.  Even at this late stage, I would ask the Minister to examine his conscience. His leader, the Taoiseach, has shown commendable enterprise in the past in matters concerning development of native industries and although I criticised, and will criticise, the Taoiseach on many things, I must say that he played a big part in the establishment of some very successful State enterprises, <Col N="160" /> of which we are all proud.  I hate to hear or read of Ministers half-apologising when they speak at chamber of commerce dinners and elsewhere and suggesting that these State companies would not have been set up but for the fact that private enterprise was not strong enough to do the job.  We should be proud that State Companies were set up and have succeeded and it should be an encouragement to the Minister and the Taoiseach to continue with State companies, where there is need for them.</P>
      <P>We already have a State company, Bord na Móna, functioning in regard to fuel.  What is wrong with bringing the technical skill and resources of such an able company to bear on the problem at Arigna?  I hope the House will support this motion and bring it home forcibly to the Minister that a great number of our people feel that the only way to develop the resources of this locality is to hand them over to a State company.</P>
