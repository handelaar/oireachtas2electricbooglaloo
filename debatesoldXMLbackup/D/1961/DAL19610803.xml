      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate last night, I had discussed industry pretty fully and had been endeavouring to show the House that the Government had not prepared the country for the situation that was arising.  I also had shown the House that from information at my disposal, and which I believe must have been available to the Government, negotiations had been going on for some time.  I had drawn the attention of the House to the fact that the information given to us by the Taoiseach was tantamount to nothing.  The only information we had was that if Britain joined the Common Market, we would join it, too.  I had just commenced to give my views on agriculture when the debate was adjourned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning, I want to put before the House some facts from a document I have here, which shows that negotiations have been going on for a considerable time.  I believe the Government must have been cognisant those negotiations and I cannot <Col N="2632" /> understand why some definite information has not been given to this House. Further, I cannot understand why the Government did not see fit to set up a parliamentary committee, composed of members of this House and probably of the Seanad, to discuss so vital a matter, because it is a vital matter to our economy&mdash;probably the most vital this Dáil or any other Dáil has been called on to deal with since we received our freedom.</P>
    <P>The document I have here was issued a considerable time ago.  It is dated 28th June, 1961.  It is an economic report on the situation in Europe, a factual report issued by the Council of Europe&mdash;ASCC, 1360&mdash; which the Taoiseach or the Minister for External Affairs can get any time they want to.  It refers to a dogmatic statement by Mr. Macmillan, Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, Mr. Maudling and Mr. Heath, four important British Ministers dealing with this situation, that the three vital factors affecting the United Kingdom are the Commonwealth, agriculture and their association with their partners in the EFTA group.  It goes on to say that it seems the best course for Britain, and the one for which the British Government are preparing public opinion, is to join the Common Market as a full member, provided these three conditions are dealt with and that agreement can be reached in relation to them.</P>
    <P>This document, which was issued on 28th June&mdash;these negotiations took place some time before this House first heard officially from the Government anything about the Common Market&mdash; goes on to say: &ldquo;Meanwhile, Great Britain has been actively engaged in bilateral negotiations with certain members of the Six, with its EFTA partners and with Commonwealth countries.  The advantages of that procedure are evident.  Mr. Heath's statement showed that on a number of specific points the talks have already enabled positions to be reconciled and have led, all along the line, to a better understanding and evaluation of the vital interests of the countries concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is clear enough.  On these three vital questions, the United Kingdom <Col N="2633" /> has been negotiating over an extended period with regard to joining the Common Market.  I stress the United Kingdom so much because the Government have based their policy entirely on what the United Kingdom is doing. When the Taoiseach replies to this debate, I assume he will tell the House he was cognisant of these negotiations and whether in actual fact Ireland has been in on them or not.  Even though we are not members of the Commonwealth, we have Commonwealth preferences, and every single discussion that took place relative to agriculture was absolutely vital to us.</P>
    <P>We come now to the question of agriculture.  There seems to be greatly misinformed opinion relative to it.  You have people going around saying that if we join the Common Market or if the United Kingdom joins the Common Market, we are going to lose all our trade with the United Kingdom. We buy more <i>per capita</i> from the United Kingdom, with the solitary exception of the Federal Republic of Germany, than any other country in Europe.  Therefore, the mutual advantages that exist in trade between the two countries are there for everybody to see.  If the United Kingdom joins&mdash; as she will join, quite obviously&mdash;the Economic Community, it means that we still have our trade with the United Kingdom and will still hold the greater portion of our trade.  For that purpose, it is necessary to look at the situation in its wider context and see is the position quite so hopeless as so many people seem to think from the point of view of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last night before the adjournment that the European Economic Community has the greatest purchasing power in the world today after the United States&mdash;170,000,000 people.  They are five per cent. short of their beef requirements.  It is extremely unlikely that they would be able to get into full production or into any further production on that line themselves.</P>
    <P>Further, if the United Kingdom join the Common Market they themselves will have to put up tariffs against the outside world.  They will have to put up a common tariff.  If we are in the <Col N="2634" /> market with the United Kingdom and the E.F.T.A. countries, it is reasonable to assume that the heavy imports of food into the United Kingdom will be stopped with the exception of those coming from the Commonwealth. Therefore, the purchasing power of this European organisation should, from the point of view of agricultural produce, be the greatest in the world. I do not see what this country has to fear from that.</P>
    <P>We produce a specialised article in that we produce meat.  We produce perhaps better quality beef than any country.  All this talk about having to compete with the Danish market and with the only other agricultural-exporting country within the Six, Holland, and that we shall not be able to compete with them is nonsense.  I do not see why this country could not be geared to go into full production for this very valuable market.  However, to do so, the country requires warning.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long the negotiations will take.  I do not know how long it will be before it is a <i>fait accompli</i> and we are in the Common Market and the United Kingdom are in the Common Market and we have to put up a common tariff against the rest of the world.  Surely the Taoiseach or the Minister for Agriculture&mdash; because it is his particular line&mdash;or the Minister for External Affairs should have given this House some information? We have had no information about these vital points nor have the Irish farmers had any information to prepare them for the challenge.</P>
    <P>The market is there but, to succeed in it, we must have that high quality production which is so essential in the competitive market we now face. It would seem that the farmers of Ireland are not in anything like as difficult a position in the changing course of events as the industrialists. The industrialists have been let down stone cold by this Government.  They are the people who should have protected them.  The present Taoiseach is the architect of modern industrial policy in this country which has settled down behind high protective tariffs. Literally overnight&mdash;without any <Col N="2635" /> warning except the few hazy speeches at chambers of commerce functions throughout the country from Ministers to the effect that we should become more competitive&mdash;they find themselves let down.</P>
    <P>I come now to the political question in regard to the Common Market. Many people have said there is no political issue.  There is a world-wide political issue in this Common Market. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the last American Government came to Paris for the express purpose of having conversations with the European powers.  The object was to replace the existing O.E.E.C. by a world-wide organisation or an organisation embracing Europe, the United States and Canada to be known as O.E.C.D.  He stated that the specific reason for that was to ensure there would be an economic <i>bloc</i> strong enough to face the situation with which every free nation is confronted nowadays&mdash;the encroachment of Communism.  It was specifically encouraged and desired by the United States that Europe should put its affairs in order as soon as possible and form a strong economic and political cohesive unit.</P>
    <P>Of course we have a political interest in all this.  We fought long enough to adhere to our historical, cultural and religious principles.  As a founddation, we have a deep spiritual and Christian outlook.  Anything to do with Communism we hate and loathe and detest.  Naturally, we would have an interest in seeing that our way of life is preserved and maintained.  The only way in which that can be preserved and maintained is to ensure in the changing circumstances of the world that an economic force will be built up strong enough to deal with the position.</P>
    <P>When the United States Minister came over he stressed that one of the great objects of a strong economic organisation, O.E.C.D., was to meet the attempted encroachment of the Communist menace and ideology upon the new nations forming in Africa and also that, with the growing spirit of freedom asserting itself in many of the States of Latin America which <Col N="2636" /> were under a dictatorial <i>régime</i>, there were considerable risks of their being taken over by the Communist ideology.  For that reason we have a political interest.  The Government must know that they are the true facts facing the world.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs has been going to the United Nations now for several years.  If he has learned anything he must know the appalling menace that hangs over the world. The Government must know, if they read the documents available to them, that these things I cite are actual facts. For that reason, our interests are widely linked up with Europe.  It is not a question of economic isolation. It is not a question of our linking only with Europe but of linking with the whole free world to preserve something that is vital.  Surely it would be small satisfaction to any body here if we preserved our few existing markets or gained a few new ones to know that they could be set aside by a Communist menace and that the whole world could be enslaved.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies may think I am rather overstating the case.  I can assure them in all sincerity that I am not.  The risks of war seem to be receding but the economic enslavement of the world is, perhaps, the greatest menace that faces us today. With the United States, Canada and a unified Europe we shall have an economic <i>bloc</i> which will be able to give the aid so essential to the  group of nations in Africa and to the South American States which need support to build themselves up.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of Europe, with its ancient cultural heritage, come what may or whatever the disagreements in Europe may have been, and America, to give that culture and freedom of thought to the rest of the world.  For that reason I believe the Government have failed badly in this case.  They have failed badly that they did not study, evaluate and realise those facts. They have not activated public opinion in Ireland so that everybody will know what the Common Market is.  Had they done that and prepared the country for this step, we should have made far greater strides in technical <Col N="2637" /> advancement and been prepared to meet the situation which now faces us.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the Six Counties and the unification of Ireland. When a great economic unit, such as the United Kingdom&mdash;in spite of its traditional policy of dissociating itself from the European community of nations and remaining an isolated unit and an island&mdash;finds itself no longer able to carry on, in the changing circumstances of the world, is it not reasonable to assume, in relation to a small, unnatural, uneconomic unit such as the Six Counties, that out of this may come not only a united Europe but, please God, a united Ireland?</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to deal with one or two specific observations made by Deputy Dillon in the course of the last few days.  In his comment on the Taoiseach's announcement that we were applying for membership of the Common Market, Deputy Dillon once again revealed the underlying insincere attitude of the Fine Gael Party in regard to industrial development in this country.  He cited as criticism of the Taoiseach's industrial policy, the policy which has been maintained by Fianna Fáil since 1932, that we now have to abandon the tariff policy which we had previously advocated.  Deputy Dillon revealed the true insincerity of the Fine Gael Party whenever they, in their public statements, borrow some element of Fianna Fáil policy&mdash;and almost all their policy is borrowed Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words there is no difference between the two of you.  Is that not what that means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his observations he implied it never had been right to impose tariffs on industry and that that policy had proved itself wrong because we now have to contemplate dismantling the tariffs protection over a period.  He gave himself away more fundamentally than that in the course of a debate on <Col N="2638" /> an entirely different subject&mdash;the proposal to establish a separate hotel company for C.I.E.  In the course of that debate Deputy Dillon said: &ldquo;I am fundamentally and irrevocably a radical, liberal free trader&rdquo;.  Now we know where we are.  That is the real truth that lurked under this half-sincere effort to follow Fianna Fáil and to adopt their policies when they become successful.  We find Deputy Dillon, as the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, making the statement that he has always been a radical, liberal free trader.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of people outside this House who perhaps may not have studied the tariff systems of the world, I want to state the truth about the matter.  When we took office we did so at a time when the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, as they were then called, believed entirely in a policy relying on cattle exports and virtually nothing else.  We had to take action to try to create an industrial world in this country after an appalling period of history dating back 150 years, during which many industries had been crushed and in which there was also a total absence of industrial tradition. Therefore we imposed tariffs on commodities coming in, in order to assist new industries to get on their feet. Deputy Dillon when he said he was a free trader implied that at the back of his mind there lay the doubt as to whether any of our tariffs were justified. That is exactly what we in Fianna Fáil have always experienced from the Coalition Parties, or at least from the Fine Gael Party all through their period as a Party in this House.  They are never really sincere when they do adopt Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think that this was the only country in the world which had imposed tariffs to establish industry. Let us take the case of Great Britain, a country with a long established industrial tradition; a country in the van of the industrial revolution all over the world in the early part of the 19th century; a country with raw materials not available to us, and owning at one time a vast empire and, as a result, having all the opportunities for establishing industries without protection.  The average tariff <Col N="2639" /> in the United Kingdom to-day on imported goods is 25 per cent.  Yet Deputy Dillon calls himself a radical, liberal free trader.  I defy the Fine Gael Party to examine the general tariff levels of any European country, and of almost any country in the world, and from that study to suggest that our level of tariffs allowing for our position and our lack of industrial tradition, indicates that we had anything but a national viewpoint and a common sense viewpoint, and that, if we had to establish industries, in the earlier stages it would be necessary to protect them from imports.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dillon talks about our having to eat our words in regard to tariffs, does he know nothing about what happens when one small country starts industries?  He knows nothing about it.  For example, if you start an industry for making paper bags an exporter from another country can in the course of three weeks send in a quantity of paper bags that would cover the entire home market at dumped prices and put the whole industry out of action for the next 12 months.  Does he know nothing about dumping?  If we take a tariff which is 50 per cent. on goods not of Commonwealth or British origin, say 33 per cent. of Commonwealth origin, a considerable part of that whole tariff mantle is imposed in order to prevent the dumping of goods at unnaturally low prices, prices that are far below those at which the goods are sold on the home market of the country from which they are exported.  He does not appear to have studied the system of trade as it has developed over the last 30 years.</P>
    <P>Apparently he did not even care to mention in the course of his observations as a radical, liberal free trader, that in the case of the Rome Treaty the dumping of goods after the tariffs have been dismantled can be remedied.  A country can appeal to the Rome Treaty Commission when goods are being exported from another country at prices below the domestic cost in that country.  If they are so exported at that price, there can be a remedy.  The very free trade system of the Rome Treaty provides for the <Col N="2640" /> one danger that affects small countries, namely the opportunities for the export into a small country of enormous quantities of goods at low prices that would practically put the home factories out of action.  Yet Deputy Dillon takes the opportunity of criticising Fianna Fáil administration for having initiated industrial development when every intelligent, young democracy had done the same thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a tariff is no protection against dumping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make that point very clear so that no one will have any illusions about it.  The fact is that, if tariffs can be removed, it is hoped that under the Rome Treaty negotiations they will be removed at a rate which will enable us to increase our productivity and so to overcome the difficulties that would inevitably be associated with the changes which will be taking place in our economy.</P>
      <P>The proof that we can look forward with some optimism to being able to join the Common Market lies in the fact that there has been a very great increase in the productivity of industry here over the last five years.  The output per worker has steadily increased in a very large group of industries.  The best proof of our ability to survive the difficulties of joining the Common Market lies in the fact that the export of industrial goods has doubled since 1956, the year in which the Coalition left this country in a state of wreckage. Quite obviously a great number of our industries are now learning&mdash;some better than others&mdash;how to reduce their costs and how to prepare themselves to face increasing competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously there are some where great improvement will be required. Obviously there will be industries where a measure of rationalisation will be needed, where there are too many units producing the same group of commodities, whereas the fact is they should specialise.  Obviously there will have to be certain combinations of industries in order to reduce overhead costs so that our exports will continue and, at the same time, enable us to meet the exigencies of the Common Market regulations.  Nevertheless, there has been every sign that in the last <Col N="2641" /> five years there has been a very great improvement in our industrial structure. As I have said, for a great many industries a considerable part of the tariff structure is related to temporary dumping and is aimed at discouraging dumping.  I do not think I need say anything more about that.</P>
    <P>I come now to something else that Deputy Dillon said.  He went back to that old rag of an argument about a statement made by some member of Fianna Fáil to the effect that, thank God, the British market was gone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is perfectly evident from an examination of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement in 1938 that the Fianna Fáil Government never lost sight of the vital importance of the cattle trade and the foundation of that Trade Agreement in 1938 was the assurance that we would be able to export our livestock and livestock products to Great Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at satisfactory prices, prices which would help us to go ahead with our industrial development and leave us in a position to export our industrial products ultimately <Col N="2642" /> to Great Britain, as soon as we could develop that trade while, at the same time, improving the position of our farmers and placing them in a reasonably satisfactory position in regard to the livestock trade.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from 1951 to 1954, which showed the least degree of prejudice against the livestock trade of the country.  When we took office in 1957 and formulated the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, having already provided a market for wheat and barley, having already expanded our sugar production from what it was in the time of Cumann na nGaedheal, and having dealt with grain crops, livestock production was the No. 1 policy, because it was our belief that the world was growing richer, that Europe was growing richer, that the British people were growing richer and, as a long-term measure, it would be vital, therefore, to increase cow stocks over a period of years, having eliminated bovine tuberculosis; and, for that purpose, we made arrangements for breeding, provided subsidies for fertilisers, and advocated the improvement of our grasslands.  It is all in the Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>

      <P>I remember Deputy Dillon, who left us with an unmanageable surplus of wheat in 1957, saying in 1947 he would rather be seen dead than standing in a field of wheat.  I remember Deputy Dillon condemning outright all tariffs of every description, and, this year, condemning the whole of our industrial structure as something run by profiteers&mdash;an allegation that has no substance&mdash;and something that could not be kept going, something that would lead us nowhere.  I do not know whether Fine Gael want me to go on with Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon lately seems to have got some sense.  He no longer denigrates wheat and beet and peat in the way he did in the past. But one occasionally sees the old policy emerging.  We had it on the debate on the Electricity Supply Bill when we got the feeling that Fine Gael would in reality like to close down the Bord na Móna peat stations. We got it again in speeches made by Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon about the value of peat production and peat fired generators helping in our electricity production.  We had it again&mdash;that atmosphere of insincerity &mdash;whenever they referred to the policy established by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I want now to deal with some of the observations made by Deputy Dillon in relation to agriculture. Deputy Dillon spoke about the difficulties through which the agricultural community are passing.  As usual, of course, he blamed the Government for all these difficulties.  The strange thing about Deputy Dillon, when he speaks of agriculture, is the fact that during all these four years we have never heard him give in detail his criticism of the operation of the Programme for Economic Expansion in relation to agriculture.  We have never heard him analyse the policies put into operation since that programme was published.  Even the other day, when referring the position of the farmers, beyond advocating more scientific education, he had nothing to offer.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the farmers will appreciate Deputy Dillon in a time of general election when he blames us for three years of freakish bad weather, when he blames us for the difficulties the farmers have been experiencing in the course of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, and when he blames us for the collapse of beef prices on the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has not made the proposal that we should place beef prices above the British level when they fall, find subsidies for it and introduce Supplemenatry Estimates in the Dáil to cover these subsidies by taxation.  He does not dare to make <Col N="2645" /> any such proposal.  All he does is to try to blame us for the low price of beef on the British market because he cannot offer any solution for it.  It might be just as well to remind Deputy Dillon that there have been unusual reductions in the price of cattle at other periods and that the price of cattle at the moment is considerably higher on average than it was in the last year of the Government of which he was a member.</P>

      <P>The price of young cattle 6 to 12 months old, in 1956, according to the Department of Agriculture was £18 18s. 6d.  From January to March, 1961, it was £21 14s. 3d.  The price of store cattle, one to two years old, in 1956 was £29 13s. and the price in the first three months of this year was £34 19s. 6d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of fat cattle, two to three years old, in 1956 was £48 16s. 6d. and in the first three months of this year it was £58 6s. 6d. Yet Deputy Dillon talked as though a temporary reduction in beef cattle had some relation to the Fianna Fáil agricultural policy.  He will go around blaming weather conditions and other marketing conditions on Fianna Fáil but I do not believe the farmers will pay heed to him.  I do not believe any farmer with commonsense will really accept the doctrine that, this country having been virtually flooded out in 1958 and again in 1960 and having suffered the effects of the other conditions to which I referred, the Government must be blamed for the acts of Providence.  I do not believe the average farmer will accept any of that nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is perfectly well aware of the fact that the farmers of <Col N="2646" /> this country, in their wisdom or un-wisdom, do not desire to have their cattle marketed on a 100 per cent. basis by any State or other marketing agency.  They have never asked for it. Therefore, they must accept that market prices will rocket up and down, that at one moment calves may be sold for £24 and the next moment there will be a lack of demand for cattle for one reason or another.  There are bound to be these fluctuations in price.  The alternative to such fluctuations would be a system of marketing for which there is no demand by the farmers in general and which would involve very great difficulties in operation, causing a complete revolution in a great many marketing arrangements.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt with that question sufficiently to eliminate the atmosphere of nonsense that can be created when we are discussing serious agricultural problems.  The problem of promoting the Government's policy for the expansion of cattle clearly indicated in 1958 is a serious one.  There are bound to be difficulties along the way.  At least I can say this: the Coalition Government spent some £500,000 in their last year of office in the elimination of bovine tuberculosis. We are spending £5,000,000 this year. Ten counties have been attested and I hope that more are on the way.</P>
    <P>The farmers will not listen to Deputy Dillon's dreary, mournful talk around the country when already they are experiencing the result of additional buyers coming in to buy good-class attested cattle in the fairs of the west and when they see the improvement in prices and in the level of demand for cattle.  They will take courage from that change and will fail to agree with Deputy Dillon that Providence and Fianna Fáil are identical and that bad weather and temporarily difficult conditions can be blamed on the Government. The idea is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Basically there has been a very great improvement in the agricultural position since the dark days of 1956 in spite of the difficulties of bovine tuberculosis eradication.  In 1960 the total cattle population was 4 per cent. above what it was in 1956 and when one considers the progress made despite <Col N="2647" /> the difficulty of maintaining the cattle population and of expanding it in the face of the removal of reactors, that more than anything else is proof that during those four years the farmers, whatever their major or minor criticisms of the Government might have been, had real confidence in the future of the livestock industry and real confidence that the Government was making an effort to assist them in the many ways in which they did.</P>
    <P>There are some other evidences of a fundamental improvement in the whole of the agricultural industry.  One of those has been the steady increase in the export of processed foodstuffs, in the export of agricultural produce of all kinds other than live animals.  We have always worked for that in Fianna Fáil.  I do not believe the Fine Gael Party have ever disputed the value of processing as much of our agricultural produce as we could in the long-term interests of the farmer and of employment alike.  If we take the exports of processed foodstuffs in 1960 compared with 1956, we find the total exports of beef, fresh, chilled and frozen, have increased by 258 per cent.  The exports of mutton and lamb of all types have gone up by 62.3 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Exports of cheese alone, which are still fractional and which may be greatly increased as a result of various measures taken exclusively by the Fianna Fáil Government, have gone up 85 per cent.  I want to make it clear that the amount is far too small but, at least, it indicates progress. Then we have the fact that, in spite of the difficulties farmers experienced before the Pigs Marketing Board was established&mdash;and I think it should have been established many years ago by one of the other Governments&mdash; the export of bacon and hams in 1960 <Col N="2648" /> was 267 per cent. above that in 1956, notwithstanding the Fine Gael Party's boasted advocacy of what they regard as their exclusive agricultural policy. The export of vegetables, still very minimal, went up 40 per cent. in the period.  The export of fruit, still very minimal, went up 54 per cent. in the period.  The export of all processed foodstuffs increased by 72 per cent.</P>
      <P>That is really fundamental, sound progress, progress in developing a form of exports which are commonplace in Denmark, commonplace in the Netherlands and which for far too long have been delayed in this country, and it indicates real progress so far as a fundamental agricultural policy is concerned.</P>

      <P>When we come to agricultural credit, there again, in either period of Government, further steps could have been taken at an earlier stage to make agricultural credit more easily available.  Nevertheless, the fact remains that the Agricultural Credit Corporation has been overhauled by Fianna Fáil.  The fact remains that as a result of negotiations that took place away back in 1957 or 1958 between the Minister for Finance and the Commercial Banks and the National Farmers' Association, the farmers borrowed from the banks about £17 million more than in the last full year of Coalition Government. I have noted efforts by some Fine Gael speakers and by Deputy Blowick to suggest that the whole of that borrowing was beginning to be an albatross round the necks of the farmers and banks alike.  The facts are, as I have gathered from the banks, that the vast majority of that credit was extended to farmers to help them to get over the difficulties of eradicating bovine tuberculosis, to increase their production and to improve their land. I further learned from the commercial banks that the amount of bad debts experienced by the banks in respect of the three difficult years through which the farmers have passed is virtually <Col N="2649" /> negligible and that this scheme is working as well as could be expected having regard, as I have said, to the difficulties farmers have experienced as a result of bad weather.</P>
      <P>Then, again, we have heard all this talk by Fine Gael as though they were the progenitors of all good agricultural policy and yet, late as it is, it was a Fianna Fáil Government that undertook the fundamental step of trying to provide proper marketing arrangements for our pig products and dairy products.  I want to make it clear that the mere establishment of those two marketing boards is only one step on the way.  No matter how efficient the boards are in the discharge of their duties, unless there can be co-operation all along the line between the boards and the farmers both in regard to production at every stage and in regard to the farmers' contribution to better marketing, they will not succeed in their efforts but at least, late as it may be, it is our Government which have carried out two fundamental changes of policy, which have long ago been evident in the smaller agricultural countries of Western Europe, in trying to rationalise the marketing of our pig and dairy products.</P>
      <P>The present Government in this year are spending on the Department of Agriculture nearly 2½ times the money voted to the Department in the last full year of Coalition Government. I do not know whether Deputy Dillon thinks that is totally disregarding the interests of the farmers.  I noticed during the course of the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture there was no suggestion that that very great increase in the Vote was either being misspent or being fraudulently spent or was not being spent with good effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture revealed no creative ideas on the part of the Fine Gael Party but at least they did not criticise us for more than doubling the moneys voted for the Department of Agriculture for direct agricultural services.  At the same time we heard no criticism of the successive <Col N="2650" /> steps taken by the Government, at considerable cost to the taxpayer, to assist farmers over the difficult period through which they were passing, of the £2½ million made available in 1960, covering an increase in the price of milk and export subsidies for reactor cattle.  Those amounts, I may add, have been enormously surpassed this year because of the low prices in Great Britain.  There will be, quite evidently, a very big impost upon the current Budget in relation to the export subsidies made available for beef at the present time.  The £2½ million also covered an additional subsidy of £4 a ton on potash and an additional and enhanced price for super-grade A. bacon.</P>
    <P>It is very heartening to have seen the very considerable increase in the exports of bacon compared with 1956 and comparing the figures for the first half of 1961 with the figures for the first half of 1960, showing that some progress has been made, even although, as I have said, the machinery of the Pigs Marketing Board is not yet in operation, and before the effects of that Board can be felt in the benefits we hope will result to farmers.</P>
    <P>We heard no criticism from Deputy Dillon when in the course of the Budget this year we added another £800,000 over and above the amount provided in the Estimates covering increases in grants for farm buildings, an increase of the subsidy for limestone and another £1 a ton subsidy for potash and the increased grants for providing up-to-date piggeries.  We heard no criticism of that.  I want to make it clear that the Government stand on that programme&mdash;the total programme.  In the programme for economic expansion, the later measures undertaken in 1959, 1960 and 1961 plus the two Marketing Boards constitute a very considerable record of progress in the agricultural field.</P>
    <P>One of the habits of the Coalition is to claim credit for practically all the Fianna Fáil agricultural policy and as this Dáil is now coming to an end and will not meet again in its present form, it is just as well to remind the House of some of the grants for which the <Col N="2651" /> Coalition claim credit whereas, in fact, these schemes were first promoted by ourselves.  I refer in particular to the Farm Building Grant Scheme for which all the regulations and the proposals lay on Deputy Dillon's table in 1948 when he took office, having been devised and conceived by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Deputy Dillon's sole item of agricultural policy which appears to be coherent at the present time is an increase in the scientific education made available to farmers.  The number of agricultural advisers all through the Fianna Fáil Government from 1938 onwards has constantly increased and so has the money provided to the County Committees of Agriculture for that purpose. It has been increased during the last four years and it has been an integral part of Fianna Fáil policy to encourage the increase in the number of agricultural advisers but one would think, listening to Deputy Dillon, that there were no agricultural advisers now and that quite suddenly he is going to produce 100 out of the hat. That appears, from what I have read of his speeches, to be his present sole contribution to new agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>We have been told the Land Project was the invention of the Coalition Government.  What is the truth of that?  It just so happens by coincidence that the present Minister for Agriculture and myself moved and seconded a resolution at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1939 advocating grants for land reclamation and they were put into operation and a vast amount of excellent work was done under that scheme during the war years when, of course, there would have been no new agricultural machinery available, no bulldozers, no trenchers, and no diesel oil for them even if they were available.  The scheme continued splendidly until after the war when it was mechanised and expanded by Deputy Dillon.  That is the truth of the Land Project.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon takes upon himself responsibility for cattle breeding stations, for the Soil Analysis Scheme, both of which were designed and put into operation by Fianna Fáil, and he <Col N="2652" /> even boasts of the Ground Limestone Scheme, as being his own particular invention.  It was lying on his desk in 1948 in the form of plans for a pilot scheme in connection with one ground limestone plant in Wexford, with proposals for a subsidy for ground limestone. He left that on his desk until 1951 when, we understand, the Marshall Plan representative in Dublin suggested that he might spend some of the American money on productive schemes.  As a result, the Ground Limestone Scheme was begun.</P>
    <P>You would think from their remarks here and elsewhere that they were responsible for those policies.  I mention those in particular; there are a great many more which we started&mdash;support of prices, the expansion of the sugar factories and putting them on a proper basis, to name only two others.  Nearly all the schemes for agricultural expansion, in fact, we devised, and of the trade agreements with Britain, the majority were the result of our negotiation. Though we can always ask for more, the fact remains that our trade trends, devised by Fianna Fáil, have enabled agricultural exports to proceed to Britain and expand as a result.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms of the Coalition Parties has always been that Fianna Fáil is too tough&mdash;that it asks too much of the people, and I should like to take the opportunity of placing on record the progress made in the development of our social services during the past four years because, as always, they far outstep anything done by a Coalition Government at any stage of their history.  The cost of living, as the House knows, rose during the period of the last Coalition Government, in spite of their frantic, ridiculous and contemptible promises to slash it in 1954.  The Fine Gael Party will find if they look at the O.E.E.C. statistics, that the cost of living has risen by about the European average and by about the average of the countries in the sterling market. They will find there is nothing exceptional in regard to the cost of living except in 1954 when we had those blue pamphlets which promised to bring it down with a bang.  Of course that never happened.</P>
    <P>Having mentioned the fact that there <Col N="2653" /> has been an increase in the cost of living of from eleven to twelve per cent., I want to illustrate the improvement in the social services under the Fianna Fáil Government because I think the public are going to be again influenced&mdash;only a few&mdash;by this talk of 1s. 6d.&mdash;the suggestion being that it is a cheap, insignificant amount.  I have seen it already published in the local papers&mdash;this insult inflicted on the less well-to-do sections by this increase of 1s. 6d. in the social services.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  For a widow with three children in receipt of a contributory pension, the rate was 46s. in 1956.  That has been increased by 14s. The non-contributory pension for a widow with three children has gone up from 36s. 6d. in 1956 by 16s.</P>

      <P>Unemployment and disability benefits have gone up from 61s. by 16s. and unemployment assistance from 28s. by 17s.  As the Deputy has said, we have managed, because of the growing productivity of industry, to secure more contributions from the employers, more from the workers and more from the Government, but in the case of assistance, of course the whole community pays in the form of taxation.  The Deputy might be interested to know that the whole of the produce of income tax is channelled into social and health services&mdash;a redistribution of income to provide for basic needs.</P>
      <P>We believe there should be a very considerable voluntary effort but that the basic minimum should be provided from taxation.  I am not saying that that indicates the maximum that can be provided as the country's prosperity grows.  It is the policy of Fianna Fáil that whenever the Budget permits it, or whenever taxation is remitted on those who can produce, to increase social services as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <P>When a comparison <Col N="2654" /> is made with other countries wealthier than ours, we know we have a long way to go, but beyond doubt there has been remarkable progress.  There has been progress in respect of old age pensions, in which the increase under Fianna Fáil was 6s. and under the Coalition Government 2s. 6d.  I mention that to indicate that along with the very great recovery in the country's fortunes, there has been this effort to redistribute from our income to provide against the hazards of life for those less well off.  No one can say that the increases I have recited are miserable and, of course, I can dispose of this cheap 1s. 6d. argument by pointing out that those increases were progressive during the years of Fianna Fáil Government.  The total is something of which we can well be proud. It will, however, be necessary for those to be increased still further as time goes on.</P>
      <P>I should like also to say a few words about the general tone of Deputy Dillon's speech in the course of his reply to the Taoiseach's address when he moved the Vote for the Taoiseach's Department.  The country has been pulling itself up by its bootstraps very successfully after the wreckage left by the Coalition in 1956. I want to make it clear that we on this side of the House state unequivocally that the mentality underlying the Coalition Government did a lot to halt the progress of this country for the ten years since the war.</P>

      <P>In the first place, let us take the Coalition which lasted from 1948 to 1951.  The House will recall the circumstances in which we had been able to survive and in which there had been reasonable provision made for the people during the Emergency. The time came to go ahead with a new post-war policy and to consider our position in relation to the rest of the world and the progress that needed to be made.  What did we have?  We had an election fought for the first time purely on the basis that the people were entitled to a better living, harking back to the increases in <Col N="2655" /> the cost of living that had taken place during the war as though they were crushing and oppressive and proof of the disaster of the Fianna Fáil Government, although the cost of living had increased a great deal more in many other countries.  Although there has never been a war yet without an increase in the cost of living, it was made the basis of what was supposed to be the turning point in our fortunes and the beginning of another great programme of industrial and agricultural revival.</P>
      <P>The House will remember all the talk about the rich profiteers rolling round the country in their large private cars who had filled the coffers of the Fianna Fáil Party with their ill-gotten gains.  The House will remember that, when Fine Gael took office with the Coalition, we had a curious mixture of Fianna Fáil policy borrowed from us and overlaid with a kind of sticky political mess.  That is what was offered to the people.</P>
      <P>When they took office, they found no profiteers.  None was prosecuted. Nothing happened about the prices. They did not find any evidence that we had corruptly provided prosperity for profiteers all over the country.  When they took office, they found they could not reverse the price trend which had taken place during the war.  They found, as we knew they would, that that was all nonsense.  Their aim was to get the Fianna Fáil Party out of office at all costs.</P>
      <P>Then we found the poison getting under the skin of Fine Gael from the influence of the Clann na Poblachta Party.  It was a strange kind of pink socialism that was not really genuine and which said this to the people: &ldquo;You do not really need to make any effort.  This country can be a Paradise on earth so long as we can sell out our savings in Great Britain.  Everyone is entitled to a good living.  This country should be a magnificent place. No one needs to make any special effort.  You can all live on a tide of good fortune so long as we have enough bank notes printed.&rdquo;  That was a desperate mixture along with the whole pattern of Fine Gael conservative policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2656" /> All the emphasis was on the price of goods, on easy living, and the Government, in order to survive with its left wing-right wing, had to try to behave like a kindly grandmother paying out pocket money to her grandchildren and saying: &ldquo;Everything will be all right in the garden so long as the paying out of the pocket money goes on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, it was easy to do that. The first Coalition Government were riding on a post-war boom.  They could be absolutely certain of a number of things.  First of all, exports did rise, as a result of fertilisers being available at the end of war conditions and agricultural and industrial machinery could be procured.  The world was hungry for food.  They could be certain that for a very considerable period prices would rise faster than the cost of production, particularly for farmers.  Prices would go up and everything would be disposed of.  Naturally, being a Coalition Government, they took full advantage of all these things.</P>
    <P>I remember all the fraudulent propaganda by Deputy Dillon about the volume of production.  In 1951, Deputy Dillon said that the volume of production in agriculture had shown a remarkable bound from the years 1946 and 1947.  He chose two years during which the weather was perfectly frightful. It was the end of a war period, when no fertilisers were available, when no drainage machinery was available, when the arterial drainage project, devised by Fianna Fáil, could not have gone into operation and when the farmers were flooded out as a result of snow.  There were also other difficulties. He might just as well have taken the year 1945.  By the end of a few years of Coalition Government, the volume of production was the same.  It had not increased.  They said exports were increasing. People could sell their goods at high prices because prices were rising faster than the cost of government. They patted themselves on the back for all that.</P>
    <P>Then we had the next really serious dose of poison in the community&mdash;the famous speech made by the Taoiseach, Deputy J.A. Costello, in 1949, when he announced in grandiose phrases that in order to outdo the nationalistic policy of Fianna Fáil, they were going <Col N="2657" /> to prove we were craven cowards utterly dependent upon British savings. They were going to repatriate the foreign assets.</P>
    <P>It is just as well to remind ourselves of this because we have been suffering ever since from that one decision and that one speech of the then Taoiseach in 1949.  Apparently, neither he nor his colleagues had taken an elementary course in economics subscribed to either by Mr. Gaitskell or Mr. Macmillan&mdash;universal economics about which there is no disagreement. If you want to repatriate foreign assets, there is only one way you can do it, that is, by importing goods.  We could not bring it back in bags of gold on the train from Euston.  We heard people going round the country in the Clann na Poblachta Party, feebly supported by Fine Gael, wrapping green flags round them and saying how much more splendidly Irish they were than Fianna Fáil because they would repatriate the foreign assets.</P>
    <P>It was difficult to explain to the people that the foreign assets could be repatriated only by importing goods. We made it clear that if we imported machinery for further production and if we imported fertilisers, that would be a great way of making use of foreign assets.  If they were used to import consumer goods or raw materials for industry, we would reduce our foreign reserves and would be less able to deal with any crisis that might arise if for any reason we imported a huge quantity of goods for which we could not pay with fresh exports.</P>
    <P>We were derided around the country by the Coalition Government as un-Irish people who wanted to live on John Bull.  We can all remember that nonsense.  It was a childish performance. The facts are that a Coalition until their backs are to the wall, can never tell the truth to the people.  They must always say the popular thing because it is easier to do it and easier to keep a Coalition Government together that way.  What was the truth? The truth was that savings were being used for consumption purposes.</P>
    <P>In 1951 we had the first Coalition <Col N="2658" /> crisis; £61 million worth of goods were purchased for which there were no exports in exchange.  The truth was that we borrowed £40 million from the American Government and used it for inflationary purposes, the expenditure of which was boasted of by the Coalition. Deputy Dillon boasts that he spent £1 million on one day of these monies.  That was spent on consumer goods.  People were not saving sufficiently in 1951; they were importing too much and the Coalition apparently had not discovered the elementary truth, again subscribed to by Mr. Gaitskell and Mr. Macmillan, that when you suddenly start to throw money into circulation, when wages increase and chase prices every time you spend £1 you import 10/- worth of it and unless you have massive exports you are bound to run into serious difficulties. That is universally accepted doctrine.</P>
    <P>In spite of the temporary prosperity attending the post-war boom, total employment was diminishing and the problems that we always had persisted even in the middle of this boom. When we had artificial aids and advantages total employment was diminishing, showing how sadly the Coalition failed to deal with the problems.</P>
    <P>The first Coalition crisis came in 1951.  By that time the Government, if it was responsible, should have been warning the people that the post-war boom was going to end and that there would be tremendous competition affecting our exports, that the whole of our costing and productivity would have to be overhauled and that it was quite impossible for any real economic revival, any real establishment of a modern economic State to have been completed in the period between 1932 and 1938, that it would take a long time to modernise a nation's economy, that absolutely no time should be lost in taking measures to provide more productive expenditure by the State and having a complete change of outlook by the people themselves as regards facing realities involving modernisation and growth of industry, the use of science in agriculture, better marketing and more productivity.  In other words, there should have been <Col N="2659" /> some ambitious revitalising of the economy on a fundamental basis.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil took over in 1951 and we administered what, looking back, was a very moderate dose of disinflation. Then we had the prolonged propaganda about the hair-shirt policy of Fianna Fáil.  I remind the House of the frequent use of that term.  We should recall what happened in 1956, as a result of having deceived the people into believing that the disinflation movement carried out by Fianna Fáil in 1952 was something tragic, serious and appalling and affecting the lives of all the people in a fundamental way.  In 1952 there was a mild recession as a result of disinflation but in 1953 there was progress on a sound basis and for the first time the nation began to go forward again on a basis of genuine increases in production and earnings and a growth in our industrial production that had nothing to do with the post-war boom as by that time the world was becoming normal.</P>
    <P>We had the next election in 1954. Once again the people's minds were completely turned away from realities by the Coalition.  When I say &ldquo;the people's minds&rdquo;, I mean a certain section of the people because a great many of them continued to support us and believed in the fundamentally sound policy of Fianna Fáil.  We had the election in 1954, some seven years after the war ended, and it was fought in a totally unreal atmosphere in which nothing seemed to count for the Coalition except the prices of certain commodities and the increases in taxation that had taken place.  Once again the Coalition dared to tell the people, when the post-war boom was over and when they had taken absolutely no steps in the way of an economic programme to revitalise the nation, that a good time was coming, and that if people voted for the Coalition, many high prices would come down with a bang.</P>
    <P>One can imagine a country that had hundreds of years of oppression, had been bashed in the teeth, denigrated, divided and despoiled, trying to pull itself up by its own boot straps at the end of a long period of oppression, being told seven years after the war <Col N="2660" /> ended, that a good time was coming if they voted for the Coalition Parties. Whereas the challenge should have been issued calling for a very great change in our whole economic life, to provide the people with incentives to live here, to bring about a great change in the national attitude to production, there was nothing of that kind in 1954. I think that election was fought on the lowest plane of politics by the Coalition since the foundation of the State. In the much more grim election during the economic war period, or during the period when we had unfortunate and tragic disunity on fundamental constitutional policies, there was something much cleaner about the fight, than when we had those millions of leaflets offered as a kind of pap to the people to induce them to vote for the Coalition.</P>
    <P>Thus the second Coalition Government were elected, again by the transfer of some tens of thousands of people.  I should like to recall to the House that during that election Deputy Costello, then Taoiseach, on at least two occasions said that they must go on repatriating foreign assets.  When they took office they should have watched for the possibilities of trade difficulties.  Unfortunately, having blown £61 million in 1951 and having got the country into an atmosphere of spending foreign assets by the purchase of as many consumer goods as they wished, there were not enough readily available external assets left to tide the second Coalition Government over the comparatively minor trade crisis which affected no other country in northern Europe.  One of the fraudulent propaganda statements made by the Coalition Government was that the crisis had something to do with the Suez crisis which took place in November, 1956, when, in fact, the balance of payments difficulties occurred in 1955 and, for a country which ended the war with an increase of £250 million in its net savings, the amount of imbalance, £55 million, was negligible. If only during those six years of Coalition Government they had not been waving this green flag around them and repatriating foreign assets to try to give the people the impression, <Col N="2661" /> as I said, that it was rather like bringing gold in bags from Euston to Holyhead, there would have been no crisis.  So, we had a totally unnecessary crisis in the balance of payment, and the terms of trade turned against us.</P>
    <P>Other small countries affected in one way or another by the war dealt with their inflations steadily as the post-war period proceeded.  I remember being laughed at in this House when I recited on two or three occasions the mild actions taken by the Dutch Government, the Danish Government and the Swedish Government to prevent themselves from getting into the type of jam the Coalition Government got into in 1956.</P>
    <P>The end to it all was that we had the then Taoiseach, Deputy J.A. Costello, wearily repeating around the country statements about the effects that had been made on inflation by the present Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, when he was Minister for Finance as far back as 1951.  It was a very melancholy consolation to us who had to inherit the wreckage of the Coalition in 1956 to hear these statements made far too late, when the damage had been done, by the then Taoiseach, Deputy J.A. Costello.</P>
    <P>I remember his recital in 1956 to the Cork Chamber of Commerce in which he wearily announced that if wages went up by £10 million in one year then, of that, £5 million represented an inevitable increase in imports and that unfortunately the exports were not there to pay for them.  He pointed out that this was a disastrous thing, that it could not go on and that they had somehow to put a curb on spending.  It was nice talk to hear but unfortunately it was much too late.  Perhaps the Coalition Parties will no longer use with such ease the term &ldquo;hair-shirt policy&rdquo; because, by heavens, we had the hair-shirt policy in 1956 with a vengeance.</P>
    <P>I wanted to go through that history and record it again in the annals of this House, now that the present Government are about to seek a dissolution. I want to admit absolutely frankly that neither I nor my colleagues believed it would take two years to get <Col N="2662" /> over the effects of the Coalition Government policy.  We believed there would be a rebound at an earlier date. If that was an error then we accept the criticism.  We believed we would get results a little bit earlier than 1959. Nevertheless, the results did finally come.</P>
    <P>As a result of our being able to get targets for achievement, of being able to provide a firm policy for five years, of indicating the vital importance of expanding our productivity and our exports, we were able to achieve the good results that have already been fully described in this House by the Minister for Finance and by the Taoiseach.  There is no need for me to go into them in detail except to point out that there is absolutely no index of production or employment or any other economic factor that does not show massive progress in 1960.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said yesterday, we are only at the beginning of the road. We have virtually wasted ten years since the war in taking the modern attitude towards the expansion of our economic life.  There was very little Fianna Fáil could do but correct the position in the three years of uneasy office from 1951 to 1954 when Deputies in this House were yelling most of the time about the price of cigarettes and the price of the pint.  During the whole of that period, the Coalition Government constantly failed to cite to the public the increase in the earnings of the public compared with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>So far as the increase in the cost of living that has taken place during the last period is concerned, there has been a far greater increase in earnings and wages to meet it.  That is a very satisfactory position.  All we want to ensure is that whatever improvements take place in the position of workers in the community will be related to productivity, to an expansion of our export effort and to the opportunities for increased employment which come therefrom.</P>
    <P>It is a very agreeable thing that in 1960 for the first time for a very long period we did manage to employ as many people in industries and non-agricultural occupations as had left the <Col N="2663" /> land in that year.  It showed we were beginning to get the measure of finding some solution to the difficulties that had been experienced in checking emigration.  We have a very long way to go.  All we can say is that we are quite certain that emigration has been less in the past 3 years than it was in the 3 years of Coalition Government. We can point at least hopefully to signs of decreased emigration in so far as they can be gathered in the figures of population movement in the first four months of this year.</P>
    <P>We now reach the point where we enter possibly into the new world of the Rome Treaty.  If ever we need a Government that can make up their mind about things and follow a clear economic policy, a Government that can take decisions some of which are likely to be unpopular, a Government that can take courage in such action, a Government of which we can be quite sure of the path along which they will travel, it is now.  I have no doubt that when the time comes the people will ask the Taoiseach, with his splendid record of having initiated a really dynamic drive in agriculture and industry, particularly in the past few years, to discharge once again those responsibilities with his colleagues and those elected by the people in this new page in our history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened last night to the Taoiseach when he gave what I can only describe as an election address for the Fianna Fáil Party.  He covered all aspects of policy that are known to have been key planks in the Fianna Fáil platform for the past 35 to 40 years, with one notable exception, the Irish language.  The Taoiseach referred in detail to Partition as one of the planks of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He dealt again with the hopes his Party seem to have of a solution for Partition which has been found by them.  Significantly, he left out the question of the Irish language on this occasion.  I have no comment to make on that except to say that it would appear that he is prepared at long last to throw overboard his former leader in so far as that aspect of Fianna Fáil policy is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2664" /> In his introductory remarks the Taoiseach said he hoped that the candidates seeking election will set a fine example of democracy in action in this country.  I believe the Taoiseach must have been talking with his tongue in his cheek.  It is evident from his remarks last night and indeed the remarks of the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, today, that Fianna Fáil have no intention of giving the public the facts in connection with the situation which will arise if and when we become members of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Whatever the views of Deputies may be in regard to that issue, at least one thing is certain and that is that the bluff that this House has real control over our political and economic destiny has been called once and for all.  The spectre of the Common Market looming up on the horizon has exposed the pitiful condition of this country and our abject dependence upon Britain.  It has shown us to be more dependent on Britain than countries which are actually members of the British Commonwealth.  It shows that as a result of the policy pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party in particular, and indeed followed up by other groups which have had the responsibility of Government, we have become closer to Britain's economy and more dependent on her than ever before.</P>
    <P>If the Fianna Fáil Party had been honest over the years they would have admitted that this was the situation. It was only when the Common Market became an issue that the truth came out.  As the Taoiseach put it very bluntly: what Britain does we must do; if Britain joins the Common Market we must join the Common Market; if Britain stays out of the Common Market we must stay out of the Common Market.  In other words, whatever decision is taken in the British House of Commons is really the decision that will bind the people of this country for their future economic and political alliance.  That situation is one that has come about as a direct result of the policies pursued over the years by various Governments.</P>
    <P>In order to focus the attention of <Col N="2665" /> this House, and of people outside, on the importance of our position in regard to the Common Market, Deputy Dr. Browne and myself tabled a motion some time ago in the hope that the Government would allow time for it to be discussed.  It was a motion, which in my opinion, if it had been discussed on its merits would have brought to light the lack of policy over the years by the Government in making arrangements, through a wider international multilateral pattern of trade, to develop alternative markets.  The motion would have exposed the failure of the Government to base our industrial development primarily on the agricultural arm.  It is beyond all doubt, and beyond all contradiction, that the Governments of this country over the years have failed completely to develop an industrial arm based on the raw materials of agriculture and fishing.</P>
    <P>Our main agricultural product over the years, as the Minister for Transport and Power has admitted, has been cattle.  That, according to the Minister, was the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, as he described them, in 1932, and the Fianna Fáil Party came in in 1932 to change all that and diversify agricultural production.  Instead, in 1961, it is still cattle as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, so that they failed the same as other Governments to change the pattern of agricultural production. They failed to induce or educate the small farmer to abandon the nonsensical pattern of agriculture that has been in operation over the years, namely where the 15 acre and 40 acre farmer engages in the same type of agricultural production as the farmer with 100 to 500 acres.  It is primarily the failure of our Governments to alter that pattern in agriculture so that the maximum production would be obtained from the small holding that we have the situation today, that we have no cards to play in any bargaining with Britain or Europe, and no power of bargaining when it comes to looking for the best possible terms if and when we join the Common Market.</P>
    <P>From listening to the Minister for <Col N="2666" /> Transport and Power it is quite clear that the issues in the coming election will not be the future of this country as far as the Common Market is concerned, but who is the most capable man of leading Ireland into the Common Market.  Of course the same propaganda will be trotted out as we had pre-war and indeed after the war. At that time a certain gentleman was the only one who was able to lead Ireland safely, to keep her free from foreign entanglements and, as far as Fianna Fáil was concerned, every campaign was based on the slogan to trust the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party:&mdash;&ldquo;Trust Dev; he will see you safely through.&rdquo; The slogan is changed now to: &ldquo;Trust the Taoiseach; he is a wonderful leader and he will see you safely through the negotiations which will have to take place between now and our joining the European Community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think the public are going to accept that type of nonsense much longer.  They are beginning to see at last that there is no use suggesting that the Taoiseach or the Leader of the Opposition will have the final say with regard to what is going to happen in this country as far as the Common Market is concerned.  When it is admitted that we must depend on what Britain is going to do, it makes little difference to the public who is going to be in charge when negotiations get under way as far as our admission is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement that we must do as Britain does should give food for thought to many people, particularly the supporters of the two major Parties.  It may be yet that Britain will withdraw from the European Community because she may not be able to accept the conditions laid down by the other members.  I do not say she will, but it is possible.  If she does and if, as Mr. Macmillan hinted, she is forced to reconsider her expenditure in regard to N.A.T.O. and other defence pacts, where does this country stand then?  It is quite possible that, if Britain is not in a position to accept the terms laid down by the other members of the European Community, she will enter into a trade agreement with Russia.  What do we do then? <Col N="2667" /> According to the Taoiseach, we do what Britain does.  Do we make a trade agreement with Russia?</P>
    <P>This statement that we are completely dependent on Britain will come as a great shock to the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party.  For the last 40 years they have been told that this country is a republic and that we could treat Britain with contempt if necessary.  Various prominent members of the Party in power spent their time running down the British market and sounding off in regard to our independence. Now, having misled the public on that for so many years, they have had to swallow their words.</P>
    <P>I said that the bluff has been called so far as the independence of this country is concerned.  We are, in fact, dependent on Britain.  We had the spectacle of the Taoiseach in London recently wrapping himself up tightly in a Union Jack and telling us we are completely dependent on Britain for our economic security and well-being. The Taoiseach is leading his Party close to Mr. Macmillan.  We have the major Opposition Party trying to tear that Union Jack off the Taoiseach and suggesting that he has no right to wear it, that it is they should be empowered to implement the decisions made elsewhere on behalf of this country.</P>
    <P>The play acting between the two major Parties on the question of the Civil War and the Republic has to cease.  It is quite clear now there is no fundamental difference whatever between them.  There is no major issue whatever upon which they can divide and seek the support of the public to make either of them a Government. Both are right-wing Parties.  If the Common Market issue never did anything else, it has done something very good in so far as it has brought an air of reality into Irish politics.  In the course of this morning's debate, we had the Minister for Transport and Power stating quite clearly that the Fine Gael Party had robbed Fianna Fáil of their policy on agriculture&mdash;in other words, that the policy pursued by both Parties was identical.</P>
    <P>The policy pursued by both Parties both on agriculture and industry has been identical.  Their efforts to solve <Col N="2668" /> the problems of emigration and unemployment have met with the same success or lack of it.  Yet, it is suggested that the country should continue to put in as a Government Tweedledum and put out Tweedledee.  The Common Market has brought nearer the day when these two major Parties will have to reconcile themselves to the fact that there is room only for one and that in all decency at this stage the Civil War should be buried by a merging of these two Parties so that the people may have clarified the real issues at stake.</P>
    <P>If an attempt is made at this election to pretend there is a real difference between the two major Parties, I believe we will have a stalemate.  As a result of that, it may be necessary to have a series of elections over the next five to seven years.  It would be a more honest approach for the major Parties to realise it would be in the interest of the country at this stage to sacrifice personal ambition rather than have the country bewildered over the next few years and the people in the long run having to bring about this merger themselves.  I have spoken on these lines for some years past in this House. I know public opinion has not been fully prepared for the suggestion I have made, simply because sufficient people in Ireland did not realise the precarious situation in which the country had been placed over the years, a situation that has been fully disclosed now as a result of the statements made by the leaders of other countries, of the countries that control the situation, as a result of statements made by the Taoiseach in this House and, indeed, by other leading speakers.  It is clear now that we are not the proud and independent nation it was suggested over the years we would be.  Instead of that, we are a very minor figure in the eyes of most countries.</P>
    <P>In the discussions that have taken place in this House, and in discussions outside it, on the Common Market the political implications of our joining have not so far been really stressed.  It is only fair that the public should be given the true facts and made fully aware of the implications in certain articles of the Rome Treaty and what <Col N="2669" /> those articles will really mean where we are concerned if they are put into operation.  I do not see much point in these articles in the Treaty unless it is the intention of the countries which constitute the Community to put them into effect.</P>
    <P>Recently the architect-in-chief of the European Economic Community, Professor Halstein, said: &ldquo;We are not in business.  We are in politics.&rdquo; That is a most significant statement from the leading figure&mdash;a German incidentally &mdash;who occupies a very responsible position in relation to the machinery which controls the Common Market at the moment.  Fundamentally the Common Market is intended to be a political organisation and the method used to create political union is the economic weapon of bringing the countries closer together on economic issues and making them more dependent upon each other in order ultimately to create a third force, politically controlled by those countries which at the moment dominate the European Economic Community.  I refer in particular to Germany and France.</P>
    <P>If the full implications of the Common Market are to be accepted, we must bow to the wishes of people like Mr. Adenaeur and General de Gaulle. I have no doubt whatever that, when it comes down to brass tacks, as far as our influence is concerned in the councils it could easily be nil; and these are the councils which will decide policy and so forth in the Common Market group.  I understand that the present voting strength is very much in favour of the three major participants &mdash;Italy, France and Germany.  Between them, they have 12 votes out of 17 on the Council of Ministers.  It would appear that Ireland's voice will be anything but an influential one.  It is admitted that we will have a say in policy: we will be allowed to talk.  So far as our influence is concerned it will, in my opinion, be nil because, unless what we want is something that suits the other participants, we will have no hope of making our influence felt.  If we want to develop some particular line in agricultural produce or promote a market for it, if that policy impinges on another country, we have not a hope of getting our proposals <Col N="2670" /> through.  We have nothing to offer in the line of bargaining power.  We have no alternative to offer.</P>

I hope that the Taoiseach and the other members of the Government will enlighten Deputy Cunningham, and the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party, on a matter of such major importance as this happens to be.</P>

      <P>The question of the future of agriculture in Ireland has been discussed in relation to our joining the Common Market, if and when we join.  Here, again, the Taoiseach has failed to give a frank account to the people of what we will be led into as far as agriculture is concerned. There is not the slightest doubt that, if the Rome Treaty is implemented in so far as agriculture is concerned, the small farmer in this country will go to the wall.  It is admitted that it is essential to prepare a scheme of compensation for the owners of what are described as marginal farms in the committed European countries.  If it is believed in France and Germany and the Benelux countries that marginal farms will go, is it not a fact that the majority of the small holdings in this country are even lower in the agriculture scale than the marginal farms in Europe?  It should be borne in mind that 75 per cent. of the holdings here are under £20 valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that in Britain the National Farmers' Union are bringing strong pressure to bear on the British Government to buy out and compensate what they describe as the small farmers in Britain who are likely to be affected if Britain joins <Col N="2671" /> the Common Market.  The small farms that the N.F.U. have in mind are those ranging from 100 to 200 acres.  If they will suffer as a result of the agricultural terms of the Common Market arrangements, what will be the position in Ireland where the majority of holdings are under 40 acres?</P>
    <P>No attempt has been made to explain this to the small farmers but I do read occasionally where so-called experts, both in the agricultural and in the industrial field, are welcoming the admission of Ireland on the basis that our farmers will reap a benefit as a result of a wider area being available for their produce.  The people who make statements like that are either deliberately trying to mislead the farming community or they do not know what they are talking about.  It may be that the very large farms can survive the blast of competition but our Constitution states that it is the duty of the State to set up a maximum number of families on the land of Ireland in reasonable comfort.  That means the creation of a maximum number of economic holdings.  It would appear now that the population which is fast leaving the rural areas will go at a much faster rate if and when we join the Common Market.</P>
    <P>It is beyond dispute that, particularly in the West of Ireland, over the years the small farmer was not making a living from the land alone.  It is a well-known fact that in parts of the West the Government itself looked upon this question of the small farmer as a problem which should be dealt with by State measures.  The trouble was that the measures taken by the Government were the ones least calculated to improve conditions on the small holdings. Instead of concentrating on improving the small holdings by changing the pattern of agriculture, the Government set up the Special Employment Schemes Office and spent money on providing employment on winter relief schemes for small farmers. If employment was not given on winter relief schemes it was given by the county council on the making of roads and by-roads and on the cleaning of drains under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2672" /> I want to emphasise that no attempt was made to change the pattern of agriculture.  The man who got three weeks' work in November, a fortnight in December and maybe a month between January and February working on a special employment scheme, a bog development scheme or a county council scheme did not do anything to his holding except perhaps put another bullock or some other beast on it.  While the cattle population increased somewhat over the years&mdash;that was the only land production that was available to the small farmer in the west&mdash;the human population has gone down, because cattle production was the wrong type of production for the small holder.  The tragedy of it is that if we become members of the Common Market we shall not be able to alter the pattern of agriculture which has dominated this country for so long.  No provision is made for a country like this to switch over to intensive cultivation, of, say, fruit and vegetables, still greater processing of our other products. Because we have not been doing this all along, we will not be allowed to do it as members of the Common Market.  It is my view we shall be confined to our traditional lines of agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the Common Market, I blame the Government over the years for their failure to keep the population on the land by diversification of agricultural production.  Their lack of policy in that respect is becoming more apparent as a result of the difficulties which now loom ahead of us.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made by Deputies on both sides of the House, and by people outside, that we shall be able to export agricultural produce to Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg.  Could anyone name for me what items in agriculture we shall be able to export to these countries?  The Taoiseach had a joke at my expense some weeks ago on the question of the impact on France and on the French farmers of the Common Market arrangements in regard to agriculture.  The Taoiseach pointed out that the terms of the <Col N="2673" /> Treaty of Rome in relation to agriculture would not be in effect for the next five years and consequently that I was talking through my hat.  It was all right for the Taoiseach to make that smart reply but the facts are otherwise.</P>
    <P>Before the French Government signed the Treaty of Rome they had to persuade the French farmers, as this Government will try to persuade the Irish farmers, that the Common Market would be of tremendous advantage in regard to agricultural production, that Germany and other countries would be great export outlets for them.  As a result the French small farmers over the past two years increased their production of wheat, dairy produce and meat&mdash;those were the three items whose output they were persuaded to increase&mdash;by about 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>What is the result of that?  All over France the French farmers rioted, put up road blocks in all the localities leading into towns and generally made their presence felt in no uncertain terms.  They had an export surplus of what we are producing here and they could not dispose of it to the members of the Common Market.  Where do we stand in a matter of this nature in regard to our exports?  That is only part of it.  In spite of what the Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee and others used to say: &ldquo;Thanks be to God the British Market is gone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not intend in making that remark to generate any heat.  I want to bring home to the House that the British market has been available to us over the years and that we enjoy certain preferences which are not at present available to members of the European Economic Community.  If Britain joins the Common Market Group she will have to throw open her ports to member countries and lower her barriers to the importation of many of the products which we are selling to Britain under preferential treatment.  It is not a question of 12 years' time.  We enjoy the preferential treatment at the moment and that treatment can go within the next two to five years, so that not alone will we be kept out of the European markets through inefficiency and incompetent production methods but we will be squeezed out of the British market by those European countries moving in.  Where is the alleged advantage that the Common Market arrangements have for Ireland?  I cannot understand why any Deputy should suggest that the Common Market arrangements present an attractive proposition to the Irish farmer.</P>
      <P>If tomorrow we had the agricultural produce to sell, if we wanted to send a shipload to Italy, France or any other country we have not got the transport facilities.  Not long ago I got a letter from a friend of mine in Ghana about the condition in which Irish eggs arrive there.  I discovered that Irish eggs exported to Ghana have to be transhipped at Liverpool.  This is after 40 years of Fianna Fáil Government.  The eggs smell like the Fianna Fáil Party after their trip.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a lot of talk about our independence over the years.  When we have not the boats to carry our produce it is time the public woke up to the fact that the Government have been bluffing them all along the line.  I listened to the Minister for Transport and Power <Col N="2675" /> telling us today that buyers were coming over here from Britain to buy our attested cattle and how glad they were that the cattle were in such good shape as a result of the money spent by Fianna Fáil on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Is it not a fact that we have no export arrangements whatever for our cattle, that were it not for the fact that British buyers come here to buy cattle and use British boats to transport them we would not be able to get rid of the cattle?  We have no port control, no boats.  We depend completely on British companies for a means of export. This is a result of the inactivity of Governments over the years, of their play-acting in this House with Party politics.  It is coming home to us now.</P>
      <P>The test of any Government is what steps they were prepared to take in developing the major aspects of agriculture. We have had the Minister for Transport and Power telling us here today that Fianna Fáil were firm believers in the cattle trade, that they were as anxious as the Opposition to ensure that the best prices possible would be paid for our cattle.  Nobody disputes that.  The Minister went on to say that if the price of cattle fluctuates and drops drastically the farmer cannot blame the Government for that, that that is what a free market means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we join the European Community, order and organisation must be brought into marketing arrangements and some system will have to be introduced into the chaotic position that has obtained here over the years. There is no sign yet from the Government that they are prepared to set up proper marketing arrangements so that the farmer would not be at the mercy of private enterprise for a market for his produce.  No protected industrialist in this country is in the position that he will get 10/6d. one day and 5/- the next day for his product. He knows what he will get all the year round and for many years and he is protected.  The real producer, the farmer, does not know from day to day the price he will get.  The result has been that in many aspects of agriculture the farmer went out of production <Col N="2676" /> or reduced production.  The cycle starts over again when scarcity is created.  They all get back into production again and make a mess of it. There is no proper planning for production, no proper planning with regard to marketing and no stability in price.</P>
    <P>All these faults have existed over the years and no Government took the necessary action.  Action would have to be taken by the State.  Then there is the clash of opinion as to whether it is right for the State to move into a sphere where private enterprise has complete control.  On that issue there was agreement between the two major Parties down along the line that private enterprise was a sacred cow, that it would be wrong for the State to move in, wrong for the State to acquire rights where private individuals had control for many years.  In the new Papal Encyclical the Pope has given his blessing to a move on the part of the State into fields where private enterprise has reigned supreme.  At least, the old criticism that was levied at people who suggested that the State had a right to move in goes by the board.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I should like briefly to give a few examples of how the Government over the years have failed to secure the necessary expansion.  The distilling industry has been for the last 40 years in the hands of private enterprise. I am sick saying that that industry could be one of the biggest in the country if it were taken over and run by a board like the Sugar Company and if a proper type of spirit were marketed.  Both major Parties have deplored the suggestion that the State had any right to interfere with the distilling industry, on the ground that it was run by private firms and that they had rights.  The community would benefit to a tremendous degree if this industry were run on proper lines.  There is no case whatever for leaving it in the hands of the group that have failed to expand and to produce the proper type of whiskey and to get the markets.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the pig and bacon industry.  Here again you had lack of stability, lack of uniformity of <Col N="2677" /> supply, lack of confidence by the farmers. The man who acted as the processor was always safe&mdash;I refer to the bacon curer.  What action did the Government take over the years? Nothing, except to deplore the fact that we had not got more exports of bacon.  As a result, a board was set up, controlled by the very people who had been holding the farmers up to ransom.</P>
    <P>The farming community have been exploited during the years and there is now only one possible way to hold the people in rural Ireland and ensure that security will be given to them. That is through the creation of State and semi-State boards on the same lines as the Sugar Company, to develop the various aspects of agricultural production.  Apart altogether from the Common Market, there is a great possibility of markets for us further afield.  There is great goodwill in the newly freed African States, in the Middle East and elsewhere; there is great regard for this country and there is scope for us for the export of agricultural produce to those countries.</P>
    <P>There is no need for us to lose hope if we have a proper Government which is not afraid to face issues and stamp on vested interest.  We must move with the times.  I do not think that we have a lot of time left in which to reassess the position but I do feel the public should be told at this stage of the full implication of the situation that faces this country if, and when, Britain joins the Common Market. Our people should be told also that Fianna Fáil are the Party who say they believe in independence at a time when we know we are closer to and more dependent on Britain than even members of the British Common-wealth.</P>
    <P>We realise fully that were Britain not beside us we would have no place to send our boys and girls.  We also know now that it was money sent back by these boys and girls in the form of emigrants' remittances which helped over the years to keep the wolf from the doors of their fathers and mothers in the small holdings throughout the country.  All these facts will be brought home, perhaps not in the next <Col N="2678" /> few months but in the next few years, and they will impress on the two national Parties of this country the necessity to get together and stop play-acting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In this debate, which takes place to mark the end of the present Dáil, I think it is realised that we are discussing not merely the end of the present Dáil but I believe also the end of a political era in this country.  It is significant that the present Government, the Fianna Party, have been in office more or less for the best part of thirty years and it is proper that regard should be had to the present condition of the country in order to see what, if any, progress has been made in that period.</P>
      <P>I do not think anyone interested in the affairs of this country could regard Ireland's present position with any degree of satisfaction.  To-day this country has a population of 500,000 fewer than it had thirty years ago.  Today this country is being bled of the more ambitious and vigorous of its young people in endemic emigration.  Thirty years ago emigration had ceased and we therefore must regard the country to-day as being in a very depressed condition. Why is that?  I think it is true to say that the reason lies largely in the fact that over the last thirty years, with Fianna Fáil generally in office, that Party was concerned to play politics and to pursue will o' the wisp ideas.</P>
      <P>Over the last thirty years, instead of concentrating on an intelligent plan for the building up of this country, we had a concentration on polemics, on the effort of cute politicians to create carrots for the electorate.  We had the Fianna Fáil Party coming into office contriving to bring about, for electoral political purposes, an economic war with Britain and I want to refer to that in some detail because I had the experience here this morning, for the best part of two hours, of listening to the unctuous remarks of the Minister for Transport and Power in which he asked us in this House to forget entirely the misdeeds of the Fianna Fáil Party and to imagine that they never took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and <Col N="2679" /> Power had the audacity to doubt whether any member of the Fianna Fáil Party had ever thanked God that the British market was gone and he went on to say: &ldquo;Well if some Deputy did make a remark of that kind we all make indiscretions and it would be quite wrong to think the Fianna Fáil Party should be branded with ever holding these ideas&rdquo;&mdash;the suggestion being, of course, that this person was some insignificant back bencher.  Now that little dog just will not run and that kind of story just cannot be told in the coming election because that speech, in which a member of the Fianna Fáil Party thanked God the British market was gone forever, was not made by an insignificant back bencher of the Party.  It was not made by Deputy Corry or any other back bencher of Fianna Fáil but by a member of the Fianna Fáil Government, the former Minister for Lands.  He expressed the view of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1933 and, of course, the speech that he then made was not an individual effort as the Minister for Transport and Power would have us believe but it was repeated by the Leader of Fianna Fáil.  On the 9th August, 1933&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to a speech made for two hours by the Minister for Transport and Power and I intend to reply to it fully.  On 9th August, 1933, the then Leader of Fianna Fáil used these words: &ldquo;So far as I can see, the British market has gone forever.&rdquo; The Minister for Transport and Power would ask us to forget that, to tut-tut, to say: &ldquo;Well, if anyone ever said a thing like that, it was a person that did not count.&rdquo; It was said by the Leader of Fianna Fáil.  On another occasion the same person said: &ldquo;The British Market would never be the same as it was in the past.  To restore that market was just, as a child might say, give me the moon.&rdquo;  That represents, not a passing indiscretion, but the belief of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;and now the cost must be paid&mdash;that they could indulge, for political purposes, in an <Col N="2680" /> economic war with Britain: that they could dispense with the British market and provide alternative markets, a phrase so frequently used by the present Taoiseach and other members of that Party at that time.</P>
      <P>While they were making these speeches another eminent member of Fianna Fáil produced a very menacing whip somewhere near the Five Lamps outside this city and, puffed up with his own importance and with all the Fianna Fáil propaganda of that time, he proudly declared to a startled audience that Fianna Fáil had whipped John Bull.  There is the background of the difficulties that this country may now have to face.  In the 30 years that the Minister for Transport and Power dealt with this morning we had this Party starting off in office by attempting to tear down the market which they now say we must follow no matter where it goes.  Coincidental with that aim there was the effort made to start in this country, irrespective of the background, the reason, the quality of standard, a whole series of small industries and the indiscriminate tariff policy was launched.</P>
      <P>If anyone had an idea, all he had to do was to ask for a tariff.  There was no necessity to have the raw materials here, no regard to the consequential effect on the rest of the country.  If you had an idea you got a tariff and you were to start your industry.  People were encouraged to invest their capital and their livelihood, everything they could reach on to build up industries here indiscriminately. It did not matter about anything else; if you wanted to start an industry you were told: &ldquo;There is a tariff; put your money into this and we will protect you.&rdquo; That was not a temporary move.  No warning was given that at some stage these industrialists would be let down with a bang.  They were told: &ldquo;If you support us, the Fianna Fáil Party, and plough your money into industry, we shall protect you and we are going to maintain these tariffs to ensure that you will get a return for your money.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I shall deal with Deputy O'Malley if he continues to interrupt.  I want to put this in perspective because those 30 years have been costly years.  I began by saying we had come to the end of an era and we have.  As a result of the decision which the Government have been obliged to make we are now applying for membership of the Common Market and it is true to say that we do not know what is in store for us but we are going into that market whistling to keep up our courage, to allay the fears, the gnawing gripe and anxiety that must exist in many persons' breasts at the moment, people who believed in the industrial drive of Fianna Fáil in the last 30 years.</P>
      <P>Apparently, those people will be thrown to the winds; it does not matter that they believed in Fianna Fáil's industrial policy since 1932. What does it matter?  The sun has gone in now, the dark clouds are there and the industrialists have to put up with it.  So be it, but the country must continue and we must have regard to the fact that, due to the stupid, ill-conceived policy of the Fianna Fáil Party for the past 30 years, due to the fact that they produced this will-o'-the-wisp idea that we could establish here an industrial paradise, because they were concerned with doing that, they did not look at the ground on which they were standing.  Faraway hills are green and that is what they were thinking about.  They allowed the agricultural industry, the primary industry, to decline, to suffer, to wilt and to fade and today, on the threshold of the Common Market, the one asset that could have been valuable to us is far less of an asset than it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the cost that this country has to pay.  We may have to pay very dearly for the fact that a Fianna Fáil Government has been in office for most of these 30 years.  If the wise industrial policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government had been continued, if we had built up in a discriminate way our industries, built up industries that had available here native raw materials, built up industries that had a tradition and knowledge behind them&mdash;if we had done that, and concentrated on doing it and <Col N="2682" /> if, at the same time, we had pursued the policy of the late Paddy Hogan as Minister for Agriculture, concentrating on building up our agricultural industry, we could have looked at this Common Market with equanimity and we could have snapped our fingers at any competitors we might have to meet.</P>
    <P>Of course, we did not do it.  Paddy Hogan was sneered at as the &ldquo;Minister for Grass&rdquo;.  The idea of the industrial policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was just scoffed at&mdash;it did not matter.  These astute politicians just went along with their game to cod the people, hoping that the day would never come when they would be found out.  They are found out now.  This challenge the Taoiseach talked about last night&mdash;let us agree it is a challenge and let us face it as a challenge&mdash;is also the call out bid as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned. Their bluff has been called and they are not in a position to meet the future.</P>
    <P>Now and in the immediate future we have got to develop, as a matter of urgency, a dynamic policy for agriculture. If we do not do that&mdash;and there is no doubt about this&mdash;this country will be completely depopulated.  Our small family farms will disappear and we will become a ranch ground for a few individuals raising cattle for continental purposes.  We have to meet that challenge as a matter of urgency. The Fianna Fáil Party do not know how to do it because they never have believed in agriculture and never have had an agricultural policy.  The Taoiseach and the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party will find very quickly in the coming weeks and months that the good sense of the people will lead to a decision that will mean that in this matter of the Common Market and of the sale of our agricultural exports, the person who should lead the Government is the person whose name means so much to the Irish farmer, and that is Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned these matters because we had this unctuous speech from the Minister for Transport and Power this morning, in which he proceeded to disregard all the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2683" /> mistakes of the past.  He proceeded to suggest that the Fianna Fáil emphasis always has been on building up the agricultural industry, According to him, the slaughter of calves never happened. According to him, the Economic War was just a nightmare &mdash; it really did not occur.  He even suggested in his speech that he, the Minister for Transport and Power, was father of the Land Project.  He said that in 1939 he proposed a motion to that effect at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I never listened to such arrant nonsense. Deputy Childers the father of the Land Project!  If the Fianna Fáil Party propose to play that sort of game in the coming election, they will find they have made a very grave mistake.</P>
    <P>The Land Project, which came after 16 years of neglect of agriculture, was the first concrete step made towards building up a vigorous agricultural industry here.  To-day that Land Project is in cold storage.  A very vital part of it, Section B, has been abandoned&mdash;again symptomatic of the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party are not concerned and never have been concerned for the small farmers of this country. If we are to meet this challenge of the Common Market, the sooner a Government that has an agricultural policy is sent into office, the better for the country.  I believe that that will be done in the coming election.</P>
    <P>I could spend a lot of time in replying to different things the Minister for Transport and Power said in this debate.  I do not propose to do so, but I want to say a few other things.  The Taoiseach gave us an address last night which was carefully prepared and read out by him.  It was full of fine sentiments and grand ideas, but basically implied all through it was: &ldquo;For God's sake, let us forget the past. Let us imagine we are only starting now.&rdquo; He would ask us to play this game according to the rules he has contrived for it, and that a new Ireland is to face the challenge of the Common Market without in any way taking any wisdom from the experiences of the past.  Again, I should like to assure the Taoiseach that that effort will not succeed.  The present Government <Col N="2684" /> came into office four and a half years ago on a specific programme and with a definite policy.</P>

This is a matter which, pursuant to the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, falls to be decided by a Deciding Officer, or, in the event of an appeal, by an Appeals Officer.  Any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of an Appeals Officer as to the rate of contribution payable in respect of a particular employment may appeal therefrom to the High Court on any question of law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery) (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a Press forecast of an increase in the price of imported coal in which reference was made to increases in the price of British coal and of coal imported from other sources and also to increased freight charges and the introduction of a five-day working week.</P>
      <P>As regards British coal, we have been assured by the British authorities that the decision to increase the price of domestic coal to us, which had the effect of bringing it to the level of British home prices, was taken solely on commercial grounds and involved no discrimination against us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2705" /> The import prices are, of course, outside our control.  So far as retail prices in Ireland are concerned, statutory control is not exercised but I have power under the Prices Act, 1958, to fix maximum retail prices following an investigation by the Fair Trade Commission.  I have no reason to believe, however, that any such investigation will be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the reply the Minister has just made that we need not anticipate that coal prices will rise here unless persons desire to continue to buy British coal at the higher British price and that there are alternative sources of supply of coal which can be sold here at prices comparable with the British prices before they were increased?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

There has not been any official announcement by the association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Except in so far as a price increase may be due to increased freightage or increased handling charges here, there is no reason to anticipate an increase in the price of coal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that as well as increased freight charges and handling costs the landed price of coal may be one of the factors which will need to be considered.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that there must be a significant difference between the two prices.  The British price reflects economies of scale.  The Irish price has to cover the cost of freight, insurance and packing on the aggregates, the Customs duty and any extra costs associated with assembly here.  There is competition between the various makes on sale in the market and I am satisfied that this is the best regulator of price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Industry and Commerce agreed about <Col N="2707" /> three weeks ago that there was a difference of about £140 between the prices charged here and in England for the new Ford Consul, would the Minister agree that that would indicate the urgency and immediate importance of having an investigation into the prices of cars generally?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech today the Minister for Transport and Power was pleased to accuse Fine Gael of insincerity.  He is, of course, entitled to express that view and to hold that opinion but I think it calls for some comment that the Minister is a member of a Government and a Party that was elected to office 4½ years ago in 1957 at a time of considerable economic difficulty for the country and because of particular promises and pledges which they made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can all remember that in the last general election we, in Fine Gael, as well as speakers from the Labour Party and others, then asserted that if Fianna Fáil were elected to office they would, without doubt, abolish the then existing food subsidies and that they would, by deliberate action, increase on the poor people the prices of bread, butter and flour.  I made many such speeches as did many of my colleagues in the outgoing Government. <Col N="2720" /> Evidently the speeches we were making began to have an effect and began to worry the people who were conditioned by Fianna Fáil propaganda to blame the inter-Party Governmeit for the economic situation then existing.  These people began to worry whether it would be safe to vote for Fianna Fáil.  When the Minister for Transport and Power comes in here with his particular accent to talk about insincerity does he remember the present Leader of his Party, the Taoiseach, dealing with these speeches which we made just on the eve of the last general election?</P>
    <P>I have here a quotation from a speech made by the Taoiseach at Waterford on 28th February, 1957, delivered by him in his accustomed, emphatic manner.  Here is what he said:</P>
    <P>Some Coalition leaders are threatening the country with all sorts of unpleasant things if Fianna Fáil becomes the Government&mdash; compulsory tillage, wage control, cuts in Civil Service salaries, higher food prices and a lot more besides. A Fianna Fáil Government does not intend to do any of these things because we do not believe in them.</P>
    <P>How definite&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>he asked</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;must we make our denial of these stupid allegations?  They are all falsehoods.</P>
    <P>On the same date the then Leader of Fianna Fáil went to Belmullet and he also dealt with our charge that a Fianna Fáil Government would abolish the subsidies on food and he, in a long rambling speech, referred to the concern of Fianna Fáil for the poor man.  He went on to say that Fianna Fáil recognised how important an article of diet to the poor man bread and butter were.  He gave an assurance in that speech that a Fianna Fáil Government, realising how important these things were to the poor, would certainly ensure they were not increased in price.  You have the Minister for Transport and Power coming in here and talking about sincerity in Irish politics.  How does he and how do his colleagues in the Government <Col N="2721" /> square their consciences, if they have such a commodity, with these kind of speeches made on the eve of the last general election for the purpose of codding people into supporting them, with the action they took some months later when they introduced a Budget here without any apology, and proceeded to abolish, as we said they would, the existing subsidies on food?</P>
    <P>By doing so they increased taxation by £9,000,000 and made the people of this country pay that sum in excess for the price they have to pay for bread and butter which the then Leader of Fianna Fáil described as being so important an article of diet to the poor.  I would imagine, if we are to swop views on sincerity, that any Government that felt itself compelled so to disown its pledges was bound at that time to seek a further mandate from the people.  Of course they did not do that.  They were elected to office and they decided to carry on.</P>
    <P>They also fought the last election on other issues and other grounds. The Taoiseach himself gave birth to a wonderful idea prior to the last election. He opened a vista and a vision for the young men and the young women of Ireland.  There was to be a dramatic new orientation of economic and political thought and we were to have a vision of an Ireland being impelled by a new urge and a new impulse. A calculated plan for investment was to be put into operation and the result of it was to be that we were to reach the stage at the end of five years when one hundred thousand new jobs, at the rate of some thousands each year, were to be available to our people.</P>
    <P>The young men were told and led to believe by the Leader of Fianna Fáil: &ldquo;There is a future for you.&rdquo;  I have no doubt that many a Fianna Fáil speaker, many a candidate at the last general election, not only believed this plan and this policy to have been sincerely conceived&mdash;it probably was&mdash; but also to have been a possible plan to carry out.  Let us imagine many of the speeches in Dublin city and elsewhere, or Deputy Corry down in Cork, speaking to an audience that had a mother or father who was worried <Col N="2722" /> about a son emigrating, or addressing a young man who was despondent about his ability to get a job in his own country.  How many of them felt: &ldquo;Here at last is something we can believe in&rdquo; and they went to vote with the clarion call issuing from a Fianna Fáil poster: &ldquo;Women, put your men back to work.  Vote Fianna Fáil.&rdquo; That was five years ago.  I wonder will Deputy Corry make that speech in Cork this time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we hear now at the end of this period any more references to employment being the acid test of a Government's policy? When the speeches were made there were 750,000 Irish people in insurable employment in this country.  To-day, four and a half years later, there are 50,000 fewer.  Not bad mind you. Fianna Fáil have only reduced employment at the rate of 12,000 a year and of course, in addition, over that period emigration not only has continued but has run in spate and thousands and thousands of our people have left this country for Great Britain and elsewhere. The plan was a spurious election gimmick, or it was ill-conceived, or it was a good plan and the men who sought to put it into operation had not the ability to do it.  Fianna Fáil can select what alibi they like, but the plain fact is that to-day, four and a half years later, fewer of our people are working at home, more of our people have emigrated and, so far as a young man getting a job in Ireland is concerned, he is no nearer to it than he was in 1957.  In fact, he now must have the gravest doubts as to what the future holds in store.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a reference by the Taoiseach last night and again by the Minister for Transport and Power this morning, to social services.  The Minister for Transport and Power referred to Fianna Fáil's concern with building up social services.  He delivered a message which I hope will be conveyed to the widows and old-age pensioners throughout this country, that although he or she may not know it, they are in fact much better off now than they <Col N="2723" /> would have been if a Fianna Fáil Government had not been elected to office.  That I am sure will make the crust of bread a little bit easier to eat although it may be dearer to buy.  We are supposed to believe the Minister for Transport and Power that they have reached a satisfactory level so far as the old age and widow's pensions are concerned and that henceforth the old age and widow's pensioners, whether they recognise it or not, can now end their days in comfortable circumstances.</P>
    <P>I noticed in this unctuous statement from the Minister for Transport and Power that one particular aspect of this State's social activities did not engage his august attention.  There was no reference to the health services.  I am sorry that the Minister for Health is temporarily out of the House.  I should like to inquire what progress report the Minister for Health or the Government can make to the people with regard to health services in the last four and a half years.  Four and a half years ago when the former Government were put out of office Fianna Fáil's Health Act of 1953 was in operation&mdash;not fully, but it was in operation. I never believed in that Act.  I spoke and voted against it.  I thought it was ill-conceived, ill-thought, and ill-planned but nevertheless I recognised, as we all did, that a majority of Deputies had supported it and put it on to the Statute Book.  It became my duty as Minister for Health to try to make that Act work and I think I can claim that, in the period I was there, I did not stint in my endeavours to make out of that Act&mdash;the plan contained in it&mdash;as workable a health service as possible.</P>
    <P>At the same time, when I was Minister, in the days of the former Government steps were taken to condition the country for a more traditional approach to health services.  The idea of health insurance was introduced to the people in a limited way.  Under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1956, the idea of encouraging our people by community effort to provide for themselves was introduced in the <Col N="2724" /> belief that the wisest and soundest way to provide for ill-health is to pay when you are well for the day you are sick.</P>
    <P>We left office with the health services under the Health Act, to the extent they are now in operation, having been in operation for just 12 months or so.  The complaints about the difficulties we had envisaged were beginning to be expressed, and of course they continued since the change of Government four and a half years ago.  I should like to know what case can now be made for the Fianna Fáil Health Act of 1953.  Today&mdash;whether the Government realise it or not it is true&mdash;there is nothing but confusion, frustration, anxiety and worry about medical cards, who is entitled to them, how they get them and what rights are to be conferred.  Under the absurd service we have, when a man who is employed and working&mdash;and, therefore, not entitled to a medical card&mdash; becomes sick and goes into hospital, when he is unable to earn his wage, he is charged a hospital bill at the rate of 10/- a day, he is charged X-ray and specialist fees, and a bill begins to mount up.  Is that a health service that is in any way conditioned to meet the problems, difficulties and necessities of our people?</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Transport and Power comes in here unctuously and hypocritically talking about the progress Fianna Fáil have made in providing social services for our people, I should like him to explain what has been done in relation to health services in the last four and a half years or what is proposed to be done.  The truth is that the Health Act of 1953 was nothing but an election gimmick introduced by Fianna Fáil. This wonderful health scheme they talked about in the general election of 1954, this health scheme that was going to provide wonderful free services for 85 per cent. of the population, this scheme that was announced with posters which said: &ldquo;Should Wealth Buy Health?&rdquo; was contrived and designed as a bribe for the electorate and, in fact, was nothing more than a re-enactment in an Irish Statute of the pauper dispensary service first <Col N="2725" /> introduced into this country under the Medical Charities Act, 1851.</P>
    <P>That is our health service in Ireland to-day, sponsored by the Party over there that prates about their regard for social progress and social reform.  To-day a poor person who is sick or ill, if he is a pauper&mdash;that word is not liked but it should be stated&mdash;and can prove it, if he can wave his rags around the place and show the hole in his clothes, he will get emergency treatment and emergency medical service of just the same quality and standard that 110 years ago a purse-proud British Government thought desirable to prevent Irish people from dying of plague and starvation at the time of the famine.</P>
    <P>As far as we in Fine Gael are concerned, we assert that that kind of attitude to health services just does not measure up to the requirements of this country.  The Holy Father in his recent Encyclical made reference to social reform and social progress in relation to health and other matters. We feel that our programme, policy and outlook on these matters are sound and would merit his praise, admiration and approval if that were necessary.  We intend in the coming election, and when it is over, to reorganise entirely the health services and to provide something worthwhile in place of the present quiltwork scheme.  We intend to provide a proper, workable scheme that will be in accordance with the traditions of our people, based on the principle of insurance and paying due regard to the fact that there are, and always will be unfortunately, a large section of our people who will be unable to make any contribution.  Certainly, we feel that the programme and policy we believe in will be a worthwhile change from the present situation.</P>
    <P>The fact of course is that the Fianna Fáil Health Act of 1953 has been demonstrated to be unworkable.  No progress has been made since 1957 to provide a better scheme.  In fact, many sections of that Act providing for particular treatments for our people&mdash; dental, ophthalmic and so on&mdash;have not yet been brought into operation.  So it was nothing but a political election <Col N="2726" /> plan from beginning to end.</P>
    <P>We also had a reference from the Taoiseach and from the Minister for Transport and Power to the general conditions in the country.  We heard from the Minister for Transport and Power this morning, in his bland, self-complacent fashion: &ldquo;Really, you know, things are going well in the country.&rdquo;  We are led to believe that there is prosperity in the country: &ldquo;Well, if it is not apparent, it is really there, you know.  There are good times; we may not recognise them but if you turn the corner, you will see them.&rdquo;  That sort of &ldquo;All-right-Jackery&rdquo; is apparently going to take the place of a policy for Fianna Fáil in the coming election.</P>
    <P>Do Fianna Fáil really believe all that cant?  Do they seriously think they can cod the people with that kind of twaddle and nonsense?  Talk about booms and prosperity!  Where are they?  Who is enjoying prosperity? Is it the farmer, the poor hardworking farmer that Deputy Corry claims to represent in Dáil Eireann?  Is the poor hardworking farmer enjoying&mdash;is he supposed to be enjoying?  &mdash; a measure of prosperity today?  According to the Minister for Transport and Power: &ldquo;Yes, he is.&rdquo;  The Minister for Transport and Power told us to-day that &ldquo;Really, you know, cattle prices are good.&rdquo;&ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than in 1956&rdquo; and he went on to say that, really, he could not understand why the farmers were grousing about their condition.  He said: &ldquo;After all, this country is doing well and the farmers really should not grouse and complain so much.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder will he make that speech in the constituency he is going to fight in the next election.  Whether he will be returned for it, or not, is another question. Will he go down to Monaghan and tell the Monaghan farmers, as he told the House here to-day, that the prices they are getting for their cattle&mdash; he made particular reference to fat cattle&mdash;are adequate, and fair, and proper?  I have here some figures in relation to gross value of agricultural output in the last four years.  I observe that at the start of this Government's activities the figure was £196.6 <Col N="2727" /> millions.  It fell in 1958 to £179.7 millions. It fell in 1959 to £176.5 millions and the last available figure is £191.7 millions.  In the last four years, the farmers, who are supposed to be enjoying the benevolence of the present Government, have suffered a loss in value on their output.</P>
    <P>The figures show that the gross value of agricultural output has dropped, not slightly but significantly and dramatically; and, of course, these figures of gross value merely emphasise the loss of the individual farmer.  I should like to assert, so far as the people I represent in Dáil Eireann are concerned, the farmers of the Midlands have not gone through four years so bad since the Economic War.  To-day the small farmer of this country finds that he gets less for everything he has to sell but he has to pay more for everything he must buy.  It would, I am sure, be embarrassing to mention in the presence of Deputy Corry the subject of wheat, but I should like to convey to Deputy Corry the fact that there are a number of my constituents, farmers outside Abbeyleix, who are looking forward to the opportunity of meeting Deputy Corry again.  They will remember how Deputy Corry, in strident tones, during the by-election in Laois-Offaly in 1956, promised them that, if Fianna Fáil were elected to office, the price of wheat would go up by 12/- per barrel.  They are looking forward to seeing Deputy Corry again so that he may explain to them how it was that promise was not carried out and that, in fact, the price of the barrel of wheat today is 6/- less.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt that in the coming election these matters, and others, will be considered fully by the people. The Taoiseach said that this country is on the threshold of a serious situation. A challenge has been laid down to our people.  We accept that.  We have regard to the fact that, however it arose, whatever the reason may have been, in the past 40 years since the formation of this State there has been a concentration, undue in my opinion, upon ephemeral political matters, upon Constitutions, upon the ways and organisations of Government, <Col N="2728" /> upon a plethora of things of that kind.  We have not even started to solve the endemic social problems that face the country&mdash;the flight from the land, perennial emigration, insecurity with regard to employment. These are the things which, in my view, constitute our real challenge for the future.  They may be coloured, they may be complicated, they may be exacerbated to some extent by the Common Market, and developments of that kind, but they will still remain, and must remain, the legitimate target for legitimate Government activity here.  We believe in our Party that our policy holds some measure of promise for the solution of these problems.  Certain it is that the present Government and the present Fianna Fáil Party can offer no solution and must go to this election convicted of failure in making even an attempt to solve these important social issues.</P>

      <P>One statement made by Deputy O'Higgins took my fancy rather because I got a document a few days ago and I was wondering whether or not there was any foundation for the way in which it was concocted until I heard Deputy O'Higgins this afternoon.

      <P>There was a great deal of comment today about markets. These markets were made at a period when this nation was fighting for its life.  We had to fight against a £5 million tribute that was being paid illegally to Britain.  The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, made attacks on me last night in regard to statements I made about wheat.  I did make them and I believe them.  I did my best to put my beliefs across.  I did not know at that time that Deputy Dillon had piled up here a surplus of wheat for 3 years waiting for the new Government to come in to get rid of it.  Deputy Dillon also attacked my loyalty.  Yes, I was loyal and I am loyal.  That is something Deputy Dillon would not understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon came in here and sat on those benches representing the unfortunate <Col N="2730" /> farmers of this country.  He was there as Deputy Leader but when the whip was cracked and certain people helped in the fight to force Irish farmers to pay land annuities to Britain, Deputy Dillon trotted out of those benches and sat over there. That is the man who cannot understand loyalty.  He went further than that.  When the emergency came and the then Taoiseach and the people decided that this country should remain neutral, the actions of that man were such that even Fine Gael could not stomach them and he had to be kicked out.  How dare he come to me to talk about loyalty!  What right has he to talk about loyalty who will trot along here today and somewhere else tomorrow?</P>
    <P>I could not wish for a higher tribute on the work of the past 4 years than that paid to the Taoiseach today by Deputy Esmonde.  I know he did not mean it but he said the Taoiseach was the man responsible for the industrial advancement of this country.  Of course, he qualified that by saying he was now letting down those for whom he had got employment. Deputy O'Higgins followed on the same lines.  Deputy O'Higgins alluded to posters that were displayed during an election campaign down the country: &ldquo;Wives get your husbands back to work&rdquo; and so on.  I can quote and proudly quote the statement made by a colleague of mine in this House a few years ago, ex-Deputy O'Gorman of Youghal.  I remember knocking on door after door in Youghal and finding that many members of families were over in England earning a few shillings.  Deputy O'Gorman made a statement in Youghal twelve months ago that there is no unemployment there.  That is the answer to Deputy O'Higgins's statement. That is the result of the work of the Taoiseach during the past 4½ years.</P>

      <P>They are all here working. We would even try to make the Deputy work if he came down to us. Deputy Dillon expressed anxiety that he would be in office when we would be dealing with the Common Market and I notice another Deputy wanted somebody there who would have a knowledge of agriculture.  Of course I can quite understand that when I heard him talking about this a while ago.  I am amazed at Deputy O'Higgins thinking that anyone would buy wheat in this country.  Deputy Dillon has said:</P>
      <P>I had the experience of eating bread made from Irish wheat.  You took it in your hands.  You squeezed the water out of it.  You teased it and you then lifted it and you decided whether it was boot polish or bread.  If it was bread you tried to masticate it if you were able. That is Irish wheat.</P>
      <P>That is a statement made in this House by Deputy Dillon on the bread made from Irish wheat.  Then he comes complaining because I looked for a price for it.  I do not blame him.  I noticed during the whole of the Emergency that the Deputy was in quite good health and that Irish wheat seemed to be agreeing with him.  That is one of the props for our Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>There is another quotation from Deputy Dillon:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There remains beet&mdash;the blessings of beet!  Some day, and in the not far distant time, our people will have to ask themselves whether it is in the best interests of the community as a whole to continue the production of sugar from beet in this country at an annual cost to the community of £3,000,000 sterling.  That is what it costs in normal times to keep the beet industry going in this country. <Col N="2732" /> If, instead of growing beet and converting it into sugar, we import refined sugar into this country there will be £3,000,000 sterling more for the national exchequer and that £3,000,000 can be used to increase children's allowances in every home in Ireland from the 2/6 per child to 5/- per child, and the land vacated by that crop can be used for the production of profitable agricultural produce which will help to finance essential imports and to enrich the farmers who live upon the land.</P>
    <P>That statement was made by Deputy Dillon in this House on 18th June 1947.  That is the gentleman who is anxious now to be put in charge of the Common Market Negotiation Committee.</P>
    <P>He went further.  I quote from the Official Report of 12th July, 1960:</P>
    <P>I want to raise a specific matter which affects the problems of beet farmers who are supplying beet to the sugar factories, and also other products which are produced from Irish sugar, which is raw material produced in this country.  In 1948, we negotiated a Trade Agreement, Article V of which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government of the United Kingdom undertake that where goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland, are dutiable at preferential rates of duty, they will not vary the existing preferential treatment of these goods in such a way as to put any class of goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland, at a disadvantage in relation to goods of that class from other sources enjoying preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>Now, that is a pretty comprehensive Article and yet with that Article in existence, I understand that goods containing Irish sugar are being subjected to a very formidable levy, the proceeds of which are devoted to the subsidisation of goods of similar quality containing sugar derived from crown Colonies of the British Crown.  I am told, I think, by some of the Minister's colleagues, that when Deputy Norton was Minister for Industry and Commerce, this <Col N="2733" /> matter arose and that he did not consider it desirable to press the interpretation of Article V which would give us the right to claim exemption from that levy.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position is in regard to that.  I have no recollection of hearing the matter discussed when I was a member of the inter-Party Government, although it could have happened and has passed out of my memory but I do not remember it and I have not discussed the matter with Deputy Norton. Whatever attitude was taken up, I should like to be told now because frankly I confess that as I see it now, it appears that that Article is wide enough and comprehensive enough to cover the present procedure under which I believe that goods which are the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland are being put at a disadvantage in relation to goods of that class from other sources enjoying preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>That was a pretty comprehensive statement made by Deputy Dillon as reported at column 1411 of the Official Report of that date.  He admitted that his colleague, Deputy Norton, did not think it advisable to point out to the British that their action in putting a £16 a ton levy on Irish sugar was a breach of Article V of the Trade Agreement.  Deputy Norton did not intervene but Deputy Dillon at that time was a member of the inter-Party Cabinet and was drawing £2,500 a year as Minister for Agriculture to look after the interests of the agriculturists in this country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon was a salaried Minister of State entrusted with the task of looking after the interests of the agricultural community. On that breach of the Trade Agreement, this country has paid during the past 12 months £550,000 levy to Britain on sugar and sugar goods exported.  Over half a million was paid because one man would not do his job and had not enough interest in it to know what was being done and another poor idiot did not know what he was doing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon made another statement which I will read especially for Deputy Russell:</P>
      <P>We are subsidising butter production to the tune of £2,000,000 per annum.  How long will that go on? Do we expect butter to get dearer in the markets of the world?  Do we expect a time in the early future when the price of milk will become so adjusted that it will be possible to suspend this subsidy or do we intend to continue producing milk for conversion into butter in creameries at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £2,000,000 per annum? I want it to go on record most emphatically that I think such a policy is sheer insanity and is purely pursued for the purpose of maintaining the prestige of incompetents in the offices of the Minister for Agriculture since Fianna Fáil came into power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2735" /> That was what was going on.  That was what was said about the poor creamery farmers of Co. Limerick. Was is any wonder he came into the House afterwards with a flourish of trumpets and told the farmers he would give them one shilling a gallon for milk for the next five years?  That was the offer the Leader of the Opposition made to the unfortunate farmers of this country.  If it were not for Fianna Fáil we would be bringing back a queer agreement from the Common Market.</P>
    <P>There were complaints in connection with the flight from the land.  I am sure there is no Deputy in the House, no matter to what Party he belongs, who will not agree with me that if a worker can get £9 a week in industry he will certainly not stay on the land at a weekly wage of £5 10s.  You have that situation and while it is there there will definitely be a flight from the land.  There are six labourers' cottages within two hundred yards of my house.  Those boys came to me for letters to get them into the dockyard in Cork.  I refuse no boy an opportunity of bettering himself, and off those young lads went to the town. As trainees they are earning £5 5s. a week, and more power to them.  They are bringing back up that hill every week as much as £276.  They are not, as Deputy Rooney said, going off to England.  Thank God that in the past four and a half years I have seen a bigger advance in employment in this country than I have seen in the rest of my history.  Were it otherwise, Deputies know only too well I would not put a tooth in saying so.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about our position in regard to the Common Market and I should like to quote some figures from the White Paper and to say that if farmers here got those prices they could compete with any danged industrialist on the labour market.  The average price for wheat in 11 European countries is 34/9d. a barrel, stretching from 56/10d. in Switzerland to 34/11d.  There is a price given for the U.K. which does not tally with the price I have in my little book which says 29/6d. a barrel.  Feeding barley is 26/6d. a cwt. in Austria, 24/2d. in <Col N="2736" /> France, 32/2d. in Germany, 18/6d. in Ireland, 28/6d. in Italy, 24/7d. in the Netherlands, 33/- in Norway, 28/4d. in Sweden.  According to the record I have the guaranteed standard price for feeding barley for the United Kingdom in 1961 is 27/7d.&mdash;that is £8 a ton more than the price given here.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, if Irish farmers were to get the average European price for feeding barley they would be getting 6/- a barrel more than I guaranteed them in Kilkenny when I told them they would get back the price guaranteed by the late Deputy Thomas Walsh.  I cannot understand, looking at those figures, what is wrong with our Department of Agriculture.  If those European countries can afford to pay those prices why are our people doing so badly?  If those 11 countries can afford to pay an average of 27/7d. for feeding barley while we can only pay 18/6d.  I want to know what is wrong with our agricultural policy and with those agricultural advisers whom we have been paying down through the years.</P>
    <P>Sugar beet is the one commodity in which we hold our own and I look upon that with a special feeling of pride as the man responsible in 1948 for setting up the Costing Board and seeing that the farmers were paid on their cost of production, plus a fair profit.  We would be better off in the Common Market because when John Bull goes into it he can no longer charge us a levy of £16 per ton on our sugar and pay £550,000 as well for carrying it to John Bull's door and no thanks for it.</P>
    <P>We are getting 128/8d. per cwt. liveweight for beef cattle and according to this document the average price in the Common Market is 155/- When you tell the farmer that he is to get an increase of 30/- a cwt. in the price of beef cattle in the Common Market you will see what the result will be.</P>
    <P>For pigs the weighted average price is 33/10d. per live cwt. while our price if 31/1d.  The biggest surprise of all is in regard to milk.  The average annual price for milk delivered to the creameries for all forms of utilisation is, in Austria, 2/5d. per gallon, Belgium, 2/1d.; Denmark, 2/1d.; Germany, 2/8d.; Ireland, 1/9d.&mdash;counting skim <Col N="2737" /> and all; Italy, 2/5d.; the Netherlands, 2/7d.; Norway, 3/5d.; Sweden, 2/10d.; Switzerland, 3/2d.; Yugoslavia, 3/2d. That is an average price of 2/8d. a gallon for milk as compared with our present price of 1/9d.  Tell the farmers that they will get an increase of 11d. per gallon in the price of milk and when they tot up the figures along the line I have mentioned, item by item, you can say to them: &ldquo;The minimum wage you pay your agricultural labourer is to be £9 a week and there is the means of doing it.  We are putting you in as good a position as any industrialist in the country today.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the change, and those are the prices.  That is why I tell the farmers that they can enter the Common Market quite happily with that knowledge, provided they have somebody to make a bargain for them; not like Deputy Norton or Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>Or some fellow condemning a housing site because there was no water there, like the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Those are the conditions in which we face the Common Market.  Those figures are on the White Paper for any Deputy who wants to see them and compare them.  It is a grave reflection on our agricultural economy and something that our economists will have to get working on.</P>
      <P>We should have no occasion for a Deputy to tell us that he has no recollection of hearing a matter discussed when he was a member of the inter-Party Government, that it could have happened and passed out of his memory, that he did not remember it and had not discussed the matter with Deputy Norton.  That was the Leader of the Opposition's account of the disappearance from the Irish farmer of a market for beet worth £2 million a year.  That is how he looked after the little job he was given to do by the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I look at, and think of, the procession of farmers who were trotting up to my door night and day during the month of September and October <Col N="2738" /> last year, saying: &ldquo;Mr. Corry, could you ever get me an extra half-acre or acre of beet?&rdquo;  I realise they were looking for the market that this gentleman, put in charge of Irish agriculture, allowed the British to levy at the rate of £16 a ton thus wiping out the unfortunate tillage farmers of the south, west and midlands that we heard about a while ago.</P>
    <P>He then had the cheek to say that he is going before the people again and wants to be put in charge of the Common Market, the Lord between us and all harm.  According to the canvassing card issued in my constituency in the past week, they have no Party. They are only three little sand boys out for a row: &ldquo;Vote for Casey. Daniel and, of your charity, pray for the political souls of Richard Barry and Philip Burton.&rdquo;  Imagine any responsible political Party issuing that and ashamed to put their name on the end of it or to say whom they represented. Then they say they are going off for a general election.  They are welcome to it.</P>

      <P>No, that is gone. This is a time of stocktaking perhaps more than at any other time of the year because we are now coming near the end of the Government's period in office and facing a general election. Whatever comments I may have to make I shall be brief.  We are entitled to express our views on the activities or inactivity of the Government during its term of office.  I can assure the House that I have no intention of going into the dim and distant past to find quotations for or against Fianna Fáil but it is no harm to recall some of the statements made during the last four years and just before the Government took office in 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1956 the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party then made it clear to everyone in the course of a public speech <Col N="2739" /> that Fianna Fáil was representative of democracy.  That being so, I would like to make an inquiry as to what happened about some of the proposals put before them.  It is true they were in Opposition then.  It is true to say that they encouraged their representatives who attended their Ard Fheis in Dublin in 1956 to be somewhat wild in their demands.  One demand that was brought before them, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 22/11/1956 and which was carried, was asking for an inquiry into the changes in ownership of the bacon industry, particularly in respect of safeguarding the employment of the workers.  Four and a half years have now gone and they are now in Government.  What has happened to that demand?</P>
    <P>Again, the demand was made, and carried unanimously apparently, asking for an inquiry into the operation of the Health Acts, the Health Acts stated by some representatives to give worse conditions to some sections, and which had created hardships.  What happened to that demand?  We all know that instead of easing the hardships, or attempting to do so, the Minister for Health decided to increase the charges from 6/- to 10/- per day for patients in hospital.  That was a second instance of the insincerity of the Government when they had the opportunity as a Government in this House of attending not alone to the demands of the people in general, but to consider the just demands of their own delegates at their own Ard Fheis.</P>
    <P>That was in 1956.  Better again, the Minister for Transport and Power lectured for a long time here today. Apparently he was in a different humour on the 22nd of November, 1956.  Speaking up then, he stated it would be very difficult to alter the methods being used by the Land Commission.  The Agricultural Committee of Fianna Fáil, however, felt that something must be done, if possible, for young men with agricultural experience.  A little later, the then Deputy Childers became Minister for Lands and he found that it was suitable for him to forget the promptings and the decision of the Agricultural <Col N="2740" /> Committee of Fianna Fáil.  He found it, apparently, more suitable to continue the policy that he said would be difficult to alter.  That was in 1956, just before they took office.  There are three promises broken by Fianna Fáil Ministers who at that time encouraged their own delegates to sponsor these acts.</P>
    <P>Coming to 1957, on the 29th May, 1957, speaking at the time on the Budget, as reported in the <i>Irish Press,</i> the present Minister for Finance stated: &ldquo;In the last two years 98,000 had left this country, the biggest number since the famine&rdquo;&mdash;a rather strong statement for the Minister for Finance at that time.  Apparently he was in jubilant mood; he had moved from one side of the Chamber to the other and had become Minister for Finance and he worried about the exodus of 98,000 persons, the biggest since the famine.  Yet, statistics proved later on that in the year 1957 alone, the year in which this Minister for Finance was worrying about the 1955 and 1956 figures, the emigration figures for the year 1957 alone amounted to over 60,000 persons.</P>
    <P>Yet the promise of Fianna Fáil at the time was to provide a cure for emigration and apparently the cure was to get over 60,000 people out.  It is quite correct I suppose to say that when most of them go that then we could hope that the figures would fall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you about that.  It is not because Tipperary beat Cork on Sunday; we will beat them now.  On the 15th May as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> the present Taoiseach as Minister for Industry and Commerce then made an extraordinary statement, a statement so strong that the people in this country believed that he was moving in the right direction, that he was taking over control in a sphere where control was necessary.  He stated &ldquo;I think the time has passed when we can tolerate without concern a manufacturer who is prepared to go along supplying the home market behind a quota or tariff protection and making no effort to do more.&rdquo;  That was in <Col N="2741" /> 1957.  What has he done since, either as Minister for Industry and Commerce or as Taoiseach?  It is not long ago inside this very chamber that he made a statement and admitted that even with the possible entry of this country into the Common Market we will not have prepared all the necessary data to show how it is going to affect the manufacturers and our workers.  He admitted that it will take a long time, that they have not sufficient staff to give to these different groups to try to prepare for themselves the figures to show how they may be affected.</P>
      <P>And yet in 1957 he was going bald-headed for them.  He was going to see that any of them sheltering unjustly behind quotas and tariffs were going to have to pull up their socks.  It is a pity that his promises then were not fulfilled, a pity he did not make some attempt to carry out what he then said. If he did perhaps now with the end of this Parliament coming near we might be in a better position to know how our entry into this Common Market would affect first of all those I am more concerned with, the workers, and secondly, because we have to take cognisance of the fact that without them the workers cannot have work, the industrialists.  But now they are in a very serious position because of the promises made by the Taoiseach as Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1957, a promise he fell down on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Very handy.  1958 came and I suppose 1958 will go down in the annals of this country as the year of the October Revolution.  But the difference of course is that in another country far removed from here when we hear them shout about the October Revolution they claim it was a success. The October Revolution of the Fianna Fáil Government of 1958 was a flop.  That was the year when the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass at the time, had forgotten his warning and his threats. At the Ard Fheis the then Taoiseach accused all other Parties of attempting to deceive the people.  That was the <Col N="2742" /> time they decided to do away with Proportional Representation, but that was another failure of Fianna Fáil. However, it cost the country a lot of money.</P>
      <P>Now we come to 1959.  On the 11th November, the <i>Irish Press</i> had a leading article headed &ldquo;The Man of Action, the Man of Vision, the Leader &mdash;Lemass.&rdquo;  That was on the 11th November, a big day in other countries, Armistice Day.  This new leader, this Man of Vision, made it clear to all&mdash;and we hoped he meant it&mdash;that he was determined to forget the past. If he had kept to that line, the country might be in a better position today. But when his vision was translated into words in the <i>Irish Press</i>, he made it clear that he thought all the other Parties were &ldquo;off the beam&rdquo;.  Fine Gael was out in the cold and the Labour Party was like a rusty old steam engine.  The Man of Vision could not see the right for any Party to exist here but Fianna Fáil.  He could not see why anybody should support any Party other than Fianna Fáil.  In the same issue of the <i>Irish Press</i> the then Taoiseach was quoted as saying: &ldquo;We do not fear for our ability, when the foundations of our economy have been consolidated, to fare as well as any others on the basis of international competition.&rdquo;  He was going to lead an army not knowing where he was going, but hoping for the best.</P>
      <P>On the 11th November, 1959, we had the Tánaiste making a statement which we all knew to be incorrect.  Speaking of the advantages of the Health Act, he said that almost 40 per cent of the people outside Dublin got free health services.  That was at a time when we knew the average in the various counties was 24 per cent. or 25 per cent.  It is easy to make such statements in places where they cannot be contradicted.  But it is our duty here not alone to draw attention to these statements but to show it is unfair, unjust and unethical for a Minister of State to leave this Chamber to go to a political meeting and to make there statements not in accordance with the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to 1960.  On the 26th April, 1960, the papers carried headlines <Col N="2743" /> about the Minister for Finance. Speaking of his Budget, he said: &ldquo;It gives much, but it asks little.&rdquo;  That sounded well and was encouraging for the ordinary reader.  He went on: &ldquo;Everywhere there is evidence of a new confident outlook and of greater dynamism.&rdquo;  He decided in his generosity that that was the right time to give a nice, tidy sum to the proprietors of the cinemas and dance halls.  He found it suitable to hand over £70,000 to the manufacturers of table waters. That was the year in which so much money was provided for television. But at that time, when he was giving so much, he could give only a shilling to the old age pensioners, the blind, the widows and the orphans.</P>
    <P>Those are facts.  That is what has happened in each of those years of the life of the present Government. Because the Minister for Finance had been so generous, praise was showered upon him in the editorials of the <i>Irish Press</i>.  On the 26th April, 1960, the paper stated: &ldquo;Dr. Ryan is evidently aiming to promote the ideal situation, one in which the incomes of retired people follow the upward trend of the incomes of those still at work.&rdquo;  Those are powerful words in praise of the Minister who gave only a shilling a week to the blind, the old age pensioners, the widows and the orphans.</P>
    <P>On the statistics issued, we know that in 1960 there were 24,000 fewer people in employment than in 1957. Tragic as 1956 was, in 1957 we had 24,000 more people in employment than in 1960.  Those are not the only promises made and broken by the Government.  It is no harm to draw attention to a publication they issued in the Cork City by-election which was entitled &ldquo;Facts for Voters&rdquo;.  It talked about the &ldquo;disastrous policy&rdquo; of the inter-Party Government.  Then we had in heavy type: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil plans the end of emigration&rdquo;.  It stated: &ldquo;The Fianna Fáil plan proposes an increase over five years in the number of news jobs by 100,000.&rdquo; In order to follow that up and to make sure that the 100,000 new jobs would be taken here by Irish people, <Col N="2744" /> it went on: &ldquo;Emigration has reached frightening proportions.  Soaring prices are robbing the wage packet of its value.  Rates have been increased enormously.&rdquo;  What changes have taken place since?  They have been four and a half years in Government now.  What of the 100,000 jobs? What of emigration?</P>
    <P>They cannot deny the emigration figures which are still running at over 60,000.  What of the soaring prices? Have prices come down since?  Fianna Fáil may say that wages have gone up. We will deal with that later.  They speak of the rates.  What has happened to improve the position for local authorities since Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1957?  Have the rates come down?  When Fianna Fáil speak of broken promises, surely they must be prepared to eat their own words.  Surely on the eve of a general election, they should be honest enough politically to say that they made more promises and broke more promises than they would now wish to recall. They had 100,000 jobs; they were determined to break the back of emigration. They said: &ldquo;We of Fianna Fáil are eagerly awaiting the opportunity of putting our programme before the people at the next general election.&rdquo;  They did.  They put the programme before the people in 1957 and they succeeded in securing election on that programme.</P>
    <P>What is their answer now to the promises made to the people of Cork and since broken?  But there is even a better to come.  There is a large heading &ldquo;Muddle&rdquo;.  They attribute the &ldquo;Muddle&rdquo; to the inter-Party Government at that time.  The muddle is, according to them, that &ldquo;The housing programme is disrupted through Coalition mishandling of the country's finances resulting in financial stringency and the failure of the National Loan.&rdquo; We all know that housing is held up at the moment and that it has been held up for quite some time.  It has been my lot unfortunately to draw the attention of the Minister for Local Government to that position here.  What was his answer?  He said that the housing requirements were almost met.  I want to draw attention now to the fact that <Col N="2745" /> in a little village not many miles from Deputy Corry's home, in the heart of his constituency, there was an application for a compulsory purchase order sent up by the Cork County Council last October.  The Minister for Local Government did nothing about that application and, apparently, Deputy Corry did not remind him of it.  That is certainly a bit of a muddle.</P>
    <P>No. 3 in the &ldquo;Muddle&rdquo; is: &ldquo;The cost of Government has risen as a result of the Coalition's mishandling of administration necessitating increased taxes.&rdquo;  What have the Fianna Fáil Government done in that regard? What is the cost of Government today as compared with the cost of Government then?  As a member of the Labour Party, or as an individual Deputy in this House, I do not say that I believe the cost of Government should be slashed because I consider that the highly efficient staffs in the different Departments should have a fair, proper and just wage.  I believe none has more than that.  As I say, I am not one of those who maintain that the cost of Government should be slashed.  But Fianna Fáil said so in Cork city.  They have had four-and-a-half years in which to implement their promise in that regard.  That is another broken promise.</P>
    <P>Muddle No. 4: &ldquo;There is a great increase in the rates.  The Coalition are loading charges on to the rates in an effort to save their own faces.&rdquo;  The other day we had a Bill here for more scholarships.  It is the local rates which will have to carry those.  It is quite obvious Fianna Fáil have never had any sincerity, have never believed that they should make any attempt to fulfil their obligations.  Mark you, these printed statements surely should have tied Fianna Fáil to a policy of fulfilling their obligations when they returned to power.  They have conveniently forgotten them.</P>
    <P>Then we have: &ldquo;Prices have gone up and the only thing the Coalition has to say about prices now is that they will go no higher still.&rdquo;  During the period of the inter-Party Government, from the time that document was first published until the general <Col N="2746" /> election, prices did not go up, but since 1957 prices have gone up considerably and Fianna Fáil were the Government during those four-and-three-quarter years.  I am not saying that Fianna Fáil were in a position to keep down prices.  If they were not, then they had no right to accuse another Government because of soaring prices.  They had no remedy for them themselves.  They should have been honest enough to say: &ldquo;You failed to keep down prices.  We cannot succeed either.&rdquo;  But they were not honest enough to admit that.</P>
    <P>They had, too, this to say: &ldquo;The worst is yet to come.&rdquo;  That is in heavy type.  They said: &ldquo;Many Cork building workers have already lost their jobs as a result of the bungling of the small dwellings loans scheme. Interest rates are higher than ever before.&rdquo;  What are the interest rates now?  What news do the papers carry today about the increase in bank charges?  Do Fianna Fáil know anything about them?  Is there any difference between interest rates then and now?  Little or nothing.  I shall come back to this later.</P>
    <P>They succeeded in getting votes in Cork.  I do not begrudge those votes, but they were gained on broken promises.  They said there were fifty broken promises attributable to the inter-Party Government.  I will not go through them all.  There is down in this document a statement: &ldquo;You pay more for tea.&rdquo;  What about the price of tea now?  &ldquo;You pay more in rent and rates.&rdquo;  Did Fianna Fáil make any attempt to reduce rents and rates?  They have a reference to magazines, medicines.  None of them is cheaper today.  Indeed, I think they have gone up a little since then. At the bottom there is &ldquo;Statistics.&rdquo; It is a pity the Taoiseach and all the rest of the Fianna Fáil Party omitted to study statistics when they returned to office in 1957.  Perhaps they would concentrate between this and the general election in making a comparison&mdash;a comparison based on statistics, not on broken promises.</P>
    <P>Do they realise how important it is that they should be honest with the people, be it in their election propaganda <Col N="2747" /> or the statements they make in public?  If they do as I suggest they will not take on themselves airs, as the Minister for Transport and Power does, and they will not admonish the people, as he does, that they ought to realise how very well off they are under Fianna Fáil.  One thing the Taoiseach never told the people in 1957, or before it, was that he intended to abolish the Prices Advisory Body. They speak of 50 broken promises.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce after 1957 it was the duty of the Taoiseach not to disband the Prices Advisory Body but rather to encourage it to examine the price structure to discover where there was over-charging. But not at all.  Fianna Fáil were then in power.  They did not worry.  They worried so little that there was no longer any room or any time for the Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    <P>With regard to statistics, in Table 3 of the statistical returns I have here, the value and volume of imports and exports is shown for the years 1956-1960.  Last night we were told by the Taoiseach that we are living in an era of prosperity.  Bad as the situation was in 1956, we find that in 1956 the import excess amounted to £74.7 millions.  In 1960, in the midst of our prosperity, the import excess is £74,000,000.  There is very little difference there.  Comparing the cost of imports and exports we find that the figure for imports increased by £43.6 million and the figure for exports by £44.3 million, notwithstanding the fact that during the 1958/59 period the prices for exports were rising and also, a very important fact, the price structure in regard to imports generally was decreasing.  That does not speak very well for the activities of a Fianna Fáil Government in connection with industrial activity.</P>
    <P>Table 6 deals with value and volume of agricultural output from 1953 to 1960.  In 1953 the net output was £149.3 million and in 1960 the net output increased by only £6.7 million, notwithstanding the fact that the price values for 1953 are not comparable with those of 1960.  Take the year 1957 in which Fianna Fáil came into office.  Agricultural output which had <Col N="2748" /> to be based on the policy of the inter-Party Government for the previous years amounted to £157.1 million which was £1.1 million more than in the year 1960, the year of prosperity.</P>
    <P>Table 7 deals with the numbers engaged in farm work and if there is anything more tragic in this booklet than the information conveyed in this Table I would like to know what it is. In 1951 there were 68.9 thousand men permanently employed by farmers.  In 1960 the figure was 50.6 thousand, a drop of 18.6 thousand.  Taking the total number of farmers, farmers' sons and men permanently and temporarily employed, we find the picture is even worse.  In 1951 there were 452.7 thousand men employed in agriculture.  In 1960 it came down to 383.4 thousand, a drop of 69.3 thousand.  Surely there is nothing as bad as that for a country whose prosperity depends on agriculture. No matter how we may build up our industries if we fail in agriculture we need not worry about the Common Market or any other Market.</P>
    <P>Table 10 gives an indication of the national income.  Again I confine my remarks to the agricultural community. In 1951 the amount paid out in wages and salaries in agriculture amounted to £19.9 million.  In 1960, in the midst of all the prosperity, bearing in mind that, according to Fianna Fáil 1956 was the worst year since the year of the Famine, we find that the amount is £21,000,000, an increase of only £1.2 million.  No wonder agriculture is floundering in many respects.  No wonder the young men in rural Ireland would head for any foreign country rather than try to eke out a living by getting temporary employment in agriculture, because permanent work is not there for them now.</P>
    <P>There is another table worth mentioning and it may help Deputy Booth.  Table 5 is a very important one.  There is one section of the community that comes out pretty well and in the light of the figures supplied to us, this Government can fairly be described as the bankers' Government. In Table 5 of these statistical returns the section of the community referred to do not do badly.  None of them had to emigrate.  Between 1956 <Col N="2749" /> and 1960 current deposits and other accounts increased by £56.3 million. Of course Deputies may say that means more money in the country but it must be remembered that the bankers do not act in an honorary capacity in lending the people money.  It is obvious therefore an increase of £56.3 million represents a nice slice of profits to the banks.</P>
    <P>According to this Table loans and advances increased by £43.3 million. That also indicates a substantial profit to the banks through the Fianna Fáil Government's activities during that period.  The net external assets of the commercial banks at the end of the year increased by £15.2 millions.  That was a nice return for the banks.  In giving these figures I am bound to draw attention to a statement of the present Taoiseach published in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of 21st November, 1956.</P>
    <P>He was worried about the policy of the banks as the Taoiseach before him had been.  He is reported as follows:</P>
    <P>Our banking system will have to be such as will ensure that production exports will not be starved for reasonable facilities.  That may require some expansion of the powers of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>That is strange.  The other banks found it suitable to give extended credit.  Lord Pakenham and other men of vision drew attention to the fact that the banking system was becoming obsolete with the competition from Bowmakers and others.  The banks, because it suited them, extended loan facilities.  The Taoiseach was so happy about that that he was not worried about the interest rates.  Everything was all right now that he was in power.  It would not be fair to upset the banks.</P>
    <P>There is a point that I want to labour&mdash;it does not affect certain people.  It does not affect some of the members of Fianna Fáil whose policy is as far removed from the genuine Fianna Fáil policy as that of any Member of Parliament in any of the six countries forming the Common Market&mdash;in view of the enormous debt <Col N="2750" /> imposed on local authorities by exorbitant bank charges it would have been advisable for the Taoiseach, not merely to make the statement published in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> but to put his words into operation by ensuring, even in the case of the Central Bank, that such a heavy burden would not be placed on the shoulders of the rate-payers in the matter of interest.</P>
    <P>When a private person borrows money from a bank, that is a matter between him and the bank.  Usury has no place in a Christian community. A certain section may reap rewards as shareholders of banks because Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and every political Party are anxious to provide housing, hospitalisation and social services, but they must depend on the banking system for temporary accommodation at an exorbitant price.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have forgotten that. Headlines appeared in this morning's paper.  Again, the Taoiseach draws attention to the importance of leadership. In 1955 he told the people to keep the straight road.  Now, according to the statement appearing in the papers this morning, we are leaving the road and taxing into the skies, into the Common Market.  We have travelled a long way since that bye-election in Cork.  Where will this aeroplane take us?  I would say to the leader of this Government and to his Party and to the Government as a whole that tragedies occurred in this country in the past because of differences between sections but we cannot afford differences in our approach to the future economic position of this country.  I accuse the Taoiseach and the Government of falling down on the job undertaken by the Taoiseach when in 1957 or 1958 he warned incompetent manufacturers. The Taoiseach, who hopes to pilot this plane of State carrying 26 Counties into the Common Market, does not know where he is going.</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach does spend a week in Cork studying agriculture and other matters he will change the policy of Fianna Fáil for the next election.  He wants to give the impression that Fianna Fáil must lead our entry into the Common Market.  Poor Deputy Corry was castigating Deputy Dillon on the subject of beet.  I wonder did the Taoiseach tell Deputy Corry that the six countries forming the European Economic Community are able to provide 100 per cent. of their requirements in sugar.  What about Deputy Corry's beet then?  For the last few years we have had trouble in part of South Cork, in the Courtmacsherry-Timoleague-Barryroe area, where the Sugar Company slaughtered the beet quota of unfortunate people who had been making a living out of it.  Can the Taoiseach advise Deputy Corry as to the effect on the beet industry of joining the Common Market?</P>
      <P>This is too serious a problem for anyone to suggest that he has the answer or to say: &ldquo;Follow me, boys. I will pilot the plane.&rdquo;  Deputy Corry may become a truculent passenger when he finds the beet programme would not help him.  Will the Taoiseach tell the farming community that the Six can meet their full requirements in milk, butter, cheese and eggs and 96 per cent. of their requirements in meat?</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry, time and time again, has referred to wheat.  The Taoiseach might do well to inform Deputy Corry that these six countries meet 92 per cent. of their obligations in connection with wheat.  It is foolish, unfair and unjust to give the people of the Twenty-Six Counties the impression that they may follow Fianna Fáil into the Common Market and prosperity.  Nobody knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential this question should not be based on the political approach, no matter who is in Government. This is a matter in which the Government must ensure the security of the people.  Before we join the Common Market, there are many hurdles to be negotiated and we must let our people know that is so.  Within a few months the people may say they would prefer other people to represent them in <Col N="2752" /> this House.  So long as I am in public life I shall admit my responsibility to the people.  I shall tell them that joining the European Economic Community may well bring prosperity but that before we gain admission we must present a united front.  If we can get that co-operation then we will be on the road to economic prosperity in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I should like at the outset to support the Taoiseach's plea yesterday that all those participating in the coming election will show the world a fine example of Irish democracy. I hope he will go further afield and have these sentiments conveyed to every constituency in the country.  I have particularly in mind my own constituency where, immediately prior to the last local elections, an effort was made by the Fianna Fáil organisation to misrepresent certain candidates seeking honours to the City Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach must have had information from some parts of the country when he made that appeal and I am giving my reasons for supporting him.  As other speakers have intimated the final debate of this Parliament is one in which stocktaking will be done by most speakers &mdash;those in Opposition as well as those who supported the programme of the Government during its term of office. I am in a somewhat unique position since the electors of my constituency four and a half years ago chose me as an independent Deputy and during the period of this Parliament I have endeavoured to justify my election &ldquo;ticket&rdquo; in my contributions to the debates in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I think it would be wrong of me not to start by paying a tribute to the Government for the progress they have made during the past 4½ years.  I think that every Government <Col N="2753" /> that has had the honour of guiding the destinies of our people is entitled to receive credit if not from its opponents at least from some neutral source and on this occasion I think it would be completely untrue to suggest that no progress has been made in the past 4½ years.  I believe it has, just as I believe that past Governments have added something to the degree of prosperity and human happiness now enjoyed by the people of this State.</P>
    <P>However, I do not think it is correct for the Government to assume&mdash;as speakers from the Government side of the House have assumed&mdash;that all the good things that have happened in the past 4½ years have been directly due to Government intervention or to Government control and encouragement. Strangely enough a lot of the prosperity that has taken place in the industrial sector has been due not to any Government encouragement but to those participating in industry.  I should like to pay a tribute first of all to the men who guided those industries, who put their energy and capital into them, and to the workers who have participated in them.  I sometimes think that if we had less interference from the top and less alleged guidance from alleged experts the ordinary people in this country, whether they work in a factory, in a field or behind a shop counter, would make a better success of their lives and of the country's economy.</P>
    <P>The last Government came into office at a very crucial period of our country's history.  The years 1956 and 1957 were very difficult years for the country.  For that reason I do not think it is altogether fair to compare the progress that has been made in the last 4½ years with the crisis years of 1956 and 1957.  We always tend to make comparisons with the worst possible examples in order to attempt to show the progress made.  It is true that the Government which went out of office at one of the lowest ebbs in our economy left behind them certain legacies.  We know the present Government are entitled to criticise some of their activities but the Government which went out on that occasion had to take <Col N="2754" /> certain unpopular steps to rectify a set of conditions which then existed.</P>
    <P>They may have been responsible themselves at the time for some of those conditions, but others were brought about by circumstances over which no Government could have control. Before the last Government left office they put certain levies on imports to correct the serious balance of payments crisis that had arisen.  Any fairminded person will admit those levies did their job.  They were painful and caused unemployment at the time but they corrected the balance of payments to such an extent that at the end of 1957 there was a credit of £9 million in our international trading account.</P>
    <P>That sum tided the country over the next three years' deficits so that at the end of 1960 we could say that over the period of four years our international account was roughly in balance.  When the new Government came in they immediately cut the food subsidies.  I do not want to make a point of that.  At the time I took the view that the country could not afford these subsidies and I think that was proved by the fact that when the subsidies were taken off the Budget was subsequently balanced.  Nothing has happened since to suggest that the present Government has been at any time in a position to restore those subsidies.  It has never been in a position of having £6 million that it could devote to restoring the subsidies on bread, flour and the other items from which they were taken.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Government were entitled to credit for certain progress and for certain favourable developments which occurred during their term of office.  They can take credit for the increase in the national income and also for the increase in industrial employment, meagre though it was, and hopelessly inadequate to offset the very large decrease in agricultural employment. They are entitled to credit for increased productivity and, finally, I think for the fact that the number of unemployed is substantially lower than it was three or four years ago.  It may be said that the figures are lower because large numbers have left to work elsewhere.  This is true, and in <Col N="2755" /> taking credit for the decrease in unemployment figures, regard must be had to the very heavy emigration which has continued over the past four years. Not so long ago the Taoiseach admitted here that the rate was in the neighbourhood of 40,000 a year.  I do not think the Taoiseach would be guilty of making an underestimate but, even accepting his estimate&mdash;which I think will be shown to be low when we get the census figures next month&mdash;it means that something like 160,000 to 180,000 have left the country in the past four years.  I believe the figure is substantially higher.</P>
    <P>A feature seldom mentioned in speeches here and which I think is very significant is the fact that over a long period, and certainly during the past four or five years, the country has continued to trade at a substantial loss. Our imports have continued to exceed our exports by a sum varying between £70 million and £90 million a year.  We depend very substantially&mdash;more substantially I believe than other countries in a comparable position&mdash;on making up that deficit by the invisible earnings of the tourist trade, emigrants' remittances and income from investments abroad.  As long as that condition of affairs continues we shall always be vulnerable.  If anything should happen to our tourist industry or to reduce the flow of emigrants' remittances, or to our investments abroad, we would find ourselves in very serious balance of payments difficulties again.  Personally, I should like to see the day come as soon as possible when our trading account comes nearer to balance and we are not so dependent on invisible items to balance it.</P>
    <P>For the past four years the Minister for Finance has been content just to balance his Budget.  In this he has succeeded and it is a matter for credit; but never has he thought of trying to budget for a surplus.  As we know, our nearest neighbour every year, in spite of trade and export difficulties, succeeds in having a very substantial balance to credit on current account. This is used for various capital purposes and I suggest we should aim at having such a balance in our Budget at the end of each year's accounts. <Col N="2756" /> It could be very usefully applied to increase our investment in productive capital outlay of one kind or another. At the moment, in order to do this, we must borrow.  I am not against borrowing for productive purposes but, looking back over various Government programmes for years past and not excluding the present Programme for Expansion, I think we must admit that a large part of what is called productive capital outlay could very easily be otherwise described.  Any capital investment that cannot at least financially sustain itself only adds indirectly to the deadweight of debt which is already too high for a small country.</P>
    <P>In this regard our rapidly growing national debt has caused me disquiet from time to time.  It is seldom referred to because no ordinary individual sees or feels its effects directly.  A national debt of £450 million in a country where the population is steadily declining is or should be regarded very seriously.  The fact that it costs £22 or £23 million every year to service that debt is something of which we should take more cognisance.  The fact that the service charge is going up each year at the rate of £2 million is a factor which may in time call for serious remedial action.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Government for the improved incentives given to exporters over the past three or four years.  I use the word &ldquo;improved&rdquo; deliberately because most of these incentives were introduced by their predecessors; the tax free &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; on exports for five years instituted by the previous Government was increased to ten years and in the case of Shannon Airport to 25 years.  That has helped very considerably to increase our exports of manufactured goods which have risen considerably over the past three or four years but which have still a long way to go before they can equal our exports of agricultural goods, whether live animals or processed foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>The more we look at the value of our exports of manufactured goods as against the value of agricultural exports the more it helps to bring <Col N="2757" /> home to us the importance of continuing to concentrate primarily on the export of agricultural goods and particularly processed foodstuffs.  In taking credit for the expansion of exports over the past three or four years, we must remember that Europe generally has been enjoying boom conditions and we have been exporting to an expanding market, in England mainly, where the purchasing power of the working classes particularly has been going up rapidly.  There are indications, however, that this state of affairs may not continue and already there is some sign of a slowing rate in some of our exports to Britain. I hope that position will be rectified as we will find ourselves in very serious difficulties if there is any general slackening in our exports to Britain.</P>
    <P>In discussing our rate of progress, as speakers from the Government side have done in this debate, they might, I think, have made comparison with the progress made by other OEEC countries.  It is all very well to take the 1956/57 figures and compare them with the last 4½ years.  I would like to see some of the Government speakers taking some of the continental countries, comparing their rate of progress, in the relevant statistics, with ours.  I think it would give a very significant picture and therefore I hope that some of the Government speakers will give us these figures for our edification.</P>
    <P>Naturally enough every speaker has mentioned the Common Market and indeed it is impossible to disassociate it from this debate.  I would like to say, first of all, that the question of the Common Market is not in issue in this House.  All Parties, and every individual Deputy, agree that if England goes into the Common Market we have no option but to join too. Whether we like to admit it or not, Great Britain and we form a natural economic unit and we already apply to the two islands some of the policies which the six countries of the Common Market are now trying to introduce among themselves.  I refer particularly to the free movement of capital and labour between these islands.  It is only <Col N="2758" /> natural, therefore, that if England joins we must join with her.</P>
    <P>I think we should not commit ourselves at this stage not to join if England does not join.  We should leave it to a later stage, and presumably to a later Dáil, to decide, in the event of England not joining, whether or not we should negotiate for some form of association with the Common Market if&mdash;and a most important condition&mdash;we can retain our trading relationship with Great Britain.  That may not be possible or practicable but at this juncture I would be very slow to commit ourselves not to join if England does not join.  I think the farming community would be averse to binding ourselves to such a decision at this stage.</P>
    <P>Although the Taoiseach has made several speeches including his speech yesterday in which he has adverted to the topic of the Common Market, I am not yet clear as to what are the specific terms on which this country will join.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister has indicated on more than one occasion the terms on which England will apply for membership, and both he and other members of the British Cabinet have laid it down as an essential condition that the interests of the Commonwealth and British agriculture and their partners in the E.F.T.A. must be considered and must be protected if England is to join.  I would like to ask the Taoiseach what position will arise if England joins and we do not secure conditions, such as a long enough period to allow our industries to prepare for complete free trade.  Do we join irrespective of the conditions we can negotiate?  I think the Taoiseach has gone very far in committing us to join if England joins. It seems to me that he should have entered into preliminary negotiations with the Common Market countries at an earlier stage before making this irrevocable decision.</P>
    <P>In this context it is interesting to learn from Mr. Macmillan, the British Prime Minister, that the British Government have been negotiating with the members of the Common Market <Col N="2759" /> for the past nine months.  Some effort should have been made by our Government when it was obvious&mdash;and I believe the Government must have known the position from its various contacts throughout the world&mdash;that England's decision to apply for membership of the Common Market was imminent.  In this regard I feel that the Committee, which has been set up to assess the position of groups of Irish industries in the new Free Trade Area, should have been set up at least two years ago.  I think we find ourselves in a particularly vulnerable position because we are entering the negotiations unprepared.  Two valuable years have been wasted, either because the Taoiseach did not want to know or was completely unaware of the position. If I have any strong criticism to offer against his handling of the situation it is that he has not acted sooner in opening preliminary negotiations with the Common Market countries.</P>
    <P>I myself have put down several questions over the past two years in regard to the question of opening negotiations and, up to a matter of four weeks ago, the Taoiseach stated in this House that in his opinion it was inopportune to open even preliminary negotiations.  Some contact should have been established with these countries over the past two years.  I feel that the information gained then would have influenced the Government to set up the Committee that is now at work to assess the position of our industrial firms in this Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>One piece of information which I found it impossible to get from the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the type of assistance which industrialists can expect to get from the Government to help them in, to use the expression of the Minister for Finance, the amalgamation, specialisation and rationalisation of their various industries.  The only assistance that I can see that would be of any use to them would be financial assistance and I hope before this debate closes that the Taoiseach will give the industrial sector, which has always been so dear to his heart as we know, some encouragement <Col N="2760" /> to relieve their very serious problems.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say much about the agricultural question.  I am not competent to speak on it, for one thing, and secondly others have already spoken on it.  I presume further Deputies will speak on it, but I am concerned at what is barely an outline of the future set-up of agriculture in the participating countries in the Treaty of Rome.  It is stated, as the Taoiseach pointed out, that the family character of farming will be preserved and that farming will be placed in a position that families and workers on the land will be able to earn incomes comparable with those in urban areas. I think that is an ideal to which we all subscribe and Deputy Corry would be one of the first to agree&mdash;indeed, he has stated so already in this House&mdash; that a farm labourer is entitled to an income comparable to his counterpart in urban employment.  I am not certain though how that is going to be done and I feel that, even if the family character of farming in this country is to be preserved, there will be less family farms.</P>
    <P>If, as Deputy Corry suggested, we are going to pay farm labourers £9 or £10 a week, we will not pay it out of 30 acre holdings.  It is inevitable&mdash;in fact, it has been stated, I think&mdash;that this whole Common Market set-up visualises a substantial reduction in the agricultural population, that large numbers will transfer from agriculture to other employments provided in the main, presumably, by greater industrialisation. Indeed, it is suggested in the Treaty of Rome that industrialisation in rural areas will take care of the surplus population and help to resolve the problem of marginal farming.</P>
    <P>Again, this is a fine ideal and one to which we would all subscribe.  It has been the policy of successive Governments here to locate industries in rural areas.  It is a policy with which we all agree, particularly for social reasons in that it offers some alternative employment to the sons and daughters of small farmers who cannot hope to support all their family in small farm units.  This is very fine so long as we can decide this policy for <Col N="2761" /> ourselves.  But who would suggest when we are part of a large Common Market of 300,000,000 people, where industrial units presumably will be of a very substantial size, that this policy will be followed?</P>
    <P>As I understand it, industrialists will establish their industries whereever it pays them best.  We may find ourselves in the position that the drift from the rural areas will continue, but instead of the farmers' sons and daughters finding employment in Limerick, Cork, Dublin and elsewhere, they will go to the Continent of Europe to get it.  These large industrial units on the Continent will be so big and efficient that they will employ the people who should be employed in this country.  In other words, unless we can secure adequate terms in our negotiations to protect our industrial sector, it is possible to foresee a situation in which we will be unable to maintain, let alone increase, the level of our population.  I do not want to take a pessimistic view in this matter. I personally believe that our people have the capacity to tackle this challenge.  The only thing that worries me is whether we are going to be ready in time.  If we are not ready in time, it will have a very serious impact on our country.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of the economic size of industry and of industrialisation generally, there is another important aspect that has not been touched upon, that is, the psychological aspect.  In the changed circumstances it will be necessary for our people to employ a completely new outlook on industry generally, both employers and workers.  I should like to see the situation arise whereby both employers and workers would look upon industry as a joint enterprise, that both would agree to share the rewards of increased productivity and that any question of a clash between employer and worker would no longer arise.  That is the outlook of successful industry particularly in the small Continental countries.  We would benefit if we could imbue our manufacturers and workers with the same idea.</P>
    <P>Finally, I subscribe completely to <Col N="2762" /> the Taoiseach's sentiments when he said that membership on equal terms with the other countries of the European Economic Community is a stimulating challenge to our people.  I believe it will be to our benefit even though we have to relinquish some degree of sovereignty and even though we must transfer some of the powers of deciding economic and social issues to the larger supra-national institutions of the Common Market.  If we make the decision to join as a completely free and independent people, by and large we will gain in the long run.</P>
    <P>This question of the Common Market is not a Party one.  It is a matter for the people as a whole.  As this will be my last opportunity to speak in this Dáil, I should like to express the hope that whatever Government is in power and whatever its complexion, it will not hesitate to seek the support and active participation of all Parties and of all interests, whether represented in this House or outside, in this great challenge to our future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>One could begin this debate by quoting the words of Shakespeare in relation to the address by the Taoiseach in opening the discussion. The words are: &ldquo;In such a night as this stood Dido on the windswept banks, a willow in her hand and waft her love to come again to Carthage.&rdquo; The Taoiseach standing here in his accustomed place, with the willow in his hand, is wafting the Irish electorate to come again to the Fianna Fáil Party and to continue to give them the support which they gave in 1957.  It might be of interest to the Taoiseach to know that Aeneas, to whom Dido was beckoning on that famous occasion with the willow in her hand, did not go back to Carthage but chose instead another bride from the vicinity of the Seven Hills of Rome. That will be true by analogy on this occasion.  Whatever blandishments, whatever the allure of words, the electorate are not going to permit themselves to suffer twice from unrequited love.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2763" /> We were told by the Taoiseach in the course of this debate that the price of progress is continuous effort.  I agree.  But effort, however continuous, must be an effort springing from a real plan, sensibly conceived, economically designed and, above all, with the intention of benefiting the people to whom it is addressed.  It can hardly be said that the plans to which we have been accustomed can be identified with that continuous effort which is meant to be the price of progress.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that such plans as we have had enunicated in this House, or outside it, in the course of addresses made on Estimates or whether it is in Clery's Restaurant or anywhere else the Taoiseach chooses to address the Comh-Chomhairle of the Fianna Fáil Party, that the plans so enunicated are not plans designed on an economic basis and sensibly conceived, but plans designed by way of expediency as the fastest possible method to gain the support of the electorate.  The support of the electorate was so gained in 1957 by the promise of 100,000 jobs through the injection into the economy of this country over a five year period of £100,000,000.</P>
    <P>So far from realisation of that objective are we today that, instead of 100,000 extra jobs, we have in this country 51,000 fewer people in employment. So far are we from the realisation of the principles laid down by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Boland, when he said that this Government was clearly elected to deal with the problems of unemployment and emigration, that 200,000 people left this country during the tenure of office of this Government.  That 200,000 does not represent all the people who left. Perhaps I might be speaking for a limited portion of this country when I talk of the families that have left, the heads of which have applied for insurance cards in Great Britain for the first time.  When the head of an Irish family, having emigrated, applies for an insurance card in Great Britain for the first time that does not carry with it numerically the dependants which he has to support in Great Britain, his wife, and his children, some of them of schoolgoing age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2764" /> I might mention, in passing, that last Sunday morning I addressed a meeting in an area in my constituency where it was brought home to me that this year for the first time children have been enlisted, children under school leaving age, to work in the potato fields of Scotland in order to supplement the family income and to preserve the holding at home.  Last evening Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Opposition, referred to a speech, without giving the source, in which it was promised at Belmullet on 28th March, 1957, that food subsidies would not be withdrawn, and that promise was reinforced by the argument that the then leader of the Fianna Fáil Party would not withdraw them because he realised, and his Party realised, how important bread was in the diet of the poor.  The Leader of the Opposition said correctly that he was prevented constitutionally from mentioning the source of that particular speech.  I am likewise prevented, but that speech carried with it in my constituency of North Mayo a distinct successful electoral result, the gain of a seat for the present Government Party.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to invite the author of that speech back to Belmullet. Neither is the author of the speech in a position to come back to Belmullet, but the person in whom is identified that electoral success, the second seat for Fianna Fáil in North Mayo, is in a position to come back and, by all accounts, he does not chose to do so, so that the people of that part of the constituency of North Mayo will be deprived in the next general election of hearing either the source of their inspiration or the argument as to why that inspiration should not be continued from the person who is identified with the success of that speech.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the people so shamelessly betrayed, so hopelessly beguiled, I now invite the existing Deputies for North Mayo, whether they be seeking re-election or not, to come out and speak in support of those who will be carrying the banner in the same town and to give their reasons as to why they think the people should continue to support this Government and as to why they think the people are wrong <Col N="2765" /> in believing that they were fooled on that occasion.  That, of course, is only one example of the kind of thing that has happened.  Deputy Dillon in the course of his speech yesterday evening alluded to the situation obtaining in this country where public men are held up to ridicule and contempt as a result of denying today what they so solemnly promised yesterday.  Only for so long can that situation continue to obtain. Only for so long can people be fooled universally.  Portion of them no doubt will continue to be fooled for all time but, speaking for the constituency which I have the honour to represent, I do not think that they will be fooled, not alone the next time, but ever again.</P>
    <P>In an Estimate here last week, or the week before, there was much discussion about the new pattern of emigration from rural Ireland, and particularly from the West of Ireland.  It was being alleged from this side of the House that houses were closing, that whole families were leaving and that the struggle to keep the small holdings was so difficult that they were being abandoned.  Out of the mouth of Deputy Killilea comes the statement: &ldquo;This racket will soon blow over.&rdquo; It is being confidently asserted by certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party, noticeably by the Minister for Lands, that it is unknown to them where these houses or where these derelict holdings are situate.  That is the kind of brazen assertion for which the people will not stand.  They will not accept that old world business of whistling past the graveyard.</P>
    <P>Speaking here over two years ago I gave the numbers of the houses that had closed in Newport and in the parish of Ballycroy.  I asked a question of the Taoiseach as to what this Government proposed to do to relieve the situation.  I was given answers that provided no hope.  The figures which I gave then are insignificant in comparison with the numbers that now exist all over Mayo.  I speak only for that area and possibly for part of Sligo and Leitrim of which I have had some experience in a recent by-election.</P>
    <P>At a meeting which I attended organised by the parish priest of the area on the north coast of Mayo some few <Col N="2766" /> months ago, we were informed by the parish priest from his records that in 1956 he had 744 families in his parish and by May of this year the number stood at 100 less.  My colleague, Deputy Calleary, from North Mayo attended that meeting, too, and as a result of joint consultation a petition was sent by the Rev. Parish Priest of that area to the Taoiseach pointing out the difficulties, pointing out the trend and asking for help.  Beyond an acknowledgment nothing has happened since by way of assistance from this Government to the people of that area.</P>
    <P>I attended a similar meeting in the adjoining parish where the same tale of emigration obtained, a parish which boasted of a football team prominent in the Mayo league and which for the past two years failed to field one because they had not got the material from which to draw, a parish in which a two-teacher school had been closed because there were no pupils to attend it.  The same is true of most of the other areas in the constituency which I represent.  It is not a matter of boasting or saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; to the Government Party.  It is a matter simply of grieving with people so deluded.</P>
    <P>Is the picture I have painted here this evening, and which is a true picture, consistent with the words of the Taoiseach yesterday afternoon when he described the mood of the people as confident?  Confident in what? There may be confident moods in some places where this Government and its members are able to place their own nearest and dearest and the most prominent of their supporters, but in the extreme west of Ireland the mood is far from confident.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says the effect of this dynamic policy of Fianna Fáil can be seen in the countryside.  Yes, the effect can be seen in the countryside&mdash;of quiet, the absence of the voices of children in villages, the absence of smoke from the chimneys, the absence of hope in those who are left.  That is the effect upon the Irish countryside that I know and with which I am conversant.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach think that, on behalf of his Party on the eve of this <Col N="2767" /> General Election, he will delude those who are left by words and by phrases like &ldquo;looking to the future&rdquo;, &ldquo;fore-taste of the future&rdquo;, &ldquo;planning for the future&rdquo; and boldly saying that emigration is less than it was five years ago? He came to my constituency once before.  I invite him back again to any town or village in it and I dare him say in any town or village in North Mayo that emigration is less than it was five years ago.  I offer the same challenge to any of his Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, to say in any town or village in the constituency of North Mayo that emigration is less than it was five years ago.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is enamoured of plans.  He loves talking of plans.  He tells us now that this plan, whatever it is, in which the Government are engaged will not show its full fruits until 1963.  He has another plan after that.  He says it is right that we should plan further.  The result, no doubt, will be a promise of another 100,000 jobs and of full and plenty for all.</P>
    <P>We had here this morning, supporting the Government case on this Adjournment Debate, the Minister for Transport and Power who sought on occasion during his speech to relegate himself into the position of Ireland's funniest man.  He gave a recital of what this Government had done for agriculture.  At times I felt that he must have got the wrong script, that he was reading from Fine Gael policy as outlined in the various speeches in recent times by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>Of course, that was in keeping with the general approach of the Government Party to the electorate, namely, to say you will do something on the eve of an election, fail to do it during your term of office and on the eve of the next general election deny that you ever promised it.  That would appear to be the philosophy, the principles upon which the Government Party work.  It is sad that while they would appear to be the underlying principles of their approach to the electorate they have achieved considerable success in securing the support of the electorate and at the same time have lamentably failed in <Col N="2768" /> every phase of activity either agricultural or industrial.</P>
    <P>There is great boasting going on, portion of it included in the Taoiseach's address yesterday afternoon, about the great rise in industrial exports. It is now freely admitted, even by the Government Party, that that increase in industrial exports flows directly from the advantages offered to industrialists both at home and abroad through the provisions of the 1956 Act brought in by the inter-Party Government.  I notice the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach smiles at that.  Is he smiling at the wonderful advantages that have accrued to his Party as a direct result of that Act or is he denying my assertion that these advantages flow directly from it?  He will have to admit that that assertion is true.</P>
    <P>Listen to what the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass in Opposition, had to say about the Industrial Grants Act of 1956.  I quote from Volume 160, column 1948 of the Dáil Debates:</P>
    <P>I think that is necessary but I think that is all that is necessary and, indeed, I am quite certain that, if that were done, it could be said that no industrial concern with any prospect of development, any prospect of making a profit, would not be able to proceed because of shortage of money.</P>
    <P>He was arguing that the Bill was unnecessary and would be ineffective. He continued:</P>
    <P>These are provisions which I think are likely to be far more effective in retarding industrial development than helping it.  I believe that over the main part of the industrial field, private enterprise is the best force on which to rely.</P>
    <P>The increase in industrial exports is a direct result of the provisions of that Act and the provisions of that Act were something in which the present Taoiseach as a Deputy in Opposition had no faith.  Perhaps it was that he was acting in a manner which was the converse of that of the man who was seeking power, namely, trying to denigrate anything of an effective nature that was being proposed.  He concluded <Col N="2769" /> his contribution to the debate on the Industrial Grants Bill, now an Act which is benefiting the country considerably, with these words:</P>
    <P>The Minister can have his Bill, as far as I am concerned, but I want to make it clear that, in my view&mdash; and I may at some time in the future be empowered to influence Government policy&mdash;I think it has no importance whatever in relation to our industrial development and it represents a completely wrong approach to the problems of Irish industry as they exist today.</P>
    <P>Are the Taoiseach and those who support him not ashamed to come in here and boast of the vast increases in industrial exports having regard to the fact that in 1956 he threw such cold water on the propositions that are proving so advantageous now?  There was the threat, certainly an implied threat, that if ever the chance came his way he would reverse the policy enshrined in the provisions of the Act when he said:</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that, in my view&mdash;and I may at some time in the future be empowered to influence Government policy&mdash;I think it has no importance whatever in relation to our industrial development and it represents a completely wrong approach to the problems of Irish industry as they exist today.</P>
    <P>Is there no limit to which public men will go in their efforts to achieve power and to hold power?  The Taoiseach at one stage of his announcement yesterday hoped that the coming General Election would be an example to the world of how democracy works here.  I take it he meant a good example.  I should hope he meant a good example. Perhaps he meant that the good example to the world would be set by people voting for Fianna Fáil again, thus showing that democracy here works in a very peculiar way.</P>
    <P>But as I interpret his exhortation to the people&mdash;and I ask the people to interpret it in the same way&mdash;it is that public men of all Parties will approach the people with plans in which they <Col N="2770" /> believe, plans that are conceived on a sound economic basis, plans that are not designed to secure the immediate vote and plans that will be honoured in so far as it is possible for a Government to honour them.  The least that can be expected of any Government is that it will honour some of the promises made.  But when the Government of this country goes back to the people on this occasion they will have to answer a lot of questions&mdash;questions that may not be put but questions which will be very active in the minds of the electorate.</P>
    <P>The electorate will want to know whether this Government, going to the country seeking continued support, proposes to implement whatever plans it means to put in a different manner from that in which it so basely honoured the promises given in the speeches of the present Taoiseach in Waterford and the former Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in Belmullet on 28th February, 1957.  The truth may not be important to the Government Party but they will find that as time goes on the truth will have an impact on their success or failure.</P>
    <P>Let them not in this General Election try to make the Common Market the umbrella, as Deputy Dillon put it yesterday, under which all the past is to be hidden, or indeed let them not invoke the protection of a much more embracing umbrella opened today by the Minister for Transport and Power when he blamed Providence for three successive years of Fianna Fáil misdeeds. It is one thing to blame material causes but when the Government Party proceed to call on Providence on their side things are going too far and it is something for which the people will not stand.</P>
    <P>We are today, by reason of the tardiness of this Government, unprepared for our entry into the Common Market though the Government were exhorted to prepare for our entry over four years ago.  They do not know any more than the man in the moon at the moment what the full implications of joining or not joining the Common Market are.  Let them on that account not try to illustrate it as a Utopia to the Irish electorate.  Let them point out the implications for our <Col N="2771" /> industrial, our agricultural and our economic life.</P>
    <P>I do not think for one moment that the relinquishment of our sovereignty through joining the Common Market will be a step backwards.  I regard it as a much more important thing that we in this country with our heritage, our beliefs, with our strong traditions, can put into that pool of knowledge in the Common Market sufficient influence to make it something greater than an economic gathering or a uniform force in Western Europe.  But is our role in the Common Market one to which we could commit ourselves on the basis of representatives from this Government? I do not think so.  Their record of negotiation has been a record of failure.  Their record of amenability to discipline has been terribly lacking. Their record of promises based on falsehood and expediency is unrivalled the world over.  I rely at this stage on the good sense of the Irish people to ignore the Taoiseach's blandishments, to ignore the fine phrases, the brave words and that, having examined carefully the results of former phrases, former words, they will withdraw his authority and set this country back on the road to prosperity.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon gave a performance yesterday in the role of Mr. Facing Both Ways.  He proclaimed at first his adherence to the European Common Market and a stronger and greater Europe and he then proceeded to try to arouse the most direful apprehension in the minds of our farmers, industrialists and workers as to the consequences for them.  We are, he said, all floating about wondering what is going to happen to us in the Common Market. Now, unless the Deputy spoke for his own Party, we on this side of the House are not wondering.  We know, and those who have been following the statements of the Taoiseach and others of my colleagues, know also. We know the Common Market brings, not only a challenge, but a great opportunity to every person of initiative and enterprise in our community; whether he works on the farm or is engaged in industry or in the ordinary business of commerce. Like all great opportunities it has its hazards as well; but none that cannot be overcome if men of vision and vigour are in charge of the nation's affairs.  In short the nation has nothing to fear under its present leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did I promise not to interrupt?</P>

    <Col N="2774" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It has everything to fear, if that leadership should fall again into the hands of those who twice before brought this country to the verge of disaster, first in 1948-51 and then from 1954 to 1957.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, Deputy Dillon told us that in the ten years prior to 1957 this country had achieved the prodigy of doubling its exports and trebling their value.  So far as the volume of exports is concerned the statement is true.  It is true, however, for one brief year prior to 1957&mdash;but that year is not one for which Fine Gael can claim credit.  It was the year 1954 when what the Fianna Fáil Government had sown was reaped by Fine Gael and its allies.</P>
      <P>As to the statement that exports had trebled in value, if, by value, Deputy Dillon meant real value on the basis of the purchasing power of the £ in 1947, then it was not true at all.  In that slick way of his, Deputy Dillon, when claiming that exports had trebled in value, wished the Irish people to forget that under the Government which Fine Gael formed and headed in 1948, and in which his Fine Gael colleague Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Finance, the Irish £ was drastically devalued; so that its purchasing power was ruthlessly cut to seven-tenths of its 1947 value, the value it had when the Fianna Fáil Government was in office.</P>
      <P>Whether his statement was true in some particulars and false in others Deputy Dillon, with the megalomania which characterises his utterance on great occasions and mars it on all, wished it to be inferred that he alone had done it and, if not literally he alone, then with the Fine Gael Party which for him has the same significance: &ldquo;L'Etát, c'est moi.&rdquo;  The real truth, of course, is that so far as exports are concerned Fine Gael's record is not one for praise but for reproach and I shall show that from official statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1947 the value of exports in the hard money of that year was £39.5 million and the index of export volume to the base year 1953=100, <Col N="2775" /> was £51.3 million.  In 1948 the value in hard money was £49.3 million and the export index was £59.4 million.  In the autumn of 1949 the Irish £ was devalued by the Fine Gael Coalition and its value cut to .7 of what it previously had been.  The value of all exports thereafter was inflated.  But, for what they are worth, here are the figures for the values of exports from the year 1949 to 1954 inclusive. Export values in 1949 were £60,000,000; in 1950, £72.4 million; in 1951, £81.5 million; in 1952, £101,000,000; in 1953, £114.1 million, and in 1954, £115.3 million.</P>
    <P>The harsh fact is, as I said before, that these values are only .7 of what they would have been in 1947; so if we allow for this, it will be seen that, not for the first time, Deputy Dillon was trying to humbug the people when he made his grotesque claim that the value of our exports had been trebled.</P>
    <P>To get back to the volume of our exports corresponding to the figures I have given, the volume index figures were: in 1949, 66.3; in 1950, 74.6; in 1951, 73.5; in 1952, 89.5 and in 1953, 100.  In 1954, the year in which, as I said, Fine Gael reaped what Fianna Fáil had sown, the figure was 102.6. There is the truth, undistorted by currency changes, and it is this: the years in which the value of exports tended to be double what it was in 1947 were 1953 and 1954.  Both of these were Fianna Fáil years.</P>
    <P>Then came the second Fine Gael Coalition, headed as before by Deputy Costello and with a Fine Gael Minister for Finance.  Not surprisingly the volume index in exports fell to £95.3 million in 1955 and £98.1 million in 1956 and the value fell to £110.85 million in 1955 and £108.2 million in 1956.  Thus under the magnificent Deputy Dillon, under the Government of which he was a member, our external trade was tending to dwindle both in volume and in value.</P>
    <P>There came a change in Government, and Fine Gael went out and Fianna Fáil came in.  Fianna Fáil came in in 1957 and the change was immediately reflected in a rapid improvement in our external trade.  The <Col N="2776" /> value of exports jumped to £131.3 million in 1957 and continued to rise until last year it was £152.4 million. The export volume index similarly rose from £116.9 million in 1957 to £129 million in 1960.  It is clear, I think, from these figures that so far from helping, fostering or encouraging exports, the Fine Gael policy and the advent of Fine Gael to the Government had disastrous repercussions on trade and not only on trade but on production and employment in this country.</P>
    <P>All of these things combined to produce the serious financial crises of 1951 and 1956 when, after a series of unbalanced Budgets and deficits on external account, the Fine Gael people could no longer go on.  Now, as a result of the Fine Gael mishandling of the public finances in their first term of office, the country had deficits of £30.2 millions in 1950 and £61.6 millions in 1951.  It is better that the public memory should be refreshed about this part of the Fine Gael record.  But not only did we lose this £91.8 millions but we also borrowed £40 millions from the United States.</P>
    <P>The people of this country have been carrying the burden of this financial improvidence ever since.  They have had to find the additional taxation for the annuities which we have had to pay every year since 1951 to the United States in respect of the Marshall loan. When we had to realise in 1950 and 1951 £92 millions of income-earning assets, not only had we to go short of capital for essential development, we had to forgo the income from the investments which our banks were compelled to sell; and the Exchequer had to forgo the tax on that income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to go out.  I just cannot hear such a tissue of untruths.  The man who spent £22 million of the Marshall Aid money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I spent £22 million of the Marshall Aid money.  I spent the £22 million that remained of the Marshall Aid money paying the bills which were due by the Fine Gael Government and which had to be met within six months after we took over in 1951.  In fact, the political record of this country since 1947 is <Col N="2777" /> briefly this, that when Fine Gael went out, Fianna Fáil had to come in to clear up the mess and, I am glad to say, did clear up the mess.</P>
      <P>Because of the fact that they did that, the country is in the strong position in which we find it today.  Over the last four years we have been able to carry through an enormous programme of capital development in this country the like of which has not been seen here since, well, since we got our independence anyhow&mdash;and we have been able to do it and to balance our Budget.  We have been able to increase our social services, to give more money out in social welfare benefits than was ever done under a Fine Gael Government and we have been able to do that without burdening ourselves with huge external debt.  Over the past four years the aggregate deficit on our external account is merely the nominal one of £1.3 million.  We are going to the country on this occasion as we went before, with our public finances in sound order, with the foundation laid for future progress and with men of vision, vigour and enterprise who will be able to see that that progress is maintained to lead us.</P>
      <P>Last night Deputy Dillon wept bitter tears about the flight from the land and today he was on the same theme.  What is the fact about the Fine Gael record on this matter of emigration?  In 1948 the then Government headed by Fine Gael, with others who joined it despite their protestations that they would never enter a coalition, were scarcely warm in their seats when the Tánaiste on the 5th April appointed a Commission to consider, I quote: The present level and trend in population and recommend what measures, if any, should be taken in the national interest to influence the future trend in population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Commission was appointed on the 5th April, the day on which the income tax year was beginning for 1948.  It presented its report on March 11th, 1954.  It was printed by us, so that it could be easily read and studied after we left office in June of 1954. During the whole of that period, what measure did Fine Gael take to give <Col N="2778" /> effect to the recommendations of the Commission which had been set up by the first coalition Government?</P>
    <P>I have, as Minister for Social Welfare, ransacked my Department.  I have asked other Ministers can they find any record in their Departments that the recommendations of the Commission which they themselves set up were ever seriously considered.  I asked them could they find for me any proposal which would tend to stem the tide of emigration.  Not one of them could produce any tangible proposal whatever.  The Leader of the Opposition, the Minister for Agriculture in the two Coalition Governments, had much pity last night for the boys and girls of the West of Ireland who have gone to England and elsewhere. Sad and regrettable the fact is, but, at least, while we recognise the sadness of it, we are trying to do something to cure it.  We do not talk about it in hypocritical terms, knowing that, while we did not set up a Commission, as they did, to delude the people, we were giving serious concern to the problem of emigration, and that we did not intend, when we got the report of the Commission, to bury it away in the Government archives and do nothing whatsoever about it.</P>
    <P>In its concluding passages that Commission made some very serious and searching comments about the future trend of emigration.  It said: &ldquo;Assuming the rate of emigration over 1948-1954 and that the present fertility rates will be maintained, we forecast in 1986 the population will be 2,899,500.&rdquo; That is to say, there will be a total decline over 35 years of 71,000, an average decrease of 2,000 per year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the babies born?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is taken into account.  The population as returned in the 1951 Census was 2,960,000.  In 1956, two years after this Commission had presented its report to the Government, the Census for that year revealed that the population was 2,878,000, a decrease of 62,000 since 1951, a decrease at the rate of 12,000 a year, indicating, of course, that the rate of <Col N="2779" /> emigration had considerably increased, because the existing rates of fertility were being maintained or, if anything, were tending to rise.</P>
      <P>With these facts before them what did Fine Gael do about it?  That is the challenge which Deputy Dillon and those who stand with him in the coming general election will have to face in regard to this question of emigration.  The Opposition have tried to create the impression that in some way not apparent to ordinary people, and certainly in some way not revealed by any official figures, there has been a heavy increase in the rate of emigration from this country since Fianna Fáil took over.  The fact of the matter is that the heaviest drain upon our population occurred during the period of the first Coalition and was repeated during the period of the second Coalition.  In 1952, the intercensal estimate of net emigration, as returned on 23rd March of that year, was 34,300.  That was the estimate of the net rate of emigration in 1952.  In 1956, the estimated net rate of emigration had gone up to 47,500, an increase of 40 per cent.  What were the Fine Gael Party and their associate in the Government doing in relation to that?</P>
      <P>In 1957, the net passenger movement outwards, as returned for the end of February that year&mdash;that, of course, was the month in which we had the general election, the month in which the Fine Gael Coalition was in its death throes&mdash;the net passenger movement outwards was 44,200.  At the end of February, 1961, it was 41,800.  It is not a very satisfactory figure, I admit, but nevertheless it is better than that we inherited from our predecessors in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Dillon professed to be gravely concerned about the effect our adherence to the Rome Treaty would have upon our industries here.  He tried to exculpate himself for the fact that in past years he had bitterly opposed the programme of industrial development which had been initiated by the Fianna Fáil Government when it first took office in 1932. It is ironical to hear Deputy Dillon profess any concern for Irish industry or Irish workers.  I remember when he <Col N="2780" /> came into this House in 1934 and held up a little baby's semmit and said that was what we were expecting the people to pay for and that was what we were professing to have made in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is true that in that year our making up, clothing and textile industry in general was very insignificant in all branches, so the little semmit might have been a satisfactory symbol for it. Today that textile industry is a great one, covering all branches from spinning the raw cotton to the making up of goods for the export market, and it is giving employment to tens and twenties of thousands of our people. It is selling in competition on the export market.  Its yarns are selling in competition in the most unexpected places.  The products of our clothing factories are to be found in some of the most fashionable shops in world capitals.  All that has been done in the face of bitter and vexatious opposition on the part of Deputy Dillon and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>I have not any doubt whatever that when we enter the Common Market the opportunities for these making-up trades will be greatly increased, because we shall have access to a much wider market.  The factories will be able to offer a much wider range of patterns and designs and they will have behind them to support them one of the most intelligent labour forces that exist anywhere in Europe or anywhere in the world.  That is one of the great assets of our manufacturers.  I have met a number of foreigners who have come here and seen some industries I know well.  They have all been struck by the intelligent adaptability of our workers.</P>
    <P>Our employers and managements, too, are as enterprising as any.  There are small industries here which have been selling, as I know, to Peru, Mexico, the Barbados, Canada and South Africa, all in the face of competition. There is not any fear in my mind, at any rate, that those manufacturers who are worth their salt and who are really seriously concerned with their businesses and who have built up their businesses will have greater opportunities.  But they will also have this hazard: they will not be able to rest on their oars.  They will <Col N="2781" /> have to be alert all the time in their endeavours to improve their products and to find out new markets for them. But it can be done.</P>
    <P>We have not any reason to fear in relation to our bigger industries that it cannot be done also.  Our Irish Shipping is facing world competition in the fiercest sector of international trade.  It has held its own very much better than much longer established lines in which the maritime interest has been a very great one.  The same is true of our cement.  We are exporting it in very large quantities.</P>
    <P>We are exporting the product of Bord na Móna.  I remember when that great enterprise was started&mdash; again, as I said earlier, by men with vision, men who were prepared to back their plans and to face the unbridled and unscrupulous criticism which they met here in this House. I remember when Deputy Dillon, and others, used come in here and talk about the wet turf in the sacks, and all the other things, just when we were starting to get our people interested in our bogs as a valuable asset which we could develop.  I remember when Bord na Móna was started and we began to mechanise our bogs.  I remember the jeer that used be made of that effort an our part.  They talked about the Health Robinson machines we were using on the bogs.  I remember when we came in here for money. We had to come in here many years for money before that project was set on its feet.  I remember the way they used to turn to the Bord na Móna accounts and scoff at them.</P>
    <P>Even during the war, when we had to carry on, when we were trying to make good the deficiencies in fuel, fuel which we formerly relied upon the foreigner to supply, no credit was given for the fact that we had to make do and mend with whatever remained of that machinery.  After the war, we reorganised Bord na Móna, reconstituted it, and refinanced it.  We were turned out in 1948.  And for over 12 months the fate of that great enterprise hung in the balance because the members of the Fine Gael Party <Col N="2782" /> were anxious to kill it, as they killed the international airlines, simply because it happened to be a Fianna Fáil project.  To-day we are dependent upon Bord na Móna bogs for one-third of our electricity supply.  We are dependent upon them to an increasing extent for our domestic fuel.  Not alone that, but we are actually exporting the product of our bogs to Great Britain and elsewhere.  That sort of enterprise would never have been dreamt of, and could never have been built up had the present leader of Fine Gael, and those closely associated with him, been members of the Government during the most critical years of its development.</P>
    <P>I referred to the international airline. We started to develop that airline in 1936.  It is now one of the most successful operating in the world.  On its European operations alone it earned a surplus of £277,000, making a net six per cent.  On its capital investment in what is regarded as one of the most hazardous enterprises upon which anyone could embark. But we saw the opportunity which our geographical position presented to us and, before the war, we started &mdash;I think it was in 1936&mdash;the development of the great Shannon Airport, which is sometimes referred to as the crossroads of the world.  How were our efforts seconded by the Deputy who professes to be concerned about the development of Irish industry and what its fate will be in the European Common Market?</P>
    <P>I remember him coming in here and jeering.  I remember him hoping for the day&mdash;indeed, he said he knew the day would come&mdash;when rabbits would be dancing on the runways in Rineanna. Now the development of our aviation service had to be suspended during the war.  We resumed its development immediately that planes could be had and pilots were available.  It is a great thing to be able to say that, in 1946, the predominance of this country in the development of civil aviation was so clear that, when the first provisional international conference on civil aviation met, it met here in this city of Dublin.  Arising out of that, we saw our opportunity.  We decided we would <Col N="2783" /> go after the transatlantic traffic and get into the transatlantic service, and get in on the ground floor.  We pushed ahead with the construction of Shannon Airport.  We bought the planes. We secured all the international way-leaves that we wanted.  We had everything lined up for that service to start. The first Irish plane was to cross the Atlantic on St. Patrick's Day in the year 1948.  Then, of course, there came a change of Government.  The St. Patrick's Day flight was cancelled.  The aeroplanes, that would have been worth millions to us in building up the traffic, were sold and the proceeds used to balance a Fine Gael Budget.</P>
    <P>Undeterred by this terrible setback, one which we have been paying for ever since, when we came back in 1951 we tried again to get the transatlantic air service under way.  We had entered into certain agreements.  Again the Government changed and Fine Gael came back.  Again everything was thrown on the scrap-heap.  This time we have entered the transatlantic air carrying service for the third time.  We had to start it with planes that were hired and naturally planes that were draining off most of the profit; but to-day, in the accounts of the Irish international airlines, you can see that in less than three years the deficit on working account has been reduced to only £94,000, and I understand from a statement made by the General Manager that, in the first six months of this year, that deficit will disappear. What position would we be in to-day as international carriers&mdash;one of the most remunerative business that any nation can get into provided, of course, it has the know-how and the ability to manage the concern&mdash;what position would we be in to-day if it had not been for these two set-backs that the country had to suffer at the hands of a Fine Gael Government?  We would have been, as we were in 1946, amongst the foremost civilian aircraft operators in the world.</P>
    <P>Last night I understand that Deputy Corish was complaining about the fact that our expenditure on social services now represents&mdash;I do not think I am misrepresenting him&mdash;a smaller fraction of our total tax revenue than it did in 1957.  That is quite true but there has <Col N="2784" /> been a substantial increase in our expenditure upon pensions of all kinds: contributory old age pensions, non-contributory old age pensions, widows' contributory pensions and widows' non-contributory pensions.  The total expenditure on all these services in the year 1957 was £13,670,000.  It was even less than that in 1956.  In 1961 the Budget provided for an expenditure of £18,576,000, an increase of £5,000,000 or, to put it another way, an increase on almost 40 per cent. in the expenditure on pensions in 1957. What is more extraordinary still, the expense of administering these enlarged services has gone down.  In 1956-57 the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare cost £551,000.  Today I am able to run that office on £494,000, so there is a saving of £60,000 due to the fact that the Coalition is out and Fianna Fáil is in.</P>
    <P>I have perhaps overstayed my time by a few minutes.  I could talk further at some length, but I understand Deputy Michael O'Higgins is to come in and I shall not stand between him and the House very much longer.  I only want to say this, that yesterday's speech about emigration, yesterday's speech about the plight of Irish industry in the Common Market, yesterday's speech about the increase in agricultural production, yesterday's speech about our total increase in production, was a hollow sham on the part of Deputy Dillon.  He is not at all concerned about these matters.  All he is concerned about is the future of Deputy Dillon in Irish politics.  He said last night that people were floating about wondering where they would go.  That does not apply to us.  But I am not surprised that it applies to Deputy Dillon and his Party, because, after all, a Party which is supported and sustained by windy rhetoric must float around some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a saying &ldquo;the old dog for the hard road&rdquo;. I think we can show the truth of that saying and see the reason why the hoary old veterans of Fianna Fáil are being press-ganged back into service for this general election.  Where would Fianna Fáil be if they were not able to hear that kind of pep talk on the <Col N="2785" /> eye of an election by the old maestro of Fianna Fáil, the Minister for Health, Deputy Seán MacEntee? &ldquo;The old dog for the hard road.&rdquo;  Deputy MacEntee is so long on the road that he knows exactly what spectacles to use and what colours to choose.</P>
      <P>There were a number of things he chose not to see with the Nelson eye of Deputy MacEntee in 1961.  There were a number of factors and circumstances which arose at the time of the last general election which it is right that this House and the country should consider, but which the Tánaiste, following his Leader's speech of yesterday, feels should be forgotten and put behind us now, that instead of considering the circumstances under which Fianna Fáil were elected four years ago we should forget everything except the challenge of the Common Market.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to forget the circumstances under which the Tánaiste and his colleagues were allowed to form a Government here in 1957.  In that year they were elected as a Government with an over all majority, an over all majority perhaps as great as any Government had in this country since this state was established by Griffith, Collins and Cosgrave 40 odd years ago.  It is right on the occasion of this adjournment debate that we should examine the circumstances in which Fianna Fáil obtained that majority.  It is even more important that we should examine just what they have done with that over all majority in the past four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What were these circumstances? One of them was the fact that in the year 1956 this country was involved in an economic blizzard over which the Government at the time had no control, brought about by circumstances which we in this country could not control. All of us remember how Fianna Fáil made political hay while the sun shone for them in the year 1956.  There was very little assistance given to the then Government by the then Deputy MacEntee and other Fianna Fáil Deputies, speaking from these benches at that time.  There were few of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, either front benchers or back benchers, who endeavoured <Col N="2786" /> to lend a helping hand at a time when the national solvency was at stake and when they knew, as we knew on those benches, that it was necessary for the then Government to take stern measures for the sake of preserving national solvency.</P>
    <P>We had instead the Fianna Fáil propagandists endeavouring to portray to the public a picture of a weak and vacillating Government lacking in leadership.  How wrong they were is well known to the people now because the Taoiseach has gone on record since as confirming that the steps taken by the inter-Party Government solved the problems that were before the country at that time.  We know now that the Government which was in office in 1955 and 1956 had not only the moral courage to take the right decisions but they had the political courage to implement their decisions.  Despite the political unpopularity which that meant, they had the courage to face the people in those circumstances.  That was grist to the political mill of Fianna Fáil and according to their propaganda the Fianna Fáil Party were even going to outdo the Almighty.  The Fianna Fáil mills were going to grind exceedingly fast.  Fianna Fáil were going to get &ldquo;cracking&rdquo; four years ago; and they were going to get &ldquo;cracking&rdquo; on three main points: the cost of living, unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>In all the atmosphere of the unpopular measures the then Government had to take and of the temporary dislocation of trade which was caused by those measures, the Fianna Fáil propagandists were pumping their propaganda into the political arena.  There was talk of 100,000 new jobs and of a Fianna Fáil plan for full employment. There were posters, which have become notorious, placarded on every dead wall in the country calling on the housewives to get their husbands back to work.  We had the Fianna Fáil promise, implicit in the poster, &ldquo;Let's get cracking&rdquo;, that all that was necessary was to change the Government and there would be a complete alteration in the state of affairs then existing.  That was one of the circumstances under which Fianna Fáil obtained office four years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2787" /> There was also the circumstance that a certain amount of political violence was taking place north and south of the Border and there was a feeling, and it was engendered by Fianna Fáil propagandists, that the then Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party was the person to deal with that kind of situation, that the firm hand of the then Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party was needed and that if he were back in office he with a firm hand would put down the kind of political violence which was coming into existence.</P>
    <P>The members of the inter-Party Government, certainly the members of my Party who co-operated in that Government, always believed in the maintenance of law and order in this country and always believed, without changing, in upholding the authority of the legitimate Government of this country and believed in using the ordinary courts of the land to deal with any trouble which arose in this country.  But, the Fianna Fáil propaganda machine was pumping out its propaganda and people were led to believe that the ordinary courts of the land were not sufficient to deal with the situation that then existed and that you wanted the firm hand of the then Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party to deal with it.  That was another of the circumstances which existed at the time of the last General Election.</P>
    <P>Then there was a fact, and it is a fact and I quite freely acknowledge it, that a number of people in this country had held in very great esteem the former Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, a man who for 20 odd years had been first the Prime Minister and then the Taoiseach, as he was called.  He had enormous prestige and people, even those who did not agree with his politics, particularly in his salad days in this country, held him in the kind of esteem that is associated with a venerable elderly statesman.  Every effort was made by the Fianna Fáil propagandists to play on that fact and to get them to vote for the Fianna Fáil Leader to form the next Government. The belief was engendered that in voting for the Fianna Fáil candidates it did not matter what the Fianna Fáil candidates were like, that they were <Col N="2788" /> really voting for Dev.  Every one of us knows that that propaganda existed at the time of the last general election. It is fair now that we should examine the circumstances which then existed and should ask ourselves how Fianna Fáil have used the overall majority which they obtained at the last general election, particularly in relation to the propaganda which they circulated at that time.</P>
    <P>Let me start at the last matter to which I have referred.  I wonder how many people in this country who voted Fianna Fáil because of their esteem for the Fianna Fáil Leader, because of the prestige associated with him as an elderly statesman, would have voted for Fianna Fáil if they knew he was going to throw in his hand as Taoiseach after a couple of years and pass on the mantle to a member of the Fianna Fáil Party who had never secured the confidence of the people at a general election.  How many of the people who voted for Fianna Fáil because they felt their then Leader was the person who would deal firmly with outbreaks of political violence would have voted for Fianna Fáil if they could have seen into the future and could have known that virtually on the eve of the Presidential election the gates of the Curragh would be opened and that reliance was going to be placed once more on the use of the ordinary court machinery to deal with that particular type of offence?</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost of living, the Tánaiste has just finished the opening of his election campaign for the coming election.  I want to remind him and his Party of his election address in the last general election which contained these phrases&mdash;this is the Fianna Fáil election address for the Dublin South-East constituency&mdash;</P>
    <P>In living memory trade has never been so bad, unemployment so rife and the necessaries of life so dear.</P>
    <P>Let us analyse that for a moment. Here we have the present Tánaiste, then a Fianna Fáil candidate in Dublin South-East, issuing his appeal to the voters in that constituency to return him to this House and to return his Party to Government and doing that blatantly on the basis of his election <Col N="2789" /> address in which he was emphasising to the people that the necessaries of life were never so dear.</P>
    <P>The next section of the election address went on to say:</P>
    <P>But all this belongs to the past.</P>
    <P>Will the Tánaiste read over that election address now and find out whether or not the dearness of the necessaries of life belongs to the past or belonged to the past in 1957 because in their very first Budget, notwithstanding the speeches which they made, quotations from which have been given here today, the Fianna Fáil Government abolished the food subsidies and by deliberate positive Government action increased the cost of living on the people?  By deliberate positive Government action, they increased the prices of the necessaries of life on the people.</P>
    <P>This election address of the Tánaiste concluded in this way:</P>
    <P>If you do your part in this election to put a Fianna Fáil Government in office, we believe that we can look forward with confidence to a revival of industry, an increase in employment and greater security for all.</P>
    <P>That, of course, was the theme of the Fianna Fáil propagandists throughout the election campaign.</P>
    <P>There was all the talk about full employment and I have here the pamphlet issued as a General Election pamphlet by Fianna Fáil in 1957.  The first page had a picture of their former leader and the words &ldquo;Let us go ahead again.  Vote Fianna Fáil.&rdquo; On page 2 there was the banner-line heading: &ldquo;All energies devoted to one aim&mdash;full employment.&rdquo;  At the bottom of that page there was another heavy lettered heading: &ldquo;Unemployment can be cured&rdquo; and on the next page, a banner-line heading: &ldquo;Action can start now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was the document issued on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party for general use in the last general election, for use in every constituency by all Fianna Fáil candidates and that was <Col N="2790" /> issued side by side with the statements of the present Taoiseach, then a candidate for the constituency of Dublin South Central.  He told the people that unemployment was the test of Government policy and that if the Government policy were putting more people into work it was all right but if it were putting people out of work it was all wrong.</P>
    <P>Every Fianna Fáil propagandist was out to paint the year 1956 as the black year for employment in this country.  What is the position now after Fianna Fáil have been there for four and a quarter years with their overall majority?  They have been in a position to implement any plans or proposals they liked.  Simply by counting heads inside this Chamber&mdash;because there was no Party or no group of Parties strong enough in Opposition&mdash;they were able to put into effect any plan they put before the House.  Where now is the plan for full employment referred to in this supplement of the <i>Irish Press</i> in 1955?  Where now is the Fianna Fáil pamphlet, the Fianna Fáil plan for full employment?  Why was that plan never brought before the House during the past four and a quarter years?  There were times when there was not an hour's work for this House to do, when we were sent home early in the week or early in the day, when the holidays were protracted because there was no work to do.</P>
    <P>Why did they not utilise that time in bringing before the House their plan for 100,000 new jobs?  What has become of it?  We are coming into another general election and are there to be more of these supplements issued of proposals for 100,000 new jobs? What has become of the original one? They have been there for four and a quarter years with their overall majority and what is the result of it? Instead of 100,000 new jobs, after a few years of Fianna Fáil Government we find that there are 51,000 fewer people in employment in this country than before Fianna Fáil were elected. There would be 51,000 more people now earning in good jobs under good conditions in this country if Fianna Fáil had remained out of office in 1957.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil succeeded in putting <Col N="2791" /> them out of work instead of putting them into work and, while all this talk of 100,000 new jobs was going on, there was talk also of the door that was to remain closed.  There was one avenue that was not going to be exploited to get employment and that was the Civil Service.  We were told there were to be no extra civil servants, that there was to be a reduction in the cost of administration.  But according to Government figures published in answer to Parliamentary Questions here a month or so ago, there are 500 more civil servants than there were before Fianna Fáil came back to office.</P>
    <P>So, while on the overall picture, instead of 100,000 new jobs there are 51,000 fewer in employment, the one door that was to remain closed&mdash;the Civil Service&mdash;was opened and 500 civil servants have been brought in. That is the Fianna Fáil record on employment.  The Tánaiste spoke about emigration.  We have not found it easy to get figures from the Government on this question.  It seems to be far easier to get them from the British Government and from British sources.  I think that every Deputy in this House is conscious of the fact that according to the report of the British Migration Board a figure of 268,000 people is given as the number who left the Twenty-Six Counties and got work in Great Britain in the years 1957, 1958, 1959 and 1960.</P>
    <P>In those four years, under Fianna Fáil Government, according to that source 268,312 people left this country and were given work in Great Britain. That takes no account of the number who were dependants of these people who were given employment in Great Britain and it takes no account of the children under school leaving age who accompany these people.  It takes no account of the people who emigrated to America, Australia, New Zealand or anywhere else.  Yet we have Fianna Fáil now patting themselves on the backs as regards their four years of office.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House by quoting Fianna Fáil sources but I do want once again to point out that when Fianna Fáil were elected in 1957 they themselves knew very well why <Col N="2792" /> they were elected&mdash;through the success of their propaganda in the general election and leading up to it.  A new Fianna Fáil Deputy who was rapidly promoted to Ministerial rank walked into this House in 1957, fresh from his speeches and those of his colleagues, and as reported at column 1283 of the Official Report for 15th May, 1957 he said:</P>
    <P>In my opinion and in the opinion of any fair-minded person who even now goes back and looks over the speeches made in the election campaign, it is beyond all doubt that we were put in here as the Government to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation of mass unemployment and mass emigration brought about by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>That was the reading of the position by the Minister for Defence.  He had no hesitation in coming into this House and saying that Fianna Fáil were put into office specifically for the purpose of ending a situation of mass unemployment and mass emigration.  How have they done that?  They have forgotten their plan for full employment, they have forgotten their proposals for 100,000 new jobs but they are facing another general election with 51,000 fewer people in work and practically 270,000 people driven to emigrate in the past four years.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste referred to a saving of some £60,000 on administration in the Department of Social Welfare.  That might be a welcome contribution to the taxpayer here but the facts are that whatever money was saved in that Department went out for a very much less worthy cause.  I put down a number of Parliamentary Questions to try to find out what was happening to that money because, according to the Estimates published by Fianna Fáil, they are spending something in the region of £22,500,000 more than was being spent by the previous Government. Yet local rates have soared by some £3,500,000.</P>
    <P>I tried to find out what was happening to the money.  Bear in mind the Tánaiste has succeeded in saving £60,000, he says, on administration of the Department of Social Welfare.  I found that they had purchased 33 new <Col N="2793" /> Government cars in the last four years at a cost of £44,732 2s. 6d.  That £60,000 which the Tánaiste saved in the Department of Social Welfare has virtually gone to buy 33 new Government cars.  The petrol used by Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries in the 33 new cars in the last four years cost £40,786, so that on those two items alone, instead of a saving of £60,000 we see that £84,000 or £85,000 was spent on transport for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not at all cheap.  Spending £44,000 for 33 new cars is not my idea of what is cheap or spending £40,000 on petrol.  We found that from 1956-57 to 1960-61 a sum of £84,000 odd had been spent on repairs and decorations for Arus an Uachtaráin.  Where do those figures stand when the Tánaiste boasts of a saving of £60,000 in the Department of Social Welfare?  I could give other figures and if Deputy Collins tempts me I shall do it, but I know there are other speakers who want to get in before this debate concludes.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are coming to the end of their period of office in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, as far as the people are concerned, it is not a day too soon.  They have been paying dearly for the privilege of having a Fianna Fáil Government in office for the past four-and-a-half years.  They have been paying 10d. per lb. more for Irish creamery butter, paying more for the loaf of bread, more for the bag or sack of flour, more for their cigarettes and tobacco, more for their petrol, more for their rates and rents, more for rail and bus fares, and, whatever Deputy Collins may think about it, I think he will find there are many people in the country&mdash;I believe, a majority&mdash; who have found out by now that Fianna Fáil are too expensive a luxury to have in office for another period.  I think Deputy Collins and <Col N="2794" /> some others who may have been momentarily encouraged and uplifted by the old-dog-tackling-the-hard-road pep-talk of the Tánaiste this evening will find within the next few months that even the old dogs will be pushed off the hard road by the electorate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to many of the speakers in this debate, I think there are only two or three figures of any great importance in assessing the success or failure of Government policy over the years.  I shall mention only three figures.  The first is the average rate of emigration in the 20's&mdash;16,000 a year&mdash;and the average rate of emigration in 1960 which was estimated at about 40,000.  There has been a progressive increase between the first and the second figure.  The third figure is the net emigration which is reckoned to be about 1,000,000 since the State was founded.  These three figures add up to the joint achievement of the different Governments in control here since the 1920's. It seems to me, on those figures, it would be reasonable to suggest that the failure has been the joint failure of the great Parties and that the breaking up of these figures into the different years with which they may be associated is relatively irrelevant. The failure, virtually a total failure, is a joint failure of the political Parties and&mdash;most important&mdash;of their policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most frightening things I have noted in recent years concerns the particular issue we are now dealing with, namely, the Common Market.  It is the frighteningly efficient conditioning of minds that can take place relatively quickly when carried out by the now wonderfully highly organised propaganda machine in our so-called democracies.  The most outstanding example of that in action occurred in the neighbouring country when a Conservative Government was returned on a particular policy and where now, of course, the policies, <Col N="2795" /> promises and undertakings fostered in the minds of the people about the possible achievement of that Government are being shattered.</P>
    <P>Here, the question of the Common Market is one which has come to the forefront relatively recently from the point of view of public opinion and we now have the situation of the overpowering barrage of newspaper propaganda, political speeches, slanted, censored and presented in a way designed to create just one idea in the public mind, the idea that it is essential that we enter the Common Market.  The extraordinary position is that confusion has been created, not only in the public mind but even among politicians here, because they have spent today and recent days&mdash; the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other leading speakers&mdash;assuring us of the wonderful prospects ahead, conceding certain risks but, generally speaking, envisaging splendid prospects if we enter the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The most absurd and ludicrous part of it all is that having engendered the idea that this is a splendid opportunity, a most hopeful development for our people generally in industry and agriculture, they failed to emphasise the possibility that we shall not&mdash;through no fault of ours&mdash;enter the Common Market at all.  It is possible that Britain will find that she cannot negotiate conditions satisfactory in regard to the Commonwealth and that she may then withdraw her application and that we shall find ourselves not entering the Common Market because, as the Taoiseach has said once before with exemplary honesty, emphasising and re-emphasising it, we are so inexplicably tied to Britain from the economic point of view that we must do what she does from the very simple, practical financial point of view.</P>
    <P>So that we are now in a position where as a result of widespread political Press propaganda we have the public being rushed into a feeling of anticipation of great new opportunities lying before us in this Common Market, expanding markets, better social conditions and so on, when in fact the matter is still in doubt.  It is <Col N="2796" /> quite possible that this vista of the Common Market may fail in a matter of weeks or months should negotiations with the British Government&mdash;not with us but with the British Government&mdash; fail.  That emphasises the completely dependent situation in which we now find ourselves as a direct result of the policies of the various Governments since the foundation of the State.  The Taoiseach is quite right; there is no alternative now to entering the Common Market with one proviso which I shall mention later.  I think we are faced with this inevitable position and its inevitability is the creation primarily of the Taoiseach himself because of his industrial policy over the years.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to remarks made by the Tánaiste in which he referred to devaluation of the Irish £ in 1948/51.  It was drastically devalued; that is quite true because we had to move with the British decision at that time.  But does anybody doubt that Britain is in a position at the moment &mdash;probably &ldquo;of bankruptcy&rdquo; would be too serious a charge to make but certainly in a position of great economic difficulty&mdash;facing problems which to many people appear to be insurmountable especially in the present context of trying to become competitive in export markets?  She is facing that in spite of the operation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer recently; she is facing practically inevitable further devaluation in the coming year and there is nothing surer than the fact that if she devalues, we will devalue.</P>
    <P>The simple logic of the Taoiseach's own statements on many occasions, particularly on the B.B.C. in the radio interview there, is that we are so economically tied to Britain that we must do as Britain does and it seems to me that we, in the next year, will almost inevitably face this question of devaluation.  Whether it is Deputy MacEntee or Deputy McGilligan who is in control of finance, he will have no choice but to do it.  The Taoiseach I think, has glossed over the economic situation when he pointed out that the banks were going to increase the bank rate but we need not consider the other changes made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Lloyd, in Great <Col N="2797" /> Britain.  Again the logic of the Taoiseach's own repeated assertion seems to escape him.  The logic of his assertion that we are so closely tied to Britain economically that if she finds herself in growing financial difficulty, as she does at the moment, from the stupidity of the policies of the Tory Government or for whatever reason, these economic difficulties facing Britain are merely three or six or nine months away from this country. The Taoiseach must know that as well as I do.</P>
    <P>He must also know that there are no steps that any Minister for Finance can take, believing as they do in their conservative economic policies, which will obviate the consequences of our close economic ties with Britain and that we face the same boom-burst pattern of conservative economic finance.  The boom period is coming to an end here as it must inevitably if it does in Britain, and the next period must be a period of serious depression. That is leaving aside altogether the question of the Common Market.  It is one of the reasons why in Britain they have no alternative but to try to get into the Common Market to try to save what is left of their economy.  So the Tánaiste may be talking a bit too soon when he sneers at the allegation of an Irish Government having to follow in British footsteps.</P>
    <P>One of the incongruous sequels to this elation and exultation on the part of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, &ldquo;the wonderful opportunities that are there&rdquo;, one of the consequences of all this favourable propaganda for the Common Market is the simple question: &ldquo;If it is all that good, all that favourable, all that desirable, what have we being doing all this time?&rdquo;  The Rome Treaty was operated in 1958. Why have we not gone in to this paradise, why have we not sought these opportunities, why have we not given industry these new extended markets, why have our farmers not been shown into this wonderful land of promise flowing with milk and honey with the wonderful prices we heard Deputy Corry refer to to-day?  What have we been waiting for?  If it is all that good now it was very much better in 1958. <Col N="2798" /> Why did we not enter the Common Market in 1958?</P>
    <P>Are we a sovereign State?  Have we the right to decide these things?  Surely it is a very sad commentary on the ambitions and the attitudes of the Leader of the Government that having examined this whole problem of the Common Market and all its advantages for Ireland, he either did not or could not seek entry without the authority of the British Government?  He implied that in his statement, that if we had applied in 1958 as was suggested by some members of the Opposition, we would have incurred the displeasure of the British Government, which appears to be a shocking exhibition of the slave mind.  Either we are an independent sovereign State or we are not.</P>
    <P>Why do we play-act?  Why do we pretend we have these rights to make these independent decisions and at the same time eagerly wait for the decision from the House of Commons, from Mr. Macmillan, as to whether we can or should enter the Common Market? Our noses were rubbed in it today by the Council of Ministers in Brussels, who have more or less assured us that our application is premature and that it certainly cannot be dealt with before the principal's application is dealt with, that we are merely minors.  As I said, we are an unimportant concern in this great international take-over operation.  Our wishes are relatively unimportant in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach appealed for an honest statement of the position in the approaching election.  I do not think he is being honest in that regard.  I think he is tending to conceal that. He has allowed a great propaganda machine to go into action, particularly in his own newspaper, the <i>Irish Press,</i> which, having indoctrinated the minds of the people for a period, carried out one of these gallup polls in order to get the mass of the Irish people behind the Taoiseach in seeking entry into the Common Market when in fact the question does not rest with the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>As far as the future of the country is concerned, the position now is that the Taoiseach and his great Party <Col N="2799" /> have as little say in the future development and expansion or contraction of the country as Deputy McQuillan and myself in our small group.  This matter is now taken over by this supra-national authority we are entering, to which we are going to subordinate our sovereignty and by whose decisions we are bound.  It is absurd for the Taoiseach to mention we will be allowed to put our view, to put the case for agriculture, for retaining our tariffs for a longer period, and so on.  The position is that there is this Council of Ministers, in which France has four representatives, Germany four, Italy four and Benelux countries two each.  We will presumably get one vote, and we will be bound by the majority decision. We can put a point of view, but it is a minority point of view and must always be a minority point of view, which carries little or no weight because we are relatively unimportant for many reasons, historical and otherwise, in this matter of the Great Powers.</P>
    <P>This is a terribly serious dilemma for the Government.  I do not pretend to ignore that fact.  My charge is that it should not have arisen.  It is conceivable that it need not have arisen if our policies over the years had been different from what they are and have been.  Even if we were faced with going into the Common Market, as we are at present, there could have been a situation in which we could go into the bargaining chamber in a stronger position than we are at present.  At present, because of the weakness of our industrial arm&mdash; and in spite of what the Tánaiste asserts it is a weak industrial arm&mdash; taken in the context of the great coal and steel belt in Central Europe, 80 per cent. of our industries have 50 or fewer employees and are unimportant industries that have no hope of surviving in competition with the great monopolies and cartels of Central Europe.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been uncandid in his failure to emphasise that fact. This is not a socialist concept interested in the common welfare of <Col N="2800" /> common humanity.  It is a natural extension of capitalist accretion of wealth into a few hands.  We have seen it in our own country, where a few great, wealthy families control most of our industries while we have a mass of poor and underprivileged people.  That is going to happen in this great multilateral system in which the majority of the wealth will be centred in this central industrial belt and people on the periphery, like ourselves and Southern Italy, will find themselves either pauperised or denuded of population while their welfare will be a matter of indifference.</P>
    <P>That is one of the developments we can see in the pattern emerging and likely to be followed by ourselves. I regret very much that there is not going to be great prosperity as a result of our entry into the Common Market.  There is going to be denudation of the countryside.  We have seen this particular pattern developing in Southern Italy, with its great poverty and unemployment, from where there is now a mass emigration into Central Europe.  Some people might say that is a good thing, that at least they are going to get work. In fact, there are two points in relation to that.</P>
    <P>First, in Central Europe they are now trying to insist on having skilled workmen.  They do not want the unskilled workmen.  But assuming the worker does get navvy or coolie work, that, regrettably, is the only kind of skill our people have, because of the failure of our various Governments to develop educational opportunities for the mass of the people.  Ours is predominatly a coolie type of labour. They are not going to find employment in rural Ireland.  They may find employment, as they always have, in Birmingham, Liverpool and London, but there will also be open to them Hamburg, Turin, Paris, Milan, and the various other great cities of Europe.</P>
    <P>Is that the sort of society we want to see developing?  Was that the ambition of these men, many of them still with us, who sought to win our freedom? Would they wish to see a society in which Ireland would become some sort of a paradise for refugees of <Col N="2801" /> various kinds from Central Europe and other places&mdash;people who have made a mess of their own societies and who come here to make a mess of ours while the Irish people continue to flock out in droves as they have been doing? Even in the last four years, the four years the Tánaiste was talking about, nearly 200,000 people have had to get out.  That is the test of success or failure of Government policy.</P>
    <P>There is the pattern developing. Even if we did not go into the Common Market in 1958, one of the tests from our point of view is to watch what is already happening.  That is one of the things that is happening in relation to Southern Italy.  The other is the influx of Germans into France&mdash;a peaceful invasion on this occasion for a change&mdash;where they are buying up land in Brittany and Normandy at prices which the unfortunate French young farmers cannot afford.  We know of it here to a certain extent.  It is happening there, too.</P>
    <P>It seems to me the whole question has not been dealt with by the Taoiseach as candidly and as frankly as he suggested we should discuss this matter.  Nobody is happier or more glad than I am that the chauvinist, sectarian, bigoted nationalism must go by the board.  My only objection is that it should be going by the board in a system in which the basic dynamic is the creation of a society for the pursuit of profit and wealth.  It is essentially a capitalist interpretation in which the profit motive is the sole dynamic for any decision.</P>
    <P>This Common Market is merely an extension of what we have seen in Great Britain to a considerable extent and in America and France&mdash;the take-over, the amalgamation of many multiple firms into one great undertaking. Those on the fringe are the ones that will suffer, the ones that will go to the wall.  We see the position most dramatically in Great Britain in the newspaper world where small independent newspapers, serving their own particular function in a great society, the small provincial Press, are being taken over and amalgamated into one great newspaper organisation, and for one purpose only.  It is not to facilitate the <Col N="2802" /> giving of better news, more valuable information, or brighter newspapers.  It is merely for the purpose of increasing the profit of the newspaper magnates. That is the sole motive.  That is the dominating motive.</P>
    <P>Let nobody believe that these great magnates in coal and steel, the heads of the great cartels and monopolies in Central Europe, will keep the Irish nation as a pet.  They will not do it.  To the extent that we can supply them with technological, professional, skilled or unskilled labour, we will be of use. To the extent that we can supply a market for what they produce, we will be of use.  But they will not worry about the Brownes, or the Byrnes, or the Sherwins in rural Ireland, the smallholders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are other Sherwins besides the Deputy.  All this is bringing dishonesty to the point of absurdity.  All these platitudes about what is likely to happen, the wonderful benefits that will come, are just so many bromides by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, and by their political supporters, all of whom are trying to lead the Irish people into believing that this is a prospect which they must accept, willy nilly, and this is the prospect they are trying to sell.  The fact is they have no choice in the matter and that is the reason why they are concealing from the public the true implications of our joining the Common Market, leaving aside altogether any political implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste said he was quite happy about what will happen to Irish industry.  He told us he knew we are able now to export to a number of countries.  He mentioned Peru, the Barbadoes and South Africa.  Of course, that is merely a question of taking in one another's washing.  Peru and the Barbadoes are on about the same level as we are.  There is no great achievement in selling to a non-competitive market.  I should like to know from the Tánaiste what he thinks our chances are of selling any of our industrial products in Belgium, Western <Col N="2803" /> Germany, France, Northern Italy. There is no comparison as between selling in the Barbadoes and selling in Hamburg, Munich, Paris, and even London.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach cannot escape the fact that we have defended with great tenacity&mdash;relentless, persistent, repeated tenacity&mdash;our foothold in the British Commonwealth markets. Although we may have changed our flag we insisted, after the fashion of hardheaded shopkeepers, on retaining our trade in the British market.  We might swop the Union Jack for the Tricolour but we did not swop the British market for some other market. We kept our foothold there and we kept it because it was a protected market.  We did not go looking for competition from Denmark, Holland, or anywhere else.  In fact we resented the possibility that they might get in and give us the competition the Tánaiste says we need not fear.</P>
    <P>We have always feared competition. Every tariff and every quota is a clear indication of our fear of competition and the hypocrisy of the suggestion that we can stand up to competition is exposed by the very fact that we have not been able to dismantle our tariff system and our quota restrictions despite repeated attempts by the Taoiseach. I believe he has attempted to review tariffs and decided, in the light of his attempt, that we would be out of business in a year, perhaps in six months, if we were open to international competition at the level we will have to face in this Common Market.  The Taoiseach knows that. The Tánaiste knows that.  But that fact must be concealed from the people.  It must be concealed from the people until the general election is over.  The fact must be concealed that the possible repercussions on Great Britain will be financial catastrophe, possible bankruptcy, and certainly devaluation. That fact must be concealed, but that will be the evolution of events.  That will follow as night follows day.  That must follow here also.  We cannot face with any degree of equanimity the prospects of competition in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I should like in support of that <Col N="2804" /> argument to quote, of all people, a most conservative economist, Garrett Fitzgerald, a consistent supporter of the Government, whether by accident or design, I do not know.  Writing on 24th May of this year, he said: &ldquo;It is extremely doubtful if the scale of most of the firms in the majority of Irish industries is such as to make it possible for them to compete against big European manufacturers.&rdquo;  I do not believe anybody in his senses believes the contrary is true.  Possibly we will get a period for adjustment, a transition period.  We have already lost nearly three years of that transition period because we have left it until now to make up our minds as to whether or not we should enter the Common Market.  Many tariffs have already been reduced.</P>
    <P>As somebody said earlier, if the British, and that includes us, believe they will alter the Rome Treaty in the slightest degree in order to suit themselves, they can go to hell.  That is the truth.  I am certain of that.  I am certain there will be no fundamental alterations to suit either ourselves or Britain. The only possible alteration of the Treaty will be a prolongation of the period of adjustment for those who find themselves in difficulties.  But there is no way out of the prospect that we must face international European competition within the very near future.</P>
    <P>It has been admitted by Ministers for Industry and Commerce over the years here that we cannot face international competition in our industrial sector.  There has been a suggestion about rationalisation of industry in order to prepare ourselves for competition. Rationalisation might be possible in relation to about half a dozen old established industries, but there is no possibility of rationalisation or useful amalgamation where most of the others are concerned.  As a result of bargains between the Government and the industrialists there is very little multiplication of industry in Ireland. Most of the industries which may appear to be under different management are, in fact, controlled by the same ownership.  It is not as if one could take half a dozen flax mills or cotton mills, or other great enterprises, and merge them into one great monopoly <Col N="2805" /> or cartel to fit them to meet the competition of Europe.</P>
    <P>Because of the relatively tiny market here, because of the failure of our industrialists to go into the export market in any big way, because of the protection they have always sought for themselves by way of tariffs and quota restrictions, and restricted trade practices to protect them from even home competition, they are largely inefficient, certainly unused to competition and, because of that, completely unfitted to face the tremendous impact of the European cartels and monopolies which will inevitably face them if we go into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry gave us a lot of figures in relation to agriculture.  The Taoiseach was very honest about the possibilities for industry, on the one hand, and agriculture, on the other hand, and conceded that if anything will benefit it is more likely to be agriculture than industry.  The only trap Deputy Corry walked into &mdash;I think possibly a trap deliberately laid for him and farmers like him&mdash;was in regard to the White Paper and the figures he read out by which I myself was impressed when I heard them and which indicate the great discrepancy between our figures and the central European figures.</P>
    <P>However, there is this consideration. We must face the general principle under which the agricultural agreements will be made, that the future trading pattern will be based primarily on the old trading pattern in relation to the different countries.  That in a way is an advantage for us in so far as we shall be sure of retaining a considerable part of the British market and we need not necessarily be swamped by competitors immediately. But it also restricts our access to the other European countries, even if we were sure we could compete with France, Germany, Britain and, of course, Denmark and Holland.  There is the fact that these countries are virtually self-sufficient in agricultural produce. What is very much more likely to happen is that we will find surplus agricultural produce from these countries <Col N="2806" /> being exported to compete against our own farmers' produce because one of the first things that must go is all forms of subsidies and protection.  The market will be thrown open.  That can easily mean that our farmers will face, for the first time in their lives, cutthroat competition.  There is no guarantee at all that we will find ourselves entering into greatly increased consumer markets in Europe as a result of joining the Common Market&mdash;quite the reverse.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have praised the Taoiseach, and I am prepared to do so at any time, for his decisions over the years in regard to the establishment of State industries.  They will be there to his credit as long as the country lasts.  At the same time I have always criticised him for what I believe was a major blunder when he decided to allow private enterprise to take over the creation of the industrial arm of our country.  The State industries he established were largely of a social nature: transport, heat, light, shipping, road haulage, Bord na Móna and so on.  They were either of a social nature or required such capital investment that it was unlikely that private enterprise would be interested in them.</P>
    <P>That blunder is one for which we will now pay very dearly.  I think it was his faith in private enterprise in the '30s which has led us now into the situation where we have a multiplicity of tiny, fiddling, relatively unimportant industries which will find it virtually impossible to make any of the adjustments required to face the intensive competition which they now must face from Europe within the next ten years.  I believe the Taoiseach knows that to be true.  I believe he knows it to be true from the fact that he refused to allow them to face competition in the past, that he refused to dismantle the tariff wall.  He must realise that is the crux of the whole position, that in regard to the creation of a viable, dynamic, industrial arm he refused to put his faith in public enterprise.</P>
    <P>That was the faith of James Connolly, which many of his comrades believed, but he was betrayed in his <Col N="2807" /> belief by those who survived the Rising.  The Tánaiste who is one of the most conservative Ministers in Ireland, possibly in any country, made some most illuminating remarks.  He told us of the achievements of Irish Shipping, the wonderful achievements of Aer Rianta, of Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. and all the other great State enterprises.  I agree with him they are wonderful achievements. They are a credit to the Taoiseach but these are the only things of which we can boast.  The big test, however, for the productive investment sector of our economy is its capacity to employ our unemployed. If it is able to do that then it has succeeded.  Nobody can tell us the majority of people leave this country for any reason other than that they cannot find jobs.  Most of us want to stay in Ireland.  Private enterprise has failed to provide employment which would absorb the young boys and girls leaving school and the men and women who want to work in Ireland.</P>
    <P>That was the great blunder of the Taoiseach, that he allowed these subsidiaries of British companies, of Japanese, Swedish and Danish companies, to be established.  He gave them protection assuming they would expand and become great organisations giving employment.  Instead of that they betrayed him.  They sat down under their tariffs and under their protection.  They failed to expand to meet the need of employment created by the increasing population.  We have many subsidiaries of British industry, British industry which has now been shown to the world as one of the most incompetent and inefficient industries certainly in Europe, possibly in the world.  That industry was based on cheap, semi-slave labour in the colonies, cheap, plundered raw material in the colonies and then protected markets in the colonies.  Those three things are gone, and Britain must find her raw materials and her labour at world prices and compete in world markets with anybody that comes, and they cannot do it.</P>
    <P>Those are the principals of which <Col N="2808" /> we are the subordinates.  We are the minor partners in that decadent society.  Those are the parent industries now to which we must turn and say: &ldquo;What are you going to do about helping us to rationalise and to compete in the European Common Market?&rdquo;  Those are the industries which are fighting with their backs to the wall for their existence.  They are on the edge of bankruptcy.  They cannot help us.</P>
    <P>We are now an economic colony. We changed the physical occupation by a brave act, admittedly, a courageous act, and we swopped that for the economic colonisation of the country for which we must now suffer the indignity of waiting for Macmillan to make up our mind and decide what is going to happen to our country, to our people, to our social services, to tens of thousands of our workers, to farmers in rural Ireland, to rural Ireland, what will be the demographic changes which must follow from this tremendous decision over which we have no control whatsoever.</P>
    <P>That is the clearest point.  This day three weeks or month the Taoiseach may call this Parliament together to tell us we are not going into the Common Market because Macmillan cannot resolve his differences with the Commonwealth.  What are you going to do then?  Where will you turn?  You are going to turn where Macmillan turns or where his successor turns and if Macmillan's successor turns to East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Russia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, you are going to turn there too because you have got to; you have delivered yourself into the hands of the British political leaders.  I am not complaining of that at all.  I am merely saying you are now so completely dependent you have abrogated your right to say you are the Government in a sovereign State. That is the result of deliberate blundering policies by separate Governments in the last 40 years in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is one of the great ironies, I suppose, of political life that these people used to shout these empty, stupid slogans, &ldquo;We will twist John Bull's tail&rdquo; or &ldquo;England's difficulty is <Col N="2809" /> Ireland's opportunity,&rdquo;&ldquo;Burn everything British except their coal.&rdquo;  All that kind of thing is now changed and if the United Kingdom seek entry into the Common Market, we do so too; if John Bull does, we will too.  This is the ironical situation into which the Taoiseach and his colleagues have delivered us as a result of blundering policies in the last 35 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>I was accused of hind sight in relation to this whole question.  That is untrue.  As long ago as 1957 I wrote on this question of the Common Market in the <i>London Tribune</i> and pointed out that our industries at that stage were unprepared for the prospect of the Common Market.  It was clear to me as an individual citizen with relatively little information.  It must have been clear to the Taoiseach; it must have been clear to the members of the Government.  They must have been advised that this was an inevitable development.  Instead of going into the Common Market, they joined E.F.T.A.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>It is quite clear that we have, as somebody said, come to the end of a political era, which is a great thing.  It is quite clear there is a great conservative organisation in this country composed of the two major political Parties.  It is quite clear that inevitable historical development must bring them together and it is quite clear also that we who are socialists, who believe in socialism, must now begin to prepare to take over to try to create a viable economy in Ireland, a socially just society, on the general principles as laid down by Connolly.  First of all, I do not accept this worker-sharing business referred to by Deputy Russell.  I believe the worker has a right to the total product of his work either directly in wages or indirectly in the form of social <Col N="2810" /> services of one kind or another. Secondly, I believe the only way in which we can get out of our present mess will be by the establishment of publicly-owned industry in all sectors of the economy, where the public invest its money, where there is public control of that invested money in industries and where the public is in a position to plan the disposition of that money to the best interests of the welfare of the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the idea of the family industry.  The purpose of a family industry is merely to make more wealthy that family or that small group of families leaving aside the welfare and the best interests of the mass of the people as a whole.  That is the position which has developed in this country but, in order to control the direction of the spending, in order to plan the type of industry we want and in order to control it so that it will operate in the best interests of the mass of the people it can only be done under public direction.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste made the best case for public ownership here tonight in his many absolutely accurate assessments and appraisals of the many State industries which we have but all around us we can see that there is a collapse in Great Britain, the collapse of the system, the capitalist system, and that unless we take very drastic steps now&mdash;I believe it is so late that there is very little we can do&mdash;we will collapse with the collapse of the British system.</P>
      <P>I believe the Taoiseach was right when he said we had no alternative but to enter into the Common Market. Whether it is a good thing or not, it is largely his fault that we have no alternative.  He is one of the guilty men who have led us into what I believe to be effectively a trap which will have very serious and damaging repercussions on every aspect of the life of our country, the depopulation of rural Ireland, the mass closing down of our industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In holding out a glittering prospect of the opportunities opening up to us, the Taoiseach was the first to break <Col N="2811" /> his own undertaking to this House and to the country that he would deal in a candid, in an honest and in a fair way with the problems which are presented to the country by the prospect of going into the Common Market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most exhilarating moments of the entire debate today came during the speech of the Minister for Transport and Power when he in this House publicly apologised both to us on this side of the House and to the country generally for the former Fianna Fáil policy of thanking God for the departure of the British market from this country.  He admitted that was a mistake and that the Fianna Fáil Party has at last discovered that the fundamental market from our point of view is that of our best customer and nearest neighbour.  The only further thing I want to say on that matter is that the Minister's apology, given quite shyly, was not quite frank because he indicated that the statement of this policy came from some Deputy of the Party and he suggested that it was made by some fellow up in the back benches who decided that it might enliven an otherwise dull debate, whereas he knew, I knew and every Deputy in the House knew that that remark was made not by a back bencher but by a gentleman whose lustre shed itself all over the Fianna Fáil Party and helped to bring them back year after year as the Government Party.</P>
      <P>We are glad to see that even at this late stage we can expect from the Fianna Fáil Party something of the policy we on those benches have adumbrated down the years and I am happy to feel that the gap between our side of the House and theirs is becoming less.  That is because the Fianna Fáil Party are accepting more and more every day, the policy which has been part of our platform throughout the years.  I hope this will not become just another sudden discovery of Fianna Fáil.  I hope Fianna Fáil will not represent it so at the coming general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several matters which, <Col N="2812" /> though important, are not of such an exotic nature as some of the points made in this debate.  On the 2nd November, 1960, I put to the Minister for Finance a question relating to statutory instruments.  He told me some 4,200 statutory instruments had been passed by the Oireachtas in the ten years from 1948 to 1958.  We must not forget that matters of that nature are very important because a statutory instrument can, by reason of its provisions, put a man out of business or affect his life in very serious ways, and those of us who practise the law know it is increasingly difficult not alone for the ordinary citizen but for the fully qualified lawyer to find out where the rights of the citizen lie and how far they are affected by these instruments.</P>
    <P>It is therefore most important that there should be a handy reference to these statutory instruments and the Minister for Finance assured me in 1960 that this index for statutory instruments would be ready by the first half of 1961.  As far as I know, it is not ready yet and I would ask the Taoiseach to see that this document is prepared as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We in this House must reflect the minds and the hearts of the people who sent us here.  We hold sacred certain freedoms&mdash;freedom of political thought, freedom of discussion and freedom of religion.  We have suffered as a race from lack of those freedoms, imposed by those who tried to destroy them, and when we were suffering in that regard we derived consolation and courage from the countries who assisted us, both morally and otherwise, in our struggles.  It is therefore shocking to me to find that we, the Irish people, are in many ways assisting the Soviet Union and the Communist Party generally by importing goods not only from the Soviet Union itself but from its Satellite States in Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Two years ago I asked a question here regarding our imports from countries behind the Iron Curtain.  It is reported at column 966 to 970 of Volume 178 of the Official Report.  On the 11th April, 1961, I asked a similar question in relation to our <Col N="2813" /> imports from the Iron Curtain countries during the year ended October 31st, 1960.  It is reported at columns 3 to 10 of Volume 188.  Further unsolicited figures in the same regard in respect of the period from January to April, 1961 are to be found in the Report of the Central Statistics Office. I was disturbed by the answers received because when you compare the 1960 figures with those of 1961 an unpleasant pattern is unfolded.  I am still more disturbed however by the pattern unfolded for the period January to April of this year.</P>
    <P>The figures in regard to imports from the Soviet Union in the year ending 31st October, 1959, show that we imported goods to the value of more than £268,000.  It means that we are giving succour to the Soviet Union.  In the following year we find that we took £625,555 worth and for the four months from January to April of this year, we took £460,796 worth.  If our trade with the Soviet Union for this year continues on the same basis as for the first four months, we will have taken over £1,800,000 by the end of the year representing a five fold increase in our trade with the Soviet Union over a period of two years. I am not suggesting that this is official Government policy but I think the Government should investigate the matter and assure the people that it is not official Government policy and that we, the Irish race, will not encourage the twisted economy of the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>Similarly for Communist dominated Poland.  The figures of our imports from Poland in the year ending 31st October, 1959, were £739,833; in 1960 the figure was £697,048 and from January to April of this year it was £725,323.  If our trade with Poland continues on this basis, we will have imported £2,176,000 by the end of the year showing a three-fold increase in the two year period.  In regard to Eastern Germany, the import figures are: 1959, £433,195; 1960, £505,176 and from January to April this year, £302,545 &mdash; meaning that if we continue on that basis we will have imported from East Germany £900,000 worth of goods by the end of this year, a two-fold increase.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2814" /> In 1960 we, in this Christian country, imported from the heart of Communist dominated Czechoslovakia one cwt. of religious objects.  We brought them into this country and evidently they were sold here.  These were objects prepared by impious hands and sent here by cynical exporters for profit.</P>

      <P>There is a principle involved in the matter and I think that if we are going to succour the economic policy of the Government of Poland at the moment we are not assisting what the Deputy describes as the ordinary folk.  We can assist the ordinary folk in Poland by helping to bring about the downfall of the regime under which they suffer at present.  We are not doing that by suffering their trade.</P>

    <P>In 1960 we took about £10,000 of imitation jewellery, if you please, from the same source.  I ask the Government to investigate this.  Who are the persons importing these things?  Are they Irishmen?  Are they citizens?  When did they come?  How long are they here? What stake have they in the country? Why are they operating here?  Why was it necessary to buy £15,000 worth of shirting, dress cloth, gauze, <Col N="2815" /> muslin and handkerchiefs from the same source?  We could have got them in more friendly markets nearer home in countries where we would not be encouraging the type of Government I have already referred to.</P>
    <P>Who was the anonymous gentleman who in 1960 purchased from East Germany 4,600 dozen pairs of nylons and other ladies stockings?  They cost him £3,744, which meant that he got his nylons at 1/5d. per pair.</P>

      <P>In point of time I am years ahead of most of the speakers who spoke already.  It is my duty, and I think I should be allowed to point out to the Taoiseach that certain persons in this country are importing such things.  As a Deputy for Cork where we ourselves can manufacture all the nylons necessary, I think it is only right to point out that we resent the importation of nylons from behind the Iron Curtain, apart from the fact that we appear to be selling our souls for 1/5d. nylons.</P>
      <P>I asked a question to-day in regard to the visit of a British naval flotilla to Glengarriff and I am asking the Taoiseach now to clear up a matter about which there appears to be a misunderstanding between this Government and the British Embassy.  I can assure the Taoiseach that the British Embassy published a statement saying that the Irish Government had refused facilities for a regatta at Glengarriff. One would not expect the British Embassy to make an untrue statement.  On the other hand we have a solemn assurance from the Minister for External Affairs that permission was never sought for this regatta.  It would be in the interests of relations between the two countries that what is obviously a misunderstanding should be cleared up at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to express regret at the trend making itself so obvious in this House, and the results which have made themselves obvious recently, of our divesting ourselves not alone of our powers but also of our duties.  The results <Col N="2816" /> were tragically obvious yesterday when certain allegations, which I believe to be fully justified, were made about the type of recruiting being done for the Irish Television Service at present and when we were told by the responsible Minister that he can do nothing about it.  I do not blame the Government for that.  I think every Party is involved. We found ourselves in the same position in regard to the closing down of branch railways.  We are here to govern, to deal with the problems of the country and we must be fundamentally responsible for them.  I wish to decry the growing practice of passing over, not alone our rights but our duties and our powers to outside bodies over which we then have no control.</P>

      <P>As there are other Deputies who wish to speak I shall guarantee not to delay the House.  Yesterday the Taoiseach made a statement that was very important to the people when he said that probably this Dáil would never assemble again and that we are to have a general election.  Going through the country, as I do, I find that probability very welcome because, after four years of the present Government, considering what they said they would do and did not do, what they said they would not do and did, the people are glad to have the opportunity of letting the Government know their views.  I was delighted that the Taoiseach made that statement.</P>
      <P>I must deal with one matter to which I think there has been no reference so far.  Questions have been put down to the Minister for Lands and some to the Taoiseach regarding the number of foreigners buying land in this country. Listening to the replies given by the Minister for Lands, I wonder what he or the Government are trying to hide. We have heard him say very little land is sold, that it was snipe land, land of no use and that it was a good job somebody was coming in to buy it whether they were Jews, Japs or Germans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2817" /> The Minister and the Taoiseach know that is not true.  The Minister for Lands and Deputy S. Flanagan and others in Fianna Fáil actually say that rural organisations are not entitled to protest on this matter.  Deputy S. Flanagan says he would not attend a protest meeting but I want to tell the Taoiseach and the Minister that they cannot hide anything from those rural organisations.  I want to remind them of places where this terribly bad land was bought and the amount of it.  I have a list here which shows that in County Wicklow, at Enniskerry, 180 acres were purchased.  In the same county in a place called Valleymount 100 acres were purchased within the last 12 months.  In a place called Tinahely 100 acres of land were purchased; in Portarlington 100 acres; in Carrig, County Wexford 100 acres; Kilmore 100 acres; Blackwater, 200 acres; Bree, 160 acres; Tullow, County Carlow, 200 acres; Inistioge, County Kilkenny, 200 acres; Moyvalley, 250 acres; Edenderry, 1,600 acres; Knockdrin, 1,600 acres; Athy, 500 acres; Naas, 160 acres; Straffan, 200 acres, and another farm in Straffan of 150 acres; Culmullen, 250 acres; Kells 200 acres; Athboy 500 acres&mdash;I do not want to delay the House.  That is the land the Minister for Lands tells us is snipe land.</P>
    <P>You have in Deputy Killilea's constituency and my own constituency in Galway 16,561 farmers trying to exist on less than 30 acres of land.  In the past 12 months thousands of acres of the best land in Ireland, as I have just read out, has been sold to those foreigners. I want to put it to the Taoiseach that that is a matter which, if this Government does not deal with it, I hope the Government we will have in 6 or 8 weeks will.  When I am in this House no matter which side of the House I am on, no matter what Government is in power&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be sure of getting back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am full sure I will get back.  Deputy Killilea knows I have the safest seat in this House.  I do not know whether Deputy Killilea <Col N="2818" /> expresses Government policy.  Personally, I do not think he does.  I do not know if the Taoiseach noted what he said.  Speaking on Wednesday, July 19th, Vol. 191, as reported at col. 1357 Deputy Killilea said: &ldquo;I am interested only in who is going to pay the biggest price and I will say &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; to the buyer whether he is a Spaniard, a German, a Frenchman or from any other place.&rdquo;  I wonder was Deputy Killilea expressing Government policy on that?  Is it the policy of the Taoiseach and his Government that no matter who they are or where they come from, they will be allowed in here to buy the best land in this country while the tenant farmers are running out of this country?</P>
      <P>I wonder does the Taoiseach realise that over the past 4 years over 200,000 of our people have left this country?  Deputy Kitt told the people about the plans this Government has and what our exports are.  Our chief exports are our own flesh and blood, our own people.  This Government and the Taoiseach have nothing in the world to boast about.  I have spoken about the promises they made and did not carry out.  Now I must talk about a promise they did not make, but that they carried out, that caused all this trouble.  The export of our people and the export of the tenant farmer started when they raised the price of the loaf of bread and the bag of flour.  That was the cause of all the trouble.  The Taoiseach on another day speaking at Belmullet during the last election said &ldquo;They are saying we will abolish the subsidies but we never did what they said we would do.&rdquo;  The result was the subsidies on food were abolished and the tenant farmer had got to go.  Also, his family had got to go.  In many cases the father and mother went as well and the home was closed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a famous character called Lord Lucan.  Some Deputies in this House would know who he was.  He made one statement, referring to the tenant farmers of this country in which he said: &ldquo;Let them go, they are uneconomic.&rdquo; I wonder does the Taoiseach intend to repeat that?  Is the Taoiseach's view: &ldquo;Let them go; break up those small farms again and put them into big ranches as Khrushchev <Col N="2819" /> or Stalin did in Russia&rdquo;?  I could hardly believe it is, but certainly I put it to him that he is doing nothing to stop it.  As I said at the start no matter what Government is here, while I am in this House&mdash;and I will be longer in it than some of the Deputies on the other side would wish&mdash; I will keep up a continuous campaign so that that class of people will be prevented from coming in here and depriving our own people of land.  The land of this country belongs to the people of this country.  In the great days of Sinn Féin long ago that is what was stated; that is what we feel and that is what we thought then.</P>
    <P>I am afraid we were making a mistake because in the last 12 months in this House we had the Minister for Lands saying that this thing was not happening.  He has a better opportunity of finding it out than I have. This list is here and if the Taoiseach wants it he is welcome to it.  I am sure he will agree that it is a disgrace that over 10,000 acres of land have been bought by these foreigners over the past 12 months.  While he is still in power I would ask him to do something within the next week or 10 days to prevent that happening here.  I advise him not to give any heed to Deputy Killilea&mdash;indeed I am sure he does not&mdash;when he says: &ldquo;I will shake the hand of the one who gives me the best price and I do not give a damn whether he comes from Spain or France.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>They were like speeches from the dock; and, of course, that is what they are.  This is the last meeting of this Dáil and we are all on trial.  It is the practice of <Col N="2820" /> Parties to indulge in battles over statistics.  Although it may be true that statistics do not lie, politicians make them lie.  Each statistic seems to be different, depending on whatever side you are.  It is easy to make a case using statistics.  If you see something that suits you, you adopt it; if not, you leave it to one side.</P>
      <P>I shall deal with self-evident matters and not with such generalisations as statistics.  I noted a few points in the Taoiseach's speech.  He said he hoped the election would be an example of democracy in Ireland.  That brings me back a few years to when, in fact, he tried to change our form of democracy by trying to do away with P.R. and having the straight vote system. In trying to do that he was trying to deprive the people of democracy inasmuch as he was trying to make it impossible for anyone to become elected to this House except he was a member of one of the two big parties. Whether he likes it or not, P.R. at least allows a certain number of people to maintain their independence and come in here and speak their minds.</P>
      <P>If individuals who are independent by nature had to join Parties, they would be muzzled.  At least, as individuals we can speak our minds, we do not have to worry whom we hurt and we do not have to cover up for any one.  Our mission here is to see that at least some truth is told amongst all the lies.  We serve the same purpose as an independent newspaper.  Tied newspapers cannot tell the truth all the time.  They must cover up.  Independent papers have nothing to gain by hiding the truth.  In fact, they gain by telling the truth.  We in our way serve that purpose&mdash;maybe not in any massive way but in a small way.  Anyway, a little truth is more important than a bundle of lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Common Market seems to be the main feature of this Debate.  I am no authority on it, but I know lots of others are no authorities either.  I read and think as much as any man. In my opinion, we have no choice but to do what Britain does.  I have listened to the criticisms of the Fianna Fáil Party.  My attitude towards the <Col N="2821" /> Fianna Fáil Party is this.  They have the power, they have the &ldquo;bees and honey.&rdquo;  Because they have that, I criticise them.  There is no point in criticising the Opposition.  There would be no point in a &ldquo;bald&rdquo; man going into a pub and looking for a pint from another &ldquo;bald&rdquo; man.  He would look for it from the man with the money.  If there were a change of Government, I would have the same attitude towards the new Government. I do not want to be taken as anti-Fianna Fáil or pro-anything else.  I am an independent, and for the purposes of the last two years I have been anti-Government.  They are the people who have the &ldquo;bees and honey.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have always supported Fianna Fáil's industrial policy.  Whatever people say about the future, I believe they were right in trying to develop industry.  Even if many of them go to the wall, some of them will survive because of the experience of the past few years.  There is no point in saying we should have developed agriculture instead.  Your plan of battle depends on information and events.  I do not know what the future holds, but we must enter the Common Market if Britain enters.  There is no real evidence she will enter.  She is applying for membership merely to see what the conditions will be.  She may not join at all.  We, of course, to make certain we have a finger in the pie, are trailing behind.  If Britain backs out, we will back out.</P>
    <P>We are dependent on the large British market beside us.  I hope Britain will not fall flat.  Although I am a Republican, I wish Britain the best of luck, because her luck will be ours.  I hope everything works out for the best.  To start talking about the crisis we are going to face does not serve any purpose.  It would be wrong for the Government, however, to paint a rosy picture of what is going to happen and make this Common Market a sort of Persian market.  The Government should not try to capitalise on the great prospects for the country.  They should stay clear of that in the election.  I am only too well aware that the main purpose of parties <Col N="2822" /> and, I suppose, individuals is to deceive people.  That is the art of politics.</P>
    <P>I read only yesterday the Fianna Fáil literature for the last general election.  Part of the policy put forward by the Dublin branch was that if they were returned to power, differential rents would be reduced to one ninth.  But since they got into office they have never opened their mouths about it.  That is deception.  They could not do it anyway, but they said they would do it.  A month after I was elected I made a public statement in the papers that it could not be done, and I have stuck to that.  I have made opponents for myself because the chumps like what they can get and not what they will not get.  I have always spoken the truth.  Again, that justifies independence in public life.  This is really a canter for the elections.</P>
    <P>With regard to employment, my mind flashes back to 1932.  I remember the former Fianna Fáil Taoiseach stating on the eve of that election that this country should employ, and be able to provide for, 20,000,000 people. He probably thought then that what he said was true. Then we had the statement that there would be 100,000 new jobs.  I do not really know whether the Taoiseach really thought that, or whether it was just another &ldquo;phoney.&rdquo; I am against that kind of propaganda. Practically 1,000,000 people have left this country since the inception of this State.  During the past four years it has been bragged here that employment in Dublin is around the 180,000 mark. To my knowledge, it was 120,000 a few years ago.  That was not due to any productive policy on the part of the Government.  The fact that there are not more in employment means that more people have left the country.</P>
    <P>I hold the Government responsible for misleading the people into believing that the Government would do what they did not do.  I hold them largely responsible for the plight of our people in Britain, our people who are living in hovels in slums, and under conditions that are bound to affect the morals of many.  We must accept some responsibility for them.  We sent <Col N="2823" /> them there.  We also must accept responsibility for the fact that there are approximately 20,000 husbands in Britain today.  In the Constitution we brag about the sanctity of the home, and all we do is to divide the home. But we promised that the opposite would be the case.</P>
    <P>With regard to social welfare, I listened here tonight to the Tánaiste. He makes a good speech.  It is a pity we have not got television here. He spoke about the great benefits and the increases that have been given. The increase in the contributory pension scheme was paid by the people themselves, and the Tánaiste must not brag about what other people pay for as if some credit was due to him.  All he can brag about is the 1/6d. he gave to the non-contributory pensioners.  In the past year we had a Rent Restrictions Bill in this house.  Under that piece of legislation every landlord was given the right to raise rents by 12½ per cent., irrespective of whether or not he carried out repairs.  That does away with the 1/6d. increase immediately. What has the Minister to brag about in relation to social benefits?  An old age pensioner gets 30/- but, if he earns a few quid, he gets nothing. What is there to brag about?  A woman came to me last week.  She had a job and she got £5 per week in that job.  Because she was in receipt of that £5 her husband received nothing by way of pension.  Recently she lost her job.  Now the husband will get a pension but, because the wife earned £5 a week for the first six months, that is taken into consideration and the husband will not be given the full 28/6d.  What sort of policy is that?  Was she supposed to save something from her miserable fiver?</P>
    <P>On the question of Partition, I am not at all satisfied with the position.  I raised this matter last year.  I am not irresponsible.  I am not the sort of fellow who believes we should march to the North.  I know we would not have a ghost's chance of marching in one yard, but I do say that we should never give up the right to march in. <Col N="2824" /> That is my point.  I think the Taoiseach has done very little to bring about harmony among the various national groups.  His policy seems to be: &ldquo;We are the national Party.  We will do it and, if we do not do it, it is none of your business.&rdquo;  Taking the country as a whole, the Taoiseach represents only 30 to 40 per cent. of the people.  Taking the Twenty-Six Counties he represents little more than half of the people.  I blame him because he has not tried to lead these young people. He has not tried to advise them.  Had he done so, there would have been no trouble on the Border.  These young fellows may be irresponsible, but they are honest.  They are as honest as we were when we were young.  We should try to harness their goodwill and not lecture them or snub them.</P>
    <P>I have raised some matters here in the last four years and no attention whatever has been paid to them.  The Taoiseach said that they would engage in law reform.  Will the Taoiseach justify to the House why local authorities should have such dictatorial powers under the Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1851?  If a tenant defaults in the payment of rent to the local authority, the local authority can bring that tenant into court and, as the law stands, the court must give an order.  What sort of justice is that? There is no option.  There is no appeal. This injustice will in years to come probably affect at least two-thirds of the population.  That is something into which the Taoiseach should get his teeth.  A court should have the right to decide whether or not an order will be made.  As it stands, there is no option.  There is need for law reform there.</P>
    <P>Again, the State can bring a charge against an individual.  That man proves his innocence.  He is put to all sorts of expense.  He suffers all sorts of loss and inconvenience.  Not alone does he suffer the indignity, but he must bear the cost of proving his innocence. That is another direction in which there is grave need for law reform. Such a man should get his costs from the State.  Indeed, he should get compensation from the State.  In an ordinary civil action, the victor gets his costs.  When it is the State, the unfortunate <Col N="2825" /> individual gets nothing.  He can go bankrupt proving his innocence and he will not get a halfpenny from the State.</P>
    <P>I do not have to make my case here for next October.  I make it in my daily work.  I am a wholetime member of this House.  I am not like others who hop in now and again and hop out just as quickly to make their money in their businesses.  The Government has not a whole lot to brag about.  It is the policy to give no one else any credit. Everybody has something to his credit and something to his discredit also. The Government cannot brag about the state of the country when we remember the masses of our people living in hovels, ten to a room, in Britain, and their children running wild.  The Government must accept responsibility for that.  They must accept responsibility for the low scale of benefits available under the so-called social services.  They must accept responsibility for denying benefit on the feeble excuse that people are not looking for work.</P>
    <P>Sending people to Britain was a sort of Gestapo practice, thus making this State a little more prosperous, having fewer mouths to feed.  The Chinese did that; they gave away their children, and negroes used to eat their parents. People are sent off to England and then we have an artificial prosperity which will ultimately weaken the State.  The State is weak in many respects due to this artificial prosperity.</P>

      <P>The unfortunate thing is that some Deputies would wish to have things both ways.  They would wish to give everything but nothing should be taken in order to provide it.  That is all I have to say on this motion except to tell Deputies opposite, who have assured us of their intention to occupy these benches after the general election that they are vastly mistaken.  If they knew the people of the country as the Deputies on these benches know them they would realise that they are living in a fool's paradise. I have no doubt in my mind that the people generally recognise the Leader of this Party as a statesman who is to be trusted, who has in the past given tremendous benefits to the Irish people, and who will in the next five years do much more to increase the prosperity which Deputy Sherwin says is artificial prosperity but which nevertheless is prosperity.  Our wish is that the prosperity should be increased whether it has the label Deputy Sherwin gives it or not.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach in his address last night appealed to candidates in the coming election to combine to give the world a fine example of Irish democracy.  I would that his colleagues in the benches behind him or beside him would heed that injunction.  I am one hundred per cent. with him; if there is apathy, disillusionment and cynicism today it is because of the actions of political Parties.  As soon as the coming election campaign begins we shall have the same smear, the same vilification, the same intemperate and extravagant language as before.  The results afterwards are sufficient to kill any national feeling that exists in our people.  It should be borne in mind that the young people of today particularly the intellectuals, those who <Col N="2828" /> have been in secondary and vocational schools and many of our university graduates are very disillusioned. They feel they are the people who have to face the emigrant ship.  They go away with poisoned minds blaming the Governments over the years because they are forced to leave, having had a liberal education here, to seek their living abroad.</P>
      <P>I have met intellectuals in the past few months who have surprised me with the intimate knowledge they have shown in regard to the policy of all our Governments over the years.  They could very well become a danger to this country if they happened to get together in order to wedge apart the two main political parties in an effort to get control of the country.  There is cynicism largely brought about because there is no national objective today.  It is a question of one Party versus another seeking votes in the coming election.  It is a choice between two Parties with more or less the same economic approach to the problems that face this country.  Therefore there is no reason why there should be any heat displayed and no reason why this election would not be conducted on the plane on which the Taoiseach spoke last night.  His address was well thought out and moderate, perhaps subtle in parts whenever he wanted to convey a point with a political veneer on it. Nevertheless I would hope his own Party would accede to the request he made and that the other members of the House will follow on the same line so that we shall have decency in Irish public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dislike very much going into personalities but when Deputy Corry was speaking here this evening he mentioned the names of two people who have never been here but who have been selected as candidates for East Cork.  He mentioned those two names in conjunction with that of Deputy Barry who was not here at the time.  It is disgraceful and contemptible that he should produce a card that these men had issued and, just because the words &ldquo;Fine Gael&rdquo; were not on the card, try to make political capital out of it. In inscrupulousness and vilification it is very difficult to find Deputy Corry's peer.  He attacked the Leader of the <Col N="2829" /> Opposition in a very personal way.  He said he was not worth so many pence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Opposition, is the greatest democrat in this House, certainly the greatest Parliamentarian, certainly the greatest observer of political procedure.  Time and again I have seen him help the Chair on difficult points.  Very few can point back, as he can, to two generations who gave magnificent service to the struggling Irish to hold on to their homes.  Let us have a sense of decency at least in that respect.  Deputy Dillon is very well able to defend himself and it is, perhaps, hardihood on my part to mention this.</P>
    <P>We must remember also that national appeal is waning and many of the men in the opposite benches or on these benches, if they come back after the next election, will hardly seek election in the election after that. Before they leave this House they should ensure that the Parliament they are leaving behind them is safe-guarded in every detail for those who will come afterwards.  The men of 1922 or of 1932 who came into this House did not ambition to be here. They came in because they took part in a revolution, because they were the natural choice, nearest to the people at that time.  They had no political ambition. I doubt if ever again we will have a Parliament composed of men equal to them in outlook, objective and national sentiment or of men as great, as noble and as patriotic as these men were.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the Report of the Committee on Electoral Law. This Committee has given a good deal of time, thought and attention to this very delicate question.  I am glad they did not adopt the proposal for compulsory voting.  That would be disastrous. The secret vote is the very basis of our democracy and should be guarded and respected.  Is it respected on election days when one sees transport bearing political labels provided for voters?  Can we say honestly and conscientiously that that is a secret vote? I have heard men outside a polling booth say at the end of polling day that such a candidate got so many votes and such another got so many <Col N="2830" /> votes.  Is that the way to conduct an election?</P>
    <P>I make the suggestion to the Committee on Electoral Law that they should consider the proposition that nobody should be allowed to stay outside the polling booth on an election day.  Neither should there be allowed transport carrying labels or banners of the Parties or individual candidates for whom that transport is used.  It is an abridgement of the principle of the secret ballot and should not be allowed. We should have grown up after 40 years and should realise that the secret vote is a most fundamental and most democratic right which under no circumstances should be abused, as it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>I know people in past years who were afraid to come out to vote.  They were afraid to pass the army of agents around the gate accosting persons going in to vote and almost compelling them to vote for this person or that person.  That is all wrong.  We should be very careful in that respect in case we take it too far because in some countries where there are dictators today they are there because democracy failed and democracy failed because it was abused.  Let us cherish what we have got and try to restore confidence in our young people who are disillusioned and disappointed and who feel very seriously about the position and their future circumstances if they remain in this country.</P>
    <P>The tendency in recent years is for Governments to delegate power to independent bodies.  That is very evident.  There are the E.S.B., C.I.E. and Irish Shipping and other bodies established in recent years, specialist bodies like An Bord Gráin, An Bord Bainne and Bord na Muc.  If that tendency persists I cannot see why we should have a Ministerial Cabinet of the dimensions of the present one.  In the early days of this State there were eight Ministers in the Government. That was at a time when these men had a difficult situation to face, when we had no Civil Service operating as we have it today.  It was a time when Departments had to be built up, when men were completely inexperienced. Now we have a Civil Service, in which <Col N="2831" /> there are experts who are equal to any in the whole world, to advise at all times.  Where is the necessity for having a Ministry of that dimension? I cannot see it.  That is one reform which should be made.  The money that goes to pay the extra Ministers could be devoted to some more laudable and essential purpose.  We should try to reduce the cost of administration which is out of proportion to our limited circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is the question of State cars. In the early days there were no State cars.  Not until the assassination of the late Kevin O'Higgins, beannacht Dé le n-a anam, was a State car used.  I cannot see why Ministers, young men, could not drive their own cars.  I do not mind what they get in the way of an allowance to operate the cars or to provide drivers.  The provision of a State car creates a false impression and a false conception. It makes people very cynical when they see Ministers of State driving around at the taxpayers' expense.  It is altogether wrong, especially when there is so much poverty amongst us.</P>
    <P>There is the tendency for Ministers to avail of every opportunity to attend functions.  I do not blame Ministers.  They are invited to these functions.  Ministers should devote their full time to their respective offices.  It would seem that there cannot be a ceremony in connection with a new housing scheme, or new bridge, school or Garda Barracks without a Minister being present.  It is all wrong.  Surely some local citizen could preside as efficiently, without putting the Minister to the inconvenience and cost of travelling from Dublin?  I do not think it is fair to Ministers.  I am not blaming them for that.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the number of Deputies could be drastically reduced. I have said this before.  It is appalling at times to see the sparse attendance in this House.  If a record were taken, the average hourly attendance would not reach 20 in a Dáil comprised of 147 Deputies.  Large bodies move slowly and are unwieldy and certainly the number of Deputies could be very drastically reduced if we had the will to do it.  I do hope the Taoiseach will <Col N="2832" /> get down to fundamental facts and, if he returns to office, will try to make the necessary reduction.</P>
    <P>I regret the fact that in the next Parliament Dublin will have almost 25 per cent. of the Deputies.  That is out of proportion to the rest of the country and is not fair.  The argument has been made that a vote should have the same power in any set of circumstances.  There is something in that.  Consider the convenience Dublin Deputies have.  They do not have to leave home to attend Parliament.  It is as easy for a Dublin Deputy to represent 30,000 as it is for a rural Deputy to represent 10,000 in Connemara.  The disproportion is too great and should be remedied.  It can only be remedied by amendment of the Constitution. Somebody ought to tackle that problem in the near future.</P>
    <P>This Government have lived almost their full life and have had an unchallengeable majority and every opportunity of putting their programmes into operation.  I believe all Governments should as far as possible implement the programmes which they put before the people, but I agree it is not fair to charge one Government with the difficulties which can arise in any one year, as happened in 1956-57 with the last inter-Party Government. The same difficulties can arise again. They have begun to arise already in Great Britain.  The very same circumstances have compelled the British Government to take similar austere measures in the past few days to safeguard their economy.  Let Governments here beware; there is no safeguard against such events.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Russell very wisely pointed out, it was therefore very wrong to select 1956 as a year for comparison.  Surely some appreciation should have been had for the difficulties of that year.  The present Government were lucky in that outside circumstances were favourable in the past four years.  They were anything but favourable in the two last years of the inter-Party Government&mdash;1956 and 1957.  Then we were selling our goods abroad in a falling market and buying our imports in a rising one.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke of unemployment. Certainly unemployment has <Col N="2833" /> gone down and it is very pleasant to read the figures, decreasing as they are week after week.  Of course it is impossible for us just now to give an accurate gauging of the situation until the new census figures are available at the end of this month.  We are also awaiting the emigration figures in the same form of statistics.  I am afraid emigration is still a very live problem throughout the country despite the fact that thousands who have left would give their very lives to get back here &mdash;I have at least a half dozen cases in mind where boys and girls left of necessity and are pining to come home again to anything approaching decent living conditions.</P>
    <P>While on the point of emigration, there is a great deal to be said for the suggestion made during this debate that Church and State should get together to try to hold in units and groups our people who have gone abroad.  I was talking to a priest recently who had for years ministered in London.  He told me the most harrowing tales of Irish emigrants who had forgotten the Irish way of living, who had given up their religion and who could easily be won back were there a liaison between State and Church to look after those of our people living in the big cities in Britain.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has been mentioned during this debate and I doubt if the position is as rosy as was suggested by many Deputies from the Government benches.  Our farmers, after the severe hardships of last year, have great commitments to meet.  The old system of farming does not hold good any more.  Now there is the capital outlay on farm machinery, and what happens when replacements are needed?  The machines cost thousands of pounds for a start but how is the capital to become available for replacements?  This is where the old co-operative swopping system would be invaluable and I think the Government should do everything possible to foster its reintroduction. The trouble is that small farmers have lost confidence because of the hard deal they have been having during the past decade or so.  Credit has been easily available to them and they have availed of it, but what happened <Col N="2834" /> when the disastrous harvests came along?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the flight from the land will continue so long as industry is so comparatively attractive. In the past few weeks, within no less than six miles of Cork, a farmer who used to employ up to four or five men told me he had advertised week after week for a second and a third man. There were no replies at all, though the terms he offered were outstandingly attractive.  It is a sad outlook for those who deplore the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said here about the desirability and otherwise of our joining the Common Market.  It has been pointed out that many of those who originated the idea of a European Economic Community were actuated by politics.  In our proposed application for membership we must be fully aware of all those implications.  I should like, now, to refer to the present wave of crime and delinquency in the country.  Here again, a spirit of co-operation is needed.  If the people do not help the Garda I am afraid the situation will become worse.  This is something we have imbibed from abroad, but it is something we shall get rid of if our people work together to help our organised police forces.  We have lost sight of our moral obligations and I think that if the Government does not give a lead in that respect and make an effort to use the instruments of the law to cut out these petty larcenies, thefts of all kinds, then it will be dangerous for the future of our society.</P>

      <P>I suppose it was to have been expected that Opposition Deputies in this final debate, commenting upon the Government's operations during its term of office, would concentrate on the sectors in which our achievements were less than we hoped and seek to disparage generally the Government's accomplishments. I do not complain of that even if they have considerably distorted the picture.  I suppose that is the stuff of Party politics as they understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, as we were frequently reminded during the discussion today and yesterday, that the Government had to take drastic measures in its first Budget in 1957 to remedy a critical financial situation which we had inherited from our predecessors. It is true that these measures included <Col N="2837" /> increasing a number of taxes and withdrawing food subsidies then in operation.  I think, however, that the public understood or came in time to understand, the need for that action and have recognised that because of the management of the public finances of this country in the intervening period, because, indeed, of the very measures taken in 1957 no subsequent problem of that kind has arisen and, indeed, it has been found possible for us in the last two Budgets to arrange for not inconsiderable reductions in tax rates.</P>
    <P>Whatever views may be held about that, I want to say, on the occasion of this final meeting of the Dáil, that if it should be that there is a change of Government as a result of the general election, the incoming Government will find the finances of this country in a healthy state.  They will, in that respect, inherit the same situation from us as the Coalition Governments inherited in 1948 and 1954.  I will guarantee to them that if there is change of Government there is no deficit of £10 million left to be covered.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies opposite not know that is why the previous Government, without being defeated in the Dáil, without any preliminary notice, without telling their own Party members, dissolved the Dáil rather than face that problem?</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that at the end of this term of office we have still with us this major national problem of a declining population.  We expect the census returns will show that since the previous census in April, 1956 a decline in population of approximately three per cent. will have occurred due to the persistence of a high level of emigration.  I think Deputies might have taken note, if they wanted to be fair and objective in their examination of this problem, of the significance of the substantial reduction in emigration recorded in this year.  That reduction proves that the economic measures which the Government have adopted are at last beginning to make an impression, even upon this old problem of Irish emigration.  The impression which it has made is not nearly sufficient: there is a lot more to be done. <Col N="2838" /> I said yesterday and I repeat now that that is the main test of policy, of the adequacy and sufficiency of national policy now and in the years immediately ahead of us.</P>
    <P>But is it fair, honest and truthful, as Deputy Dillon urges us to be, to represent this as a problem which began in 1957?  Let us get the facts in that regard straight.  When we came into office in 1957 emigration was running at the rate of 50,000 per year having risen to that figure from an annual average of 40,000 in previous years.  In the most recent period of 12 months, the 12 months ended May 31st, the net emigration figure was 30,000.  Let us, against that background of very considerable reduction in emigration, look at the position regarding employment.  When the previous Government decided to cut and run in February, 1957, on the day they dissolved the Dáil, the number of registered unemployed in this State was 95,267 and was still rising.  On Friday last there were 34,939 and still falling.  Even making allowance for the seasonal variation in these figures, that is not an insignificant change.</P>
    <P>Since 1956 there was an increase in the total national income of £74,000,000 per year, an increase in the total value of the goods and services produced by the labours of our people of those dimensions.  In 1956, which was the final year of the previous Government, the year I am contrasting with the final year of this Government, the national income figure revealed a fall of £3,500,000 on the previous year and that was the only year in the past decade in which a fall was recorded.  The 1960 figure for national income shows an increase of £26,000,000 on the previous year and it is still rising.  The agricultural contribution to the national income, about which Deputy Dillon tried to mislead the Dáil yesterday, increased since 1956 by £9,500,000.  During 1956, agricultural income fell by £11,000,000 as compared with the previous year.  In 1960 it rose by £5,000,000 on the previous year.</P>
    <P>There has at least been a change in direction.  I do not know what Deputy Dillon was trying to mislead the House into thinking when yesterday he beat <Col N="2839" /> his breast and said: &ldquo;Between 1947 and 1957 agricultural exports doubled in volume and trebled in value and I was responsible for that.&rdquo;</P>

Deputy Dillon was not Minister for Agriculture in either 1947 or 1957 but he was in the years 1954, 1955 and 1956 and in 1954 the value of our exports was £115,300,000. The volume index for exports was 102.6 and by 1956 they had fallen in value to £108,100,000 and the index to 98.1.  In 1956 the index for agricultural prices fell to the lowest point reached in this decade.  I concede at once that the increases in agricultural prices which have been brought about since then were not enough to rectify the position that prevailed in agriculture.  That was, to some extent due to weather conditions, but the main problem arose in the abnormal conditions prevailing in international trade in agricultural goods, due to the extension of the price subsidy arrangements which the great and wealthy industrial States are operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For me, one of the main attractions in the possibilities of our membership of the European Economic Community is the prospect that it offers of a more rational and profitable trading situation in respect of agriculture. In 1956, the last year of the previous Government, the average number of persons employed in industry fell by 2,200 as compared with the previous year and in 1957 it fell by a further 4,500.  These are the figures.  In 1955 the number employed in manufacturing industry was 156,600; in 1956 it had fallen to 154,400 and in 1957 it fell to 149,900.  In the first quarter of this year the figure was 161,500, an increase of 11,600 over 1957 and of 5,800 over 1960.  If Deputies study these figures they will note the acceleration of the upward movement that has taken place.  In 1956, the total <Col N="2840" /> exports of this country fell in value by £2,800,000 as compared with the previous year.  By 1960 they had been increased by £44,000,000 above the 1956 total.  They were £22,000,000 in 1960 above the 1959 level, and they are still rising.</P>
    <P>I give to the Dail at the end of our term of office this over-all picture to study.  We came into office with emigration and unemployment rising rapidly, with agricultural and industrial output, exports and the national income falling steeply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A few minutes ago, Deputy Manley was complimenting Deputy Dillon on his Parliamentary manners, believe it or not.  We are not satisfied with these results.  We do not think these results are good enough.  We do not think a satisfied Government is ever any use, but the trend of all the speeches of the past two days is that Fine Gael thinks that the 1956 level was good enough.  They have been trying to represent 1956 as a sort of golden age in Irish history. Do they think that the public have forgotten the facts altogether?  Maybe they have.  But for my part, if conditions prevailing now were not better &mdash;and a good deal better&mdash;than in 1956, I would not have the hardihood to present myself to the electorate at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon works on the theory that if you repeat a falsehood often enough and proclaim it loudly enough, it will be accepted by someone.  He has repeatedly asserted that I promised in the election campaign of 1957 to produce a state of full employment in <Col N="2841" /> five years.  I want to state my personal position in this regard.  I believe that full employment must be the aim of any comprehensive national policy, the aim of any worthwhile Government. But in stating that aim I am not attempting to minimise the national effort that will be required to bring it about.  It is traditional for Fine Gael to deride those who want to bring Ireland into line with the world.  We remember when the very idea of export industries, or of a modern transport system was described as evidence of megalomania.  They, in their thinking, have not yet moved out of the donkey-and-cart age.</P>
    <P>In the year 1955, it is true, I tried to calculate the requirements of a full employment policy, tried to estimate what it would necessitate in the way of increased employment, and to calculate whether there were sufficient financial resources available to the State to support a policy of that kind.  I made calculations which, in my view, justified giving an affirmative answer to that question.  It is, perhaps, worth mentioning that in the same year the Executive Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions carried out the same exercise and arrived at the same answers.</P>
    <P>This is what Deputy Dillon forgot to tell the House yesterday.  In the following year, in 1956, I went back to the same audience at the same venue and made a speech, published in the same way, in which I had to explain that after one disastrous year of Fine Gael Government, because of the rise in unemployment that had come about, because of the wastage of financial resources which had occurred, the calculations which I had made were no longer valid and the conclusions I had reached the previous year could not then be sustained.</P>
    <P>What is the position now?  We had reached the end of 1958 before the slump which began under the Fine Gael administration was finally arrested and the upturn in our affairs began.  It began slowly but it has been gaining speed ever since.  Calculating on the <Col N="2842" /> basis of the sales of social insurance stamps, and assuming that 52 stamps sold equal one man in full employment, since we brought into operation the <i>Programme of Economic Expansion</i> the number of people in employment on the basis of full-time working, has increased by 24,000.  At the moment, as I have already mentioned, we have 35,000 people registered as unemployed.  The yearly average may, of course, be higher.  That unemployment represents 5.3 per cent. of our wage-earning labour force, excluding agriculture.</P>
    <P>Defining full employment, as I attempted to do it before, as a condition in which not more than three per cent. of the workers of the country are unemployed on weekly average, then it is clear that if we can double the present rate of economic progress, full employment is within our grasp; but we have got to double our rate of progress.  That is the estimate I gave the Dáil last year.  That is the estimate I repeat this year.</P>
    <P>We have been in the course of this debate discussing the European Economic Community and the implications for our economy of our membership of the Common Market. Nobody could make or even pretend to make a confident prediction of the effect of the emergence of the European Economic Community and of our membership of it upon this country's prospects of economic expansion.  It represents a fundamental change in the circumstances in which our trade has been carried on&mdash;a new deal of the cards.  That may be a bad metaphor because it implies that luck is a factor in this situation.  I do not believe it is. I reject completely the argument of Deputy Corish and Deputy Manley that luck enters into this at all.  It is my faith at any rate that a confident, enterprising people with a competent Government can determine their own destiny in any international circumstances. It was obvious over these two days in the speeches we heard from Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, and repeated by other members of his Party, that Fine Gael are frightened by the problems of Irish association with the European Community <Col N="2843" /> and are afraid to face up to them.</P>

      <P>I do not deny in our membership of the European Economic Community there will be problems galore, great, serious and difficult problems, but there will also be possibilities.  Let us not forget about the possibilities while we are worrying about the problems.  Deputy Corish urged yesterday that this question of Irish membership of the European Community should not be made an issue in the general election &mdash;not made the football was, I think, the phrase he used.</P>

      <P>In the course of this debate it is true that it was revealed that there is no fundamental difference of viewpoint amongst us regarding the question of our application for membership.  That, therefore, cannot be an issue in the election in the ordinary sense of that term. Deputy Dillon, I notice, said in a public speech some days ago that the basic issue in the election is whether Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael are to conduct the negotiations.  I think that is a reasonable and legitimate issue, but I do not think it is the main issue.  I think the main basic issue is: who is to be entrusted with the task of organising the Irish economy so that the progress which has now started will continue in the new circumstances?  I think that task requires qualities which Fine Gael have never shown&mdash;the qualities of initiative and consistency and capacity for work.  In my view, they were disastrous as a Government, but they were unconstructive and ineffective as an Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not represent the speech I made yesterday when introducing this motion as being a comprehensive review of either current events or of the policy of the Government. I think, therefore, it was somewhat unfair to suggest, as some Deputies have suggested, that because some important policy matters were not referred to then by me it shows I have no interest in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan, for example, concluded that because I did not refer to the work of the Government in restoring the Irish language in the daily life of the people, I had no interest in the matter.  My views in that regard are well known.  But in case anybody might believe that assertion, let me repeat there has been no change of purpose in that regard since I became Taoiseach.  We are, as Deputies know, carrying out, through a Commission appointed for that purpose, a review, a reassessment, <Col N="2845" /> of the methods heretofore applied to achieve that national aim.  We are awaiting the final report of that Commission. One or two interim reports have been already made.  I hope when we get it we will be able to initiate a vigorous effort to complete the realisation of the objective we have set ourselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to the part which public enterprise can play in national economic development.  Let me say, I am in full agreement with that and, indeed, I believe that State enterprise will have to play a part of greater significance in national development in the future.  We have already gone to each of the State organisations responsible for commercial activities and have directed them to explore the possibilities of extending their activities in new fields associated with their present work.  Some important developments have already resulted and others are in prospect concerning which some announcements may be made soon.</P>

I do not know what reasons Deputies opposite who have spoken in this debate have for the confidence in the outcome of the election which they are displaying.  It may be that their confidence is not genuinely felt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2846" /> In concluding this speech in this final debate, I want to say that we in the Government have served the country to the best of our ability.  What the people have seen of us in action is the best we have to offer.  I hope they will think it is good enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We know&mdash;we are very conscious of the fact and have discussed amongst ourselves the implications of it&mdash;that no Government in the history of this State ever succeeded in getting an overall majority at two elections running.  We know that that indicates that there is a prospect that we may not succeed either, but we also know this: no Government, other than this, ever left office with a better record of achievement to present to the electorate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make no claim upon the Irish public on the grounds of gratitude for past achievements. What is past is history.  What is written on the record cannot now be changed.  What matters is the future. The future will present difficult problems and hard tasks and I shall not attempt, when I go to the electorate, to minimise either the difficulties or the magnitude of the tasks.  I believe in the gospel of national salvation through work and effort, and hard work and consistent effort are things that Fianna Fáil are good at.</P>
