    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving to report progress last night, I had not quite completed the references I intended to make to An Foras Tionscal.  I was suggesting to the House that the autonomy of An Foras Tionscal in the matter of grants for new industries or expansions of existing ones is something we ought to safeguard.  While I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, or any other Minister would not like to escape his ultimate responsibility, the system we have is a good one whereby applications for grants can be thoroughly and objectively examined and only the good proposals, the ones likely to last, as is a necessary requirement under the statute, will be assisted by way of grants.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the administration of the affairs of An Foras Tionscal I should like to refer to particularly, having regard to the observations made in the course of the debate, is the location of industries.  I want to repeat what I have said more than once in this House and outside that An Foras Tionscal do not, in any way, try to influence an industrialist to locate his undertaking in any particular place.  When an industrialist makes an application for a grant, generally speaking, he already has the location in mind.  An Foras Tionscal, if he has not got a location in mind, can do no more than give him information that is available to them regarding the amenities of various towns and districts</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> throughout the country.  They take the greatest possible care to ensure that the ultimate selection of location is a matter for the industrialist himself.  If only for the sake of their own self-preservation, it is a good standard to apply, because the time could come when, by reason of location, an industry might get into difficulties and, in that event, An Foras Tionscal could not be held responsible or taken to task in any way for the location of the industry in that particular place.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress on the House that the Minister for Industry and Commerce in no way influences an industrialist as to the location of his undertaking.  As I have repeatedly told deputations, who came to me from particular places, the Industrial Development Authority is a body mainly charged with the encouragement of outside industrialists to set up here or the encouragement of our own people to set up new industries or expand their existing ones.  The Industrial Development Authority is supplied, generally, with a list of the locations where it is felt a factory would be an advantage to the district. Most development committees have already supplied to the Industrial Development Authority full particulars of the amenities and promise that their respective locations have for new industries.</P>
    <P>There is no truth in the suggestions made here yesterday that an attempt is made to remove a proposed industry from one area to another.  No attempt is made to influence an industrialist away from a particular location.  On the contrary, Foras Tionscal do their utmost to influence an industrialist to adhere to the particular location and influence him not to change his mind. But they will not influence him to the extent of requiring him to set up in a particular locality.  I hope I can convince the House that there is no truth in the suggestion that the Industrial Development Authority, An Foras Tionscal or the Department of Industry and Commerce ever influenced an industrialist away from a particular location.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  If an industrialist comes</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> with a proposal for the establishment of a factory, would An Foras Tionscal be in a position to say to him: &ldquo;If you go to the undeveloped areas we can give you so much assistance&rdquo;?  If the industrialist asks what he would get if he establishes the factory outside the undeveloped areas, would An Foras Tionscal be able to tell him what financial assistance he would get?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised that point because it reminds me to deal with another criticism that was made.  The grants laid down in the Undeveloped Areas Act and the Industrial Grants Act are maximum grants &mdash;100 per cent. for buildings and 50 per cent. for machinery in the undeveloped areas and two-thirds for buildings and one-third for machinery outside the undeveloped areas.  An Foras Tionscal have to work within the terms of these Acts.  If a person makes an inquiry as to what grant he will get if he sets up in the undeveloped areas, An Foras Tionscal tell him they can give him up to 100 per cent. and 50 per cent. grants respectively under the Undeveloped Areas Act, and, under the other Act, two-thirds and one-third respectively but, until such time as he submits his full proposal, they tell him they will not be able to say in terms of money how much he will get in either case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If an industrialist comes forward with proposals in respect of the two areas, then An Foras Tionscal would be able to tell him what he would get, and he could make up his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The location must already be decided upon before An Foras Tionscal will deal with him. The location affects the amount of the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the question of location not largely decided by the fact that, under the Industrial Grants Act, an industrialist cannot avail of the grants unless the industry is one that cannot be set up in the undeveloped areas?  Does that condition not automatically preclude a number of indusdustries being located outside the undeveloped areas?  In other words, it <Col N="1251" /> is a form of direction to go to the undeveloped areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Industrial Grants Act there is a provision that the type of industry must be one which is not suitable for establishment in the undeveloped areas.  There are a thousand and one reasons why an industry would not be suitable for establishment in the undeveloped areas.  I can assure the House that there is no narrow interpretation of the provision requiring an industry, if it is suitable for the undeveloped areas, to be set up there. The approach by An Foras Tionscal is very liberal in that respect.  Nevertheless, they must have regard to the provisions of the Act passed by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if the grants are more liberal for an industry in an undeveloped area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum grants for the undeveloped areas are higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they not more positive?  They are more defined.  A man knows where he is going in the case of the undeveloped areas.  If he decides to set up an industry outside of that the position is not so clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly easier to qualify under the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not intend to cross-examine the Minister, but the Minister knows the feeling there is about all this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, but I am under some pressure as to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that an industrialist came to a particular area and signified his intention of opening an industry there?  It was not an undeveloped area.  He then went to Dublin and this area never heard of him again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the particular case the Deputy has in mind. If an industrialist makes application for a grant for an industry in Waterford and if at a certain stage, An Foras <Col N="1252" /> Tionscal having dealt with it and approved the location and the amount of the grant to be given, the industrialist wanted to change his mind it would be very difficult for the industrialist to get out of Waterford if, in the first instance, he had decided to establish an industry there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could he make two applications&mdash;one for an industry to be located in the undeveloped areas and one outside of that area?  Could he then compare the type of assistance he would get in each case and make up his mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The application must be a composite exercise on behalf of the respective industrialist.  He must know not only what he will produce, the size of the factory, the amount of capital he will put into it, the number of people he will employ, but he must also say to An Foras Tionscal that he proposes to locate the factory in the town of &ldquo;X&rdquo;.  They deal with the application only on that basis and so there can be no question of a proposition to set up a factory with no location in mind.  The applicant must have the location in mind because that affects the amount of the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to split up the debate into five parts.  That appeared to be the course the debate took.  I have dealt with tourism and An Foras Tionscal.  The main theme of the debate was our approach to the Common Market.  It was suggested on a number of occasions, by Deputies on the other side, that the Government had done nothing to apprise industrialists of the difficulties and the competition they are likely to encounter in the event of our subscribing to the Rome Treaty.  That is not so as I propose to prove in a moment.  Deputy Russell raised the question of making some estimate of our chance of maintaining our position in our export market.  It is, of course, impossible at this stage to forecast in a matter of this kind.  Many of the economic conditions that will obtain in the future are matters over which we can have no effective control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> At the moment the situation is fluid and it is very difficult to frame any estimate of our development <i>vis-á-vis</i> developments of the European Common Market.  If we join some of our weaker industries will find it difficult to survive because of the competition they will encounter.  Not only will they encounter competition from outside but they will also encounter competition on the home market which has hitherto been reserved to them through the medium of protective tariffs.  I am sufficiently optimistic to hope that many of our industrial undertakings will, by increasing productivity and efficiency, succeed in weathering the storm.  I hope that, by consolidation of control and, if necessary, rationalisation of products, our industrialists would be able to take advantage of the wider and more populous markets that would be open to them in our new position.  It seems clear in any event that the measure of whether they will or will not maintain their position in the export markets will largely be their managerial energy, skill and efficiency of technical production and perhaps what is equally, if not more important, the efficiency of their marketing set-up.</P>
    <P>I should mention at this stage that in any event if we do adhere to the Common Market we must assume that we will be given at least the period over which tariffs are to be dismantled that is now enjoyed by present members. In fact, it might be reasonable to expect that we would be given a longer period.  That was accepted in the European Free Trade Area talks which came to an end in 1958.  Perhaps the reason is less urgent now for us but nevertheless I think the same principle should apply because we are still a country in the process of economic development.  We are still a country that has not been able to keep pace with the more advanced industrial countries of Europe and therefore it is not unreasonable that we should expect to receive a longer period for the dismantling of our tariffs.</P>
    <P>Having said that, however, I want to repeat what I mentioned in my opening statement.  There should be no relaxation and no question of deluding ourselves that we can get favourable <Col N="1254" /> terms because of, perhaps, the sentimental view people have of the Irish people.  It has been suggested to me that when the Free Trade Area negotiations broke down the sense of urgency that had been created amongst Irish industrialists with regard to improving their efficiency and production techniques had eased and that some people were glad of that.  The usual &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; was said to those who had been urging for greater production efforts. Even in the light of the breakdown of the Free Trade Area talks, that was wrong because the Common Market was already a fact and still is a fact now more so than it was.</P>
    <P>Having said that too it is not unreasonable for Deputies to ask what the Government have been doing about the Common Market and about making sure that our industrialists were fully aware of the difficulties of the new competition they were likely to face. As some Deputies have observed speeches have been made at chambers of commerce.  I do not know whether or not it was suggested that I like going to chamber of commerce dinners and making speeches.  It is a chore I would gladly avoid although having gone to them I am glad to be able to talk to the people I meet.</P>
    <P>Those talks are worth while because we get a cross-section of complaints, criticisms and suggestions from manufacturers, businessmen and industrialists of all kinds.  It is very useful to any Minister to take advantage of those occasions to put across whatever admonitions and exhortations are proper at the moment.  I have taken full advantage of those occasions to stress the need for greater productivity and efficiency.  However, those are the more publicised things that happen.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, in my own Department, as one would expect, my officials and I separately and jointly have been having consultations with groups of industrialists representing the different trades and with the Federation of Irish Manufacturers.  We have discussed all aspects of their products and made suggestions to them even up to the point in appropriate cases of rationalisation. As Deputies know the Federation have not been idle in that respect <Col N="1255" /> either.  They have appointed a very well-known economist who has studied very closely the likely impact on us of the Rome Treaty.  As well as that, they have set up various group committees that are examining the whole problem and the problem as it applies in their own trades and industries.</P>
    <P>I have also had conversations with the President of the Federation and with the General Secretary in which I reviewed with them the progress of the Free Trade movement in Europe.  We felt that the officers of the Federation could organise their members to greater efforts to meet the new situation.  Apart from that we have, of course, the different schemes that exist within the Department.  First of all, there is the technical assistance scheme and, in that respect, some Deputies have asked why it was reduced from £205,000 to £200,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be aware that I have been making complaints at some of these chamber of commerce dinners of the comparative lack of interest in that technical assistance scheme and have been urging industries that have not yet taken advantage of it to apply for grants and other aids that would help to make industry more efficient.  The amount fixed this year, £200,000, was a realistic appraisal of what is likely to be sought by way of technical assistance grants for industry.  I can assure the House that lack of money will not prevent any industry from getting full value and the full effect of the grants within that scheme.  I am quite sure that if I come to the House at any stage and indicate that £200,000 is not enough the House will give me increased moneys for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House that the Government have not been idle, and that my Department and I have not been idle, in the matter of consultations with the Federation of Irish Manufacturers and with the different groups.  I want to say, too, that these consultations are proceeding apace and ultimately will probably be even more detailed.  As they become more detailed, the House will be informed and following the issue of the White <Col N="1256" /> Paper, as I said in an intervention yesterday, with regard to the setting up of the Common Market published by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government, we hope at this week-end, there will be an opportunity for a full debate by the House on all the aspects and implications of the Common Market. That debate will take place at a very early stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question at this stage? What effect will our entry into the Common Market have on the establishment of industries in under-developed areas?  Has the Department examined it in that light?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been examined in that light.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are many imponderables when we are examining a situation which is so fluid and will continue to be fluid.  I believe that one of the biggest attractions we can have if we go into the Common Market is to have available to us a skilled, semi-skilled or non-skilled, but at all times intelligent labour force.  As was observed by the Leader of the Opposition, the industry that will be attracted mainly by these considerations will be a good one.  So long as we have that labour force&mdash;and I have heard many tributes paid to it by visiting industrialists&mdash;we will have an attraction over and above many other areas in the countries now forming part or likely to form part of the Common Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister care to make any comment on the suggestions made by several Deputies during the debate as to what might happen some of the industries recently established if we were to join the Common Market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the industries recently established&mdash;I do not have to make a distinction between those established by outside interests or with the aid of outside interests and those established at home&mdash;were established in the main for the export market. Many of them were established under the Encouragement of Investments Acts, 1958, where they were permitted <Col N="1257" /> even without a manufacturer's licence to set up here as long as they exported 90 per cent. of their production. Already they are doing that, and not only to the British market but to many parts of the world.  Since that, in the main, is the pattern of the new industries, I do not think they will have much to fear from the Common Market. Apart from that, we have the advantage that they are new factories. New factories and new layouts have a great advantage over old-established concerns by reason of more efficient techniques and the time and labour-saving devices that can be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would our main market not be Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The main market may continue to be Britain, but not necessarily. We will have the 200,000,000 people of the existing Common Market countries, and in the EFTA countries, whose entry into the Common Market at some future date is not unlikely, there are an extra 100,000,000 people, making in all a market of over 300,000,000 to which we might have free access, admittedly only on the basis of price, competition and quality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>When we join the Common Market, are we limited to that market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No, you can export to every country in the world.  There is no limitation whatever.  The Common Market has only cleared tariffs between the participating countries.  I hope it will soon have an agricultural policy as well.  As far as the rest of the world is concerned, there will be no difficulty whatever about any member country coming to its own arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I hope the Common Market will have an agricultural <Col N="1258" /> policy very soon.  I believe joining the Common Market would be an advantage to Irish agriculture.  I want to comment on what the Leader of the Opposition said about a wider basis and extension of the Common Market. I would agree with him.  We all know American subvention assisted greatly these countries to rehabilitate themselves economically to the point that they could form this bloc.  Naturally, it had a political content.</P>
      <P>First of all, the aim was to make these countries as economically sound as possible in order to withstand any ideological pressure from outside on the way of life of the people forming the Common Market.  It is essential that that concept, or an even stronger one, will have to be on a broader basis and extended certainly to the free countries of Western Europe.  Since the United States and Canada have now come into OEEC in its revised form, OEECD, it is not unreasonable to hope that the basis of the Common Market concept will even further be extended.  If it is, the stronger it will be.</P>
      <P>Labour relations were referred to on a number of occasions during the debate.  As I have announced, the Conditions of Employment Act and the construction of the Labour Court itself are being examined.  I should like to say, however, that, contrary to what has been suggested here, the Labour Court has performed a very useful function.  It has been said on a number of occasions that the recommendations of the Labour Court formed the basis of settlement in 75 per cent. of the cases coming before it.  In 1960, for example, it was instrumental in the settlement of all but 21 of the 246 disputes coming before it, which I think was a creditable performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not yet reached the stage&mdash; I do not think we ever will or that we would ever want to&mdash;of saying to any of our workers that he will not have the right to withdraw his labour if the conditions under which he works are so bad as to make it intolerable for him.  Even if we did, we would have the question of enforcement; and I do not think we would face with any degree of equanimity the prospect of sending people to jail because they established <Col N="1259" /> what they felt were their traditional and treasured rights.  We must face facts.  We have a very good instrument in the Labour Court.  Its method of procedure is an excellent one, but we have the difficulty, in my opinion, that its ultimate findings are no more than recommendations which are not binding on either side.</P>
    <P>In the main, its recommendations have been accepted.  The difficulty arises in the few cases in which they have not been accepted.  It has been no pleasure for me to intervene in one way or another in a few strikes recently. I do not think it is a situation that should be allowed to continue.  I know it is a situation the Labour Court itself did not view with any degree of equanimity.  I fully appreciate their point of view.  Nevertheless, there were serious matters depending on the peaceful settlement of these disputes; and, fortunately, in the few cases in which intervention was made, there was a settlement after a short time.</P>
    <P>What I hope to see is the system whereby conciliation will be tried and tried, with recourse to the Labour Court at a very late stage or, possibly, the latest stage in the course of any dispute.  As long as we can keep parties talking about the difficulties before any serious action is taken, there is always the prospect that the difficulties and differences between them can be resolved.  As Deputy Sherwin aptly observed yesterday, there are three sides to every story: your side, my side and the right side.  Perhaps that is the case in labour disputes as well.  I should like to see, even when the conciliation efforts have failed and the matter ultimately comes to the Labour Court, and even when the Labour Court's ultimate recommendations are not acceptable, that the conciliation system would continue right through to make sure that the parties will not continue sniping at each other from a distance through newspaper advertisements and other ways; in other words, that at all stages of a labour dispute there should be some means of conciliation, some means of keeping the parties in conference and in touch with each other <Col N="1260" /> so as to avoid the difficulties, hardships and, in some cases, the bitterness that often accompany strikes.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the situation is being closely watched and we are undertaking an examination of how the method can be improved.  The more we think of it, the greater must be our realisation that we have a very good system. Nobody can suggest there is an easy or readymade solution to the problem. At all events, we have the situation in which the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are in close consultation with each other on labour problems.</P>
    <P>I do not know what scope these consultations embrace, whether they are limited to immediate wage demands and hours of work or whether they can be extended to the broader question of labour relations.  Nevertheless, it it a good thing they are sitting down together and I believe nothing but good can emanate from it.  I will await the outcome of these conferences. I expect to be kept informed, particularly having regard to the fact that the parties know that the Department of Industry and Commerce is examining the labour relations position.  I think the House will agree with me it is a matter that is not easy of solution and one in which no quick decisions ought to be made, particularly as the two main partners in industry are sitting down together and discussing their problems.</P>
    <P>Another matter mentioned by a number of Deputies was the cost of living.  Comment was made on the fact that I did not advert to the cost of living in the course of my opening statement.  I can assure the House that the omission was by no means deliberate and that I had no fears whatever in referring to the cost of living as it stood or as it stands.  This Government before it came into office said that the important thing was to achieve stability in the cost of living.  If one looks at the statistics for the past three years one will readily see that that stability was maintained.  The figure in mid-February, 1958, and mid-February, 1960, was the same at 144.  There were fluctuations in the meantime but in the main the figure of 144 was maintained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> Between the same starting period, mid-February, 1944, and mid-August, 1960, there was a fluctuation of 2 points up to 146 and the latest figure now being taken for 1961 is 150.3. Some of the Opposition speakers yesterday based the sums of money which they quoted, as between now and 1957, on the supposition that 15 points was 15 per cent.  In fact the 15 points is only 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned that while industrial workers were in the main able to keep pace with the increased cost of living the agricultural community were unable to do so.  However, the increase in the cost of living largely referred to the increase in the price of milk, butter, flour and bread.  Some of these commodities were increased, as will be admitted, as the result of the withdrawal of the subsidies which at the time accounted for some eight points. But the same table as Deputy Dillon quotes from, shows the increase between 1957 and 1960 in food was 102.1 to 116.6.  That was to August, 1960.  I have not got the other figure. Therefore that was 14.5 points.  There were, of course, fluctuations on the other headings which had an effect&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that in the statistics published prior to the year 1961, the figure has gone up by 2.7, page 26, table 14.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumer price index number has risen from 115.4 to 118.1 on the August, 1953, base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings the figure to two months later, to the one available in the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i> However, the point I want to make is that apart from the increases for which the abolition of food subsidies was responsible, there were increases in the price of commodities which automatically increased farm income, for example in milk, and which was deliberately done to try to equate the position of the person living on the land with that of the person who is earning his daily bread from industrial employment.  It is wrong, therefore, to say the increase in the cost of living, as it stands now, has taken no account of farm income.  In fact farm income remains largely the same as it was in 1958, notwithstanding the reduction in output of cattle and other things in the meantime which was caused largely by the weather.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat that I had no ulterior motive in not mentioning the cost of living figure in my opening statement.  It was an omission on my part and certainly not one the members of the Fine Gael Party can seize upon as something I was trying deliberately to avoid.</P>
      <P>With regard to emigration, the Taoiseach mentioned yesterday that the outward-inward balance had been reduced considerably.  He mentioned in the course of his reply to that Dáil question that the highest figure for net emigration we ever had was in 1956. That brought howls of protest from the Opposition benches but I would like to refer the Opposition Deputies again to the <i>Statistical Abstract,</i> 1960, page 17, table 6.  It gives the net emigration figure for the period to 1956 as 196,763 which was the highest figure attained since the 'twenties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a qualification of that figure.  The publication <Col N="1263" /> which I heard Deputy O'Malley read out and which I presume was an official British publication said the possibility of duplication could not be overlooked.  There was another figure in table 164 of the same <i>Statistical Abstract</i> which indicates that the total live register for unemployed as at January, 1957, stood at 94,648.  That allied to the net emigration figure for 1956 is a pretty dismal picture of the social conditions available from the statistical figures for the years 1956 and 1957.  It was not easy to recover from a position like that but we have done so fairly well.</P>

      <P>We should try to avoid boom conditions in any sector of our economy.  They do not last very long.  Steady progress is being maintained and it is admitted by outside observers, for example the most recent O.E.E.C. report on our country, that we are set on the right road.  Many other questions were raised by Deputies.  It is difficult for me to follow all of them, but I owe it to Deputy Dillon to refer to his comments on the adverse trade balance.  He takes the figure for May at £10,000,000 and multiplies that by 12 and produces an adverse trade balance of £50,000,000 in the current year.  Deputy Dillon knows more about statistics than I do.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Deputy quoted from <i>The People,</i> a British Sunday newspaper, to illustrate a point he wished to make in reference to his observations on our adverse balance.  I should like to refer him to to-day's <i>Irish Independent</i> which, I hope, he accepts as a more dependable journal than <i>The People.</i></P>

      <P>I am dealing with the Deputy's observations on the balance of payments situation, and I am quoting for him the treatment of that position by to-day's <i>Irish Independent.</i> The article says:</P>
      <P>Imports rose, but not so markedly, the increase being most noticeable since the middle of last year.  As a result, the import excess, which declined to £72,000,000 in the 12 months ended September, 1960, has shown an upward tendency, rising to £76,000,000 in the 12 months ended March, 1961.</P>
      <P>Lower down it says:</P>
      <P>Import prices in the first quarter of 1961 were about one per cent. above those for the corresponding period of 1960, but about the same amount lower than for the last quarter of that year.</P>
      <P>The final paragraph says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of these relatively slight movements, the terms of trade were somewhat worse in the March 1961 quarter than in the March 1960 <Col N="1265" /> quarter, though better than in the December 1960 quarter.</P>
    <P>The increase referred to some extent to the increase in the import of raw materials.  Deputy Dr. Ryan, in his Budget Speech, adverted to this fact and said there would, perhaps, be an increase on that side.  At Column 659, Volume 188, for the 19th April, 1961, he said:</P>
    <P>However, imports will probably rise noticeably also, partly because of the bad grain harvest last year and partly because of the demand for equipment and raw materials for expanding factories.  It is possible that a small deficit may emerge, but this need not cause concern.</P>
    <P>The figures quoted by Deputy Dillon yesterday need not cause him concern. The position is being watched very closely.  In the figure which Deputy Dillon quoted for last month there are, as he knows, raw materials and machinery for new factories.  It is hoped that not only will that be offset but that our exports arising from some of these new factories, which are in the main export factories, will have the desired effect on the balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other questions asked in the course of the debate on a variety of subjects.  I made some inquiries about the grant given to the chewing gum factory to which Deputy Dillon referred.  Under the Encouragement of Investment Act, 1958, that factory is one which did not require a new manufacture licence and, therefore, no facilities were given under the Control of Manufactures Act, because their output conformed with the terms of the Encouragement of Investment Act that 90 per cent. at least was for the export market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied they are not exceeding the ten per cent.?  There were complaints from home manufacturers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The first complaint I got was from Deputy Dillon yesterday. While we have no complaints yet, I would expect that the Federation of Industries themselves would keep a <Col N="1266" /> close watch and report any breaches to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  If there are any such breaches, I would be very glad to hear of them.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I had only time to inquire about one side of it.  I may have misunderstood the Deputy when he said that existing manufacturers get no assistance by way of concession on tax in relation to export profits.  Even on existing exports there is a remission of 25 per cent.  I have a function to attend to this morning which precludes me from referring to the other points but I can assure the Deputy who raised those points that these will be attended to.  I have a full note of them.  Deputy Dillon made a case about a furniture manufacturer in some rural part.  I made some inquiries about that.  The existing Apprenticeship Committee was dealing with that.  The new Apprenticeship Board will now look at it and I hope they will be able to come to that person's assistance in some way.  I think they will be able to come to his assistance in some way.</P>
      <P>Deputies raised the question of entry on land for the purpose of mineral exploration.  I am in close touch with the National Farmers Association about the problems which open-cast mining are causing for farmers in the Kilkenny area.  I can assure Deputy Dillon that the case I think he had in mind and which Deputy Crotty mentioned afterwards is not as bad as thought.  I have arranged with the parties concerned for an arbitrator, appointed by me, to decide on the compensation due to the man concerned.  I do not think there is any question that the man will be done out of his compensation. In the meantime, having regard to that experience, I can assure the Deputy that the suggestion about some security or some bond to be placed in advance by these prospectors or miners will be very carefully looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked about oil exploration. Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Norton and, I think, Deputy Russell asked what exactly was being done in oil exploration <Col N="1267" /> and what was behind the change in the set-up of the existing company. They wanted to know whether Irish Ambassador Oil had ceased to exist and whether there were any new Irish directors or new Irish money in the new company.  The Continental Oil Company and the Ohio Oil Company will join with the Irish Ambassador Oil Company.  They are two of the top Oil exploration companies in the United States.  The Irish Ambassador Oil Company indicated to the Department that participation of these companies in the project would enable the work proposed to be done in this country to be done at a faster rate. They also pointed out that, if oil or gas were found, the Continental Oil Company and the Ohio Oil Company could, between them, and with the assistance of the Irish Ambassador Oil Company, finance subsequent developments which the Irish Ambassador Oil Company, by itself, may not be able to do.</P>
    <P>The main advantage from the country's point of view, then, is that exploration work will be finished more quickly and any benefit derived from a discovery of oil or gas will be available earlier.  The arrangements to give effect to the amalgamation between the Irish Ambassador Oil Company, the Continental Oil Company and the Ohio Oil Company have not yet been completed.  When they are completed, the Irish Ambassador Oil Company will cease to exist and a new Irish company composed of the three will be formed with the same agreement as the existing one with the Irish Ambassador Oil Company.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  The only jurisdiction in relation to solicitors which is now exercisable by the Chief Justice, by virtue of subsection 2 of Section 19 of the 1924 Act, is what is called his &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; jurisdiction over solicitors as officers of the Court. Up to the passing of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1960, the Chief Justice had an extensive statutory jurisdiction over solicitors, for example, in relation to their admission, appeals against refusal of practising certificate, etc.  The 1960 Act transferred all these statutory functions to the President of the High Court.  The &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; functions of the Chief Justice were expressly preserved by subsection (3) of Section 14 of the Solicitors Act, 1954, and this Amendment will make it clear that it is only these traditional functions which are now exercisable by the Chief Justice.</P>

    <P>Subsection (4) of this section, which gives the President of the High Court power to interview a justice and tell him what he thinks of his conduct, was inserted in the Bill because it seemed to the Government to be desirable to have further provision for the unsatisfactory district justice who might conduct his courts quite efficiently but nevertheless in such a way as to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  The Government were thinking in particular of offensive statements made from time to time by district justices and, also, the imposition of ridiculously low fines as an indication of the justice's disagreement with the policy underlying the law.  Experience has shown that the formal inquiry provided for by Section 21 of the 1946 Act, that is, an inquiry by a High Court judge, was very often too heavy handed a procedure to invoke in such cases, with the result that the justice escaped the rebuke he should have received.  The Government believe the provision will do a lot of good and that is very existence will exercise a moderating influence on justices.</P>
    <P>However, there were two respects in which, on reconsideration, it was felt the subsection could be improved. Firstly, it was considered that it might be better if the Chief Justice, rather than the President of the High Court, were to exercise this &ldquo;reprimand&rdquo; jurisdiction as well as the more formal jurisdiction under Section 21 of the 1946 Act, enabling him to have the conduct of a justice formally inquired into by a Supreme or High Court judge at the request of the Minister.  Secondly, as the section stands, it gives a disciplinary jurisdiction over a district justice only so far as his conduct in the execution of his office in relation to a particular matter is concerned.  Thirdly, it was felt that the provisions of subsection (4) were unduly restrictive in that they confined this &ldquo;reprimand&rdquo; jurisdiction to the conduct of a justice <Col N="1271" /> in the execution of his office in relation to a particular matter.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the amendment proposes to transfer this jurisdiction from the President of the High Court to the Chief Justice and to enable any conduct of a justice which is such as to bring the administration of justice into disrepute to be the subject of admonition by the Chief Justice.  I have consulted both the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court on this matter and I should like to express my appreciation of their co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all familiar with the occasional lapses of district justices where statements are made which receive a certain amount of publicity, statements which do not in any way assist in the administration of justice.  On the other hand, is it wise to adopt a procedure which more or less appoints either the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court&mdash;in this case, the Chief Justice&mdash;with a type of schoolmaster jurisdiction over justices? If a justice is guilty of a lapse of this sort, he may himself, on reflection, or as a result of contact with his colleagues, realise the desirability of making amends and correcting any error he may have been guilty of and avoiding such occurrence in the future.  The point that strikes me is whether it is desirable to impose, in legislation, this power or jurisdiction in the Chief Justice to call justices before him at a particular time.</P>
      <P>I understand there is some similar procedure in Britain in regard to justices of the peace or magistrates&mdash; but their jurisdiction is probably different and their general system of appointment is different&mdash;under which the Lord Chancellor, or somebody appointed by him, exercises somewhat similar functions to those envisaged here.  The only question is whether it is considered desirable that this should be included in legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there should be some disciplinary power because we are all human, justices or otherwise.  Certainly district justices <Col N="1272" /> do lapse from time to time.  On occasion, they are fond of making speeches which bear no relation to what is before them and expressing their views like politicians.  Another point is that a justice might be in the habit of being under the influence of drink to some extent and indeed all sorts of matters might arise which would require the exercise of this disciplinary power.  Justices can err just as much as we can but we have the press and the public to keep us in line and there must be something in their case, too.</P>

      <P>First of all, I take it that the House agrees with the proposal in the amendment that these powers should be exercised by the Chief Justice, rather than, as was originally suggested, by the President of the High Court.  That is more consistent.  The Chief Justice has always had certain traditional jurisdiction by virtue of the fact that he is head of the judiciary.  It is more appropriate that he should exercise this particular function as well.  I do not think there could be any objection to the proposal.  We know that a minority of justices may transgress from time to time and it is desirable that somebody should interview them and point out the error of their ways.  The appropriate person to do that is the Chief Justice.</P>
      <P>I think I am right in saying that from time to time, even though he had not any particular statutory authority to do so, the Chief Justice on a couple of occasions has actually interviewed district justices informally, at the request of the Minister, along these lines.  Now we just want to give a statutory basis for that procedure.  A further point which is in the amendment which is not in the original subsection is that we are now widening the procedure.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 9, lines 33 and 34, to delete &ldquo;An Príomh-Chúirt Choiriúil&rdquo; and the brackets enclosing the next four words.</P>
      <P>The procedure of taking out this Bill in the dark and slipping in in a variety of places an Irish description of the court in the English version of the Bill results in the fantastic situation that in subsection (1) of Section 11, we are told that the High Court exercising criminal jurisdiction shall be known as An Phríomh-Chúirt choiriúil and the Central Criminal Court is in this Bill referred to as the Central Criminal Court.  Why you are told in the first half that the court is to be known by a certain title and in the second half you are informed that it is to be called by another title is a mystery to me.  This is a new departure.  I have never yet seen a definitive section which began by saying that the name of such an institution shall be one thing but in this Act it shall be called something else.</P>
      <P>We discussed this pretty extensively in connection with earlier sections of the Bill and I do not know that it is necessary further to underline it except to say that I think this is the kind of procedure which degrades the language and degrades us and denies that the language has a standing in its own right and that, in this country, when we speak English, we speak English and when we speak Irish, we speak Irish.  To me, it is a humiliation that it should be thought necessary, by irrelevant provisions in statutes of this kind, to appear to assert that the only basis upon which anybody can be persuaded to speak Irish is by constraining him by statute to do so.</P>

      <P>To delete subsection (2) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) (a)  The jurisdiction exercisable by the Central Criminal Court shall be exercisable by a judge or judges of the High Court (including the President of the High Court) nominated from time to time by the President of the High Court.</P>
      <P>(b)  The jurisdiction of the Court shall be exercisable by each judge for the time being so nominated save that, where the President of the High Court directs that two or more such judges shall sit together for the purpose of a particular case, the jurisdiction of the Court for that purpose shall be exercised by those judges sitting together.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment makes it clear that several central criminal courts may sit separately at the same time and also <Col N="1275" /> that more than one judge may sit in the court at the same time.  There may be a trial of particular importance, for example, a treason trial, where it might be thought desirable to have more than one judge.  The necessity for having more than one judge has never in fact arisen and I hope it never will; but if it should, this provision will make it possible to proceed with the trial on that basis.</P>

      <P>This is the procedure of sitting <i>in banco.</i>  I thought we would be entitled to some more extensive explanation of this standard of procedure. I am not myself familiar with the circumstances in which judges sit <i>in banco.</i>  I know under the British jurisdiction it was possible for 15 judges on occasion to preside over a criminal trial&mdash;in matters, I think, relating to treason.  My recollection is that my own father was tried in Green Street by three judges.  I have never heard of any change in our judicial system which rendered that practice under the criminal law impossible.  Has there been some change as a result of the First Constitution of 1924 and the Second Constitution of 1937 which had the effect of altering the system, or why is it necessary to bring in a statutory provision now in regard to it, if it was the established practice down the years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin raises a point.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to brief himself better on this matter.  The circumstances in which a number of judges can preside in a court of first instance are peculiar. I admit that I am not familiar with them.  If we were approaching this for the first time, it would seem manifestly cracked to provide that two judges could preside over a trial in a court of first instance because you would be faced with the problem of what would happen if the two disagreed.  Where would you go from there?  I do not doubt that in the ordinary course you would have a minimum of three judges. Deputy Cosgrave spoke of a divisional court with two judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No, three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Three, is it?  I can conceive of nothing less calculated to produce speedy justice than a court of first instance presided over by two judges, and I do not doubt that is not contemplated in this section.  This section is, however, designed apparently to regularise procedures on which we are not fully informed.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary is himself fully informed.  If that is so, then I should be grateful if, at some stage of this Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary would undertake to get for us a note as to the circumstances in which it is thought possible that more than one <Col N="1277" /> judge would preside in the Central Criminal Court over an ordinary criminal trial because before we legislate positively to make provision for that, we ought at least to know some of the possible circumstances that might make it desirable.  These can easily be found in the precedents that exist, but, for the record, they ought to be presented to the House and the House should not be told that we are just making this provision for no particular reason and at a time when we do not believe it is likely ever to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind informing myself as fully as possible on any particular subject but I cannot see that there is anything more in this than meets the eye.  First of all, we are setting up a Central Criminal Court.  Paragraph (a) of the proposed new subsection (2) makes it absolutely clear that you can have more than one Central Criminal Court sitting at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No cavil about that &mdash;all right.  The second thing is that we want to make it clear that if the President of the High Court thinks at any time that it would be desirable to have a court presided over by more than one judge he may do so.  That is all.  We are merely giving that discretion and jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I certainly do not mind doing some research and finding out precedents or the history of the occasions in the past on which this sort of court has been set up or what sorts of trials have been presided over by more than one judge.  That would be interesting and possibly might have some bearing on our deliberations here, but not necessarily so, because it would be a matter for the President of the High Court in future to decide what he shall do about any particular trial.  All we are doing here is giving him the jurisdiction to do that, if he thinks it desirable.</P>

    <Col N="1278" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My problem about this is that the Central Criminal Court means to me that a man is arraigned on indictment and is brought before the court to consist of 12 jurymen, with a judge to see fair play, and at the end of the argument the picture I envisage is a judge with detachment charging the jury and then 12 jurymen retiring to the jury room and returning ultimately with a verdict of &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; or &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo;.  I find it extremely difficult to follow the possibility of such a criminal trial being conducted by two or three judges. Do the three judges charge the jury or do they go into a huddle and agree on a charge?  At once my whole concept of the functioning of the Central Criminal Court becomes confused, if a criminal trial can be presided over by more than one judge. The Parliamentary Secretary may on inquiry find that the criminal jurisdiction does provide for some other kind of trial in particular kinds of cases.  I do not know.  Can any Deputy here feel with me that it is an incongruous kind of picture to envisage three judges or two judges presiding over a jury trial in the Central Criminal Court?  Who charges the jury?</P>
      <P>As I say, I do not doubt there is some explanation of that seeming incongruity but if we are to legislate intelligently, I do not think we should slip subsections like this by without raising the query in what circumstances does the Parliamentary Secretary believe the powers under subsection (2) (b) could ever be used?  If he comes back and says there is such an institution as trial <i>in banco,</i> trial by judges, and it is not envisaged here that the exercise of this criminal jurisdiction by more than one judge would be in the context of an ordinary criminal trial by judge and jury, then we would know where we stand but we do not at present.</P>

      <P>With regard to the subsidiary matters Deputy Dillon raised, such as the question of who charges the jury and all that sort thing, that of course would be taken care of by the Rules of Court.  The procedure laid down in the Rules of Court governs all that kind of thing.</P>

I do not think I am being extravagant when I say that ordinary legislators in this House understand a criminal trial to be a trial of a citizen by 12 of his fellow citizens in a jury presided over by a Criminal Court judge.  If there is to be a departure from that and a provision in the Bill for a departure from that, all I am asking is that we should be told what the circumstances are in which such a departure could arise.  The Parliamentary Secretary, seeking to assist, pulled the Casement trial out of his memory and caused Deputy Cosgrave grave <Col N="1280" /> concern.  He says that if there is no better precedent than that, we demur. I am sure there are good reasons for this but I should like to hear them.</P>

      <P>I can see Deputy Dillon's point as to who charges the jury because the person who charges the jury can convince the jury.  Apart from the Casement case, I can remember many similar cases such as the Dreyfus case in France where there was a definite desire to railroad a man. Supposing a man were to be charged with treason and there were political implications and the authorities considered that by appointing three judges with a certain political tinge, the issue would be decided in accordance with their desire.  It is in the power of the High Court judge to decide whether there shall be three or one.</P>

So that it is absolutely clear that all matters of charging the jury and all matters of procedure are governed by rules of court and must necessarily be governed by such rules.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposal generally, as I say we simply want to ensure that if it is thought desirable by the President of the High Court for any reason&mdash;and the reason that most naturally comes to mind, of course, is a trial which would be of great national importance and the President might think the issues so fundamental and important that it would be desirable&mdash; to have more than one judge presiding, he can do so.  We are simply stipulating that he has that power.  That power has been there before and we are making it clear in this amendment that it will continue to exist in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (a), line 29, after &ldquo;barrister&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or solicitor&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment refers to subsection (2) (a) of Section 17 which refers to the qualifications required for appointment as a judge in the circuit court.  As drafted it refers to the qualification of getting a practising barrister of not less than 10 years' standing.  My amendment proposes that we shall add the words &ldquo;or solicitor&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;barrister&rdquo;. There are a number of solicitors who have built up very considerable practices in the circuit courts.  Solicitors have the right of audience in the circuit court and not only can but do practise fairly extensively in the circuit court without the assistance of counsel. I feel that the solicitors' profession should not automatically be disqualified from membership of the bench of the circuit court.  The tradition in this regard is really without any foundation.  I do not know whether in future the Government might ever see fit to appoint a solicitor as a <Col N="1285" /> judge of the circuit court, but of course my amendment would not oblige them to do so.  Consequently, this would be an enabling provision simply enabling the Government, if they find a suitable solicitor with suitable qualifications, to appoint him to this office. I believe this would be welcomed generally, not only in the profession but by members of the public as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue here, of course, is a very net one.  I have had representations from the Incorporated Law Society in this matter.  I was very reluctant indeed to have to refuse to accept what they had to say.  In connection with this Bill and other matters, particularly in regard to the Solicitors Amendment Act, 1960, I found myself coming into contact a very great deal with the solicitors' profession and the Council of the Incorporated Law Society.  I came to have a very high regard for that body.  When they made a suggestion to me on this particular point, knowing them as I do and knowing the standards they try to maintain in the profession, naturally I examined it very sympathetically.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the solicitors made another suggestion at that time&mdash;that the statutory right which they had to be heard in the circuit court should be preserved. I was very glad to be able to accede to that request.  But, as Deputy Booth very rightly indicated, there is a tradition about this matter.  Traditionally, only barristers are appointed to the circuit court.  That is not alone the way here but the way in Great Britain and the Six Counties.  There, of course, the corresponding courts are the county courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have given full consideration, indeed sympathetic consideration, to this proposal but find themselves, unfortunately, not able to agree to upset the existing position in this regard.  It is not suggested at all, I think, by anybody that a solicitor of long standing and experience and wide practice would not in certain circumstances make an excellent circuit court judge.  But in all these matters where the legal professions are concerned, the House will agree we must have very <Col N="1286" /> great regard for traditional practice and precedents.  As this is a firmly entrenched precedent, I think the Government rightly, though rather reluctantly, decided they could not agree to this proposal by the solicitors' profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise with Deputy Booth's point of view. One must accept there is a very strong tradition in regard to the appointment of circuit court judges.  There ought to be an equally strong tradition in the district court against appointing barristers to the district court bench at all. In other words, if the Government feel, and they do, that only barristers should be appointed to the circuit court, then I think they should appoint only solicitors to the district court.  That particularly applies to practice in the court. It is seldom that a barrister with experience nearly altogether of Dublin work who is appointed a district justice down the country can be regarded as successful.</P>
      <P>From time to time the Bar Council tried to eat into any privileges we had. Certain methods were adopted to try to squeeze solicitors out of their right of audience in the circuit court.  There were ways and means of persuading them, by adverse decisions and otherwise, that it was not safe for them to try to exercise their right in the circuit court with the result that they had to employ counsel in cases where it really was not necessary, where the matter was simple and straightforward and could be dealt with by any reasonably competent solicitor, thereby increasing the cost of litigation to the client.</P>
      <P>If the Government and Parliamentary Secretary cannot meet us on this point&mdash;and I am prepared to accept they cannot&mdash;I think they should do everything possible to ensure that the district court bench is left to the solicitors' profession and that the solicitors' right of audience is preserved in fact as well as in theory.</P>

      <P>I know of cases where judges refused to hear solicitors and the poor person had to brief counsel when there was no need for it. Counsel's costs were about £40 whereas a solicitor would require only half of that.  I am not in this profession myself.  But I mix around and I take a little interest in this matter.  I am very fond of history which is connected with it.  I believe there are very clever solicitors and they should not be deprived of opportunity in this democratic age.  There is too much of the craft union set-up about it. Only barristers' sons may become apprentices and so on.  In my opinion, solicitors should have this right.  But if they are denied it, they ought to have the exclusive right of appointment to the district court bench.</P>
      <P>I am against this business of certain preserves for certain people. In my own way I was up against that sort of thing.  Later, some of the people said &ldquo;Sherwin is a great fellow. We thought he was a dud.&rdquo;  Whether I am or not, perhaps the same thing could be applied to solicitors.  They might make very fine judges.  In this democratic age, there should be no barriers for anyone attaining to better himself.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this matter really falls within the ambit of our discussions at all&mdash;that only solicitors be appointed to the district court.  There are in all about 60 judicial appointments.  Of that 60, only 20 are exclusively reserved for practising barristers in the Supreme Court, the High Court and the circuit court and the remaining appointments&mdash; roughly 40; I am not absolutely certain of these figures&mdash;are for the district court.  Of those appointments, many will be solicitors.  No percentage <Col N="1288" /> of that 40 is reserved for barristers against solicitors.  Therefore, under the existing scheme of things, the solicitors have a very fair advantage. It might be thought there is a sort of vested interest in reserving certain traditional appointments to the Supreme Court, the High Court and the Circuit Court for practising barristers. It is not really that.  It is the question of experience of the type of courts to which barristers are accustomed. That does not mean that solicitors are not as practised or as capable in their own sphere but, by and large, the existing system works out very well and, on a percentage basis, as the figures stand, solicitors, having regard to their experience and the kind of work which they do in the various districts in the country and in the cities and towns, have a considerably higher outlet for preferment than have practising barristers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might preface my remarks by saying that in the past, having had considerable experience of the judicial system and having no immediate or present interest in the matter, my comments might be taken as impartial.  The essential reason for the appointment of barristers to the higher courts goes much deeper than merely a reservation to the particular branch of the profession.  One has only to look at the essential difference between barristers and solicitors to see what is involved. In our legal system, there are in the first instance, solicitors, who are lawyers, who have a good basic legal training and who are mainly the administrative organ of the profession. They are competent to deal as general practitioners with ordinary routine criminal and certain civil cases.  However, their main preoccupation is the organisation of legal work, dealing with the mechanics of legal work, the preparation of cases for court, the briefing of the expert consultants whom they bring in to plead for them.  That is the rôle of the solicitor.  It is an extremely important rôle from the points of view of the client, the State and the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be clearly understood that the rôle of solicitor is a rôle in itself. <Col N="1289" /> The rôle of the barrister&mdash;and the layman sometimes confuses this&mdash;is a different thing.  The role of the barrister is to be, as the old phrase goes, &ldquo;learned in the law&rdquo;.  He is a specialist in law.  He is a specialist in pleading and in being a legal adviser.  His essential usefulness and his essential rôle in the system is in being just that, the advocate and the adviser, the dispassionate adviser who is briefed by the solicitor and who is saved all the administrative work which is done by the solicitor.  The team of the barrister and solicitor together constitute the instrument, the means by which a client can defend and assert his legal rights in court or elsewhere.  It is essential to grasp that difference, that the barrister is a specialist, a specialist adviser, a specialist in advocacy while the solicitor is a general practitioner who has a most important role in organising cases, the administrative and business side, and so forth.</P>
    <P>Let us take that background and apply it to the question of judicial appointments.  The work of the district court is largely concerned with criminal cases of a routine nature, criminal cases which are not on indictment, and with a limited type of civil jurisdiction.  The solicitor, within his knowledge and competence, is completely capable of dealing with that type of case and very often does not require and does not brief counsel for the work involved there.  Therefore it is very fit and proper that no distinction should be made between the solicitor and the barrister in regard to eligibility for appointment to be a judge of that court, that is, to be a district justice. The actual position is that both are equally eligible and that the authorities when making appointments have regard to personal suitability, and all the rest of it, for the job but take the qualification of being either a barrister or a solicitor to be sufficient without reference to the branch of the profession to which they belong.  That is so for the district court.</P>
    <P>The situation is totally different for the circuit court and the higher courts.  In the case of the circuit court the criminal jurisdiction is wider and the civil jurisdiction is wider.  The <Col N="1290" /> court is competent to deal with a large range of legal matters and in fact it is the usual practice for solicitors to brief barristers on behalf of their clients and to have the cases conducted in that court by barristers.  That is done because in that court the cases that arise have such implications in law and require such standards of preparation and advocacy that a barrister, a specialist, is needed.</P>
    <P>Reverse that and put yourself in the position of the judge sitting on the bench in the circuit court.  Matters of law, particularly in modern times, if any degree of certainty is to be achieved in regard to them, require a great deal of specialised study which can be done only by a barrister.  A busy solicitor, apart from the fact that he could not do his work and keep up with that specialist end of it, would not be in a position to make up individual cases no matter how well he was prepared.  Therefore, having regard to what is going on in the courts, it is not only reasonable but compellable that the judge sitting on the bench should be competent to deal with that case in the first instance, even if there is an appeal.</P>
    <P>I shall not elaborate on that argument any further.  I think that anyone who reflects on it will see that points of common law, statute law and equity in the circuit court raise extremely difficult matters of law.  If there is not to be an automatic appeal to a higher court, the judge trying the case must have competence to deal with the matter.  In those circumstances, one sees why it has been the universal practice to appoint a barrister to that court rather than a solicitor. It is not a question of a closed shop. It is not a question of preference for one branch of the profession over another.</P>
    <P>It is a question of technical competence.  If that technical competence is not in the court of first instance, it can mean only one of two things.  If the technical competence is not there, it can only mean inefficiency, perhaps, wrong decisions or else an appeal mechanism that will involve almost impossible delays <Col N="1291" /> and costs as a matter of course.  So much for the circuit court.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the High Court and the Supreme Court.  It is quite clear that the projection of that argument indicates, quite apart from the consideration of the closed shop, that they are technical appointments for barristers under our present system. I have tried to explain the matter on this basis because sometimes, I think, laymen are under a misapprehension as to what is involved and the importance from the layman's point of view of having competent judges in the courts and properly conditioned judges.</P>
    <P>Experience is another thing that comes into play here.  For the higher courts such as the High Court, the Supreme Court and the Circuit Court, a practising barrister is the condition for appointment, a practising barrister of sufficient number of years standing.  In fact, the people appointed to these posts have gained a terrific amount of experience in just the matters they will be called to decide.  It is really only the barrister in his experience in the court who can in the nature of things and in the actual working out of them acquire the experience.  It is the practising barrister who is actually dealing with these matters by pleading them and who, when he becomes a judge, will have to decide on these matters. No amount of theoretical consideration can compensate for the experience so gleaned and the knowledge that is so acquired in the specialisation which goes with that branch of the profession.</P>
    <P>I have spoken somewhat at length but I think it is no harm to say these things.  I stood up to say them because I have no longer, shall I say, any particular interest in the matter.  Thus, perhaps, I can say them more freely than other members of the House who would know what the situation is.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude these few remarks with this.  What I have said is in regard to the present system.  There are other possibilities.  You can have laymen judges with technical advisers and all that.  I am not widening the field to that.  I am taking the present <Col N="1292" /> system where judges are appointed. Judges have to be not only human beings in the broad sense but have to be experts as well.  I think that, in the nature of things, this must be reserved to the barrister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot claim to be really impartial in this.  I do not think I am any more impartial than Deputy de Valera.  He is one who has been practising at the bar and I am one who previously practised as a member of the solicitors' profession.  I think he has misdirected himself on the main point.  When moving this amendment, I was trying to explain my view in regard to solicitors having the right of audience in the circuit court.  There are some who will have at least as much experience of circuit court practice and procedure as any barrister. There may not be any such at this precise moment, but it is at least possible that there will be at some subsequent time.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera did not really agree with the Parliamentary Secretary because there was a complete conflict of views there.  As I understand the Parliamentary Secretary, the Government's view on this matter is based very largely on the desirability of maintaining rather than breaking with tradition. The Parliamentary Secretary did not state for a moment that the decision was based on the suitability of a solicitor as a circuit court judge but simply that the tradition was of long standing and he was reluctant to break it.</P>
      <P>At the same time, we must remember that the tradition has been built up over many years during a large proportion of which a solicitor had not got the right of audience in the circuit court or what was previously the County Court.  Where tradition has been built up which is not of itself a reasonable one, I do not feel that the Government are justified in maintaining it simply because it is the tradition. I would have more sympathy in a way with Deputy de Valera's view if I could accept it, which, incidentally, I cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He spoke about the comparative knowledge of the law.  I would not agree with that for a moment, believing, as I do, that the difficulty of qualifying <Col N="1293" /> for a solicitor is very much greater than the difficulty of qualifying as a member of the Bar.  I agree that there is a specialisation at the Bar and that whatever the basic knowledge of the law may be, it is more frequently the members of the Bar who study legal decisions and who are more versed in the legal precedents than members of the solicitors' profession.</P>
    <P>Any solicitor who was regularly exercising his right of audience in the circuit court would be well versed in circuit court procedure and practice in regard to the criminal, common law and equity sides.  I think it is quite incorrect to say that simply because a man is a solicitor rather than a barrister, he cannot have the same suitability.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is any point in asking the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this matter but I would ask him to find out, as I think is the case, whether the solicitors' profession have not already made considerable progress in England in advancing their claim to a similar right.  Simply because barristers in Great Britain have not the right of being appointed to the county court bench is no good reason for our not considering doing so here.  Somebody has to do it first.  I think a very reasonable step would be taken here if we did this first and gave this right to the solicitors' profession.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has certain legal training, I understand.  Who is to judge whether a solicitor has or has not technical competence?  If a solicitor does not get an opportunity of submitting himself to some examination, it is not just to say he has not the technical competence.  A solicitor may have ambition and no barrier should be placed in his way.  He may have trained himself.  As I say, a man may have ambition.  Lincoln was a world <Col N="1294" /> figure but lots of people thought he was a &ldquo;galoot&rdquo;.  He was a man touched with genius.</P>
      <P>On principle, I am against this business.  A man should be given an opportunity to prove his worth.  Nobody should judge without some proof.  That is just the point I want to make. I am against the whole business of partition: I am suspect on that word, too.  It is a racket.  At one time, only a man of blue blood could be a lord.  They have got away from that. We have to get away from all those things.  They are really a wrong in order to preserve a vested interest.</P>

      <P>In regard to Deputy Sherwin's last remark, there is one thing I should like to point out to the House in regard to solicitors and barristers.  It is that anybody&mdash; admittedly, there are certain fees to be paid&mdash;without distinction, can become a barrister or a solicitor, if he is of good character.  There are many occupations and trades in this country and in other countries of which that cannot be said, so let Deputy Sherwin sheer off that side.</P>

      <P>To come back to the point, Deputy Booth and myself are not quite <i>ad idem.</i>  I completely agree with Deputy Booth as regards the basic qualification&mdash;completely.  As regards the qualification&mdash;again, I think I was careful.  I shall look up the note of what I said to cover myself on that.  I think, as Deputy Booth pointed out, that it is open in a particular <Col N="1295" /> case to appoint a solicitor even to the circuit court as things stand.  I do not know : I have not checked that.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>All right; it is not.  Even if it were, there is the general over-all situation and it boils down to this.  No matter what practice a solicitor has in the circuit court, many of them invariably, as a matter of practice and as a matter of necessity, have to brief counsel when it comes to any matter involving law or complexity in regard to law and indeed complexity in regard to pleading.  It is because of that, when I put the matter in reverse, that I make the case why it should be a barrister on the bench.  This is the man who will have to deal with it.  Deputy Sherwin mentioned 10 years.  That is the point of experience.  If he has not that experience, it can only mean involving the client in automatic appeals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential point why it should be a barrister is this.  I have seen complicated Land Commission cases in the circuit court, cases that have ultimately gone to the Supreme Court on a case stated.  I have seen complicated equity cases where the rights and the complications of law were all that could arise in one of the higher courts, the only difference being that the amount involved was small and that the case went to the circuit court in order to save expense and give the client a quick and relatively cheap relief.  That case would have to go to the higher courts because of the complexity of interpretation in, <Col N="1296" /> say, equity, or a will case or something like that.  These are all matters which occur on the average, I should say, quite frequently.  When I knew workmen's compensation cases&mdash;I do not know what has happened since&mdash; they were the same fruitful source of litigation.  In all of these cases, the experience, the specialised knowledge and the specialised preparation of the barrister is in direct relation to the bench and the functions of the bench, such as is not the position with a solicitor.</P>
      <P>I am not in any way attempting or pretending either to underrate the solicitor's knowledge or to underrate his competence or his excellence.  In fact, I do agree that in many ways he gets a more thorough training than the barrister but the barrister's real training comes with his experience, as Deputy Booth will know very well.  I feel that these points should be made and should be understood.  Unless you change the whole system&mdash;and there I cover myself again and I would be prepared to argue a wider matter with Deputy Sherwin&mdash;I think you are compelled, in the nature of things, to keep to what has essentially been happening here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concerned here and the Government are concerned with getting the best people as judges.  I think that should be the main objective and the principal aim. To start discussing the qualifications which a judge should have is to open up a vast field.  I suppose the perfect judge would have a very rare combination of qualities.  He should be a man of very considerable knowledge of affairs; a man familiar with the social structure of the country ; a man of experience in legal matters ; a man fully qualified in law; a man of wisdom ; a man of commonsense and a man of humanity.  All these qualities, I think, go to the making up of what we might call a judicial personage.  I think the overall requirement we would like to see in judges is that they should be judicial.  I think we might all personally know a solicitor who would have this combination of qualities and who would be suited to be appointed to the <Col N="1297" /> circuit court bench, but the tradition is&mdash;and it is not just because it is the tradition that we are accepting it&mdash; that the circuit court bench should be reserved exclusively for barristers.</P>
      <P>That tradition is based on a very sound principle to which Deputy de Valera referred.  The circuit court is more concerned with the law than, for instance, the district court where you have a great many factors of one sort or another in the cases coming before it and indeed, where to a certain extent, the law is not the paramount factor.  Because the sort of person required on the circuit court bench must primarily be a specialist in law and trained in legal affairs, these appointments to this court have been traditionallly reserved to barristers.  It is for that reason that the Government propose to adhere to the tradition, while at the same time admitting and saying that they are with reluctance turning down representations made by the solicitors' profession because they realise that in certain circumstances you could get a perfect judge from the solicitors' profession.  I have a lot of sympathy with what Deputy Flanagan said about the district court.  We must all agree that there is a good deal of force in his argument that in rural areas a solicitor is quite likely to make a better district justice than a barrister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly except a circuit-going barrister.  That may come in time.  The barrister members of this House, I think, would be prepared at some future time to contemplate a situation in which that would happen, where we would decide as a matter of policy that only solicitors should be appointed to the district court.  I do not think it is necessary to stipulate it in an Act of Parliament.  That is the sort of thing that would come about by practice and precedent.  It is true to say that by far the greater number of these appointments at the moment are made from the ranks of the solicitors' profession. <Col N="1298" /> A time may come when the district court could be reserved exclusively for solicitors but I do not think it desirable to do it at this stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Sherwin's point, we will, by virtue of amendment No. 83, put a new section, Section 56, into the Bill, which will clearly lay down the statutory rights of solicitors to be heard in the circuit court.  The solicitor has always had that right but there was some doubt as to whether we were continuing it in this Bill and so we are specifically laying it down.  I have no doubt that the courts will have due regard to the wishes of the Oireachtas in this matter.  I could not accept that there could be any situation whereby circuit court judges would make clear their disapproval of solicitors appearing before them by the type of decision they might give.  That is too dreadful to contemplate.  I am confident that when we lay it down that it is the wish of the Oireachtas that solicitors have that right, that will be the end of the matter.</P>
      <P>May I, sitting here, as it were, on the one hand, between the representatives of the solicitors' profession and on the other, the eminent practitioners at the Bar, throw out a suggestion which may bear fruit in time?  Something which both professions might think about and which would solve all our difficulties is if some day we looked forward to the amalgamation of both professions.  I do not know whether an objective of that nature would recommend itself to either of the two professions, or indeed whether there is any thinking along those lines current at the moment. However, it is something which is well worth examining and which we may look forward to at some stage in future.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (a), to add to the paragraph &ldquo;or as President of the Circuit Court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to seek to clarify the position.  I take it that the intention is as it always has been since the post was created, that a practising member of the Bar of ten years' standing may be appointed President of the Circuit Court.  If that is correct, the object of the amendment is to ensure that that will be expressly stated in subsection (2) (a). The subsection as it reads at the moment is open to the interpretation that a practising barrister of not less than 10 years' standing shall be qualified only for appointment as a judge of the circuit court.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be desirable or proper that the presidency of the circuit court should be confined to existing circuit court judges.  In all probability, when there is a vacancy, the President will in fact be appointed from amongst the existing circuit court judges but I do not think it should be confined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with Deputy O'Higgins that it is not desirable that appointment of the President of the Circuit Court should be confined to the existing circuit court judges.  In fact, it is our intention that any barrister of ten years' standing should be qualified for appointment directly to the position of President of the Circuit Court.  I think we achieve that in the Bill as it stands.  If the Deputy and the House will look at Section 4 of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill, they will see that subsection (2) states that the circuit court shall be constituted of the following judges &mdash;(a) a judge, who shall be styled &ldquo;Uachtarán na Cúirte Cuarda&rdquo; (&ldquo;The President of the Circuit Court&rdquo;).  So that the term &ldquo;judge&rdquo; clearly includes the President.  Therefore when we look at subsection (2) (a) of Section 17 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill which states that a person who is for the time being a practising barrister of not less than 10 years' standing shall be qualified as a judge of the circuit <Col N="1300" /> court, and relate that to Section 4 of the other Bill, it is quite clear that the phrase in subsection (2) (a) &ldquo;judge of the Circuit Court&rdquo; includes the President of the Circuit Court and therefore a barrister of ten years' standing who is not necessarily a judge of the circuit court can be appointed President of the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>One small point occurs to me in regard to the Presidency of the Circuit Court.  As I understand it, the President of the Circuit Court <i>ex officio</i> may sit as a judge of the High Court.  Take a situation where a person is appointed a judge of the circuit court and made President of the Circuit Court the next day, or within a matter of months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Or even directly.  He is thus a judge <i>ex officio</i> of the High Court, with possibly only ten years' standing as a practising barrister whereas, in order to become a judge of the High Court, one must be 12 years practising as a barrister.  I do not know whether or not the point is valid, but it might possibly be clarified on further examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is a perfectly valid one.  It could happen.  The only thing I can say is that it is most unlikely.  I do not think it is anything we need worry about.  We must in these matters rely on the good sense of Government, on precedents, tradition, and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very easy for a slip to occur.  There might be somebody whom the Government particularly wishes to favour with only ten years' standing as a barrister who might be made President of the Circuit Court.  It might happen, through inadvertence possibly, that he might be called on to act as a judge of the High Court, in which case I, or anybody else, could walk in and say: &ldquo;Mr. Justice So-and-So, you have no jurisdiction <Col N="1301" /> to try this case.  You are not a qualified person.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no validity in that point.  I thought the point was that, in order to be appointed a judge of the High Court, one must have 12 years' practice whereas one might slip in this way and become an additional judge of the High Court with only ten years' practice.  I thought the suggestion was we should make it ten years in both cases.  It is true the President of the Circuit Court, with only ten years' practice, could become an additional judge of the High Court but his qualifications to act <i>ex officio</i> could not be challenged on that ground because the stipulation governing 12 years' practice applies exclusively to appointment to the High Court.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2) (b).</P>
      <P>I think the case for the deletion of subsection (2) (b) of Section 17 has been strengthened by some of the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks on a previous amendment of mine.  He stated quite clearly that, in his view, while there was a considerable chance of legal complexity in cases heard before the circuit court the law was not, I think he said, paramount or predominant in the district court.  I do not think he meant any disrespect towards the district court.  The fact is, of course, that points of law are not as a general rule raised in the district court.  The majority of cases are minor in content&mdash;illegal parking, drunk and disorderly, or just drunk, and so forth.  While a solicitor, even though practising for many years, in the circuit court, is not deemed the most suitable person for appointment to the circuit court, similarly a barrister or solicitor appointed to the district court is not the most suitable person for promotion to the circuit court.  He should, I think, be disqualified from acting as a circuit court judge.  The practice and procedure in the district court is entirely different from that of the circuit court and would, in fact, be very poor preparation for promotion to that court.</P>
      <P>In principle, I am against judicial promotion.  It is a dangerous practice. It is far better to appoint a level headed solicitor or barrister to the district court&mdash;it is a position of standing and some financial substance&mdash;and leave him there.  Promotion to the circuit court would create a dangerous precedent.  The experience gained in the district court is not a suitable preparation for the circuit court bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Booth has said pretty well what I intended to say on this amendment.  I think we should recognise that promotion in this <Col N="1303" /> field is undesirable.  Under the Constitution there is clear recognition of the separation of the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.  Where there is a written Constitution, it is of the utmost importance that the persons appointed to judicial office should be removed from the temptation of seeking the goodwill of the Executive.  In this subsection there is a facility which would permit a person who accepted appointment as a district justice to look forward to the day when he could, as a result of a favourable decision, be appointed by the Government to the circuit court bench.</P>
      <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reflect on what might be involved if that kind of procedure were permitted. It would mean that a judicial officer, a district justice, who sought promotion&mdash;if the opportunity is there promotion undoubtedly will be sought&mdash; would inevitably seek to make himself pleasing to the Government and bring himself to the notice of the Government. I think that could lead to a lot of very undesirable results and I am firmly of the opinion that when a person is honoured by the President at the instance of the Government and is appointed to an honoured judicial position, he should go in to do his job as a justice or as a judge, in the belief that he is going to remain until such time as he retires or dies.</P>
      <P>I remember reading some years ago a description by Professor Lasky of how the judicial system operates in England.  He said that a judge appointed to the Bench ordinarily for the first three years gave his judgments fully convinced that he was wrong and for the next three years he gave his judgments fully convinced that he was right, but that after that, until he died or retired, he gave his judgments irrespective of whether he was right or wrong.  That is the type of way in which a judge should function.  Certainly, it would be most undesirable that a judge, whoever he might be, should have one eye on the facts of the case and another eye on the effect his decision is likely to have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, for <Col N="1304" /> once, to support the general principle Deputy O'Higgins is advocating here. The danger, looking at it in the present modern context, does not come so much from the danger of incurring political favour with a Government or looking to a Government or the temptation to please a particular Government.  There is much more subtle danger involved, the danger of being well got with the administrative machine, the danger of being the victim of a fear that if they differ with the administrative machine and the Executive or the Minister rather than the titular Executive at the top, they will be classed as difficult people, or something like that, and that it is easier to take the line in accordance with the administrative machine and life will not only be easier, but prospects better.  That is the danger in regard to the lower court, in fact, in the modern context.</P>
      <P>I am not taking away from the danger in principle that Deputy O'Higgins has mentioned in regard to promotion.  It is a very difficult problem, especially when you go higher.  If you accept the principle of promotion of judicial appointments, I find it very hard to get away from the danger there is to the independence of the judiciary, embracing all judges and justices in the term &ldquo;judiciary&rdquo;.  It is extremely difficult to maintain that principle if the judiciary are in that way dependent on the Executive and the only way I can see out of that is the traditional way, that is, to pay all judges sufficient and to give them sufficient status to compensate for the finality of the original appointment.  That goes particularly for appointment from one court to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do confess I see grave difficulty in the appointment to some of the higher offices like appointments as President of some court or other, Chief Justice, or something like that.  The normal requirement would very often indicate that the best person suited for that post would be somebody who had already judicial experience.  That is a very difficult problem to resolve but I think it is minimised if the principle of having no promotion from court to court is <Col N="1305" /> adhered to.  Then the possibility of selecting an individual for these particular presiding posts is made easier.</P>
    <P>I felt compelled to add my voice to those who have expressed fear of this principle of promotion.  Otherwise, the courts will simply tend to become instruments of the Executive.  Again, I am talking in principle.  If that were to be the pattern in which the situation was likely to develop, it would be very important indeed for us, perhaps, to look at the whole judicial system. There might be a question of recasting that in a new context.</P>
    <P>There is another thing we have to bear in mind in this country also and, again, it is a matter of importance, namely, that our Supreme Court has an important constitutional rôle and, in the concept of the Constitution, our Supreme Court is a constitutional counterbalance to the Executive and the Parliament.  At least, that is the concept of it.  If that is to be a reality, the principle of the independence of the judiciary is an extremely important one.</P>
    <P>These are, perhaps, theoretical points but theoretical points, when they are the matters of principle raised by Deputy O'Higgins, are well worth our attention and are necessary guides sometimes in practice.  I do not think I would help by trying to elaborate on particular hypothetical cases.  That would do more harm than good.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will understand the spirit in which this point is made, and very sincerely made, from both sides of the House.</P>

I will go further and say that, indeed, it is an argument which can very well be advanced and has a deal to support it.  I have said here when we were discussing a similar type of amendment to this which Deputy O'Higgins put down dealing with the question of promotion from the circuit court to the High Court, that we would all be reluctant to contemplate the idea of promotion from one court to another as any sort of general practice. <Col N="1306" /> The arguments against such a thing are very obvious.  They have been mentioned.  The argument that individual judges or justices might be inclined to temper their views and their judgments in order to seek favour from somebody or other is there and is quite clear, and it is one to which we must give due regard.  I will go further and say I think we could all agree that any sort of wholesale practice of promotion from court to court would be undesirable, but I want to point out that the possibility of a barrister district justice being promoted to the circuit court has been there since 1924.</P>

      <P>It has never been used and, more important than that, we have no evidence whatever that the barrister district justices at any time have ever given any indication that they were attempting to curry favour with the Government or with anybody else.  I think we can all be very proud and I am sure we all are very proud of the independence of the judiciary in this country.  We consider that it is something that will always be maintained and anything any of us can do in this House to ensure it will be upheld we should be willing to do.</P>
      <P>The best argument I can put forward against this proposal is that the power has been there for 37 years and, in practice, has never been used.  I think it is extremely unlikely that it will ever be used.  That is a tremendous addition to the weight of precedent which has been brought to bear on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said all that, bearing in mind, as we do, the undesirability of the idea of promotion, it is right that we should contemplate a situation when we might have a particularly outstanding person in the district court. I do not think we should, by law, exclude forever the possibility of a Government being able to call on such a person and to appoint him to the circuit court, if he were the only really <Col N="1307" /> suitable person available and the best person who could be got for such an appointment.</P>
    <P>There is also the aspect of an anomaly that would arise if we were to adopt the proposal which would have the result that a man with ten years' practice as a barrister would be eligible for appointment to the district court. He can practise as a barrister for 12 years and then as a district court justice for another five years.  He can gain all the experience that five years sitting on a district court bench would give on top of his 12 years' experience at the Bar, and he would not be eligible for promotion to the circuit court whereas a barrister with nothing more than 10 years' experience practising at the Bar would be eligible. That is a little anomaly.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be impolite to the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said that this point is there; it is pretty well unanswerable, but we will ignore it.  There is no doubt that promotion is bad in principle.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary he agrees that it is undesirable and then, having said that, I should have felt that he would have been driven inevitably to the conclusion that the power to provide for promotion should not be in our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that it was in the 1924 Act but it is also true that it has never been availed of over the past 37 years. Despite the fact that there were successive different Governments, no existing appointee as district justice was, in fact, appointed to the circuit court. Therefore, the power was there over <Col N="1308" /> a long period but it was not exercised and no circumstances arose in which any Government were tempted to use it.  In those circumstances, I do not see why the power should be retained in this Act.</P>
    <P>It is a power to act in contravention of a principle, which everyone recognises as being a correct principle, that there should not be promotion. The Parliamentary Secretary says there can be exceptional circumstances and an exceptional man, but we should not legislate for exceptional or improbable circumstances.  In fact, one's experience has shown that those circumstances have not arisen for nearly 40 years.  The Parliamentary Secretary says there would be an anomaly and that a person with some 10 years experience at the Bar might be appointed a district justice and after serving for five or six years in the district court the question might arise as to whether he should be considered for appointment to the circuit court as against a barrister with 10 years in practice.</P>
    <P>Certainly, as between them, if one were merely to consider the question of experience and practicability one would feel that there was not very much in it, but there is the principle that a man who is appointed to the district court bench and takes that appointment should be glad to get it, and realise that no matter how long he might be there that is his job, he is the holder of a judicial office and cannot be promoted beyond that I do not see any answer to that.</P>
    <P>I think it would be most undesirable and a sign of very bad government if at any time the Government of this country began looking around and saying: &ldquo;There is a man with 10 years' practice at the Bar who has now served for 10 years on the district court bench.  He is a person in whom we have confidence and we therefore propose to appoint him to the circuit court as against any other person who might be in practice there at the moment.&rdquo;  The very moment that is done once&mdash;and once the power is there to do it it might be done once&mdash; you can write off any idea of an <Col N="1309" /> independent, steadfast, stalwart judiciary. The rot will have set in and the difficulties obviously will be increased.</P>

      <P>Let me add something to what Deputy O'Higgins has said.  Here is the way it will work. The person who will be promoted will be promoted on suitability and sound decisions.  I am talking in theory now.  One of the things which would help a man would be sound decisions, and from the Minister's point of view sound decisions would be a good sound record of convictions especially in a certain type of case.  I am not suggesting any deliberateness in this but I am pointing out the natural human psychology.  We must look not only to the independence of the judiciary but to the rights of the individual about which we all talk so much.</P>

      <P>I find some difficulty in accepting the Parliamentary Secretary's proposal that this subsection should be retained because of the possibility of an outstanding person becoming available as a district justice and thereby qualifying for promotion to the circuit court bench.  The point I was trying to make on amendment No. 41 was that while there might not at the moment be a solicitor of sufficient standing in the circuit court to justify his promotion, a changed situation might well arise.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not seem to be in the slightest bit impressed by that argument and now he produces it in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If solicitors as such are to be precluded from being appointed as judges of the circuit court, exactly the same circumstances must apply to justices of the district court.  I feel quite definitely that the longer a man sits as a district justice the better qualified he should be in that particular office.  I also feel that the longer he sits as a district justice, the less qualified he will become to act as a circuit court judge because the whole trend of his thinking will be away from the complexities of the law.  He will be dealing with a completely different set-up and type of case and he will not have any need, <Col N="1310" /> nor probably any opportunity, for sitting on legal decisions and precedents. He could very well go to the circuit court very ill-prepared indeed and worse prepared than a barrister of 10 years' standing.  I hope the Government will not be unduly impressed by tradition in this case.  In actual fact the tradition in this case is purely theoretical.</P>
    <P>If there had been a tradition that district justices were being promoted to the circuit court, I can see that the Government might be slow to break off a tradition unless it was very desirable. But in actual fact there is no tradition at all except a tradition to have a certain provision implemented in a statute. Since that statutory provision has never been invoked in 37 years, it has been proved to be entirely unnecessary.  I feel it is not only unnecessary but undesirable, and I would strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join in the general condemnation of this subsection (2) (b).  The unanswered and unanswerable argument against it is that in 37 years it has never been found necessary to use it.  One must look back at the circumstances in which the 1924 Act was passed and where this matter of service in the lower courts was regarded as a prerequisite to enable promotion to be made to the higher courts.  That was put into the 1924 Act with regard to the circuit court and the High Court, on the one hand, and the Supreme Court, on the other.</P>
      <P>The situation was somewhat confused. New courts were being established. There was excellent material offering for all the courts.  There were some phenomenal appointments made to district justice in those early days. A person who might be regarded over the years as the permanent Attorney General, and who recently retired from that office, was a district justice in his day.  He came from a considerable practice, went into the district justice post and eventually went into the office of Attorney General.  There were quite a number of people.  I am reminded of another person who had an amazingly large practice at the Bar and who became a district justice.  He got rather tired of the district justice position after a bit and took a post in the Department of Justice from which he later went back to the Bar.  He was an outstanding success until his premature death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was great material offering at the time.  It was deliberated on at the time.  I understand it was said it might be wrong to have a man chosen to go into a particular appointment in the law courts and this qualifying clause was brought in to preclude him from appointment if he was not at the time of his appointment a practising barrister. Am I right in saying there is only one example in the whole court system of what was a real promotion?  That exceptional case proves the rule that would be established if we obliterated this section.  That was a particular person who was offered a High Court judgeship, but, in his humility, decided to refuse it.  He was then given what <Col N="1312" /> amounted to a postponed warrant of appointment by the then Government, who left it in his hands to decide when he thought he was by experience and practice at a point where he might attain to the higher position.  He was eventually appointed to the higher position, but he was a person who had actually been given the warrant of appointment in the first instance and refused himself to accept it.  If over the whole series of courts, in regard to this question of service as a judge in a lower court being regarded as a prerequisite to enable a person to qualify for the higher appointment, there is only this one example&mdash;I do not think it is a real example&mdash;I think it is surely time to withdraw this.</P>
    <P>We could say &ldquo;Leave it as it is; it is only dead wood,&rdquo; but it is a standing temptation.  When it is there and we are giving people appointments, it is a temptation to give them preferment. Deputy de Valera put it that people were inconsistent in their judgment and feared the administrative machine.  Political temptation, however, is there the whole time.</P>
    <P>We talk about an independent judiciary.  Let us say they are independent once they become judges, but there is no independence in the approach to the judicial office.  I have heard people who were eventually appointed judges being praised in this House because as Deputies of the Fianna Fáil back benches, they appeared on their lorries&mdash;not as much as they should have, but they did appear.  That was apparently regarded as a qualification for judicial office.  If a person takes up a judicial office, he should then remain where he is put. There should be no question of his currying further favours either by appealing to the administration or being more of a politician.  He should not be allowed to look for preferment. But that possibility offers to him so long as that subsection is there.  If we have not found it necessary to use that clause, put in under very different circumstances, it is about time we removed it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I should not say at this stage exactly what I hope I conveyed in my earlier <Col N="1313" /> remarks.  I do not really think there is anything undesirable in the principle of promotion.  I think it is perfectly right to contemplate, in proper circumstances, the idea of a judge being promoted from one court to another.  I have gone along with the Deputies who have argued on this point to the extent of saying that the fact that you go for promotion could give rise to dangers if it were abused. Somebody here put it that there is some element of an invitation there at some stage, maybe, unscrupulously to avail of this provision.</P>
      <P>If I were coming to this matter for the first time and legislating about it <i>de novo</i>, it is possible I would not include any such provision in the Bill, despite the fact that would have the anomalous effect I have already mentioned, namely, that a barrister of ten years' standing only would be entitled to be appointed to the circuit court whereas a barrister of 12 years' standing, plus five years in the district court, would not.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that that anomaly would arise, I still think it is possible that if we were approaching this completely afresh and if there were no existing law there to be considered, we might not make this provision.  I am not sure, but the provision is there.  It is a very remote thing.  This, if you like, is a privilege that district justices have at the moment.  A conscientious hardworking justice can contemplate that if he devotes himself zealously and earnestly to the efficient discharge of his functions and duties, a situation may arise where he may be promoted for perfectly worthy reasons to the circuit court.  I admit it is very remote but it is the sort of perquisite that district justices have and we would be taking it away from them.  There is also the aspect of anomaly that would arise if we were to remove subsection (2) (b).  We have the assurance of the protection of the 37 years of precedent and I think it is better to leave the provision there than take it away. I must admit the possibility that at some future date it could be abused but the possibility is so remote that it is not one we need worry about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two objections to this.  I object to it on the general ground of promotion from court to court.  That is an objection in principle. My second objection is an objection in relation to practice, that selecting somebody from a lower court for a vacancy in a higher one&mdash;and this applies to many professions&mdash;automatically means one of two things, that the material is not available among the people already in practice or that if the material is there, the ordinary outlet is not being used.  It is disadvantageous particularly to younger persons in the profession to have a choking at the top.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty I see in this subsection is that while it was in the Act of 1924, the circumstances, as explained by Deputy McGilligan, are somewhat different and the atmosphere in which we live is quite different.  At the moment it is easy to see who are the barristers on the district court bench.  By a further look at any law calendar, it is easy to see the date of their admission as members of the Bar. When one narrows that down, it can then be seen how many of those barristers were appointed to the district court bench with the necessary period of six years or over but with less than ten at that time.</P>
      <P>In the event of this provision being used&mdash;although I am inclined to accept the Parliamentary Secretary's expression of good intentions in this regard &mdash;it is so easy not alone for members of the profession but members of the general public to say: &ldquo;Now we know why subsection (2) (b) was retained. It was in order to benefit a particular person who, while he had the six years and was a district justice for a time, did not have the qualifying period of ten years which was necessary to bring him in.&rdquo;  I see that difficulty.  I am not speaking personally and I have nobody in mind.  But the whole thing can be held up to ridicule in the event of its happening.  In the event of its not happening, it lies buried and innocuous. As soon as it does happen, there will be a certain amount of criticism outside.  It will not be expressed publicly but privately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> This is an enabling subsection that would be highly contentious and one which would bring scorn and ridicule not alone upon the Executive but upon the judiciary itself that somebody has been selected for them.  It may be quite wrong.  The man selected might well have all the qualities the Parliamentary Secretary attributes to him, but the very fact that he was short of that qualification without this enabling clause enables people to cricitise it.  I am not saying it applies to this Government alone.  This would enable the Opposition to the Government in power to say: &ldquo;Surely he was one of themselves.  He was specially selected.&rdquo; You hear it very often in relation to other things.</P>
    <P>It may be wrong but it is very important that the finger of scorn, which is almost identical at the moment with the finger of preferment, should not be pointed at any person appointed to the circuit court bench.  There is great force in what Deputy O'Higgins says that if a person is honoured by being appointed to the district court bench and if he is satisfied with that at that time, it should be his privilege to continue to stay in the position of honour which has been given to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are arguing not so much against the subsection as against the Government coming along to exercise it at any moment.  Consider the position if the Government sought to avail of this subsection.  The Opposition in the House would be able to point to the fact that this appointment was not made in 37 years or more and the Government would have to be in a very strong position to justify the appointment.</P>

      <P>What I mean is that the Government would have to be very well fortified in their belief to face up to the general body of criticism that would arise in the House and outside it.  Of course there is this about it.  The provision does not apply to solicitor <Col N="1316" /> district justices and they are in the majority and will continue to be in the majority.  Therefore, I feel the provision itself is quite innocuous.  I suppose it is a fairly fine decision whether to take it out or leave it there, particularly as it has been a dead letter for 37 years, but as it is so innocuous and as there is a possibility that some day it may need to be availed of in very meritorious circumstances, I think the House should leave it there.</P>

      <P>With regard to the qualifications of judges, it is a well-known fact that the main qualification for becoming a judge of any court in this country is a political qualification. Without that, you cannot hope to succeed, except a reservation is made for a religious appointment to the High Court Bench, but all other appointments are made on a political basis. Even though that has been the established practice since the foundation of the State, I think the time is now at hand for a change in that system and for devising some more impartial way of appointing members of the judiciary.</P>
      <P>What must a barrister do at the present time if he hopes to become a judge?  First of all, he must visit some place like West Cork because I heard numerous members of the Bar who support the Government Party speak at the different church gates in that area.  He must go along from church gate to church gate speaking at political meetings and exert himself in every possible way to promote the Government interest.  That is absolutely essential.

      <P>The rules of the House do not allow us to take these judges one by one.  If we were to do so, that is what you would find. I remember a recent appointment where the person in question was speaking at a political meeting in this city.  I was passing by at the time and I stopped to listen to him for a few minutes addressing a political meeting in support of a by-election candidate.

      <P>I think that system is wrong.  I am not blaming the Government for this.  I have stated that this is the system that has been applied since the establishment of the State under all Governments and that it is impossible for a barrister to become a judge, unless he attaches himself very closely to a political Party which is likely to form the Government. I have some sympathy for those junior barristers and a few solicitors who come to places like West Cork to speak at political meetings. It is rather difficult for them. At the same time, I have to reflect on how they fared.  A few were appointed to the Bench and one got the consolation of being appointed a State Solicitor.  Apparently, the people who attach themselves to political Parties are not doing badly.</P>
      <P>The fact that a barrister is attached to a political Party should not preclude his appointment in any way.  Any person is entitled to attach himself to any Party he decides on but he should not get preferential treatment on that account.  We have a substantial number of members of the Bar in this country who hold independent views politically.  In other words, they do not go round to church gates airing their views publicly.  These members of the Bar, under the present system, have no chance of being appointed to the Bench.  I feel that they should have their chances and should be in the running just as well as the others who are politically attached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> I am asking the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary to revise what I would term a deplorable system because the question will arise as to whether we have the respect we should have for our courts.  We find these people going along to public meetings in the towns and villages.  Some of them express themselves in terms that are not creditable in order to get their case across to their listeners.  Then we find them on the Bench a short time afterwards.  That is not conductive to respect for our judiciary.</P>
    <P>I appeal, as strongly as I possibly can, to the Government to revise this system and to set up some kind of an appointments commission so that, when a vacancy exists for a Supreme Court judge, a High Court judge, a Circuit Court judge or a district justice, these barristers, who are qualified according to the terms of this section and who have the prescribed experience, will have a chance of applying.  The more suitable candidate should be appointed in the same way as the more suitable applicants are appointed when other vacancies arise.</P>

Of course the Parliamentary Secretary is more knowledgeable in that field and it may happen that the Government Party are exercising influence in that field, too&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If that is the case, it should not continue.  I would appeal to the Government to revise the system.  Before I conclude, could the Parliamentary Secretary tell me how many judges on the High Court Bench were people who endeavoured to get into this House and who were political candidates?  Judging by the vote they got at the elections, they had no hope of coming in here, because many of them failed to get a four-figure vote. It is reasonable to assume that it was not at this House they were aiming when they offered themselves as candidates on behalf of the then Government Party or other Government Parties but that they were endeavouring to get into a house elsewhere.  That is the system I want to see ended.  It has existed for 40 years and it is time to do away with it.</P>

      <P>This is not the first time that this argument has been put forward in the House.  I want to emphasise at the outset that the appointment of judges is a matter for the President constitutionally.  The President, and not the Government, appoints judges.  Constitutionally, the President appoints judges, not the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution places fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Government the duty of advising the President as to the appointments he should make.  The Government cannot get out of that responsibility.  It is a constitutional responsibility which is placed on the Government and they cannot escape or shuffle it off or delegate it or anything else.  It is a function that very properly and rightly devolves upon them and they must face up to it and exercise it.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in the debate on the Courts of Justice Bill, 1959, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" />&ldquo;The appointment of members of the Judiciary is an important function of Government and to my last breath I shall oppose any proposition to transfer that function to some bureaucratic institution or committee. The independence of the individual judge in the exercise of his judicial functions is very important, but that the Government elected by the people is superior in status and function to any other branch of the administration is a principle we must assert&mdash;a principle always asserted by those who understand the real functioning of democratic institutions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, to my mind, is the real issue we have here.  It would be constitutionally impossible to appoint any institution other than the Government to take upon itself this function of advising the President with regard to these appointments.</P>
    <P>If we are to accept the argument that there is something wrong with judicial appointments at the moment and we must also accept that the Government must carry out this function, then the only other thing that follows is that we would have to preclude all barristers and all members of the legal profession from having any part whatever in politics.  That would be ridiculous.  We all know that, from earliest times, down through the centuries, the professions of politics and the law have been very closely associated and that from time to time in different societies they were practically inseparable.</P>
    <P>It would be absurd to suggest that a barrister or solicitor should be precluded from any political activity whatever.  Once we accept that proposition, then it must follow that the Government, in making appointments to the Bench, must necessarily from time to time appoint people who have political leanings one way or another. At the moment, on the Bench in the Supreme Court and the High Court, there are people who never had political affiliations with one Party or another.  There are appointments made traditionally to the High Court and the Supreme Court of people who <Col N="1321" /> have not and never would have any political leanings or political associations.</P>
    <P>It would be invidious for me to mention names here but there is one well-known person who was a most prominent supporter and member of the Opposition who was appointed to the Bench by this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

      <P>There was no political motive.  I am not sure that this matter should be debated on this section but, once the argument has been put forward by Deputy Murphy, I feel I should reply to it.  I am quite confident that we have, under the present system of appointment, an excellent and independent judiciary of whom we can all be proud.  Therefore, the end product is there.  If the end product is there, it is fairly reasonable to assume that the system must be all right.  The system can be justified completely on a logical basis.  The Constitution lays down that the Government must exercise this function.  Once you accept that, then the rest all follows.</P>
      <P>It is nonsense to suggest that every appointment to the Bench in this country is made on a political basis.  I am quite certain that 95 per cent.  of appointments are the best appointments that can be made.</P>

I have never heard such superficial arguments of the type produced by the Parliamentary Secretary in answer to what is well known.  It is nonsense to say in this House that the best people are appointed to the Bench.  That simply is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that there are a number of people on <Col N="1322" /> the Bench who have no political affiliations.  I have been turning over in my mind as he spoke what I know to be the position: I am speaking of the higher courts.  I do not recognise the people the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned.  I know certain people on the Bench who were affiliated to both Parties at different times.  The position some of them took up at a particular moment coincided with the chance of preferment but nobody who knows the country can say that the best people in the profession are selected for appointment to the Bench.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>It may be the position that after people of less merit than other people get judicial appointments, they make good judges.  I am not for a moment questioning the partiality or impartiality of judges, but to say that their appointment is on the basis of merit is not realistic.</P>

      <P>That brings in all that Deputy Murphy is talking about. I remember being down in Deputy Murphy's area, around West Cork, at one election.  There was an arrangement between the two Parties to have their meetings at different times.  One meeting was being rather unduly prolonged and a question was asked about it whereupon an announcement was made from the platform to the effect that the meeting was late because a speaker, &ldquo;a man of European reputation on the topic of `neutrality' &rdquo;&mdash;as it was termed&mdash;&ldquo;was about to make his appearance.&rdquo;  Then, up stood a young member of my profession who has now been invested in terms of respect because he is on the Bench.  I have no doubt it was political.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course politics are definitely at the background of these appointments. It is nonsensical to say that is not so. One can say that and make the definite statement that meritorious people have been passed over and over again in favour of people who are very much inferior to them in legal capacity, experience, training, world outlook, and so on.  I do not want to be interpreted as saying that when the <Col N="1323" /> judges go on the Bench, they do not preserve impartiality.</P>
    <P>With regard to the details of Section 17, subsection (1) (b) mentions &ldquo;qualified for appointment as an ordinary judge.&rdquo;  I have flogged that matter of &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; judge.  I ask again that these people will not be styled in their warrants of appointment &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; judge but &ldquo;judge&rdquo; because that is what the Constitution recognises.  If we cannot get agreement about that phrase, let us at least know what we are trying to put into a formula.  The qualification is, as far as the judges of the circuit court are concerned, in subsection (2) (a) &ldquo;A person who is for the time being a practising barrister of not less than 10 years' standing.&rdquo;  That is the formula in all matters of appointment.  The number of years varies but the phrase is running right through the Bill, &ldquo;for the time being a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than blank years standing.&rdquo;  When this was before the House on the last occasion, the Parliamentary Secretary said that he took that to mean that a person had to be in practice for ten years or 12 years as the case might be. If that is the intention&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear that I was not saying that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  Then there is agreement that this does not mean what it is ordinarily supposed to mean.  In the other Acts, it was at the time of his appointment and Deputy Sherwin asked was there any significance in the change.  The qualification therefore is that on the date on which the person is appointed he must be in practice either as a barrister or a solicitor and must have a standing of so many years.  I put it to the House and it is backed by case law that that means there must be this period elapsing from the date of his qualification or profession until the date of his appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person need not be in actual practice, or in practice at all except that he shows himself, so to speak, in the area of practice&mdash;in the Law Library, for instance, if he is a barrister&mdash;a few days or hours before he is appointed. <Col N="1324" /> I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that it must be within his knowledge that a person was appointed to a court having been for the greater part of the qualifying period a full time journalist and had not practised the four, five or six years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not in complete agreement with Deputy Murphy in regard to the matter of appointment.  If a body such as the Local Appointments Commission recommended somebody before everybody else and the Government did not take that forward as advice to the President, there could be trouble and there could be trouble here also. The President must act on the advice of the Government but the Government could also act on the advice of a body such as the Local Appointments Commission or some other body.  This matter has been agitated throughout the country for many years.  There are people who have strong views on it.  I think we could get a better system of appointment and I would be very glad to see some other form put into operation.</P>

We all know that.  The Parliamentary Secretary should not try to be a little untruthful, because it is foreign to his nature.  He should not try to get across points which have no foundation in fact.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated also that if my contention was upheld it would mean barristers could not affiliate themselves to any political Party.  I made no such statement. Association with a political Party should not be in any way a hindrance to appointment to the Bench but it should not mean preferential treatment, which is the case at the moment. I am casting no reflections on the members of the Bench, but the Parliamentary Secretary seems to think that they were the best that could be got down through the years.  I think Deputy McGilligan has answered that point effectively.  He has much more experience in that field than the majority in this House.  Everybody knows that the most suitable applicants are not appointed; how could they be if they are outdone by people with the desired political qualifications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary should be sufficiently convinced of the falsity of his outlook on this matter to recommend to the Minister and the Government that it is time to review this system.  There would be much more respect for our judges and for their decisions if they were appointed on some basis other than their political qualification which is <Col N="1326" /> the main qualification one must hold today if one wants to be appointed to the Bench.  Some of the appointments are made on a religious basis in order to straighten out matters a little.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a point I raised previously where a similar phrase to that set out in subsection (2) is used in regard to another <Col N="1328" /> court.  This point puzzled me on an earlier occasion and the explanation given on the previous occasion was that it would cover a very special and exceptional case.  The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>Where a judge of the Circuit Court is removed from office on account of incapacity, he shall be deemed for the purpose of pension to have vacated his office owing to permanent infirmity.</P>
      <P>I was wondering why should we treat a judge who becomes handicapped in this lenient way?  A judge who finds his mental or physical strength weakening can always retire by sending in his resignation.  If he has a certain number of years' service he will qualify for pension.  It was explained on the last occasion that this provision was put in to meet the exceptional case of a judge who becomes so infirm that he cannot send in a letter of resignation.  That is a very special case.  It has never arisen so far and I feel that, if that is the only case that has to be met, then the phrasing should be modified to aim particularly at that.  I still do not think this provision is necessary. If a judge becomes so infirm that he cannot send in a letter of resignation and this House has by Resolution to remove him on grounds of incapacity, the House could, at that point, if so minded, pass legislation ensuring pension rights to such a person.  This phrase occurred also in the Act of 1946 in connection with the district court.  Was the explanation now given given at that point also&mdash;that this is to meet the case of a person so infirm that he cannot resign?  I do not remember it.</P>

      <P>The answer to the last question is &ldquo;Yes, that explanation was, in fact, given for that particular provision at that time&rdquo;.  District justices have had this provision applied to them since 1946.  I think it is a very sensible and a very fair provision.  Here, we are dealing with the case of a circuit court judge who, through no fault of his own, becomes completely incapacitated and incapable of resigning because of paralysis, mental disorder, or something like <Col N="1329" /> that.  Why should he be victimised? Is it not only just that we should, as part of the privilege of his office, defend that privilege by statute to ensure, in the event of calamity, that he will be entitled to his pension in the same way as if he vacated his office of his own volition because of permanent incapacity?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2), to insert the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Circuit Court shall, concurrently with the High Court, have and exercise the jurisdiction in lunacy matters which was conferred on the Lord Chancellor of Ireland by section 68 of the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act, 1871, that is to say, in cases where the property of the person alleged to be of unsound mind and incapable of managing his affairs does not exceed two thousand pounds in value or the income therefrom does not exceed one hundred pounds per annum.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment gives the circuit court the statutory jurisdiction which the existing High Court possesses under Section 68 of the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act, 1871.  As the Bill stands, it proposes to give the circuit court jurisdiction in lunacy matters where the property of the persons concerned, in so far as it consists of personalty, does not exceed £2,000 in amount or value or, in so far as it consists of land, does not exceed £60 in rateable valuation.  This is the effect of Section 22 (1) and reference No. 28 of the Third Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been represented to me that the provisions in the Third Schedule continue certain doubts which exist under the present law as to the jurisdiction of the circuit court in lunacy cases&mdash;for example, the question of the right to have the issue as to sanity <Col N="1330" /> decided by a jury.  Section 68 of the 1871 Act empowered the Lord Chancellor, where the property of the insane person did not exceed £2,000 in value or £100 per annum, to apply it for his benefit in a summary manner, without directing any inquiry under a Commission of Lunacy, i.e. an inquiry by a Commissioner sitting with a jury. It will be more convenient and consistent to follow the framework of Section 68 in giving the increased jurisdiction which the Bill proposes.</P>
    <P>As a consequence reference number 28 of the Third Schedule is being deleted and the Lunacy (Ireland) Act, 1880, which conferred its existing jurisdiction on the circuit court is being repealed. That is being done by amendments Nos. 89 and 94.</P>

      <P>Under the subsection as it is in the Bill at the moment power is given to the Minister in effect to shuffle the circuit judges any way he pleases.  He can, as I read subsections (c) and (d), alter existing circuits at will; he can change the disposition of circuit judges at will and, generally, he can completely reorganise and change the manner in which the circuit court operates in its eight circuits.  I do not think that is desirable.</P>
      <P>If the circuit court is to function properly it should be a court of some certainty.  Circuits should be defined and clearly understood and, in my view, should be defined by statute.  A circuit judge, when he is appointed to a circuit, should be appointed in the knowledge that he is a permanent judge of the circuit court in that particular circuit.  The manner in which circuits from time to time are changed, the manner in which circuit judges are from time to time translated from one circuit to another is undesirable and leads to uncertainty and in my view has not worked out well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may say: &ldquo;Well, from time to time it may be found necessary by reason of change in the amount of business being done in a particular circuit area, <Col N="1333" /> due to changes in population, to change the judges.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>(1)  The circuits created under section 16 (repealed by this Act) of the Act of 1953 shall be the circuits for the purposes of the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>(2)  (a) Where a person is appointed a judge of the Circuit Court, the Government shall permanently assign him to a particular circuit.</P>
      <P>It is not contemplated at all that that will be changed by Government Orders.  Subsections (2) (c) and (d) of Section 22 clearly refer to the jurisdictions given to circuit judges.</P>

      <P>Oddly enough, I think subsection (2) (c) will have to be reconsidered but for a completely different reason.  Subsection (2) (a) of Section 22 reads:</P>
      <P>The Circuit Court shall have and exercise the several jurisdictions which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  were, under or by virtue of any enactment set out in column (2)  of the Fourth Schedule to this Act, formerly vested in or capable of being exercised by chairmen of quarter sessions, recorders, county court judges, or quarter sessions, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  were, immediately before the operative date, vested in or <Col N="1334" /> capable of being exercised by the existing Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>In other words, it is an omnibus provision conferring on the circuit court set up under the Bill the various powers, functions, jurisdictions, and so on which were exercised by previous circuit courts.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (c) merely goes on to stipulate that the Minister may by order vest in the new circuit court some power or some function or some jurisdiction which, through inadvertence, had not been specified in the Fourth Schedule but in its attempt to do that it does not do it terribly well and it may have to be looked at again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>Before section 26 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A judge of the Circuit Court may, at his discretion, transfer the trial of a criminal issue which is for trial before him to the Central Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>(2)  A judge of the Circuit Court may, if he thinks fit, transfer the trial of a criminal issue from the place in his circuit where it is required by law to be held to any other place in that circuit, and, in that event, the trial shall be held at the place to which it is transferred with a jury drawn from the jury district or other area prescribed for trials by the Circuit Court sitting in the latter place.</P>
      <P>(3)  An order of a judge of the Circuit Court under <i>subsection</i> (1) or <i>subsection</i> (2) of this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  may be made only on the application of the Attorney General or an accused person,</P>
      <P>(b)  may provide for matters ancillary or incidental to the transfer, and</P>
      <P>(c)  shall be final and unappealable.</P>
      <P>This amendment and amendment No. 59 deal with the sending forward for trial of accused persons from the district court to the Central Criminal Court in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) of the section which this amendment proposes to substitute for Section 26 of the Bill, in conjunction with the new section proposed by amendment No. 59, represents a different approach to the problem with which subsections (1), (2) and (4) of <Col N="1337" /> the existing Section 26 propose to deal. That problem is the abuse to which the present automatic right of an accused person to have his trial transferred to the Central Criminal Court has given rise.  As mentioned by the Minister in his introductory speech, cases have been transferred to the Central Criminal Court for no better reason than to secure an adjournment which had been properly refused, or to suit counsel or because the accused wanted to postpone the evil day.  The abuse is particularly noticeable in Dublin because jurors for the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and the Central Criminal Court are drawn from the same jury book so that an accused in Dublin has not the excuse of a country accused that by applying for a transfer he can avoid having to appear before the local jury.</P>
    <P>Subsections (1) to (4) of the existing Section 26 had the limited object of avoiding the unnecessary expense and inconvenience which is caused to witnesses and jurors by having to be present at the circuit criminal court for a case which is transferred to the Central Criminal Court.  These provisions required the Attorney General or the accused to give seven days notice of intention to make an application for a transfer.</P>
    <P>I believe that the revised proposals contained in this amendment and in amendment No. 59 are a better approach to the problem.  The House will see that an accused person who is returned for trial on a serious offence &mdash;that is an offence carrying a maximum penalty of more than five years penal servitude&mdash;will have an absolute right to be returned for trial to the Central Criminal Court instead of to the Circuit Criminal Court, if he so applies.</P>
    <P>Where the accused person is returned for trial to the circuit court, either because the offence in question is not a serious offence within the definition I have just given or because he did not apply to be sent forward for trial to the Central Criminal Court when he was being returned for trial by the district court, then, in such case, the court is being given discretion to grant <Col N="1338" /> an application by the accused or by the Attorney General to transfer the case to the Central Criminal Court at that stage.  The amendment will be as effective as the present provisions in preventing inconvenience and expense to witnesses and jurors but it will also help to confine the time spent by the High Court judges on trials which the Oireachtas intended should be handled by the circuit court in ordinary circumstances. I think it is fair to say that the amendments achieve this object without any undue curtailment of the accused's rights.</P>

Under subsection (3) an order may be made only on the application of the Attorney General or the accused person, and may provide for certain ancillary matters.  The section we are amending at subsection (1) (b) provides that notice must be served on the Attorney General within seven days or the circuit court judge must grant the application.

If the accused passes up that right then it goes to the Circuit Criminal Court and he no longer has the absolute right.  He may apply to the Circuit Court and it is at the discretion of the circuit court judge whether he gets the transfer or not.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a statement regarding the hours of meeting next week.  The Whips <Col N="1347" /> have been meeting and have come to an interim agreement regarding hours of meeting for next week.  I want to propose that it be made an order of the Dáil in accordance with that agreement.  I accordingly move:</P>
      <P>That on Tuesday and Wednesday next the Dáil shall meet at 2 p.m. and shall adjourn not later than 11.30 p.m.; and that the interruption of business provided for in subsection (2) of Standing Order No. 20 shall take place at 11 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to that proposal but I think it is appropriate to say at this stage that if the Parliamentary work is to be properly done there must be some kind of programme arranged.  The practice has always been that, prior to Christmas and up to the introduction of the Budget, the bulk of the legislative work was undertaken even though we had to carry the later stages of Bills forward into what we ordinarily call the financial year. This year the Government have sought to produce a vast bulk of legislation which should have been dealt with very much earlier in the year and which is now being submitted to the House, some of the Bills not having yet been printed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to direct the attention of the Government and the House to is this: to get legislation of this kind properly considered in the House it is extremely difficult if it is delayed in its presentation to this stage of our proceedings.  We are prepared to agree to these longer hours of sitting, but it is important that this should go on record for the benefit of people who are not familiar with the proceedings of this House.  They may not appreciate the difficulty of maintaining constant attention to the business of legislation because they are not aware of the variety of other duties that devolve on Deputies during the remaining hours of the day. The arrangement now proposed is the very limit which is consistent with any attempt at efficient legislation and I would invite the Government to review its programme very carefully in <Col N="1348" /> order to fit in whatever requires to be done before the end of this session within the hours that are proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the element of urgency arises out of the need to complete the financial business before the Vote on Account runs out.  So far as possible the Government will confine time during the next three weeks to the completion of the Estimates and the Appropriation Bill although there may be some need to depart from that arrangement, and in one matter I have addressed a letter to the Deputy which he will receive shortly.</P>
      <P>As regards legislation I think most of the long Bills which the Government contemplate for this session have already been disposed of or are in progress through the House.  While there are a number of Bills which have not yet been introduced or circulated none of them, I think, is likely to be the subject of protracted discussion in the Dáil.  Nevertheless the Deputy will appreciate there are perhaps some special circumstances prevailing this year why the Government would like to leave the legislative programme fairly clear.</P>

      <P>We were discussing this amendment which appeared to withdraw from the defendant his absolute right to secure a transfer to the Central Criminal Court.  While the Bill is acknowledging that that absolute right is preserved at the stage of his return for trial by the district justice it appears that heretofore he had the right, which the original section 26 proposed to give him, to serve seven days' notice on the Attorney General whereafter the circuit court judge was obliged to grant him the necessary transfer he sought to the Central Criminal Court.  In the amendment which is to be substituted for Section 26 it is sought to remove that absolute right and to place it again in the hands of the circuit court judge before whom he was originally returned for trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are matters about which one must not allow oneself to get sentimental. We must be practical.  To anyone who is on trial and alone, confronted with an appalling ordeal, there is not much consolation one can offer but there is this minimum that I think we should be concerned to make available to him&mdash;that is why Section 26 in its original form recommends itself to me &mdash;that he would have the right to choose within the judicial system the <Col N="1350" /> court where he felt he would get the fairest trial.</P>
    <P>I believe he would get a fair trial from a circuit judge or a High Court Judge.  Of course we are not dealing with trials in this context.  We are dealing with trials by juries, and we are dealing with a population which is largely a rural population.  There are many cases of which we all know in this House where a defendant would prefer to be tried among his neighbours if he were charged with the right kind of offence, confident that the neighbours would never convict him. On the other hand, a man could find himself charged with some disgraceful crime or charged with some crime which excites public antipathy and profound sympathy for the victim.  He may be a person driving a car while under the influence of drink or driving it recklessly as is provided for under the new transport legislation.  He may feel that local feeling is so strong he would not get a fair run for his money. Would it not be a desirable thing, even though in his distraction and woe he is not taking a reasonable view of the situation, to say to that person: &ldquo;All you have to do is give the Attorney General seven days' notice.&rdquo;  The jury knows nothing about the background of the case at all.  I think it is a hardship to say to that man: &ldquo;Make your application to the circuit court judge.&rdquo; All the circuit court judges are not angels.  It can happen that the judge may have a sore head and may get it into his mind that the person objects to being tried by him and the judge says: &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;  It is quite possible that the person will get a fair trial.  If he is convicted and sentenced, he will leave the court not only burdened by the affliction of the disaster that has come upon him but by the sense of grievance that he has not had a fair run for his money.</P>
    <P>I think we are right in this country in our strict adherence to the view that a man is innocent until the State has proved him guilty, unlike the Napoleonic law or the Roman law.  I think he is entitled to as free a choice as is practicable to give him of the tribunal within our system of law before which to make his case and to <Col N="1351" /> issue his challenge to the State to prove to a jury who are truly detached that he is guilty.</P>
    <P>We had dramatic instances recently in which the Court of Criminal Appeal ordered, because a member of a jury had an interest, however remote, in matters which were before the court for decision, a retrial immediately.  That is an indication, I think, of the view of the courts which I think they rightly hold that where there is any doubt at all about an interest in the jury box, the trial should be set aside and a retrial ordered.  In those circumstances, I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that his original proposal is better than the amendment he now submits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Attorney General or the State can fix which court the man is to be tried at, for the very good reason that local circumstances might conspire to defeat the interests of the public.  That is the principle upon which there is the discretion to bring the case either to the local circuit court or the Central Criminal Court.  The same principle should apply in reverse because exactly the same difficulties can occur in cases in relation to an accused as they can for the State.  We all know that there are cases where it is difficult for the State to get a conviction where a conviction should lie because of public sympathy.  Conversely, it is very difficult for a man to uphold his innocence if there is a strong feeling in the locality about the crime or the circumstances in which the crime was committed.</P>
      <P>I recollect a case where there was a considerable hearing in the circuit court.  I do not want to go into all the details.  The judge who presided at the trial is no longer on the Bench.  In fact, he is no longer there at all.  In that case, instead of having the retrial take place, as it would in the normal way, the Attorney General removed the case to the Central Criminal Court.  The defence had no option in the matter.  It was removed to the Central Criminal Court because it was felt that the situation had been bedevilled as the result of the first hearing and the atmosphere in the local venue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> I am not in the least suggesting that the Attorney General was not right.  I think we were all glad that it was removed to the Central Criminal Court. Suppose the accused had applied in that case and it were at the discretion of the judge and it were opposed by the Attorney General in that case, I am morally certain that the accused would have had to face his trial in the local circumstances.  I mention that as an instance of the type of thing that can occur.</P>
    <P>It is placing to some extent an unfair onus on a judge in the local venue&mdash;a judge who himself may be called upon to preside at the trial in the local court. It is unfair to put the burden upon him of deciding whether he will have it in his court or whether he will transfer it to the Central Criminal Court.  It is an awkward one for the judge.  I would urge that point for consideration by the Parliamentary Secretary, in addition to what Deputy Dillon said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree largely with Deputy Dillon and Deputy de Valera that as between the proposed new section and the section as in the Bill, I prefer the existing Section 26.  I can understand and I think everybody will sympathise with the point of view expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary that, under the existing law, instances have occurred where the unbridled right to transfer was availed of merely for the purpose of obtaining an adjournment of the trial.  One can see that if at the very last instance and without any warning, either the accused person or the Attorney General could transfer a trial to the Central Criminal Court, that might lead, as I am certain it has led, to very unfortunate consequences for a variety of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I could understand the provision in Section 26 which specifies that in relation to the right of transfer on the application of either the Attorney General or an accused person, reasonable notice of the fact should be given so that the working of the courts and the engagements and commitments of a variety of people should not be ignored.  I felt it was reasonable that at least seven days' notice should be given by either party of an intention to apply for a transfer.  On giving that, they <Col N="1353" /> should be entitled, as of right, to select a venue for the trial.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I have an amendment, which is the next amendment, providing for the contingency where for one reason or another notice has not been given either by the Attorney General or the accused person.  In those circumstances, I felt that it should then be at the discretion of the judge to decide whether the case should be transferred. Presumably, he would not exercise the discretion if he felt that the party applying should have given proper notice and was in fact making the application not <i>bona fide</i> in relation to the trial.  Only in those circumstances should he have a discretion.  For those reasons, as between the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment and the existing section, I would prefer the existing section.</P>
    <P>I just want to ask the House to look at what the position would be if this amendment were passed, coupled with the amendment to Section 34, amendment No. 59.  If that were passed, there would be a very strange position obtaining.  The right to transfer would be restricted to those offences in which the maximum penalty exceeded five years' penal servitude.  In relation to any offence where the maximum penalty might be imprisonment for three years, or whatever it might be, there would be no right to transfer at all.  I think that is a very dramatic change.  I would urge that we should not embark upon it without careful consideration.  It is a novel view to assess the right purely in relation to the sentence which may be imposed.</P>
    <P>One may well imagine some person charged with an offence which, naturally, he and society regard in a very serious light.  I suggest it is an indictable offence.  That particular offence, that person may feel, would be tried in a fair manner by a jury drawn from a particular area.  I cannot understand why, merely because the offence does not call for a sentence in excess of five years, that person should not be entitled to do as he is now entitled to do&mdash;that is&mdash;to seek a transfer of his trial.  That is the first point I should like to make in relation to the proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> The second point is that the right to transfer under the new proposal has to be exercised at the date of the return for trial.  Again, I do not think that is wise.  Frequently, that particular date may be considerably removed in point of time from the date of the trial.  Certainly, it may happen and has often happened that it is only at the time when the trial is due to take place that the local conditions and the local climate may from one side or another make it undesirable to have the trial locally.  It may be completely impossible to access that at the time of the return for trial.  I do not think it is wise to provide that it is only then that there shall be a right to transfer.</P>
    <P>I think the third point is the point very validly made that where, under the new proposal here, the application for a transfer is not made at the time of the return for trial, but is made to the circuit court judge, when the trial is about to take place, if it is made by the accused person and, indeed, possibly even if it is made by the Attorney General, it does, in my view, put the trial judge in a most invidious position to have to try in effect to come to a decision that in his court a fair trial will not be provided either for the accused person or for the people at the suit of the Attorney General.  That, I feel, is a wrong position to put any judge into, and certainly I do not think it would work.  I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to withdraw the present amendment and to retain the proposal he has in Section 26.  I would, at the proper time, urge that it could be extended slightly in the sense of the next two amendments on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>Then there is another point which is a practical difficulty in regard to the application.  I know there is an analogy there.  If there is an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, there is usually a procedure by which leave is first sought to appeal.  Every lawyer knows that that procedure virtually means a hearing of the appeal.  In other words, all the ground is gone over before the Court of Appeal can make up its mind to hear the appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Except in the <Col N="1355" /> unusual case where the court gives the leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  What happens in the Court of Criminal Appeal is that, in order to make up their minds whether the judges will entertain the appeal or not, they have virtually to hear the appeal and there has to be a preliminary run, as it were. That is all right in the Court of Criminal Appeal, where it is a matter of law, where the facts are already more or less determined, but just think of what is involved if an application of that kind is made just before the trial or at the time of the trial to the judge. Does it not mean that before the judge can come to a reasonable decision whether to transfer to the Criminal Court or whether to retain in his own court&mdash;and this would be immaterial whether the application had to be made at the time of return for trial or before the hearing would commence&mdash;he would have to know enough about the case to make the decision?  In order to know enough about the case, he would either have to have public inquiries in court, that is, preliminary, or, worse still, he would have to inquire privately.</P>
      <P>I have heard Deputy Dillon make a point in this House about the importance of judges staying aloof and not consulting police officers or anybody else.  What is the position in regard to the accused if the judge gets his information privately, where the judge will have to consult both sides in Chamber privately, which is prejudicial to justice and to the accused?  Otherwise there has to be a preliminary run of the case in some form or other in the open court, again prejudicial to the accused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I see great dangers in working on that principle at all in the transfer system.  I see all the difficulties. I have great sympathy with the Parliamentary Secretary in the matter of the Attorney General or the State transferring to the Central Criminal Court and making it very difficult for the defence to bring up witnesses and making it very expensive.  That is an objection from the point of view of the accused.  From the point of view of <Col N="1356" /> the State the same objection can arise &mdash;the bringing up of witnesses, and so on, to Dublin.  But, when all is said and done, these things have to be balanced and this question of the mechanics of the thing should be looked into rather closely.  I see that great danger following the line of argument Deputy O'Higgins and myself have indicated.</P>
    <P>I see a real difficulty from the point of view of the application and from the point of view of carrying it through without prejudice to the accused.  As Deputy Dillon said, we have a very sound principle here that the onus of proof is on the prosecution and that the accused is assumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty.  Having said that, I would be more concerned about parity between the situation of the State and the situation of the accused.  I would not, so far as the mere question of transfer is concerned, be very worried whether it was an absolute right to either party or whether it was through some judicial discretion provided the Attorney General, that is, the State, and the accused are on a fully equal basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know.  But even so, if you put the accused and the Attorney General on an equal basis, there is no room for objection.  I do address myself to the Parliamentary Secretary, on, as I say, the difficulties and the mechanics of the thing from the point I first developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the general principle which Deputy de Valera seeks to lay down, that is, if you seek equality of status between the accused and the State, the bulk of the objection is gone.  I am not prepared to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary.  I think that the Attorney General has his rights which are primarily designed to enable him to vindicate the law.  No one would doubt the importance of that, but we are here in Parliament to vindicate the rights of the individual.  I do not want <Col N="1357" /> to go over the same old argument again.  I do not want to be sentimental, but I do not want to dismiss from my mind the position of an ordinary person appearing in the dock.  Let us concede that 50 per cent.  of such people are fairly familiar with the dock and know their way around the dock, but there are the other 50 per cent. who have never been there before. I am peculiarly solicitous to ensure that there is not added to their existing woe and desolation a sense of grievance that they have not had a fair run for their money, have not had a fair trial.  Therefore, I should like to see reserved to the prisoner at the bar an absolute right to be transferred from the local court to the Central Criminal Court if he feels, however mistakenly, that he cannot get a fair trial in his own area.  The right is so manifestly desirable that we should not have to argue unduly, and I want to dissent very strongly from the principle Deputy de Valera seeks to set down. I do not think parity between&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It really has nothing to do with it.  Parity between the two has really nothing to do with the rights of the accused.  It does not help him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with me that what we are charged with is to concern ourselves with equity and justice for the accused.  When I hear somebody like Deputy O'Higgins, who is versed in the practice of general law, speaking about the expense, inconvenience or annoyance of bringing witnesses, exhibits and so forth and then getting an application for a transfer from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court, to my way of thinking, it would be far better to have that expense, inconvenience or annoyance in the few cases where it arises than to have anyone feel that because he was ignorant himself&mdash;and that can happen&mdash;or because <Col N="1358" /> his solicitor was indolent and did not serve the notice within the seven days, he is constrained to face trial in a court where he does not think he will get justice.</P>
      <P>Do not let us get too practical.  Let us occasionally indulge in the licence of going into the dock with the accused and standing for a moment in his shoes. I think if we all did that we would be agreed.  We would go to the limit of our resources to ensure that a person standing in peril of conviction of a serious offence&mdash;because he cannot be tried for minor offences on indictment &mdash;will not only get a fair trial but will get the highest assurance we can give him that he will get a fair trial and that he has had a fair trial.  This original section requires the defendant to give seven days' notice.  I prefer the original section to the amendment now proposed. I would have asked the Parliamentary Secretary to allow prisoners at the bar on arraignment before the circuit court judge to apply for a transfer to the Central Criminal Court and to have that as a right.</P>
      <P>I do not believe five per cent. of the prisoners would make such a demand but I would let those who did have it. It will not cause inconvenience.  On occasion, you will get the odd &ldquo;old lag&rdquo; who wants to postpone the evil day and to try to stretch things out, but what of it?  Ordinarily, the law will catch up with such people in due course and if the odd jailbird stretches it out a few weeks, the State will not come to an end.  It would be a great pity if the man who seriously believed himself to be innocent found himself convicted by a court in which he felt he was not getting the full measure of justice to which he was entitled.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, if possible on Report Stage, to reinstate not only Section 26 but to ensure that a defendant will have that right to go to the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say it is a very good thing that in this House, when legislating, we should be concerned, as Deputies are, for the rights of the accused and should be careful to ensure that in so far as we can the best principles in regard to this <Col N="1359" /> matter will be upheld.  First of all, let me say that that is the sort of discussion in which I am very glad to join and I am hopeful that we can come to agreement as to exactly what is the right thing to do in this regard and achieve the best possible Bill.</P>
      <P>The existing Section 26 suffers from this defect, that if you have a case where the accused has neglected or omitted for one reason or another to apply for a transfer within seven days and then some circumstances arise which make it manifest that he will not get a fair trial in the local circuit court, there is nothing you can do about that defect.  Deputy O'Higgins realised it and attempted in his amendment to do something about it.  From that point of view alone the existing section could not stand and we must, therefore, amend it; and, in amending, we must take two contending factors into account.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, there is the principle, which has been fairly eloquently enunciated by Deputy Dillon, of the fundamental right of an accused person to a fair trial and, on the other hand, the question of practicability enters in.  We must be practical.  We must ensure that the courts function with a reasonable degree of efficiency. It has happened that the time of the Central Criminal Court has been taken up unnecessarily with trivial cases, cases which could just as easily have been tried in the circuit criminal court but which were transferred to the Central Criminal Court for very unworthy and unmeritorious reasons.  I have instanced the cases.  The transfer was sought in an attempt to postpone the evil day, because of dislike of some particular judge, because of some feeling that another judge would be more lenient&mdash;for some motive which cannot really stand up to the light of scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have then, as I said, these two contending factors.  We must ensure that the Central Criminal Court is preserved for that for which it should properly be preserved.  In order to ensure that, we are providing that the general run-of-the-mill criminal cases <Col N="1360" /> will be tried in the circuit criminal court.  The existing law is that either the accused or the Attorney General may apply to the circuit court judge to have the case transferred to some other court within the circuit.  That right is there at the moment and we are preserving it.  That is the first leg of the defence we offer to the accused. If, for some reason, he thinks the particular court before which his trial is listed is unsuitable, he may apply to the court and the court, in its discretion, can transfer the case to some other court.</P>

Deputies should not allow themselves to get the impression that only in the Central Criminal Court will people get a fair trial.  That is not so.  The only thing that concerns us is whether it is likely that, because of circumstances, a jury in a particular local area might <Col N="1361" /> not give the accused a fair trial.  In every other case it is absolutely elementary in our whole system that the accused will get as fair a trial locally as he will in the Central Criminal Court.  We want to provide for the one case in which there might be a possibility that the jury might be prejudiced.  First of all, if it is a serious criminal offence at district court level, which is the point at which the accused is returned for trial, the accused has an absolute right to apply at that stage&mdash;and, at that stage, all the facts are known&mdash;to have the case transferred to the Central Criminal Court.</P>

      <P>Am I not to be allowed to speak without interruption? Deputy McGilligan has kept up this practice throughout the debate.  I have never said that an offence which carries a sentence of less than five years is trivial.  I was speaking of trivial cases which are taken to the Central Criminal Court.  I said in a serious <Col N="1362" /> case&mdash;a case which carries five years, or more, penal servitude as the penalty &mdash;the accused has an absolute right to go to the Central Criminal Court.  In all other cases, under the new dispensation, he does not have to give seven days' notice, or anything else.  He can at any stage apply to the circuit court judge and give his reasons as to why he thinks he will not get a fair trial and apply to have the case transferred to the Central Criminal Court, or some other court in the same circuit. What could be fairer than that?</P>

      <P>He applies to the circuit court judge for a transfer to some place else in the same circuit. If the accused claims that, when informations were accepted, he did not apply for a transfer because he was satisfied he would get a fair trial, and he is strenuously opposed to transfer to another area, I am quite certain that will be a perfectly satisfactory case to put to the circuit court judge and I am quite certain it will be allowed.  I cannot see any difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But if the accused applies it is still the circuit court judge who hears the application. This matter is based on the argument that a great many trivial cases have been engaging the attention of the Central Criminal Court which could properly be tried by the circuit criminal court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it is not trivial cases any longer.  It is the excuses made.  Within the framework of the law these are indictable offences and, therefore, they are not trivial cases; and, secondly, on the new meaning, it is where a person is charged with an offence the maximum penalty for which does not exceed five years' penal servitude. Certainly, that wipes out all the element of triviality as far as the offence is concerned.  Now for trivial reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to date what was the situation? It lay in the accused's hands if he liked to have himself tried by the Central Criminal Court.  He had the choice.  It is now moved to take that away and give the decision entirely to the judge.  The new section 26 says: &ldquo;The judge may at his discretion transfer&rdquo;.  The only reservation in that is that application can be made <Col N="1364" /> only by the Attorney General or by the accused person.  Those two being the only two who have the right to apply, the decision in the end lies with the judge of the circuit court. He may, if he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>I am told now there are cases which have been transferred for trivial reasons.  In the opening statement made on this the Parliamentary Secretary referred to people who wanted to be longer, so to speak, away from the clutches of the law and secondly, to people who had applied for an adjournment and had it refused and then the second way of getting an adjournment was to get the transfer to the other court which, of course, would take some time.  I should like to have some statistics on that.  I am not so well aware of the circuit court in other areas but the Central Criminal Court is very fully occupied at the moment. I do not know if there has been any great number of cases that have gone before the Central Criminal Court under the old dispensation which could be regarded as sent there for trivial reasons.</P>

      <P>I was going to say that.  It is on the State's side that most of the applications were made for an adjournment.  Accused people are generally anxious to get the thing over and done with and, if the application for an adjournment comes from the State side, very good reasons are given on some occasions and very poor reasons on other occasions.  On the matter of the application to get a transfer made, the great majority of those come from the State side also.  So, what we are dealing with is the minor number of cases.  I should like to be informed of something that is called a trivial reason by which a person got a transfer from the circuit court to the Central Criminal Court.  I do not know of any such at the moment.</P>

      <P>In fact, I know the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind one case.  I only know of it occurring once.  It may have occurred a second time.  It is a case where a particular application was made to a particular judge for an adjournment in a particular case.  There was considerable argument as to whether the adjournment was to be granted or not and the judge, in a very vehement way, refused the adjournment.  The person who made the application said: &ldquo;I am applying for a transfer to the Central Criminal Court.&rdquo;  That was a much talked of instance.  I know of only one such incident and, in fact, when the Parliamentary Secretary mentions transfers applied for for trivial reasons, I think he must to some extent be assuming things there because the ordinary rule&mdash;and I think it is a rule that has never been altered and could not be altered indeed&mdash;is that there is no reason given; it cannot be given. An application is made for a transfer. Full stop.  Because, under the law as it stands, the judge, once the application is made, must grant the application and, therefore, no reason is ever given.  It is just that the application is made and the transfer is ordered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remark that there is no such thing as a trivial reason as far as the accused is concerned.  The mere fact of being accused is enough to create a calamity for that person and, therefore, the provision should be retained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me just say what I am objecting to.  I do not care what sort of language we use or what objection is taken to some particular phrase I used but what I object to, and I think Deputy O'Higgins appreciates this because he has experience of it, is this sort of thing where the local <Col N="1366" /> circuit criminal court is perfectly qualified in every way to give an accused a fair trial and, for some reason which is not a valid or good reason, he applies to take up the time of the Central Criminal Court unnecessarily and inconvenience everybody concerned.  That is the sort of case I want to obviate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Should I point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that this is a most unfortunate approach? When we are dealing with a man who is dependent on a criminal trial, reasons that may appear to persons who are cold, detached observers as being trivial do not so appear to the person under the appalling stress of defending himself in a criminal case and you have got to make allowance for that.  After you have made full allowance for that, I am prepared to concede to the Parliamentary Secretary that you will get in 100 defendants a small percentage of what we call &ldquo;old lags&rdquo; who know all the ropes and for their own reasons wait to the last moment and then clap in what perhaps all experienced practitioners know is virtually a fraudulent application for transfer to the Central Criminal Court, made for no reason other than to postpone a decision.  I want to make the case to the Parliamentary Secretary that in that full knowledge we ought to say that the fact that a few old practitioners will play fast and loose with this provision should not deter us from making the provision for the benefit of the vast majority of applicants who are actuated by trivial reasons, objectively seen, because subjectively the reason is to the defendant one of importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could go on reciting cases <i>ad infinitum</i> but if you are living all your life in Dublin and you are to be tried at the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court the difference between a jury in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and a jury in the Central Criminal Court is nil but I am not thinking of that case; I am thinking of the case of a fellow who is going to be arraigned in Boyle or Monaghan or Dundalk and who knows that the evidence that is going to emerge is going to be of a kind of which he is desperately ashamed.  He <Col N="1367" /> maintains that he is not guilty of a criminal offence but has to go through the ordeal of having all these deplorable matters exposed to public view.</P>
    <P>It may be that if we could search his mind what he is really recoiling from is having all these unfortunate matters ventilated in the presence of his neighbours but subjectively he believes: &ldquo;If they hear I did all this they will certainly come to the conclusion I did the rest but if I can get the best of twelve men who simply see me out of my background I will prove the State has proved nothing against me except, perhaps, folly or imprudence or impropriety and I will go free.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary's line is that we are full of charity.  It is not charity.  I think he is entitled to say: &ldquo;I want to go to the Central Criminal Court.&rdquo; We cannot say: &ldquo;You must stand your trial in a court where you believe you will not get justice.&rdquo;  We are forced into saying: &ldquo;That is a position we cannot consider.  All men in this court are equal under the law and we are prepared to take every conceivable precaution to ensure that you get your indictment before a court which is absolutely impartial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no such thing in Ireland as impartial justice and we cannot establish the law on sentiment and allow sentiment to govern reason in this Bill.  Do not let us go too far in the direction of saying that we all know that certain persons for trivial reasons go to the Central Criminal Court in the city.  I am prepared to say at once to the Parliamentary Secretary: &ldquo;Let them go.&rdquo;  The number of such cases is microscopic.  The vast majority of defendants who seek a transfer to the Central Criminal Court seek it for reasons which they think are good and grave.  They are entitled to protection when they are in the midst of misfortune.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been out of touch for some time now and I should like to know the proportion of cases in which application has been made during the past 10 or 20 years for transfer to the Central Criminal Court, and the number of cases which have been transferred.  It would be interesting <Col N="1368" /> to know what proportion were made on the initiative of the Attorney General, and what percentage of applications were made on the initiative of the accused.</P>
      <P>As I say, I have been rather out of touch in recent years, but my recollection is that when I was practising the vast majority of cases transferred to the Central Criminal Court were transferred on the initiative of the Attorney General.  The impression I got was that the general grounds, though not stated, were that it would be easier to get an impartial trial in the Central Criminal Court divorced from circumstances that really had nothing to do with the case but which would colour a local hearing. That would be a very important factor to ascertain before coming to a final conclusion on this matter.</P>
      <P>In my experience, and I think other lawyers will probably agree with me, a defendant and his legal advisers do not seek to go to the Central Criminal Court, unless they have some reason for it.  There is the uncertainty that they do not know in advance what judge will be trying the case.  There is complete uncertainty in advance as to what judge will be trying the case, and there is also the point of view that the jury is completely impersonal in a big city because it is chosen at random.  In that way, so far as possible, there is an impartial tribunal that cannot be associated in any way with the case.  That in itself is an encouragement to an accused who wants to seek the specific advantage that he is going <i>prima facie</i> before the most impartial tribunal that can be conceived.</P>
      <P>There is one other reason, possibly a trivial one, I agree, that is, to cause delay.  A person may have a perverse wish to cause the maximum amount of inconvenience to the State and to the prosecution, but, in my experience, accused persons do not do that kind of thing because it rebounds on them. It is well known that if you are obstreperous, you pay in the penalty. Legal advisers are very careful to watch the matter in that light, so mere delay does not seem to me to have any particular advantage in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An accused may apply for a transfer because of local considerations.  He <Col N="1369" /> may feel that the jury will be familiar with background which is really outside what is evidence in court.  That is one reason.  Another reason is that he may feel that in a particular type of case a judge from the circuit court may have, to put it mildly, extreme views.  We must talk about judges here with respect, but they have their own points of view, and we all know that in particular matters judges, like the rest of us, have strong views.  It is common knowledge that a judge can get the reputation of having a particular type of view on a particular type of case.  That will be known to the defending solicitor and to the accused and may be valid ground for seeking a transfer.</P>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary has listed that ground among the trivialities but I should like to urge on him that it is indeed a very valid ground.  I know there is appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal which can correct any misdirection in judgement, or any positive misdirection during the case, but juries tend to lean on the opinion of the judge in the court, and the judge's general attitude and facial expression very easily can, and often does, convey his opinion quite forcibly to a jury in a way that can never be caught by the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>That does not seem to be a trivial thing.  It is a substantial thing if in a particular type of case the accused feels that he would be at a disadvantage with an individual judge.  I do not think that should be listed as a trivial reason for taking away his right of transfer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly could not possibly contemplate the administration of criminal justice on the basis that the accused would have the right to pick his judge.  That is really getting to the daft stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the argument put forward that the accused should have the right to transfer because, in his opinion, the judge is a <Col N="1370" /> crank or does not like him for some reason.  That would be absolutely nonsensical.</P>
      <P>With regard to the argument put forward by Deputy Dillon, the House should not forget that the amendment I am proposing works against the Attorney General in certain circumstances just as much as it works against the accused.  The Attorney General may be convinced that because of the sort of crime and the type of person involved the local jury would be prejudiced in favour of the accused.  Up to now, the Attorney General had absolute right to transfer to the Central Criminal Court.  From now on, if this proposal is accepted, he has that right subject to the discretion of the judge. It works that way as well.</P>
      <P>Our view is that the circuit criminal court is the normal court in this country charged with the job of trying these criminal offences.  The theory is that only certain parties should be brought to the Central Criminal Court and only in certain circumstances should cases, as an extraordinary measure, be transferred to the Central Criminal Court.  In the normal course of events cases should be tried by the local circuit criminal court.  It is because that desire and intention of the Oireachtas in this regard is being circumvented to a considerable extent at the moment and because we have the unnecessary and undesirable transfer of cases to the Central Criminal Court&mdash;cases which could properly, in every sense of the word, be tried in the local Circuit Criminal Court&mdash;that we want to put this brake on the situation from now on.  In certain cases we will give the absolute right to transfer serious cases carrying more than five years' penal servitude.  In all other cases both the accused and the Attorney General will have an equal right to apply to the circuit court judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the point raised by Deputy Dillon.  He argued a certain case very well.  As he was arguing it, I put myself in the position of the circuit court judge listening to his argument.  If the argument advanced by him in that case were put to a circuit court judge, surely he must accept it?  The very idea is that we give discretion to the circuit court <Col N="1371" /> judge.  If the facts of the matter produced by Deputy Dillon prevail, we are entitled to assume the judge would grant the transfer in that case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Parliamentary Secretary's argument but I think he has misled himself.  He seeks to say this proposal abridges the right of the Attorney General just as much as the right of the defendant.  He says it cuts both ways and that he would not amend it one way or the other.  He would go on to say: &ldquo;If you examine the records, you will probably find it will operate to restrict the Attorney General much more than it will operate to restrict the defence, because the vast majority of applications for a transfer of proceedings arises with the Attorney General.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I submit that is to misdirect the answer to this matter.  I do not mind how far the Executive, represented by the Attorney General, restricts the prerogative of the Executive.  In fact, the further you go in that direction, the happier I am.  I think it is thoroughly good democracy.  If the Attorney General wants to transfer a case to the Central Criminal Court let him satisfy the judge to whom the case has been referred that there is a good reason why it should be transferred.  I concede at once that the Parliamentary Secretary is taking away from the Attorney General a prerogative he at present enjoys.  But I do not think he can say: &ldquo;Because I am doing that to the Attorney General, it is fair enough to do it to the defendant as well.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit it is a <i>non sequiter.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A <i>non sequiter,</i> yes. You are dealing with two persons in entirely different circumstances.  I will agree with the Parliamentary Secretary it is a good departure to require the Attorney General to get the consent of the circuit court judge to the transfer, if he is the applicant for the transfer to the Central Criminal Court.  That would be all right as long as we did not say in a case of that kind.  &ldquo;What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the <Col N="1372" /> gander,&rdquo; because these two parties are not in the position of the goose and the gander.  One is the Attorney General, whose sole concern, acting coldly and objectively, is to vindicate the law and whose daily chore it is to be in or about the courts on criminal or other business.  The other is an unfortunate individual, bewildered, overwrought, irrational, and in a state of the most extreme psychological upset.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is appropriate for us not to have regard to that, even if we were to go so far as to say with the Parliamentary Secretary: &ldquo;We think the Central Criminal Court is being cluttered up unnecessarily and we think it is expedient to take some measures to restrict this flood of work which could properly be done in the local court.&rdquo;  If that is the answer, I say: &ldquo;Very well.  Restrict the powers of the Attorney General to move cases to the Central Criminal Court.&rdquo;  But when he goes on to say: &ldquo;We also propose to put at the discretion of the circuit court judge the right to accede to or deny an application from a defendant to transfer a case to the Central Criminal Court&rdquo; I say that is going too far in the cause of efficiency. We ought to say we will tolerate whatever measure of inefficiency is brought about by the small number of unmeritorious applications for transfer to the Central Criminal Court made by old lags who are simply swinging the lead. There cannot be a dozen such cases in twelve months.  I am giving the outside figure.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that of all the the persons returned for trial by the district court not 50 per cent. will apply for transfer to the Central Criminal Court from the dock, and of that 50 per cent. not 5 per cent. will be old lags concerned to create the maximum inconvenience and protract the period of their trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy de Valera is right when he says, in regard to the old offender who finds himself back in the dock, that his anxiety is to get out of it as quickly as he can, as cheaply as he can, to make himself as agreeable as he can to the judge and jury and everybody else, and that he makes an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal to the judge <Col N="1373" /> not to be too hard on him and to give him another chance.  I concede you get a small few who will make a nuisance of themselves in that way.  But the amount of time they will waste and the amount of expense they will cost the State is trivial compared to the feeling we have that a defendant should be given the highest measure of assurance that we can by law provide that he will have access to a court in which to maintain his innocence against the State's efforts to prove him guilty.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that is the right line of procedure, and therefore I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to retain Section 26, subject to one amendment that he might consider between now and Report Stage.  That is, to provide that in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) instead of the words at present standing there, there should be inserted:</P>
    <P>in case the accused applies to have the trial transferred to the Central Criminal Court, the judge of the circuit court before whom the accused is triable shall grant the application.</P>
    <P>If we do that, I think we will have done a liberal and wise thing and we will not have caused anybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>An offence may appear trivial but an accused person may have other reasons for wanting a transfer.  If his trial is to be held in the neighbourhood in which he resides he may feel embarrassed at neighbours' talk and instead of being calm, cool and collected in considering his own case he may be more concerned about what other people are saying behind his back.  He should be given the right to have his case heard outside that neighbourhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us suppose the judge concerned is a sort of hanging judge or one of those judges who go in for stiff sentences, as there are, or an abusive judge.  In 1924 I remember having the experience of going before Mr. Justice O'Shaughnessy.  He was most abusive to me.  It was a political matter.  If I had the choice I would object to going before Mr. Justice O'Shaughnessy.  A person might object to the judge on the grounds that the judge might not be fair, on reputation.  Even if the accused were an old lag it is quite possible he might say to himself: &ldquo;This judge knows me and he may make it tough <Col N="1375" /> for me.  I would rather go where I am not known.&rdquo;  Cases which are regarded as very trivial may be very serious to the person concerned.  I have known people to commit suicide over what might appear to others to be a trivial matter.  The right of transfer of a case should not be denied if a person wishes to exercise it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter to which I wish to refer in relation to the amendment that is proposed in paragraph (3) (c) in regard to making the discretionary order of the circuit judge on such applications as we are discussing final and unappealable. In matters of the exercise of discretion on the part of a judge, it is always a necessary concomitant of the exercise of that discretion that it should be judicially exercised.  It would not be usual but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the discretion could be exercised capriciously under the guise of being done judicially. Accordingly giving no right of appeal to persons is dangerous, making the exercise of discretion something absolute in a Court of First Instance, as it were.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am objecting to, the discretion of that judge.  The seven days' notice in the case of the Attorney General should be there.  I think &ldquo;good and sufficient reason&rdquo; would probably meet this much better than saying &ldquo;at his discretion&rdquo;.  The Attorney General would have to argue the case as to why he wanted it transferred to a particular venue and give his reasons before any discretion would be exercised.  It is wholly undesirable to place the Attorney General with, as Deputy Dillon says, all the administrative machinery at his disposal, on a par with an accused person who might or might not be represented.  It is something worthy of further consideration.</P>

      <P>In page 18, line 7, to delete &ldquo;justices&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;judges&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I come back to this point again.  I have almost lost myself in the changes that occur in regard to titles.  Under the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill, 1959, Section 5 provides there is to be a Court of First Instance which is to be called An Chúirt Dúiche (The District Court).  Subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>The District Court shall be constituted of the following judges&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a judge who shall be styled &ldquo;Uachtarán na Cúirte Dúiche&rdquo; (&ldquo;The President of the District Court&rdquo;), and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  such number of other judges <Col N="1377" /> (each of whom shall be styled &ldquo;Breitheamh den Chúirt Dúiche&rdquo; (Justice of the District Court))...</P>
    <P>We are to establish a district court which is to be composed of judges. Judges are to be addressed as &ldquo;Breitheamh&rdquo; which is the word used with regard to the judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and the circuit court and in a translation of the word &ldquo;Breitheamh&rdquo; we use the term &ldquo;Justice&rdquo;.  Then we come to Section 28 where it says the number of justices are to be so many.  This verbiage is very confusing.  These people are judges.  They must be judges under the Constitution.  They have no status as members of the judiciary unless they are judges and nobody can deal in our courts with matters of justice except judges. Justice must be administered in courts established under the Constitution by judges appointed in the manner determined by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I asked with regard to other judges, where there is a distinction between the President of the High Court and ordinary judges, what would the warrant of appointment of these judges be?  I am told it will be as a &ldquo;judges&rdquo; and not &ldquo;ordinary judge&rdquo;.  Every judge is to get a warrant of appointment in terms of &ldquo;judge&rdquo;.  This court is to be composed of judges.  These judges, as far as the Irish title is concerned, are given the title &ldquo;Breitheamh&rdquo; which is the word used for a judge. Yet, we are told that we are going to provide for a number of justices in a particular court.  Is that not nonsensical?</P>
    <P>The next subsection deals with people who are to be qualified for appointment.  They have to be qualified in certain ways by having a certain standing or by being justices already.  They are to be qualified for appointment as justice of the district court.  We are not appointing justices in the district court but judges. Except for the English translation of the Irish term, we never use anything throughout the whole of the Constitution except the word &ldquo;judge&rdquo;.  Here we are going to appoint a number of justices.  I do not know why.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that in another connection.  I think that on a previous occasion we went forward to deal with this section.  The position is that in the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill we establish the court and we bring into being the office of judge of that court.  In other words, in regard to the district court, in Section 5 of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill we state that the district court shall be constituted of the following judges, a judge who shall be styled so and so and such number of other judges each of whom shall be styled &ldquo;Breitheamh den Chúirt Dúiche&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We create the office of judge and, at the time of creating it, we indicate that from then on they shall be styled justices.  That seems to me to be a perfectly legitimate way of proceeding. It is one to which, as I have already explained on a couple of previous occasions on this Bill, I cannot see any objection whatever.  We comply with the constitutional requirement when we create the office of judge.  At the same moment we indicate how they are to be styled right through the two Bills and we style them accordingly.</P>

Later in subsection (2) we are told that people with certain standing and practising qualifications are to be qualified for appointment as a justice of the district court.

      <P>On the section, I had intended putting down an amendment making the age of retirement the same as in the other courts, 70 or 72, whatever is the appropriate year.  I assumed that because these people would have to be carried on their salaries for a longer period, that might be regarded as imposing a burden on the State and therefore I would not be entitled to move it, as a Deputy.  I would ask that consideration be given to two points.</P>
      <P>At present, the district court judge age of retirement should be 65.  That is subject to this very peculiar business that when one of the personnel of this court reaches the age of 60 he must, for the 5 years after that, present himself, I think on his birthday, as each one comes along, to a committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General.  I do not know whether he is bound to do this but certainly it is the procedure that the district justice between the years of 60 and 65 must also produce a certificate from some qualified medical person to the effect that he is fit and able to carry on his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that any Justice, using the, to me, incorrect term, has ever been removed from his office in the interval between the period of 60 and 65 years.  I think every one of them has been accepted.  It seems to be odd.  There is, right through the <Col N="1382" /> whole of our legislation back since 1924, a procedure which tends to diminish the status of the district court and it is carried out in this matter in particular.  No other judge has to appear before any committee to show he is in physical good form and possibly to be questioned, although I have never known a question of a searching type put to a district justice to see if he is mentally suited to the office.  I doubt if this is proper.  This is of very long standing.  It creates the impression that those who get to the Bench in the district court are inferior in their physical and mental equipment to those of the higher courts or else that their work is so trying that they wear out quicker.</P>

      <P>Neither of these impressions can be substantiated by experience.  I do not remember any occasion on which such a person on presenting himself to a committee of three has been turned down.  They have been able to go to the retiring age.  It should be the same as the other courts&mdash;70 or 72 years.</P>
      <P>We are apparently coming to the point that 70 is the correct age of retirment for the courts generally but there has to be provision for 72 years for people appointed with that age limit.  However, a prejudicial distinction is made between the district court and the other courts and it should be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I got Deputy McGilligan accurately there.  If he said that there was a continuing attempt since 1924 to lower the status of district court judges, that is not so.  It was in 1946, for the first time, that the district court justices were given the same status of tenure as the judges of the superior courts.  This matter of the retiring age of district justices was fully debated in this House in 1946.  At that time the retiring age was fixed at 65.  It was again debated in 1949 when the proposal to extend the age to 70 was mooted.  I suppose the <Col N="1383" /> real reason why district justices have a lower retiring age than judges of the superior courts is that to a far greater extent their job as district justices involves travel.  They are expected to travel around their areas and to attend the sittings in different parts of their areas.  In that regard, they must be more active people than the judges of the superior courts.  There is no ordeal involved in this.  It would be wrong to describe the process of applying to the Judicial Committee for an extension, year by year, of from 65 to 70, as an ordeal.  In the normal way, it is a pure formality.</P>
      <P>It is important that we should retain the retiring age of 65, only to be extended if the district justice is fit enough to carry out his job, which entails a fair amount of travelling around, first to get to his area and then to travel around within it. Another argument is that there is a well-settled pattern now established of retirement ages for justices.  I do not think we should change it unless for some very good reason.  Otherwise, we would never get finality.  I think the present scale of 72, 70 and 65 years is appropriate in all the circumstances and I think we should stick to it.</P>

      <P>I cannot see the reason for the distinction between 72 <Col N="1384" /> and 70 as between the Supreme Court and the High Court any more than I can see the reason for retiring district justices at 65.  The reason given in relation to travel does not carry great conviction.  I look around this House. I see seasoned warriors who travel more in coming to this House and going back again than district justices. These warriors submit themselves to the ardours of the consideration of legislation and the work in their constituencies as well as the social hazards of a strange city and yet a great number of them can undertake all those duties.  Therefore, I do not see travel as an impediment which influences the retirement of district justices at the present age level.</P>
