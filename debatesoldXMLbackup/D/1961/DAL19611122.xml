    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the function of local authorities in providing dentures and dental treatment to medical card holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, and Article 8 of the General Medical Services Regulations, 1954, health authorities are required to make available, without charge, dental treatment and dental appliances for persons who are unable to provide, by their own industry or other lawful means, the dental treatment or appliances necessary for themselves or their dependants.  The possession of a Medical Card entitling the holder to free general medical services does not, however, automatically entitle that person to free dental services from the health authority.  The health authority must be satisfied that the dental services applied for are necessary for the particular <Col N="546" /> applicant and that he is unable to provide them from his own resources. Moreover, an applicant, although the holder of a Medical Card, may be qualified as an insured employee to obtain free dental treatment or a grant towards the cost of dentures under the Dental Benefit Scheme administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  If he is so qualified, he is not eligible for free dental treatment from the local health authority because he can get the treatment he needs otherwise and he may be deemed not to be eligible for the supply of dentures from that authority on the grounds that he is in a position to bear his portion of the cost of this service under the Social Welfare Scheme.  Under Article 5 of the Dental and Aural Appliances Regulations, 1961, the health authority is authorised to make a payment towards the amount of any contribution payable by such a person for dentures under the Department of Social Welfare Dental Benefit Scheme.</P>
      <P>Because of the limited amount of funds and dental personnel available to local health authorities, it has been my policy, and that of my predecessor, to recommend to health authorities that they should concentrate mainly on providing dental treatment for children who are entitled to free dental treatment under the school health and child welfare services, as children stand to benefit most from such treatment.  This means that only a limited dental service is available in most areas for adults in the lower income group.  In particular, dentures are provided only on a restricted basis in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Article 3 of the Dental and Aural Appliances Regulations, 1961, the legal liability of each health authority to make dentures available for persons in the lower income group is limited to the extent to which it can make such appliances available from a sum determined each year, by the Minister for Health, after consultation with the health authority.  In fixing this sum, which it is hoped it will be possible to increase from year to year according as dental facilities are improved, I propose to have regard to what the health authority can reasonably be expected to do, bearing in <Col N="547" /> mind the prior need to provide a good service for children.  The Regulations also stipulate that in making dentures available to persons in the lower income group, a health authority shall have particular regard to the needs of expectant and nursing mothers and of persons suffering from tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>Health Authorities have been hampered in providing dental services by the difficulty in recruiting and retaining the services of whole-time dental surgeons.  A large number of such posts has recently been advertised by the Local Appointments Commissioners and it is hoped that sufficient candidates will be forthcoming as an improved salary scale has recently been approved for such posts.</P>
    <P>I am keeping the position regarding the expansion of this service and, in particular, the matter of the recruitment of additional dentists, under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say to what extent, if any, there is in operation a service for the provision of free dentures to people who have not this service from the Department of Social Welfare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have fully dealt with that matter in the reply.  I have nothing to add to the reply I have already given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did say the extent of the responsibility on the local authority, but I am asking if there is in any local authority now a scheme for the provision of dentures to people who have not the service available to them from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, yes; but I have already explained that our ability to provide this service is limited, not <Col N="548" /> merely by the funds available, but by the fact that qualified dental personnel is not available and has not been so far obtainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will give his Department's estimate of the cost per annum of the provision of dental services for expectant or nursing mothers not covered by employment insurance, and the estimated cost on the basis of 50 per cent. of the cost of dentures being provided by the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to estimate the cost of the provision of dental services for expectant and nursing mothers as it will depend to a large extent on the demand for the services; and from the information available in my Department I am not in a position to assess accurately the probable use which would be made by expectant and nursing mothers of such services.</P>
      <P>However, on the basis of the information available, it is estimated that the annual cost of providing, through health authorities, dental services, treatment and dentures, for expectant and nursing mothers of all classes, except those eligible for dental benefit under the Department of Social Welfare Scheme, would be approximately £180,000; the annual cost on the basis of the patient contributing 50 per cent. of the cost of dentures would be approximately £155,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that, at <Col N="549" /> present, health authorities are only empowered to provide dental services for mothers in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>Article 4 of the Dental and Aural Appliances Regulations, 1961, requires health authorities to have particular regard to the needs of expectant and nursing mothers in the provision of dentures under their existing dental service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the steps which health and local authorities can take to combat the menace of rat infestation; and if he will take steps to promote a national campaign against the rat menace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities are empowered by the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, as amended, to serve a notice on the occupier of any land, including buildings, requiring him to take such steps as are prescribed in the notice for the destruction of rats and mice, or for preventing infestation with rats or mice.  Alternatively, a local authority may, after 24 hours' notice in writing, take the necessary steps themselves and may recover any reasonable expenses so incurred from the occupier.  A person authorised in writing by a local authority under the Act may enter any land or buildings for the purpose of ascertaining whether the requirements of the Act are being complied with.</P>
      <P>In addition to these general provisions, proprietors of food premises are required, under the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950, to take adequate measures for preventing the contamination of food by rats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Health, my interest in the problem of rat infestation is concerned chiefly with the possibility of the spread of disease.  The position generally regarding enforcement of control measures has improved appreciably in recent years and local authorities have available to them the services of health inspectors who have been specially trained in rodent control. I do not consider that, from a health point of view, special measures <Col N="550" /> in addition to those at present operated are called for.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern in this matter is limited to the qualifications and the salary attaching to the posts involved.</P>
      <P>Qualifications are settled without regard to the type of authority with which any previous service was given, the only exception being that when an upper age limit is prescribed, it is customary to provide, broadly, for exemption for persons who are already permanent officers in the local authority service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not satisfied that the upper age limit should extend to Army service?  Is he not further of the opinion that service in the Army is equivalent to local authority service in these pensionable posts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept that contention at all.  So far as the local authority health service is concerned, it is quite a different type of service from that which is operating in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister asserting that the service given by doctors and nurses in the Army is not of the same type as that given by doctors and nurses in local authorities and does he assert that their service is of a lower standard than that rendered to the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not assert that it is of a lower standard.  I say the circumstances in which it is given are different and they cannot be regarded as officers of local authorities.  The <Col N="551" /> Army is not a local authority, you know.</P>

A person may retire from the Army service, having received a substantial gratuity and in the enjoyment of a pension, and should he be put in a position to compete with persons who have to stay for a great deal longer in the local authority service before they get an equivalent pension?  I think equity is against that.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>The primary aim of Government policy in the commercial and industrial sectors of the economy is to encourage private investment in these fields of activity.  In certain cases, however, undertakings have had to be sponsored as Government projects either for particular reasons of public policy or&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot hear a word the Minister is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  In certain cases, I say, however, undertakings have had to be sponsored as Government <Col N="553" /> projects either for particular reasons of public policy or because it was considered unlikely that they would be initiated by private interests. It is desirable, where circumstances permit, that the Irish investing public be given the opportunity of sharing as widely as practicable in the control of these undertakings, and this objective is kept constantly in mind by the Government. The issue to the public of shares in State-sponsored concerns would not only encourage more private investment in Irish commercial and industrial projects by widening the field of investment but would also result in the freeing of State-owned capital for other desirable purposes.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will appreciate, however, that there are certain difficulties to be surmounted, including the problems of obtaining for the State a fair recompense in respect of capital already invested and, where a monopoly position is enjoyed, ensuring that the affairs of the companies would continue to be conducted in the national interest.</P>
      <P>My recent statement on the matter, to which the Deputies have referred, was intended to convey that at the moment I have under examination the possibility of putting on the public market some of the capital of State-sponsored companies.  I am not yet, however, in a position to say which companies are likely to be included in these proposals or to give any further details.  Much preparatory work has still to be done.</P>

      <P>The cost of building the new Abbey Theatre is provisionally estimated at £244,000 (excluding professional fees).  Under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1959, a sum not exceeding £250,000 may be made available from dormant court funds towards the cost of the theatre; this will be the limit of State assistance towards the project. The Government has the right of appointing one of the Abbey directors for so long as the annual State grant-in-aid of the expenses of the Abbey continues.  The owners of the new theatre will be the National Theatre Society Ltd.  As the Society is a private company, a director could not transfer his shares without the permission of the whole board of directors.  In connection with the offer of State assistance for the rebuilding project a formal agreement was made in 1957 between the Minister for Finance and the National Theatre Society Ltd., under which the Society cannot, without the written consent of the Minister, dispose of the new theatre or allow it to be used for any non-theatrical purpose.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy <Col N="560" /> is referring to the drain in the townland of Fairfield for which a full-cost grant was authorised in last summer's programme of bog drainage schemes. The grant was sanctioned on condition that all necessary consents would be forthcoming, but as two of the farmers whose interests appear to be affected have refused to sign the standard form giving their consent to the work, the Special Employment Schemes Office were not in a position to put it in hands.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The works sanctioned for Passage East, one of the five ports selected for development as major fishery harbours, are the provision of a quay parallel with the deep-water channel of Waterford Harbour and reclamation of a large area to provide space for development of shore facilities.  The order of cost is £280,000. Before construction work can be put in hands it is necessary to have engineering surveys made&mdash;including trial borings, soil sampling and hydraulic investigations&mdash;so that a detailed design of the scheme can be prepared.</P>
      <P>A commission for the hydraulic investigations was placed in September, 1961, and experts have made a survey on the site and are at present carrying out investigations at their laboratories. A report is expected from them next month.</P>
      <P>A contract for trial borings and soil samplings was placed with a Swedish firm on 2nd November, 1961: owing to the exploratory nature of the work it is not possible to determine in advance the precise extent of the work and therefore the completion date for the contract is uncertain but it will be several months before the results are available.</P>

    <P>Design work cannot proceed until <Col N="562" /> the results of the borings, soil sampling and hydraulic investigations are available for study.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>Bread prices were freed from control in 1957 and I am not, therefore, in a position to give precise reasons for the recent increase.  I understand, however, that increased labour costs have resulted in increased costs of production in the bakery industry and that the recent reduction in the price of bakers' flour has not been sufficient to offset these increased costs.  While, therefore, I share fully the concern of Deputies for the poorer sections of the community, there are no grounds for assuming that re-introduction of price control would result in the price being reduced to its previous level.</P>
      <P>However, I am keeping the situation under close observation and I will, of course, use the powers conferred on me by the Prices Act, 1958, if circumstances should seem to me to arise which would justify such a course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>This an unofficial strike.  In 1956, a joint conference of workers' and employers' representatives unanimously accepted the recommendations of a working party which they had set up to examine unofficial strikes and to consider steps that might be taken to avoid them.  The recommendations, which were endorsed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <i>inter alia</i>, discouraged unofficial strikes and intervention in them by third parties.  There is well established machinery available for the determination of the matter in dispute and it is obvious that the best course to be followed as advised by the trade unions concerned is to have recourse to this machinery.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in reply to a question by Deputy S. Collins last Thursday, delays in dealing with housing grants have arisen in various areas because of an increase in the volume of cases arising for inspection and also on account of difficulties experienced during the present year in keeping our inspectorial staff up to strength, due to a current shortage in available engineering <Col N="577" /> personnel.  In the case of Sligo-Leitrim the staff was increased by an additional inspector last month.  The arrears in Leitrim have been substantially reduced and the staff has now been instructed to concentrate on the arrears in County Sligo.</P>

Everything is being done to remedy the situation and nobody would be more happy than I if these matters could be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In August of last year I had a full discussion in a cordial atmosphere in Belfast with Lord Glentoran, then Minister of Commerce, on the general policy and operations of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  We reviewed the work of the Commission and the results achieved since its establishment in 1952.  On examining the law for fishery protection we agreed that the existing legislation may be inadequate in some respects.  We arranged for further consideration of the question of introducing amending legislation for the purpose of increasing the severity of penalties for the poisoning of fish.  Our valuable exchange of views has led to the present Bill.</P>
      <P>This short amending Bill has one unusual characteristic in common with the principal Act of 1952, namely, that a measure in closely parallel terms has been introduced in the Belfast Parliament and, I understand, is receiving its Second Reading there today.  The two Bills are, in fact, the fruit of collaboration between the draftsmen of both Parliaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputies will refer to the notes circulated showing the effect on the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, of Sections 4, 6, 8 and 9 of this Bill, they will see how the various insertions and substitutions fit in.  For Section 10 of the <Col N="587" /> Bill the notes show the side titles of the provisions of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, which are to apply in the Moville area instead of corresponding provisions in their pre-1959 form.  Perhaps I should explain that the Moville area is the part of the Foyle area within the State.</P>
    <P>Taking the sections of the Bill seriatim, the first section calls for no comment beyond saying that it establishes the link between the 1952 Act and the modifications in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Of the definitions contained in Section 2, all but that substituting the Minister for Lands for the Minister for Agriculture in consequence of the transfer of functions which took place in 1957, have reference to the provisions in Section 3 relating to use or possession of deleterious matter which is defined to include an explosive. There was no definition of deleterious matter in the 1952 Act and the present definition is somewhat more comprehensive than that in the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.</P>
    <P>Coming to Section 3, we now have a single section in substitution for Sections 41 and 42 of the 1952 Act which deal with the use or possession of explosives and the use or possession of deleterious matter for the capture, destruction or injury of fish.  The maximum fine under Section 41 is £100 and that under Section 42 is £50.  In place of the existing penalties, we now propose&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding £100, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both such fine and such imprisonment;</P>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment, a fine not exceeding £500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both such fine and such imprisonment;</P>
    <P>The application of the Probation of Offenders Act is also to be excluded. I might say here that, should the gravity of the offence warrant the taking of proceedings by way of indictment, the usual procedure of the criminal justice code would apply and <Col N="588" /> should the offender, at the District Court hearing for the purpose of taking depositions, elect to plead guilty, it would be competent for that court to deal with the case summarily, subject to the consent of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>When the insertions to be made by Section 4 are read with the aid of the note already circulated, it will be seen that the tailer and the snare are added to the list of devices which it is an offence to use or possess for the purpose of taking any fish.  The tailer, which may be regarded as a somewhat elaborate snare, may, of course, be used as an auxiliary to lawful angling and provision is made to safeguard its legitimate use.</P>
    <P>The new provision in Section 5 makes it an offence to use a boat or vehicle as an aid to the commission of any other fishery offence and applies penalties on the same scale as in Section 3.  While, at first sight, it may seem excessive to provide for proceedings by way of indictment in respect of the new offence, it must be borne in mind that the value of the vehicle or boat involved may be such as to place the proceedings outside the jurisdiction of the District Court.  In the case of a vehicle, however, automatic forfeiture as a statutory consequence of conviction shall not apply but, where a conviction is obtained on indictment, it is left to the discretion of the Court to order that the vehicle be forfeited.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is to amend subsection (1) of Section 64 of the 1952 Act which sets out the powers conferred on an authorised officer for inspection, examination and detention as required for the enforcement of the Act.</P>
    <P>The first amendment adds &ldquo;any hotel, guest house, restaurant or other premises or place at which board and lodging or meals are provided for reward&rdquo; to the various places to which an authorised officer is to have access. The need for this addition speaks for itself: it is unfortunately only too common that hotels and other catering premises offer convenient outlets for the poacher's catch.  Purchases of salmon by the owners of such premises have been kept under surveillance but doubts have been expressed as to whether the existing wording extended <Col N="589" /> to hotels and the like; this matter is being put beyond doubt by adding the new category.</P>
    <P>The next amendment to be made by Section 6 inserts &ldquo;the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959&rdquo; in a paragraph which then empowers an authorised officer to seize fish in respect of which there is an offence or suspected offence under that Act: the existing power is related only to offences under the 1952 Act.  A possible defect in the powers of seizure is thus removed.  The final amendment to be made by Section 6 is consequential on the creation by Section 5 of the offence of using a boat or vehicle as an aid to the commission of a fishery offence: it authorises the seizure of such a boat or vehicle.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is also consequential on the creation by Section 5 of the offence of using a boat as an aid to the commission of a fishery offence and consists of a substituted section for Section 65 of the 1952 Act which is confined to disposal of fishing engines seized.  The new section indicates in paragraph (a) the circumstances in which the District Justice shall order forfeiture of a boat. Paragraphs (b) and (c) relate to fishing engines and are to the same effect respectively as paragraphs (a) and (b) of the existing Section 65, while paragraph (d) provides for the residual instances in which it becomes the duty of the District Justice to order the return of the boat or fishing engine to the person who appears to be the owner thereof.  Provision is not made for application to the Court in respect of a vehicle used as an aid to the commission of an offence for the reason that the ownership of the vehicle could readily be ascertained and its use would usually be the subject of proceedings under the new provision inserted by Section 5.</P>
    <P>Section 8 which is also consequential on Section 5 inserts a boat among the articles automatically forfeited as a statutory consequence of conviction.</P>
    <P>The next group of amendments&mdash;in Section 9 of the Bill&mdash;will have effect on the Third Schedule to the 1952 Act which relates to the constitution, powers, procedure etc. of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> The first of these amendments makes good an important omission by enlarging the powers of the Commission so as to enable it to take legal proceedings for the enforcement within the area, of any law relating to fisheries&mdash; and not merely the law under the 1952 Act.  This enlargement of the Commission's powers is, of course, in keeping with the extension of the powers of its authorised officers effected by paragraph (b) of Section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The next insertion to be made by Section 9 relates to the Secretary of the Commission.  There are four members of the Commission&mdash;two appointed by the Belfast Ministry and two by me. The existing provision is that the Secretary shall be the junior member who was appointed to the Commission by the authority other than that by whom the senior member who is the Chairman for the time being was appointed. Since 1957, the Commission has employed an executive officer resident in the Foyle Area with responsibility for the day-to-day working of the measures of administration and control of the fisheries.  In the light of experience, it is now proposed that the Commission should be empowered to appoint a whole-time Secretary to discharge the statutory duties of that office.  Subject to Ministerial approval the Commission would have power to appoint or remove a Secretary and, if the post of Secretary filled under that power is at any time vacated, the position will be that the Secretaryship will, for the time being, be held as originally provided by the appropriate junior member of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The final amendment to be made by Section 9 is the insertion of provisions to enable the Commission to make a pension scheme for its officers and servants.  The Commission, in common with statutory bodies generally, feels obliged to make provision for superannuation of members of its staff&mdash;pensions and gratuities for a permanent establishment of administrative and supervisory staff and retirement gratuities for long-service members of subordinate status.  The provisions to be inserted follow, in the main, the conventional pattern of enabling clauses for a <Col N="591" /> superannuation scheme.  I might mention that the Commission hopes to be in a position to finance the proposed pension scheme out of its own resources.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the effect of Section 10 of the Bill is to take note of the enactment of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, and to extend to the Moville Area the provisions of that Act which are listed in the Table. The present position is that the corresponding provisions in the various Acts consolidated for the remainder of the State in 1959 are in force in their pre-1959 form in the Moville Area since they were not repealed in respect of that area by the Consolidation Act. Some of these provisions will fall to be amended according as the Consolidation Act is brought up to date and it is, therefore, necessary to adopt them in the Moville Area in their consolidated form so that future amendments of the 1959 Act may also apply to that Area.</P>
    <P>Section 11 contains the usual provisions as to short title, collective citation and commencement.  When this Bill and the parallel Bill in Belfast become law, arrangements can be made to fix the same date for bringing both of them into operation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, perhaps I may say that I am fully satisfied that the extensions of the powers of the Foyle Fisheries Commission proposed in this Bill are fully justified in the light of experience and that, while some of the new penal provisions may appear somewhat draconic, they cannot be held to be unwarranted, considering how valuable are the fisheries, the welfare of which has been entrusted to the Commission.  In sponsoring this legislation it is my wish to signify my complete confidence in the Commission in carrying out the difficult task imposed upon it; and it is on this note that I recommend the Bill to the favourable consideration of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be brief in dealing with this matter.  May I say at the outset that we have no <Col N="592" /> objection whatever to the Foyle Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1961.  On the contrary, I personally take very great pleasure in welcoming this measure.  I should like to say that from my own knowledge, the Foyle Fisheries Commission, which was set up in 1952, has done very valuable and very useful work.  It has performed its duties in a very capable manner. Certainly, it has performed them in a very efficient way.  When we come now to comment or pass judgment upon the workings of a Commission which is representative of the Government in the Six Counties and of our own Government, we can see that, with co-operation and with a spirit of friendliness and understanding, very valuable, useful and effective work can be carried out in the successful management of these fisheries which happen to be on both sides of the border&mdash;the Moville area, under the jurisdiction of the Republic, and the remainder of the fisheries under the jurisdiction of the Six County Government.</P>
      <P>I think this is one instance we can view with gratification and admiration. Very excellent work was performed and undertaken by the representatives of both Governments who sat round a table frequently to deal with the progress, development and good management of the fisheries in general.  The results have been very gratifying and the Bill, which the Minister is now asking this House to pass, is in my opinion a very reasonable one.  It is one which we welcome and gladly support.  If in the future we are going to work for the common good of this country with commissions, containing representatives of both Governments, I feel that if there is the same spirit of understanding, the same spirit of national uplifting and national progress we can do a good deal of work.  A great example has been shown to the rest of the country and, indeed, for that matter, to the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come here today to view the work of this Commission while at the same time there is probably before the Stormont Parliament a similar Bill under discussion at the moment.  That shows that, with commonsense and <Col N="593" /> understanding on both sides, we can do very good and valuable work which will be of great benefit to this country. I think that the Foyle Fisheries Commission, established in 1952, has served a great national purpose. It has brought about a spirit of understanding in relation to this very important fishery.  The Foyle fisheries are, as we all know, probably one of the most important and most beneficial fisheries in the State today.  I think that the powers which this Bill will give the Commission and the legislation which the Minister now recommends to this House are very reasonable.</P>
    <P>He has pointed out very very clearly the very serious view taken by the Commission and by the State in relation to illegal fishing.  That is why I want to repeat what I said on many other occasions in this House.  Any action that is taken to prevent illegal fishing and prevent the activities of poaching our valuable fisheries deserves the wholehearted support and co-operation of everybody who has the interests of the fisheries at heart.  Under Section 3 of this Bill the powers sought are, indeed, very reasonable.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is one way in which we can stamp out illegal fishing and that is, apart from good protection staffs, by having the co-operation of the general public.  That is why the co-operation of the public is so urgently needed not alone in this area but in all areas by everybody who has the interests of our fisheries at heart.  I have always felt&mdash;and I feel it is still the position&mdash;that our courts and our district justices have been far too lenient with those who have been guilty of fishery offences.  If we are to foster and develop our fisheries and if a greater measure of financial support will be given to those who are depending for their livelihood on fishing, I feel that by co-operation, by a spirit of harmony and by proper protection services being made available, it will eventually turn out that there will be a better type of fish and more fish available.  There will probably be a better livelihood for those who have to obtain their living from those fisheries as a result of this measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> I feel that this Bill is not being brought in without the Commission having had to examine very carefully the position in relation to poaching. Poaching is probably the lowest form of fishing that can be undertaken.  Certainly, nobody has any respect for those engaged in illegal fishing.  That is why I also am very glad to note that under this Bill the Commission will take steps to reorganise the protection staffs.  I have often wondered why that has not been done, not only in the Foyle area, but in many other areas. I hope the Commission will not consider any question of expense in relation to providing a good protection staff.  I have been always of the opinion that water bailiffs and those responsible for protecting our fisheries probably could not take a keen interest in their work when they were not properly paid for it.  I hope the Commission, representative of the Governments of the North and South, will be an example and an inspiration to the rest of the country in relation to having a first-class protection staff.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the people who are engaged in illegal fishing on either side of the Border require additional vigilance in this regard, but I do hope, in the interest of the fisheries, for the safeguarding and improvement of the fisheries, the Commission will endeavour to increase its protection staff considerably.</P>
    <P>I welcome very sincerely the provisions whereby the employees of the Commission will be catered for and their future safeguarded.  I also welcome very sincerely the idea of the appointment of a whole-time secretary to discharge the duties of the Commission. That is something that is long overdue and which will put the work of the Commission on a firmer and sounder basis.</P>
    <P>The pension scheme for officers and servants is an excellent idea and I hope and trust it will be an encouragement to them to discharge their duties with greater enthusiasm.  At least, it will make their position more secure.</P>
    <P>If there is a first-class supervisory staff and if there is the co-operation of the Garda Síochána, which we have had in this area, on both sides of the <Col N="595" /> Border, the work of the servants of the Commission and those responsible for the protection of the fisheries will be made easier.  With co-operation, there can be much better results.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that the general pattern of fishery protection throughout the country may follow the line set out in this Bill and that all the water-keepers and all those engaged in fishery protection may be given at some later stage the benefit of superannuation and pension schemes and much improved working conditions.  It is very important to have a contented staff, who will be enthusiastic about their work and will know that they will be provided for on retirement. That is why I think this is a good Bill, which we on this side of the House very warmly support.</P>
    <P>I know from my own experience that there is still a great outlet for the disposal of poached salmon to hotels, boarding houses, restaurants, cafés, and so on.  There should be more rigid operation of the registration of purchases of salmon.  Under existing laws, guesthouse owners and hoteliers are bound to keep a record of purchases of salmon but I do not think it has worked well or satisfactorily.  There should be provision for a greater degree of supervision in relation to purchases of salmon.  It is disgraceful that owners of hotels and business houses should encourage illegal fishing by providing an outlet for the poacher's catch.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that the measures taken in this Bill, at some later stage, may be enshrined in our general fisheries code so that, not alone in relation to fisheries under the jurisdiction of the Foyle Fisheries Commission but in relation to fisheries throughout the country, a very serious view will be taken of hotels, restaurants and boarding houses which, by providing a profitable outlet, encourage poaching and illegal fishing in defiance of those responsible for fishery protection.  People who buy illegally-caught salmon display very poor citizenship.  The laws of the land should punish very severely those who provide a ready market for illegally-caught salmon.  That is why I welcome <Col N="596" /> the provisions of this Bill in this regard. They are very reasonable.</P>
    <P>There is one point on which I should like further explanation from the Minister.  Section 4 refers to the unlawful use of tailers and snares.  A tailer may be regarded as a somewhat elaborate snare and may, of course, be used as an auxiliary to lawful angling and provision is made to safeguard its legimate use.  I should like to know if that could be made a little clearer.  I should like to hear more from the Minister in that regard, because, as I understand it, tailers or these stone snares are commonly used in absolutely legal fishing.  If persons engaged in lawful angling are discovered to have in their possession these tailers or suitable snares, are they to be penalised by the courts and a very serious view taken of it?  I understand that, to a great degree, for lawful and legal fishing these types of snares are used by certain types of anglers.  The provision should be made very clear so as to safeguard the use of these tailers and snares in legal fishing.  I trust the Minister will be able to elaborate on this point so as to avoid confusion at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I have read the Bill very carefully. I cannot say that there is anything in it with which I do not agree or with which we on this side of the House do not wholeheartedly agree. We feel that it is in the interests of the fisheries and in the interests of good, business-like working of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by paying tribute to the former chairmen, the secretary and former secretaries of the Foyle Fisheries Commission for the manner in which they have always attended meetings, for the keen interest they have taken in the development of the fisheries?  It is common knowledge that the fisheries have developed to a very profitable stage, due to the amount of hard work and enthusiasm of the Commission.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I readily support this Bill.  We in this Party have no objection to it.  On the contrary, we agree with the terms of the Bill and wish its implementation every success.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> The provisions sought are reasonable and warranted and deserve the support of the House.  We readily give that support because we realise the great value it will be to the fishermen, particularly those in the Foyle area.  This legislation is most desirable.  The Party to which I belong have always been ready to co-operate with and to assist the Government in reasonable and worthwhile legislation that will be of benefit to the community.  This is one example of legislation which is of benefit to the community and to the fishing industry and which will lead, in so far as the Foyle fisheries are concerned, to a greater degree of success and progress in the protection and development of the fisheries.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo. First of all, I want to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill to Dáil Éireann and, secondly, I want to congratulate his opposite number in the North.  Both Ministers met, discussed ways and means of improving the Foyle fishery and the fisheries in the Foyle area, and as a result of that co-operation and co-discussion, have arrived at these measures to protect the fishery and to improve it in the years to come.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I also want to say that since its formation in 1952, the Foyle Fishery Commission has done a very good job there.  There has been excellent co-operation, first of all, between the Ministers; secondly, between the officials of both Departments&mdash;the Department of Lands and Fisheres here and their opposite number in the North&mdash;and thirdly, the men on the spot, the different people in the area whose responsibility it is to carry out the provisions both of the 1952 legislation and the various Orders which have been made arising from that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposed legislation we are now considering is not before its time. I attended a number of meetings of both driftnet and draftnet fishermen last year and the year before, and it was clear from those meetings, and from my own knowledge of the Foyle area, that something should be done <Col N="598" /> to restrict illegal fishing, especially illegal fishing on the rivers which form part of the Foyle fishery area.  Suggestions were made at those meetings, and by other people who are interested in this fishery, regarding the restriction of anglers' licences.  Since 1952, any restrictions imposed were imposed against the net fishermen, both the driftnet and the draftnet fishermen.  We feel that those restrictions were very severe in some cases but those restrictions have been operated and I know from my personal knowledge that the net fishermen are playing their part and co-operating in every way, although they were the people who bore the brunt of any restrictions that were imposed up to last year.</P>
    <P>The Commission took its first step last year in dealing with the anglers. I am not against the anglers.  I know that there are a large number of genuine anglers, but there are others who are not genuine.  There are anglers who use their angling licences as a blind for illegal fishing.  That is quite well known, and it is also well known to the Commission that the number of angling licences in that area for the rivers Mourne, Faughan and Finn have increased four- or fivefold.  Last year, the first step was taken to restrict the activities of the anglers by having the angling season curtailed by a fortnight at each end.  I suggest that the alarming growth in the number of anglers is something into which the Commission should look.  The measures which are set out here will, to a great extent, reduce the illegal fishing which is taking place every season on the rivers I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Illegal fishing on a river can be vastly more destructive than on the tidal sections of the Foyle.  After all, if by any chance a boat fishes illegally &mdash;which happens very seldom&mdash;no damage is done to the remainder of the fish, but where illegal fishing takes place on the rivers, by way of poisoning, blasting, or the modern methods of destroying fish quickly and in large numbers, then very great damage is done to the fry and the spawn and no mercy should be shown to anyone found attempting to use, or using, these methods of illegal fishing.  I attended a meeting of fishermen <Col N="599" /> recently at which it was pointed out that even on the lower stretches of Lough Foyle, salmon fry were washed ashore during this fishing season.</P>
    <P>The remedies to be taken will go a good way towards doing what the Foyle Commission has in mind, the building up of this very fine river, one of the best in Ireland.  The steps it has taken already have improved matters very much, although it is surprising that last year and the year before were two very bad years for driftnet and draftnet fishermen.  Indeed, fishing has not been too good either on some of the rivers.  Previously, it was unknown for two such years to follow each other and it is felt that some new factor, as yet unknown, may be entering into the run of fish and the spawning of fish.  For what it is worth, it has been suggested locally that the presence of a chemical factory, on the Derry side of the river, and also a fertiliser factory, may have something to do with that matter.  I do not know whether there is provision in the Bill whereby the use by individuals of all sorts of poisons will be illegal, but I should like the Minister to find out whether these factories, or other industrial concerns in the area, are causing the damage which some local people say may be or is being caused.</P>
    <P>The whole idea, of course, in this legislation, as in the 1952 legislation, is to improve and build up the fishery. The fishery is owned equally by both Governments, each having paid a purchase price of £50,000.  I realise the measures being carried out to restock the river and carry on experiments are also costly.  But I think the time has come when the Foyle Fishery Commission itself, as a step towards conserving the fishery, should cease operating the Derry stretch.  That part of the river is fished solely by the Commission.  It is fished by driftnets and, I think, stake nets.  The Commission's annual returns show that the income from the fishery is fairly substantial.  If it is not possible for the Commission&mdash;I know they must have an income&mdash;completely to abandon the fishing of the Derry stretch, as it is known, then at least <Col N="600" /> they should very much curtail their activities there.</P>
    <P>A good part of the £50,000 has now been repaid to the Exchequers of both Governments.  I know these meetings between the Ministers and officials of our Department and their opposite numbers took place some time last year and that the whole question of the Foyle and the problems connected with it were discussed.  I am glad to note it was not found necessary further to curtail the activities of these driftnet and trawl fishermen who earn their livelihood on the river as their ancestors have done for centuries.  I strongly urge that in any regulations or orders made for the coming fishing season no action be taken against those men and that they be allowed to continue their much limited activities without further restraint.  I am sure the Commission knows that the amount of illegal fishing by either of these categories is greatly reduced. Our main worry at the moment is the illegal fishing taking place in the rivers I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister said a whole-time secretary would be appointed and stated there was a resident official in the area who dealt with matters on the spot. I should like to know where the offices of the secretary will be located, whether they will be in Dublin or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to introduce this legislation to prohibit illegal fishing, but the passing of legislation is not sufficient.  Are the Minister and the Commission satisfied that on the various rivers, the Faughan, Mourne and Finn, there are sufficient water-keepers to see to it that the provisions of this Bill will be carried out.  That is highly desirable, because it is a difficult matter to deal with these rather long rivers in a territory hard to supervise.  The problem is made more difficult because of the large number of people who have a legal right to be there by virtue of holding an angler's licence.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provision which deals with hotels, I take it that it will not be confined to hotels in the Foyle area but that the Minister has in mind to apply it later to the whole country?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> It would seem to be ineffective if it deals only with hotels situated within the Foyle area itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the whole area, I think.  Would the Minister clear up that for us?  Does it refer to every hotel in the State?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill refers solely to the Foyle area.  It is my intention to tell the House I shall be coming along in a short time with another Bill to deal with the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has clarified that point.  The section would really be ineffective if it were left as it is, without further amending legislation to deal with the whole country.  Everyone knows that fish caught illegally do not necessarily find a market in the hotel next door. They travel far and fast.</P>
      <P>In regard to Section 10, I should like the Minister to explain the difference between the Moville area, as mentioned there, and the entire Foyle area. I do not think it is very clear.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude by saying I trust the effect of this Bill when it becomes an Act will be an improvement in the fishery, that the provisions of the Bill will be strictly enforced and that those who damage the fishing stocks of the river by illegal fishing will be punished. This is a measure which has the support of this House, which will have the support of the fishermen who earn their livelihood in that area and the support of genuine anglers not only in the district but, I am sure, throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Bill as an indication of progress, I shall not be as complimentary to the Minister as the two previous speakers.  As a representative of the fishermen of the Foyle area, and knowing their grievances, I feel that consideration should be given to the advisory body elected by the fishermen to spotlight the grievances they have, and perhaps at times they think they have.  It is a known fact that the Commission refused to meet this advisory council when the Press were <Col N="602" /> present.  That suggests they had something to hide.  Some provision should be included in the Bill giving some authority to an expression of views by the advisory council and, while I am on that point, I should like to recommend that a reform in the election of the advisory council should be initiated.</P>
      <P>With regard to the fishermen and their catches, I understand there is a levy of 1d. in the 1b. on salmon catches on the River Foyle and 2d. in the 1b. on spring fish.  That levy is payable by the Donegal fishermen only and does not apply to the Northern Ireland fishermen.  The position can be explained by taking the example of two brothers, one living in Northern Ireland and the other in Donegal. Fishing the same river, they pay the same licence fee but one pays the levy of 1d. in one instance, and 2d. in the other, whereas his brother does not. There is also the question of the potential employment in Donegal in regard to the packing of fish.  I recommend that this levy should be removed.</P>
      <P>There is another point I should like to bring out.  The Commission pays roughly £10,000 per annum to both Governments.  I hold that the Foyle fisheries is one of the finest industries in Donegal and that it should receive more consideration.  With the greatest respect, I suggest that if it were some other industry established by the Fianna Fáil Party, money would be ploughed back into it.  This is an industry using home resources and employing Irishmen.  Many poor fishermen make their livelihood in that industry, while this £10,000 per annum is paid by the Commission in repayment of principal and interest, I understand, to both Governments.</P>
      <P>The licence fee of the poorer class of fishermen has been increased by 50 per cent, from £16 to £24 per annum. I believe the fishermen in the upper reaches of the Foyle are being given a raw deal, and I suggest that the money which is being paid by the Commission should be ploughed back into the Foyle fisheries industry to expand the spawning beds and to improve the rearing of the fry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also remarkable to note that while the Commission increased the <Col N="603" /> cost of the licence, they have total assets of £40,000.  That again suggests that it is a profit-making concern.  I should like in conclusion to ask the Minister if he would name the manager, as shown in appendix 1, page 18, of the 9th annual report.  I should also like him to inform me of his complete functions.</P>

      <P>The Chair is aware of that but Deputy Harte is making his maiden speech and it is usual in those circumstances to allow a certain amount of latitude. The matter referred to by the Deputy does not arise on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point which I should like to make was touched on by Deputy Cunningham.  It is a slur, to the minds of Donegal Deputies, to note that according to the Bill the hoteliers in Donegal are the only hoteliers who cater for and have truck with poached fish.  I would ask the Minister to apply that generally to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill because we think it is a step in the right direction.  Some speakers referred to the fact that there was co-operation between the Northern Ireland Government and our Government with regard to the Foyle Commission.  I do not think we should be surprised that fellow Irishmen can co-operate.  If there were a little more such co-operation, possibly it would be much better for the country both north and south.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally welcome the Bill because it introduces a new element.  In fact, it has established a precedent which I hope the Minister will follow when introducing amending legislation.  I refer, of course, to Section 9 (c) which provides pensions for the employees of the board.  This is the first fisheries board in the country to provide pensions for its employees, its officials and <Col N="604" /> servants, and I hope when the amount of the pensions is being fixed, we will not find what we found recently when under another pension scheme decent pensions were cut down by the Department of Finance, and men with over 20 years' service were offered pensions of between 15/- and £1 per week.  I hope that when pensions are being given to these men, they will not be treated in the same way.</P>
    <P>I should like also to see included&mdash; perhaps provision is made for it but it is not shown here&mdash;some method of dealing with the fishery protection staff. The fishery protection staff have a dangerous job, a job which weaklings cannot perform, which requires resourcefulness, courage and intelligence. Yet, in answer to a question which I put down this day week, the Parliamentary Secretary gave me figures showing that people in a similar type of job to that being done on the Foyle by the fisheries protection staff receive a rate of pay of from £4 10s. Od. to £7 per week.  They are not people who clock in at 9 o'clock in the morning and clock out at 5 o'clock.  I asked what were the conditions of employment of these people and I was told there was no record of them in the Department.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to challenge the Minister to prove that those people and the people in the Foyle area are also required to work at least twelve hours per day for seven days of the week. There is no provision made for hours of work.  There is no distinction made whether they work in the daytime or at nighttime.  There is no provision made for Sundays, bank holidays, church holidays or even annual leave.  The recent legislation dealt with the annual leave question, but the other questions are left wide open.  I should like the Minister to have another look at this, particularly when he is considering amending legislation which will affect a very much wider range of employees and will cover employees of boards of conservators all over the country.</P>
    <P>As regards what Deputy Harte said, there is a tendency to go near to the Border, to compare the good things on the far side with the bad things <Col N="605" /> here.  We seldom compare them the other way round.  However, I am sure the Minister has this question in mind and that, when he is introducing his amending legislation, he will do something about it.  I think also that Deputy Cunningham's point about the number of the fisheries staff must be borne in mind.  We find from experience&mdash;I am a member myself of a board of conservators&mdash;that fishery protection staff is not nearly adequate anywhere in the country.</P>
    <P>People are expected to be able to work miracles and the number required is usually governed by the amount of money available.  From some of the figures here, I would assume there is an adequate supply of money available to provide for an adequate staff in the Foyle area and I hope that will be done.  It would be just too bad if we had a continuation of the bad old system where three or four men are expected to do the work of ten, to work night and day, Sunday and Monday, and be paid the lowest wages of anyone in the country.</P>
    <P>I am sure the people from the North who are connected with this, having a different set of wage structures before them, will put the question of a decent wage fairly high and I am sure when the Minister sees the rates, there will not be any differentiation in regard to wages and conditions between those who are from Northern Ireland and those from the South, that having had a look at what is being paid he will then apply it as far as he possibly can to a similar type of employment in the Republic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the reception this Bill has received.  I think, too, I should place on record my appreciation of the way in which I was met by Lord Glentoran and his officials in Belfast when I went there to discuss this matter.  I should also like to place on record my appreciation of the valuable work done, not alone by the Commission but by the advisory body that was referred to here. The advisory body is a statutory body under the 1952 principal Act and they have done very valuable work down through the years.  They have given <Col N="606" /> very valuable advice and help to the Commission in its work.  I shall come back to that in a moment in view of something Deputy Harte had to say on the question of the advisory body <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Commission generally.</P>
      <P>It is of course true, as Deputy Flanagan has stated, that a good protection staff is very necessary particularly in the protection of a valuable fishery of this kind.  With regard to what has been said by Deputy Flanagan and other Deputies about the adequacy of protection, I concede that all the legislation we may conceive here will not be effective unless there is an adequate staff.  I believe a far more effective way of protecting our fisheries is to educate public opinion as to the value of them.  I have always felt that part of our difficulty in this field is due largely to our history and I believe that, as time goes on, our people will become more and more aware of the value of our fisheries, particularly of our inland fisheries.  Indeed, the figures show that more and more of our own people are participating in this form of sport.  Therefore outside the commercial aspects of fisheries such as these, there is a new awareness among our people that these fisheries must be protected in the interests of good sportsmanship, if for no other interest, and the more quickly we proceed and educate public opinion along these lines, the more effective will be our protection against poaching.</P>
      <P>I should state that many other matters, indeed the whole administration of the Foyle Fisheries Commission since its inception, were discussed when I was in Belfast and these are just some of the urgent matters by way of legislation that we decided it was desirable to introduce as soon as possible.  Poaching by way of poisoning has become a serious menace, particularly since the war.  I think it came largely to the North of Ireland from Scotland and poaching of this type has been organised on a commercial basis with modern poisons and organised gangs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was therefore thought very urgent and necessary, particularly in view of the experience up there in some of the rivers&mdash;the river Fen, the river Faughan and elsewhere in the Foyle fisheries <Col N="607" /> area&mdash;that immediate steps should be taken to tighten up the law and make the punishment fit the crime.  We have gone in that direction here.  More elaborate provisions on these lines will be necessary in the general law of the land to deal with this problem so far as the whole of our national territory is concerned.</P>
    <P>It may not be understood by many members of the House, that the up-to-date 1959 Consolidation Act was specifically excluded from that area.  Under this Bill, we are bringing all the provisions of that up-to-date law as specified in this Act to bear on the Foyle area, so that the Commission's hand will be strengthened, not alone by the specific powers we are giving them under this Bill but also by the up-to-date powers that are contained in the Fisheries Consolidation Act of 1959.</P>
    <P>In regard to the work being done in the Foyle fisheries area on conservancy and the protection of fisheries, it was agreed at our discussions that certain conservancy measures should be taken and many of these measures are in fact already in force there.  The time for fishing was restricted and indeed restricted by the Commission themselves voluntarily as to the time they would operate.  We thought it only right, and the Commission thought it only right, that some restrictions should also be applied to the rod men. They also have been restricted in the times of their operation in the general interests of the fishery in order to ensure that we will get it to the stage that it will carry the fullest possible stock that the system can support.  A survey of the system has recently been undertaken with a view to selecting sites for installation of suitable counting devices.  Already an electronic counter for adult fish has been installed in the fish pass in the Campsie barrage on the River Faughan.  Devices are also being planned for the counting of smolts on their seaward migration.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Cunningham has stated, that results were disappointing in that area in the last year or two and in the system generally.  I am afraid the complaint has been general <Col N="608" /> as far as salmon fishing is concerned throughout the whole country and the results this last season have been equally disappointing.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to put one's finger on the exact causes of the bad fishing in some of these areas during the past year or two.  The suggestion by Deputy Cunningham that there may be some pollution by industrial effluent will be conveyed by me to the Commission. I am sure any possibility of damage from that source will be fully investigated by the Commission.</P>
    <P>On the question of the funds at the disposal of the Commission, I should point out that outside the repayment of the capital invested by both Governments in this undertaking, there is also the question of an extensive improved programme of the fishery itself.  That has been planned.  Some of the engineering works are already under way.  In the main, these works are aimed at giving potential spawning fish access to spawning grounds at present under-used.  Improvements have been carried out at Newtownstewart hatchery and plans are in hand for the rearing of fry at a number of points on the system with a view to the stocking of selected waters with fingerling fish.  On the whole, the prospects seem good for an increase in the stock of fish being supported by the Foyle system generally.  The agreement that was reached on both sides for the conservancy of the stocks and the stopping of the restriction on the hours of netting and, indeed, the restriction on rod anglers, all have the one objective, that is, to get as many salmon as the experts believe the system can support.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan raised a question on Section 4 in connection with the use of a tailer.  A tailer, as I have stated, is an elaborate snare&mdash; it is really a snare with a handle.  I am aware that it is used by some anglers. I have not seen it in much use by anglers in my own part of the world but it is used in other places instead of a gaff in order to prevent damage in the landing of a fish.  It is also used by some fishery owners for taking out stocks.  I can assure the Deputy that there is an escape clause for a <Col N="609" /> man genuinely using a tailer as an angler.  It is contained in Section 43 of the 1952 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Nowadays, most rod fishermen, even on the banks of a river, use a net.  Some of them still use a gaff.  I am sure the Deputy has seen a gaff.  It is stuck into a fish. Sometimes it destroys the tail.  A tailer is slipped over the tail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 43 of the Principal Act, the 1952 Act, is now being amended by Section 4 of this Bill. Under subsection (3) of Section 43, it is provided:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subsection (2) of this section shall not apply to the use, possession or control of</P>
      <P>(a)  a gaff&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;now also a tailer&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;used or to be used solely as an auxiliary to lawful angling between sunrise and one hour after sunset...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Therefore, the lawful angler is protected under the law against prosecution under the section to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>Let me make it quite clear that the fact that I have included the section dealing with hotels, restaurants, and so on, is no reflection on the hoteliers, restaurateurs or boarding-house keepers in the Moville and Foyle areas or in any other part of this land.  I am satisfied, irrespective of some of the offences that were committed, that the produce was not intended for local consumption but was intended to travel a very long distance indeed from the <i>locus in quo.</i> The fact remains that, on this aspect of protection, I consider that the law has been much too loose and, as I have informed the House, I have a further Bill nearly ready which I expect to introduce next session which will deal with this matter in a more detailed way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> Under some of the sections, it may be that there is sufficient power already to make inspections, but there was some doubt under the law, and I took this opportunity of clearing it up, so far as the Foyle area is concerned.  I can assure the House that the expansion of the existing law, as provided for in this Bill, will be enshrined in the new legislation which I propose to bring to the House.  Indeed, it may be necessary to go a step further as far as hotels and restaurants are concerned to ensure that the market for the poacher will be closed.</P>
    <P>I should also say that I do not suggest that all hotels and reputable restaurants are offenders.  I believe the offenders are a small minority of the trade.  The fact remains that, just as there would be very little larceny without receivers, I am convinced there would be very few poachers, particularly commercial poachers, without people to purchase their catch.  I feel one of the most effective ways of restraining poachers is by taking their market away from them.</P>
    <P>I have stated that there has already been some limitation on the Derry stretch that has been mentioned here by the operations of the fishermen, including the Commission itself there. The Derry stretch has been drawn upon heavily to finance the whole operations of this Commission.  The House will agree that the Commission must operate for the necessary funds to provide conservancy measures, watchers and the improvement of the system in the whole area which is a very substantial area.  The Derry stretch is one of the main portions on which the Commission will rely for its income.  Even to maintain the protection staff at its present level, if the commercial side of the fishery were not operated there as fully as it is now, I feel the Commission would be forced to further increase the licence of the fishermen.  So, with their improvement programme and with the cost of their protection for the whole system, the cost of restocking and conserving, it is essential that they carry on the commercial side of the best of their ability.  Indeed, we should congratulate them on the results they have <Col N="611" /> achieved and on the fact that they have been able to pay back to both Governments a considerable proportion of the capital invested since the Commission was set up as well as carrying out fairly effective improvements in this valuable fishery as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte mentioned the advisory body which is a statutory body under this Bill.  I should state that the proceedings of the advisory body, or the advisory council itself, have always been open to the Press.  When however, the Commission meets the advisory council the Press have, as a matter of agreement, been excluded and the proceedings involving discussion on matters of policy in consequence have been more freely conducted than if the Press were present. I understand an agreed statement is always issued after such meetings.  I explained elsewhere&mdash;I think in our discussions in Belfast&mdash;that, under the Foyle Fisheries Act, the Commission are entitled to attend any meeting of the advisory body.</P>
    <P>There were some differences between them for some time but in my view these might not have arisen if they were meeting much more frequently. There is always this tendency.  I do not make any reflection on the advisory body but when you have such a body they often feel that it is their advice and their decision solely that should be implemented particularly when they are a statutory advisory body as in this case.  I am very glad to say that any disagreements that existed between the Commission and the advisory body&mdash;and which were more apparent than real&mdash;in my view seem to have largely evaporated and both bodies seem to be working in full harmony.  Their interests are really the same and their objectives are the same but sometimes, from a technical viewpoint, the Commission's advisers might take one view as to the improvement of the fishery and some members of the advisory body might take another view.</P>
    <P>It is correct that on some occasions the members of the advisory body were <Col N="612" /> not <i>ad idem</i> as to what steps should be taken but all gave their views and it is not unusual among fishermen to find very many different views and arguments as to how fisheries should be rehabilitated and as to what conservancy measures should be taken. The advisory body is working very well now with the Commission and I have every reason to hope that climate will continue and that that body will continue to give the same good advice, assistance and help to the Commission as they have done in years gone by.</P>
    <P>I think it was also Deputy Harte who said the number of rod licences had increased.  Of course they have, and by a very large number, on this particular fishery.  They have also increased throughout the length and breadth of the country and I shall have conveyed to the Commission the view, if further conservancy measures should need to be contemplated, that rod fishermen must bear their fair share of the restrictions in common with net fishermen and with others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for the good of them all and I am sure the Commission will fully consider the views expressed here.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Tully's contribution I should say that the provision for the staff here had been contemplated for some time.  People who are familiar with the history of this matter will realise there was staff there in the old Foyle and Bann days, which was taken over in the first three years when the Commission succeeded the organisation that was there previously.  There was a period under the old Act when this work had to be carried on and some of the staff there at the time, employed by the predecessors of the present body, may still be there.  If so, they are provided for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputy raised the matter of the secretary.  It is contemplated, as I understand it, that the present chief executive officer who is there on the spot, and who has in fact been active as <i>de facto</i> secretary for a number of years, will be the man who will become <Col N="613" /> secretary after the passage of this Bill. He is the man who was selected, after a very careful search, for this position and although the junior member of the Commission, as I pointed out in my opening statement, has been called the secretary down through the years, in fact the chief executive officer carried out all the duties of the secretary.  I understand some questions were raised from time to time as to whether he had the authority of the statutory secretary as provided under the Foyle Fisheries Act. Taking it all round, in the light of experience, the Commission are satisfied that it is better that their chief executive officer should be appointed secretary.  Then, should there be for any reason a vacancy at any time, until the vacancy is filled, the <i>status quo</i> comes into operation and the junior member of the Commission under the 1952 Act would still come back as secretary.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the matters raised in the debate, with the possible exception of Section 10, raised, I think, by Deputy Cunningham:</P>
    <P>(1)  The provisions of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, indicated in the Table to this section shall, notwithstanding section 325 of that Act, extend to the Moville Area with the substitution, for reference to boards of conservators, of references to the Commission and, for references to a fishery district, of references to the Moville Area and subject also to the modifications mentioned in the Table.</P>
    <P>I agree that this type of legislation, having reference to different branches of the complicated fisheries code, is difficult to understand in this form.  In simple language, the reason for this provision is to apply the consolidated 1959 Act to Moville area.  Under former legislation, it was specifically excluded from the Foyle fisheries area by Section 325 and that section is now being repealed so that the modern general provisions as set out in all these tables and schedules from Section 10 of this measure on will come into effect in the Foyle area.  So in addition to the new powers given under this Bill, the Commission and officers will be armed with all the modern <Col N="614" /> fisheries protection legislation and other modern consolidated fisheries law provided for under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act of 1959.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Under the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956 (Continuance) Act, 1958, the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, which was due to expire on 9th February, 1959 was continued in force until 31st March, 1962.  The purpose of this Bill is to continue the 1956 Act in force until 31st March, 1965.</P>
      <P>The Act empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prohibit by Order the exportation of industrial goods save under a licence issued by him.  At present a number of goods are subject to export control under the Control of Exports Order, 1961, the Control of Exports (No. 2) Order, 1961, and the Control of Exports (No. 3) Order, 1961, which were made under the powers conferred by the Act. Orders made under the Act have a life of twelve months, and are required to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made, and if a resolution annulling any Order is passed by either House at any time during the currency of the Order, the Order is annulled accordingly.</P>
      <P>I consider that the time has not yet come when the export controls may be dispensed with.  Accordingly it will be necessary to continue these powers for some further time, and to enact legislation to that end.  The need is threefold:</P>
      <P>(a)  to conserve, for the benefit of home industry, raw materials continuing, or likely to continue in short supply:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from this country to Iron Curtain countries or that this country is not used as <Col N="616" /> a base through which such materials may be sent to the Iron Curtain countries from other countries, and,</P>
    <P>(c)  to have immediately available a means of dealing with the situation in the event of an international emergency developing in which the country could be drained of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, sir, I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

I know that there is a restriction on the export of certain strategic materials.  Can the Minister say if there are any materials in that category which are exported to countries other than Iron Curtain countries?</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the passing of this Bill, either, but I should like to re-pose the questions addressed to the Minister by Deputy Cosgrave.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us briefly&mdash;I do not think anybody wants him to detail them&mdash;the Orders he has found it necessary to make in the last 12 months or two years.  We appreciate the purpose of the Bill but it would I think be enlightening to the House and to the country to know if the Minister has occasion to limit or prohibit the exportation of raw materials from this country.  I wonder also if the Minister, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, considered whether it was desirable to prohibit the export of wheat from this country last year.  This may be primarily a matter for the Minister for Agriculture.  Last year, many people in this country took exception to the fact that the wheat, which millers described as being unmillable, was sold abroad for what was considered to be a cheap figure.  I am sure that the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, will <Col N="617" /> have to consider the making of an order in respect of wheat.  It would be interesting to know whether it was considered that wheat was an essential raw material in that it provides a cheap foodstuff for the Irish farmers.</P>

      <P>The Chair is absolutely right.  There is no necessity for the Minister to answer that question but perhaps he would answer the second one?  Could he define &ldquo;Iron Curtain countries&rdquo;?  I do not know how loose the term is.  People generally have an appreciation of where the Iron Curtain falls across Europe.  Is Jugoslavia, for example, considered to be one of the Iron Curtain countries?  If the Minister would tell us what these countries are, I think it would be of advantage to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me give an indication of the type of goods in question. I think I could take the obvious example of scrap metal.  The purpose is to conserve the arisings of scrap metal in the country for our own engineering and foundry industry, particularly Irish Steel Holdings.  There are exceptions whereby people engaged in the breaking up of ships they might purchase for that purpose outside the country are given licences to export the arisings from that breaking up outside the country.  The reason is that they would have been in competition with other ship-breakers for the purchase of these ships and would, therefore, be expected to get the best price they could for the material arising from the breaking up.  In the case of much of that material, licences are permitted for its export.</P>
      <P>Another example is timber.  It is necessary to control the export of timber in order to conserve the limited stocks of native timber for native sawmill and allied industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent Order was made in respect of fertilisers.  First of all, as a result of the comparatively cheap fertilisers available in this country, and, secondly, as a result of the subsidy paid by the Department of Agriculture for the benefit of our farmers, there would be an inclination to export <Col N="618" /> the fertiliser and thereby make a profit at the expense of our taxpayers. Last year, it was found necessary to impose an export control on it. Examples of strategic goods are arms, ammunition, military and naval stores, graphite, aircraft and parts thereof.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for the purpose of the Bill to define &ldquo;Iron Curtain countries&rdquo; because export controls are in force in respect of strategic goods to countries other than Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  In the event of export facilities being sought for export it would be a matter for decision as to whether the countries to which, say, ammunition was being exported, were countries that would be from our point of view countries to which to grant a licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Pilotage (Amendment) Bill, 1961: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to modify certain provisions of the Pilotage Act, 1913, to facilitate the introduction of a more efficient, economical and up-to-date pilotage service at the port of Dublin.  There has been a progressive increase in recent years in the cost of operating the existing pilotage service. It is clearly desirable to avoid further increases and, if possible, to reduce costs, as they are reflected ultimately in the cost of goods transported.  For these reasons, I have been pressing the Dublin Port and Docks Board, who are the Pilotage Authority at Dublin, to introduce a comprehensive reorganisation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme which they have prepared follows a comprehensive review of the technical and safety aspects of the pilotage service, the mechanics of providing the service and the relevant statutory provisions.  The possible effects of the proposals on the remuneration and working conditions of the pilots concerned have also been borne in mind.  The present elaborate system is, I am advised, no longer warranted having regard to improvements in the <Col N="620" /> manoeuvring qualities of ships, radio and navigational aids, and the deepening of and other improvements to the harbour.  It is against this background that the Pilotage Authority has devised the proposed new arrangements.  The Dublin pilots have agreed in principle with the proposals.</P>
    <P>Pilotage at Dublin is compulsory in an area bounded, on the seaward side, by an imaginary line which runs from Bray Head through points on the Kish Bank to Ireland's Eye.  These limits are set out in the Dublin Pilotage Order, 1925, which was confirmed by the Pilotage Order Confirmation Act, 1926.  With certain exceptions, every ship navigating in the district for the purpose of entering, leaving, or making use of any port in the district, must be under the pilotage of a pilot licensed by the Pilotage Authority.  Among the exceptions are the cases where the master or mate of the vessel holds a certificate from the Pilotage Authority empowering him to pilot his vessel in the area, or, the ship is of a class which is exempted from compulsory pilotage by the Pilotage Authority in accordance with statutory powers.  In practice, and owing to the altered technical and physical conditions I have mentioned, the real need for pilotage has, in recent years, arisen in an area much smaller than that at present defined and the need for compulsory pilotage for smaller types of vessels has been reduced.</P>
    <P>The obligation of the Pilotage Authority to provide service up to the limit of the existing district has made it necessary for the authority to maintain a more expensive type of service than is now warranted.  It is intended to reduce the compulsory pilotage district to an area bounded by an imaginary line through points between the Baily Lighthouse and Sorrento Point, extending some distance to seaward. Under this arrangement pilotage will have to be provided only in the area where it is, in fact, required.  This reduction in the compulsory pilotage district can, however, be effected by means of a Pilotage Order made under the provisions of the 1913 Act, and it is not, therefore, necessary to deal with it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> Among the existing statutory exemptions from compulsory pilotage is one which applies to coasting vessels up to 200 gross tons, not carrying passengers. The reorganisation proposals include raising this tonnage exemption limit and extending it also to home trade ships.  Initially, the exemption would be conferred on certain unladen vessels but the Board propose to confer and extend exemptions gradually and over a fairly long period.  This method will obviate any question of redundancy among the pilots and is, of itself, prudent, as it will enable the authority to assess the practical effects of each exemption before considering any extension.</P>
    <P>The procedure for exempting vessels from compulsory pilotage is laid down in the Pilotage Act, 1913.  A pilotage authority may, under pilotage bye-laws, made under the Act and confirmed by the Minister for Transport and Power, exempt coasting and home trade vessels not carrying passengers from compulsory pilotage.  Where, however, a bye-law appears to exempt a class of vessels which was not in practice exempt at the passing of the 1913 Act, the bye-law cannot become effective unless confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  This procedure, which is a relic of a more leisurely parliamentary era, would in this case be unduly cumbersome as it would involve a fresh Confirming Act at each stage of the proposed gradual extension of exemption.  It is proposed, therefore, to repeal this requirement and to provide instead that when an exemption from compulsory pilotage is conferred by bye-law and the bye-law is confirmed by the Minister for Transport and Power, the relevant instrument shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution within 21 sitting days.  Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill provide accordingly.  It is an additional safeguard that, as in the case of pilotage orders, proposals to amend pilotage bye-laws must be publicised before being submitted for confirmation by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Port and Docks Board has carried out studies based on the <Col N="622" /> assumption that the exemptions from compulsory pilotage would eventually extend to incoming vessels of 500 tons gross and outgoing vessels and vessels shifting up to 750 tons gross.  These studies suggest that if the exemptions mentioned were conferred, there would be a reduction of about 45 per cent. in the number of vessels to be piloted. This would represent a very substantial relief both to the Pilotage Authority and to ship owners but would mean a loss of about 27 per cent.  in the revenue from pilotage charges.  In terms of cash, a loss of 27 per cent. of revenue would amount to about £11,000 per annum.  The Board would find it necessary to recover part of this loss in order to render the pilotage service as a whole economic and has decided that it would have to impose a special reduced charge on the vessels it now proposes to exempt from compulsory pilotage; the special reduced charge is not yet settled but a rate equivalent to one-third of the appropriate charge for pilotage is under consideration.  Such a charge is justified by the fact that a pilotage service will be available on call to these vessels, if required.  The charge will, in effect, amount to a contribution towards having this on-call service available.  Under existing legislation, the proposed special charge could not be made, and the necessary provision is, therefore, being made in Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The measures described are designed to reduce to an appropriate and realistic level the demand for pilotage service which must be met by the Pilotage Authority.  This will, through time, reduce the cost of the service and confer savings in both time and cash on users of the port.</P>
    <P>The Board also intends, under the powers to make bye-laws which it already enjoys, to introduce economies and improvements on the operational side of the service.  The principal change will be the substitution for the existing pilot vessels of a shore pilot station from which ships will be served by small fast launches.  The shore station will, also, improve the working conditions of the pilots.  They will have recreational facilities while they wait on call and will be relieved of the discomfort <Col N="623" /> and inconvenience involved in living aboard ship until their services are required&mdash;especially so in bad weather.  I feel that the board are to be congratulated on the thorough review they have carried out and the constructive proposals they have prepared.</P>
    <P>The opportunity has been taken to provide for a minor matter in Section 4.  Under the present provisions of the Act, details furnished to the Minister triennially, or if the Minister directs at shorter intervals, by each pilotage authority must be presented to the Oireachtas.  This information is not of any general interest either in form or substance and it is proposed to abolish this provision and to simplify and modernise the provisions governing the furnishing of pilotage returns.</P>
    <P>I would like to add that in so far as the reorganisation proposals are concerned this Bill is an enabling measure. It will not, of itself, introduce changes in arrangements for pilotage in Dublin. These changes will be brought into effect by pilotage Order and pilotage bye-laws made in accordance with a statutory procedure which is designed to safeguard the interests of all interested parties and to permit them to voice their views.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The changes proposed in this Bill seem necessary, in view of the changed conditions, and the proposals put forward by the Dublin Port and Docks Board appear to be based on a modern approach to the problem.  There are, however, one or two small points I should like to mention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, the Bill enables a pilotage authority to require the payment of pilotage dues by ships which were exempted from such payment in their districts on 1st January, 1961.  It is not clear from the 1913 Act or from the Bill why certain ships in some districts were exempt from the payment of dues, but, as I understand the proposal in this Bill, the intention now is to enable the pilotage authorities <Col N="624" /> to oblige any such ship in future to pay dues.</P>
    <P>The other matter is that which is dealt with in Section 4 and which the Minister has said was not of any general interest.  It is proposed in the subsection to delete the words &ldquo;and any returns so delivered shall, as soon as may be, be laid before both Houses of Parliament&rdquo;.  While these returns may not be of any general interest, there is an advantage in ensuring that statutory bodies present accounts at regular intervals.  It has been the practice in the past to get these accounts presented or laid on the Table.  Only on rare occasions are any questions raised on them, but, nevertheless, the fact that they are laid on the Tables ensures that there is control, if the Dáil wishes to exercise it at any particular time.  It is true, in connection with the amendment of Section 22 of the principal Act, that the returns will in future be made at such times as the Minister for Transport and Power will require.  This procedure has been brought into effect recently in respect of the Electricity Supply Board by an amendment of the 1927 Act.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if the returns in the case of the E.S.B. and other statutory bodies are laid before the House, as I understand the proposal in Section 4, the deletion of the words referred to will mean that the returns for the future will not be laid before the House.  It seems to me that statutory control should be retained in all these matters, whether they are of general or of limited interest.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main object of this Bill is to provide an extra £5,000,000 capital for Bord na Móna.  Under the Turf Development Acts, 1946 to 1959, Bord na Móna may borrow up to £19,000,000 for the performance of their functions, exclusive of the housing of their servants.  The Board may obtain capital up to this amount by way of advances from the Minister for Finance or by the creation of stock or other forms of security.  In the exercise of these powers the Board have to-date borrowed a total of £18,991,472, of which £750,000 was obtained from Messrs.  Arthur Guinness and £52,000 from the Board's own Superannuation Fund, the balance, which is inclusive of assets valued at £444,915 taken over by Bord na Móna from the former Turf Development Board, Limited, being provided by the State.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna have already repaid to the Central Fund the sum of £444,915 in respect of the assets taken over from the Turf Development Board, Limited.  Repayment of capital advances from the Exchequer for bog development is phased to correspond with the coming into production of associated groups of bogs.  Repayment with interest of the first block of capital amounting to £6,387,557 commenced on 1st October, 1956, and will be completed on 1st April, 1981.  Repayment with interest of a further sum of £3,250,000 commenced on 1st October, 1960, and will be completed on 1st April, 1985.  Repayment of remaining advances will commence when the bogs in which the capital is being invested come into production.</P>

    <P>The authorised borrowing of £19,000,000 was intended to cover the requirements of the Board up to 1960/61, and the need for further provision <Col N="626" /> in 1961/62 was foreseen when the limit of £19,000,000 was fixed by the Turf Development Act, 1959.</P>
    <P>The main output of Bord na Móna is determined by the requirements of peat for electricity generation.  It is the policy of the Government that all bogs which are economically usable for electricity generation shall be developed for this purpose.  Development of bog to the production stage requires a period of five years more or less. Already five peat-fired electricity stations have been commissioned, together with the four small hand-won turf stations.  These stations have an aggregate capacity of 205 megawatts. The future programme of the Electricity Supply Board provides for the commissioning of the following additional peat-fired plant&mdash;40 megawatts at Bellacorick in 1962/63; 12½ additional megawatts at Portarlington in 1962/63; 40 additional megawatts at Rhode in 1963/64; 30 additional megawatts at Ferbane in 1964/65; 40 megawatts at Shannonbridge in 1964/65; 40 additional megawatts at Lanesboro' in 1965/66, and 40 additional megawatts at Shannonbridge in 1968/69 or later.  On the completion of this programme, a total of 447.5 megawatts of generating plant will be peat-fired.</P>
    <P>At 31st March, 1961, peat-fired stations represented 205 megawatts of the total generating capacity of 723.5 megawatts, that is to say about 28%. These stations produced 32.5% of the total units supplied to the electricity system by E.S.B. stations.  In the same year 79.7% of electricity generated came from native resources and just over 40% of the native production came from peat-fired stations.</P>
    <P>The programme of peat-fired generating plant which I have outlined extends to 1968/69 and represents the maximum foreseeable bog development for electricity generation.  Thereafter peat-fired generating capacity will represent a gradually diminishing proportion of total capacity.</P>
    <P>To meet the requirements of the electricity generating plant construction programme up to 1968/69, Bord na Móna are developing or will develop additional areas of bog in the Boora, <Col N="627" /> Derrygreenagh, Bangor-Erris, Garryduff and Longford groups.  The Black-water bog, which had been reserved for the nitrogenous fertiliser project, is now available to provide the milled peat for the 40 megawatt station planned for Shannonbridge in 1964/65. The bog development programme provides, ultimately, for an annual production for electricity generation of 580,000 tons of sod peat and 2,500,000 tons of milled peat.</P>
    <P>In addition to their output for electricity generation Bord na Móna also produce some 320,000 tons of sod peat for general consumption.  Other aspects of their activities are the production of peat briquettes for domestic and industrial consumption and peat moss. Capacity for briquettes is 250,000 tons per annum requiring 750,000 tons of milled peat.  The annual production of peat moss is at present about 250,000 bales, mostly for export.  The number of persons employed by the Board, in all grades, amounts to about 7,000 at peak.</P>
    <P>The present statutory limit on the total amount which the Board may borrow for the performance of their functions is £19,000,000, excluding provision for housing.  It is estimated that the completion of the development programme will necessitate additional expenditure amounting to about £8,000,000 bringing the total up to about £27,000,000.  The present Bill proposes an increase in the statutory limit of £5,000,000, bringing it up to £24,000,000.  This increase should enable the Board to meet their requirements until about 1964/65 and at that time the House will have a further opportunity to consider the position.</P>
    <P>The opportunity of this Bill is being taken to effect an amendment in the law relating to the tenancy of the houses built by Bord na Móna under the powers conferred on them by Section 5 of the Turf Development Act, 1950.  That section permits the Board to let these houses only to their servants.  Houses become temporarily vacant when a tenant leaves the employment of the Board.  Suitable tenants from among the Board's <Col N="628" /> workers may not immediately apply for the tenancies, and houses may, therefore, be vacant for periods which may be short or long depending on how soon suitable tenants apply for them.  It is undesirable that houses should remain vacant for long periods and, accordingly, it is proposed by Section 3 (2) of this Bill to give the Board power to let vacant houses to persons who would not ordinarily qualify for tenancies.  To give the Board a wider field from which to obtain suitable occupiers it is proposed to relax the restriction confining tenancies to servants of the Board. The Board, of course, will only make such lettings in cases where they are satisfied that the houses would otherwise remain vacant for extended periods.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the Board may sell houses which may eventually be found to be permanently surplus to their requirements.  Any such houses would be sold by public tender.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to pay a tribute to Bord na Móna for their great progress in the field of development assigned to them.  The Board and their staff are to be congratulated on the substantial contribution which turf development is making to the national economy.  I confidently recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal for increased capital for Bord na Móna is obviously one which will meet with general approval in order to enable Bord na Móna to proceed with the further development of a number of bogs for the provision of peat for the generation of electricity.  In that connection I notice that the Minister in the course of his remarks said that the present programme of peat-fired generating plant, which he outlined, extended to 1968-69, which is roughly a period of seven or eight years.  As I understand it, the life of a fully developed bog is about 25 years.  I notice in the course of the Minister's speech that peat-fired generating capacity will represent a gradually diminishing proportion of the total capacity after that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be interesting to hear what <Col N="629" /> will replace turf as fuel for electricity generating plant when these supplies are exhausted.  In planning a large undertaking of this nature it is essential to look ahead over a period of years and the fact that a fully developed bog has a life of only 25 years may in one sense appear a considerable period of time, but in another it is a comparatively short one.  I would be interested to know if the Minister is in a position to give information as to what progress has been made on the possibility of generating electricity from atomic energy&mdash;I understood that some years ago the Electricity Supply Board had this matter under consideration&mdash;and whether the possibility of providing electricity from that source is contemplated after the life of the existing bogs and those which it is proposed to develop has been exhausted.</P>
    <P>The proportion of electricity generated by turf-fired stations is fairly considerable.  At the moment it amounts to about 28 per cent.  Of the 79 per cent.  of electricity generated from native resources, just over 40 per cent.  of the native production came from the peat-fired stations.  It is therefore obvious that a very considerable gap will have to be filled when the existing and proposed bog development supplies are exhausted.  I believe there would be general interest in getting a picture of what will be the expected developments when that situation is reached.</P>
    <P>The investment by Messrs. Guinness of £750,000 in the work of Bord na Móna, particularly in the establishment of the two briquetting factories, has on many occasions been referred to and is indeed a remarkable example of the interest which that firm takes in the general development of the national economy.  It is a practical gesture of faith in the capacity of this country to exploit its own resources as well as an indication that a company which has not merely very large interests here but interests on a world-wide scale is prepared to invest in the development of the resources of this country.  It is an example of the confidence which that firm, with its world-wide interests, has in the capacity and ability of Irishmen and Irish technicians, craftsmen and workers to develop the resources <Col N="630" /> of the country.  The faith and confidence which that firm has shown deserve the best thanks of all concerned as a practical example of encouragement and a practical incentive to further development.</P>
    <P>The increased supplies which are being provided from the briquette factories are, indeed, welcome by all who use turf as a domestic or industrial fuel.  I would be interested if any figures are available for the comparable calorific value of ordinary machine-won turf and briquettes.  So far as I understand it, machine-won turf is sold by fuel merchants and briquettes sold largely at the choice of the purchaser.  I have never seen any figures or statistics which would indicate what are the relative calorific values of, say, a ton of machine-won turf and a ton of briquettes.  Information of that sort would be of interest to domestic consumers, because in many cases people make selections merely on the basis of choice rather than on scientific information which would be of use to them in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>The decision to allow Bord na Móna to lease some of the houses built seems a sensible one.  Looking at some of these schemes from time to time, one is struck by the large number of vacant houses.  Indeed, even in districts in which Bord na Móna carries on very extensive activities, it is remarkable how many of the houses are vacant.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister if any information is available as to what proportion of the total number of houses is occupied and whether that sphere of activity will be discontinued in the future.  It seems that the original idea, while satisfactory in certain districts, has not been generally availed of.  Proposals for the further development of the activities of Bord na Móna will undoubtedly be welcome and have the general support of the House and the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few comments regarding the third section of the Bill, which gives the Board permission to sell houses. I was glad to hear that what inspired this section was the fact that many of <Col N="631" /> the houses are empty, but I was afraid, in the first instance, that after these houses were sold, the Board might find themselves short of houses and having to build more.  What strikes me is that with so many of these houses being empty, it might be that they are not properly sited from the point of view of selling or letting to private people not employed by the Board.  If they are not, and if all these houses are not occupied in a reasonable period of time, I can see difficulty arising with regard to their maintenance.</P>
      <P>In Dublin Corporation when we were envisaging the possibility of selling houses to Corporation tenants who are in on a rental basis at the moment, the view was expressed that unless the tenants, in a definite block, all agreed to go into a purchase scheme, there would not be much saving for the Corporation, because a number of houses would have to be maintained and serviced here and there.  That is a point which I hope the Board will consider, and perhaps they will consult with the local authorities with regard to maintenance which can be a very expensive item as I know from my experience on the City Council.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, is it possible that people seeking local authority housing, and having difficulty in obtaining it because of the present priorities, would apply for work with Bord na Móna with a view to getting a house, and having got it&mdash;either having rented it or made an agreement to buy&mdash;cease their employment with the Board?  I am slightly worried that Bord na Móna, whose function is not to build houses for letting or selling, might have difficulties in administration. It might be worth considering, where the houses are suitably sited, that an offer should be made to the local authorities to take over, by way of purchase or of renting, some of the houses, with a view to easing their own housing situation, that is, if there is a demand for the houses in the local authority area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to feel sure that the Board would not find themselves at a later date in the position of having sold most of their houses to people <Col N="632" /> who do not work for them, and as a result of some further development, having to build houses afresh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, I welcome the proposals in the Bill, the main one being the proposal to extend the borrowing powers of the Board from £19 million to £24 million.  When we remember that under the 1946 Act, £3¾ millions were advanced to the Board, and that we are now proposing to bring that figure up to £24 million, we can get some picture of the gigantic strides which Bord na Móna have deservedly made in the intervening years.  In times when it was not popular so to believe, I was an unrepentant believer in the development of our own peat resources.  While Bord na Móna had a rather hostile reception in many quarters at birth, it managed to survive and become regarded as the welcome child, and the proud child, of many who were rather critical of its arrival on the Irish economic scene at all.</P>
      <P>I maintained that faith in the development of our peat resources, and when we remember that at the peak season Bord na Móna provide employment for approximately 7,000 persons, we get some picture of the beneficial impact of their activities on the Irish economy.  It is well to underline here that these 7,000 persons are employed largely in an area where there is no other employment whatever, and no industrial employment because of the turbary character of the land.  There is practically no agricultural employment, either, so Bord na Móna have been able to provide very substantial employment in the rural areas in places which were just silent wastes before the Board started their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want again to put on record my appreciation of the excellent work which Bord na Móna have done down through the years.  I think their direction generally has been good, and their technicians first-class people.  It was possible to achieve the measure of progress now attained only because of the fact that they had an almost dedicated technical and engineering staff who tackled problems in circumstances <Col N="633" /> and in localities which were a challenge to even the stoutest hearts and the most steadfast of purpose. The staff of Bord na Móna&mdash;and I include the entire field staff&mdash;can now stand and look back over the ground they have travelled.  If they do, they can see the very substantial edifice which has been erected and each and every one of them is entitled to take pardonable pride in the splendid contribution which Bord na Móna have made to the national economy and feel satisfied that so much progress has been made.  It now seems reasonable to assume that they will continue this progress until such time as there has been the fullest and most expert exploitation of our turf resources, and land so utilised for fuel purposes will in time be available for agricultural and afforestation purposes.</P>
    <P>The Board are entitled to all the good-will and help that we can give them and if they continue their developmental policies on the lines we have seen up to now, the House will feel proud that these waste lands, useless to anyone and a source of depression, dreariness and drabness, will have been brought into healthy economic life and provide useful employment in those areas.</P>
    <P>The fact that I think so much of Bord na Móna will exempt me, I am sure, from any nagging charge when I say there is a blot on their employment programme.  When their harvesting operations start about February, if the season is a good dry season, those operations are completed about September, but if the season is a bad and wet season, in which the harvest cannot be garnered as speedily as in a dry season, employment lingers on to about October or November.  When a large number of people have been paid off, there is no employment for them between October or November and the following February or March with the result that large numbers of these people have got to go to the employment exchanges and live over that period of the year on what they get in the form of social welfare benefits. There are, of course, numbers of persons kept on and, in that respect, preference is given to those who are <Col N="634" /> tenants of the Board's houses, because I suppose the Board regard themselves as having more of an obligation to the tenants of their cottages than they have to persons who are not so circumstanced.</P>
    <P>However, even the tenants of cottages get a pretty lean wage, being paid only time rates during the winter period and there is quite an amount of hardship on these tenants because, while their normal outgoings remain heavy, their income is substantially accentuated because the whole method of payment in the wintertime is altered from the level in operation during the summer period.</P>
    <P>A particular hardship is visited on the person who gets employment with Bord na Móna from about February or March till October or November. There is virtually no other employment available in the area for that person. There is no agricultural work to be done during that period.  There is very little agricultural land of an arable character near the bogs.  There is no industrial employment and that time of the year is the period during which county councils are already cutting back on their road work because their road funds are being exhausted and they find it hard enough to provide employment for their regular road staff much less take on other persons.</P>
    <P>One of the most valuable features of the Local Authorities (Works) Act was that it could be available all during the winter period, that is, from October to February or March, in carrying out drainage schemes, valuable drainage schemes which helped to drain flooded lands and to improve the productivity of these lands.  The improvements made under that Act were a substantial investment in bringing into production and into a greater standard of production lands which would otherwise be useless.  It is a great pity that this Government were so prejudiced against the Local Authorities (Works) Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It does to this extent. Here we are providing moneys for Bord na Móna, an advance up to £24 million.  If we give the Board more money we ought to expect the Board, with the additional money it gets, to organise itself in such a way that it will give the staff 52 weeks wages, as every Deputy in this House gets, instead of paying them for only eight or nine months of the year and sending them to the employment exchange for the other three or four months.  Surely that is a legitimate point to make if there is still free discussion in this House.</P>
      <P>What I am arguing is that Bord na Móna employment for a large number of people means eight or nine months' employment in the year and three or four months' idleness in the year.  If anybody has any doubt about that and does not yet know it, then I am quite sure he will be supplied with all the information he wants by the top level officials of Bord na Móna who will tell you if you talk to them that they regret this aspect of Bord na Móna employment and would like to be able to find a remedy for it.  We ought to try to find a remedy for it because eight months' work and four months' idleness is not satisfactory and cannot be satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to urge the Minister, if he is interested in the matter at all, to discuss with Bord na Móna the possibility of providing some class of work over the winter period which <Col N="636" /> will provide an alternative to the employment which Bord na Móna can provide during the summer period and which it cannot now provide during the winter period.  I would suggest&mdash; I know this matter has been discussed at Government level by a few Governments&mdash;that Bord na Móna should endeavour to plant the fringe areas in the winter time so as to keep in employment those who would otherwise be dismissed.  For some administrative reason, perhaps because of the absence of land suitable for the purpose, it has not been possible to do that up to the present but there are other examples of the alternative work which could be provided.</P>
    <P>The same kind of problem existed in Germany, the harvesting of turf for the summer and no work available in the winter.  In that case they put up many acres of glasshouses where they grew all kinds of bulbs and flowers during the winter period and certain classes of vegetables which fetched a high price. They trapped the steam from the generating stations and were able to run a very successful economic unit in the production of flowers and vegetables as an adjunct to the main problem of winning turf to keep the electricity stations going.  Some consideration ought to be given to that. We cannot pretend that Bord na Móna employment is satisfactory so long as it is associated by those not living in the Board's houses with four months' unemployment in the year and difficulties in finding any alternative employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the sale of houses by the Board or the possibility that the Board will let these houses. Unfortunately the Board got itself in a strait-jacket because of the provision that it could only let these houses to their own servants, with the result that many of these houses were vacant, and vacant for long periods too.  The Board was unable to find tenants for them and was unable to allow in as tenants persons who were not in the Board's employment.  Now after many years' experience of that uneconomic running of houses, the Board apparently wants to be allowed to sell or let the houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> One unsatisfactory feature about these Bord na Móna houses which ought to be recognised at the outset is that the Bord na Móna house has all the difficulties of the old tied cottage.  Where the farmer let his man into a cottage, when he lost his job as a farmer not only did he go out of the job but he went out of the house. Although this is 1961 and everybody is pleased with the departure of the tied cottage from our social life, Bord na Móna houses are still tied houses. If you lose your job with Bord na Móna for any reason at all&mdash;it may even be your own physical inability to work&mdash;the Board will take steps to recover the house from you so that you not only lose your job but your house as well.  Bord na Móna have taken people to court from time to time to recover possession of these houses which is not a very pleasant exercise either for the Board or for the tenant.  I think it is a feature of these lettings which ought to have been considered earlier and certainly ought to be considered now with a view to obviating that kind of difficulty arising in future.  Suppose for any reason a person loses his job with Bord na Móna, perhaps in circumstances not within his own control.  Surely it would be desirable that he would have the opportunity of remaining on in the house and paying the Board a rent if he can no longer continue physically to work for the Board or if he happens to get some other more congenial kind of employment and wants to remain in the house for which there is no other demand?  It is not unreasonable in these cases that the person should be allowed and that the Board should have authority to let such houses.</P>
    <P>I think the Board may find it extremely difficult to sell these houses, situated where they are.  The houses in the main have been put into the centre of the bogs where Bord na Móna were carrying on their turf development work.  They suffer from all the social disadvantages of being very isolated.  I should not think, taking the long view, that many persons would be keen on buying these houses unless they are prepared to face up to travelling long distances from their <Col N="638" /> place of employment to their place of residence.</P>
    <P>It would be worth while for the Board to consider whether it would not dispose of these houses which it does not require by offering them for sale to the local authority and letting the local authority, which is the natural housing authority, see in what way they could usefully let these houses having regard to the demand for houses by applicants living in these areas.  It seems to me that that would be a better idea than for the Board to advertise them for public auction and then to endeavour to sell them in that way.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that there will be a tremendous crowd seeking to purchase these Bord na Móna houses.  It is better that they would consider selling a batch or block of them to the local authority or, in all events, letting the local authority administer the letting or sale of them.  In that way you can have some order in the scheme where the local authority exercise not merely the powers of a housing authority but the powers of a local authority, a sanitary authority and a health authority as well.</P>
    <P>One must remember in connection with the Bord na Móna housing schemes&mdash;this fact is I think acknowledged by the directors and certainly by the management and executives of Bord na Móna&mdash;that the building of these houses did in fact cause a social problem in these areas.  One can see that the breadwinner will get employment. He has a wife and a number of young boys and girls growing to adolescence.  For the boys, you can probably get work footing turf during the harvesting operations when turf is ready to be footed.  You may do so for the girls but that is an extremely short period of employment and there is no other employment for girls in these particular areas.</P>
    <P>I discussed with the Chairman of Bord na Móna the possibility that the board would take on some ancillary activity such as the establishment of some sort of knitting factory in these places so that the girls in these Bord na Móna houses might get employment in a local factory regularly <Col N="639" /> which would be run on commercial lines.  At present, both the Bord na Móna officials and the tenants of these houses will tell you that there is no work around these areas for the female members of a family.  That fact apparently was not sufficiently weighted when the board decided to erect the houses in these places.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister in a position to give us any idea of the lifetime of the bogs which are being used to feed the turf-fired electricity generating stations? We may take it that the bogs we intend to develop this year, next year and down to 1968-69 will be capable of carrying on in the new situation. Ultimately, of course, we know that the bogs will be so exploited that their lifetime as suppliers of fuel will come to an end.  Can the Minister at this stage give us any idea as to what future is then envisaged for the generating stations which have been erected and which one day will reach the stage at which, while you have the station there, you have no fuel of the kind for which it was built available in the area.  Is it contemplated, for example, converting these to use some other type of fuel?</P>
    <P>I do not think the possibility of using nuclear energy in these small electricity generating stations will arise for a very long time, judging by what the experts say on that matter. At present, I think the experts would say that the whole country is too small and its electricity demands too small for the establishment even of a single nuclear electricity generating station. Perhaps the Minister, who has more up-to-date information on the point, might be able to tell us what the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna visualise as the ultimate use for these stations when the bogs, having been cut away, are no longer capable of supplying fuel for the present turf-fired stations?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputies for their friendly reception of this Bill.  Deputy Cosgrave asked some questions about the future of the electric power programme when the peat bogs have been fully exploited. It is envisaged that the bogs will be fully utilised within 25 or 30 years.  I understand that the power stations <Col N="640" /> will, by that time, be regarded as virtually worn out, subject to some new technique being developed that might alter that position.</P>
      <P>In so far as the fuel to be used in future, after 1968, is concerned, it is very hard to be certain what it will be because techniques are constantly changing.  I imagine oil will play a very large part&mdash;oil processed at the Whitegate refinery.  Experiments with both winds and tides proved disappointing and unremunerative.  I think the House knows that surveys are being undertaken in the Arigna colliery area to find out if any reserve of coal can be used by present or improved processes to extend the Arigna power station.  That could never contribute a very great part to the programme but it would naturally be considered.</P>
      <P>In so far as the bogs themselves are concerned, it is intended that they should be developed for agriculture or forestry and some work of an experimental kind has already been done.  I am told that Lyrecrompane bog is most likely to be utilised for forestry in the first instance and it will be sold to the Department of Lands for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I am afraid the day has not yet been reached when a sufficient amount of land is being made available so that turf workers can be assured of a full week's wage working on forestry in the months in which they are not employed by Bord na Móna, when laid off.  No doubt as time goes on, when forestry really begins, there will be very definite co-ordination in regard to employment of the turf workers themselves and other persons employed in the district to ensure maximum permanent employment in the area.  We must wait a good number of years before we can see that operating in a satisfactory and effective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The E.S.B. are keeping under review the whole question of atomic power.  As Deputies have already said, atomic power is far too expensive at the moment for us to consider it, even if we had one station for the whole of the 32 Counties.  I have been <Col N="641" /> told recently that with improved techniques, it might be possible to consider an atomic power station in the next ten or 15 years but all that depends on cost.  In the meantime, as the House knows, the total reserves of oil in the world are constantly increasing and power derived from oil at the moment is very much more inexpensive than power derived from atomic sources.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked for the comparative thermal capacity of briquettes and sod peat.  Briquettes have a thermal capacity of 8,000 British Thermal Units per 1b. and sod peat, 6,000.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy Norton that I meet the Board and the Chairman of Bord na Móna at regular intervals and I am always asking them to see what they can do to expand employment with the Board.  The Research Department has been working effectively and some of these developments such as the use of powdered peat, have been very successful, but the company using this process is operating in Drogheda.  All I can say is that Bord na Móna and all State companies are pressed to see how they can extend their own manufacturing activities and help others to do so also.  I do not think it would be possible for some time to consider full-time employment for Bord na Móna workers. The Board do everything they can to ensure that there is a maximum period of work but, as Deputies know, turf must compete with coal and other fuels to the maximum degree, particularly in relation to the sale of briquettes.  The accounts of Bord na Móna show that while they are able to repay advances to the Minister for Finance each year on a very satisfactory basis, there is absolutely no surplus available.  It is a very tightly-run concern in which there must be maximum efficiency and output.  It is equally true to say that, not all the workers but a good number of them, are able to earn very satisfactory wages on the basis of bonus incentive payments during the season.  I think the corps of Bord na Móna workers staying with the company will gradually grow, particularly now that we are to have a pension scheme which I <Col N="642" /> think will decrease the annual wastage of turf workers that has occurred up to now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked for the number of houses vacant.  Bord na Móna have built 574 houses and 104 are vacant, of which 69 are vacant at Clontuscairt in Roscommon and Rochefort Bridge.  The vacancies are concentrated largely in two areas.  The turnover of labour has been fairly high in Bord na Móna and that perhaps reduced the number of houses they anticipated being occupied.  The change-over from sod turf to milled peat also had an effect on the number of houses likely to be occupied in various areas.  I think it can be taken for granted that the Board will take account of the problems that arise in relation to the sale or letting of these houses other than to persons employed by them and I am sure all the statements made by Deputy Lemass will be considered in that connection.</P>
    <P>It is possible for local authorities to buy the houses from Bord na Móna which they regard as permanently surplus to their needs.  The Board do not intend to sell their houses to tenants so that the idea that persons who do not really intend to remain employees of the Board could take tenancy of a house and eventually buy it cannot arise.  Naturally, employees leaving the service of the Board may be required to vacate the houses.  Deputy Norton spoke of the difficulty in some areas where workers lose employment altogether and are made to vacate the houses.  Under certain circumstances, when this Bill has been passed, they may be able to keep on the tenancy, provided the house is regarded as permanently surplus to the needs of the Board.  There should be some advantage in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke of the difficulty of tied houses.  Houses belonging to the Board are necessarily tied because they are the only houses in these areas for the Board's employees.  I have no information as to whether Bord na Móna will have difficulty in disposing of their houses; there still is a demand for houses in various districts.  Perhaps they will be able to sell them to local authorities or private individuals.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered all the <Col N="643" /> points raised in regard to the Bill and again I should like to thank Deputies for the way they have received it.  I agree with everything that has been said about the imagination shown and technical ability of the officers of Bord na Móna in designing new apparatus and adapting existing techniques to the requirements of this country and in going ahead with the job in the splendid way they have done it.</P>

      <P>May I ask a question ? The Minister said in his reply that because of the introduction of a pension scheme, the number of permanent employees of the Board would probably increase.  Is he aware that, in fact, Bord na Móna officials have been telling the trade unions the direct opposite&mdash;that over the years they expect the number employed by Bord na Móna gradually to diminish?</P>

      <P>I want to ask one question about a point on which the Minister touched in connection with briquettes.  When we were in Government, we established a briquette factory with a considerable capacity and I remember postponing the decision as to whether the second briquette factory should go ahead until we assessed the demand for the output of the first big briquette factory. Now that we have two briquette factories working, how is the demand for briquettes corresponding with the productive capacity of the two big new factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware it is almost impossible to fill the demand for briquettes.  In commencing the second factory manufacturing 100,000 tons a year the Board are fully confident at the moment that they will be able to dispose of the full output. The export market, particularly in Northern Ireland, shows lively promise. During last winter, which was not a severe winter, the demand for briquettes far exceeded the supply.  A market research inquiry was conducted in some of the counties not in the turf area.  It was found, both in the rural and urban areas, that 41 per cent. of the families interviewed were using briquettes at one time or another <Col N="644" /> during the year for one purpose or another.  The Board are fully confident that sales will remain satisfactory, provided the price is kept competitive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge that will come in course of payment, during the year ending 31st March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, and Miscellaneous Grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to enable grants to be made by my Department towards the cost of works of public amenity which will help to improve the recreational <Col N="645" /> and visual amenities of towns, villages and countryside.</P>
    <P>The House will note that it is proposed to amend Subhead K of the Vote for Local Government for the current year, which provides for grants for the acquisition, clearance and improvement of derelict sites.  The amendment will enable grants to be paid from this subhead for works of public amenity as well as for the clearance of derelict sites.</P>
    <P>The reason for the proposed amendment is that it was ascertained in the course of administering derelict site grants under Subhead K that certain desirable works proposed would not qualify for assistance, or would qualify only for very limited assistance, because the site was not derelict or was only partially derelict.  Although the broadest possible definition applies to the derelict sites scheme, it does not include many sites which it is desirable to have developed or improved as public amenities.  Furthermore, the restriction of grants to work on derelict sites tends to narrow unduly the scope of any improvements which are carried out with the aid of such grants.</P>
    <P>This situation underlined the fact that there is a gap in the existing arrangements for affording financial assistance to local authorities and other bodies concerned with the provision of public amenities.  Allocations from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote are related to unemployment returns.  The funds available are adequate to enable a regular programme of amenity works to be undertaken in the larger urban centres.  In other areas, even where an allocation was available, the amount of amenity development which could be carried out was small.  In consequence, Bord Fáilte Éireann found it necessary, in order to provide amenities and facilities for tourists, to promote such works throughout the country and to offer financial assistance towards defraying the cost.  I understand that the Board's activities in this field are limited because of more urgent demands on their funds but in any event their criterion is, naturally, the tourist value of the schemes.  In most areas, if the needs of our own people <Col N="646" /> are to be catered for, some further provision must be made.  There is a growing awareness throughout the country of need for public amenities and of their value to the community.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment of Subhead K will have the advantage that any payments arising in the current year can be met from savings on the subhead.  The total of the grants allocated to date in the current year for derelict site works is approximately £16,000 but it appears that requisitions for payment of grants are likely to be slower than anticipated.  A number of proposals have already been received from local authorities for consideration in connection with the new grants scheme and I am informed that many more are in course of preparation locally.  As there is a reasonable prospect that savings on the subhead will suffice to cover any payments in the current year on foot of amenity grants, the present Supplementary Estimate is limited to a token sum of £10.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the Supplementary Estimate the grants will be payable to local authorities, local development associations and other bodies.  The rate of grant will be 50% of the approved cost of the work.  No grant will be payable where the approved cost of the work is less than £100. Eligible works will include the provision and development of parks, open spaces, playing fields, riverside walks, beach development works, means of access, boating slipways, opening up of views and prospects, landscaping of historic buildings, ornamental tree planting, seating and shelters, car parks in scenic areas, public caravan parks, provision of local museums and protection of places and objects of interest.  I might also mention that public amenity works proposed by winners of Tidy Towns Competition Awards will be considered for amenity grants.</P>
    <P>Local development associations and other such bodies will forward their proposals to the local authorities through whom applications for grants must be made.  If the proposals are acceptable, the local authority will submit the application to my Department. <Col N="647" /> It will be a condition of the grant that the amenity being provided will be available for the use or benefit of the public generally.  Maintenance of the completed works will be the responsibility of the applicant body or of the local authority and formal undertakings may be required from local development associations or other bodies in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the programme for clearance and improvement of derelict sites should be given priority but that where there are no such sites qualifying for grants or where they do not admit of satisfactory development by themselves, other positive schemes for improving amenities should be encouraged. I have asked local authorities to give advice and technical assistance, where necessary, to other bodies putting forward proposals and I hope that all concerned will adopt an imaginative and constructive approach to the question of local amenities.  With this object in view, the grants scheme has been drawn as widely as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle behind the clearance of derelict sites is one with which we are all in agreement and the Minister now proposes giving grants of approximately 50 per cent. of the cost to local authorities, development associations and others interested in the provision of such amenities but prior to the provision of the amenities the first thing we have to do is get rid of derelict sites.  My main criticism of what the Minister has stated is that the amount of State grant is insufficient to encourage local authorities to proceed with the clearance of derelict sites.  I find in my travels throughout the country that the main offenders in the non-clearance of derelict sites are the local authorities themselves.  We find in practically every county throughout the State old workhouses, old buildings, old walls, even old jails and old courthouses which are a disgrace to the local authorities to which they belong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that all local authorities would be most anxious to clear the sites and thereby give employment, were it not for the <Col N="648" /> fact that at the moment it would be non-productive work and the mounting rate prohibits the local authority from this expenditure.  In my own county, the rate at the moment is well over 52/- in the £.  We are informed by the county manager that if we accede to the request for the increase in salary and wages of the various officials of the council, we will require to budget for an extra 4/9d. in the coming year, bringing our rate up to £2 16s. or £2 17s.  How are we to ask the local authority, when the rate is £2 16s. or £2 17s. in the £, to expend 50 per cent. on the cost of clearance of derelict sites?  I do not think we can do it.  I would appeal to the Minister to increase the State grant if he desires the Derelict Sites Act to be implemented.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister is aware of the many obstacles placed in the way of individuals who are anxious to clear their own derelict sites, that is, apart from the local authorities? If one has an old building on one's holding and is anxious to have it demolished, the site cleared possibly to take away the scar on the countryside, is the Minister aware of the obstacles placed in the way of doing so?  In the first place, the person has to prepare a plan of the site.  He has to employ, if necessary, an engineer or an architect to show the manner in which he proposes to demolish the site.  He then has to employ a costings surveyor to tell what it would cost to demolish the site.  He has to provide plans for the site when it is cleared and he has to say what is going to be done with it.  After all this has been done, he will be paid 50 per cent. of the cost of the clearance of the derelict site.</P>
    <P>There is no encouragement in the Act, the Estimate or in the Minister's speech in regard to people who are anxious to clear derelict sites on their own holdings.  I think it should be sufficient that if the assistant county surveyor gives an estimate of the cost of clearing the site and if the Minister cannot see his way to increase the grant, the estimate by the local authority surveyor should be accepted and 50 per cent. of that sum paid to any person enterprising enough to clear his site.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> Down through the years, local authorities have had certain powers with regard to the acquisition and clearance of derelict sites.  One of the reasons they fought shy of implementing these powers was that they were afraid they would be held up to ridicule by reason of the fact that they refused or neglected to clear the derelict sites of which they were actually the owners.  If we are anxious to see this Derelict Sites Act a success, we should compel local authorities to set a headline by clearing the derelict sites of which they are in possession and by doing so, compel private individuals to clear derelict sites on their holdings.  The Minister cannot expect any local authority to undertake large projects, unless a higher State grant than 50 per cent. is made available to them.</P>
    <P>We are all in agreement with what the Minister states is desirable in regard to procuring the amenities to which he refers, namely, parks, open spaces, playing fields, riverside walks, bridge development work, means of access, boating slipways, opening up of views and prospects and other amenities of that kind.  These are desirable in a Utopia but local authorities have many more urgent things to do with their very limited purse at the moment.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Bord Fáilte on what they have been doing under their Tidy Town competitions. I should also like to compliment the winners of these competitions who have ploughed back the prize money into the development of amenities in their towns, but I am only afraid that the Derelict Sites Act will be more honoured in the breach unless more generous State grants are made available. I believe that if more generous State grants were made available, up to 75 per cent. or 80 per cent. of the cost, a considerable amount of employment in rural Ireland would be given to unemployed labourers, particularly farm labourers, in the off season.</P>
    <P>Now with machinery, great numbers of road workers find themselves thrown out of employment.  There is nothing left for them but the emigrant ship or migration.  I believe that if more <Col N="650" /> generous State grants were given to local authorities, these people could be employed throughout rural Ireland, in the towns and villages, particularly the seaside towns and villages, in tourist centres.  If these more generous State grants are not made available, I am afraid the Bill will be more honoured in the breach.  The Minister made suggestions in his opening speech and while we would all desire to see them implemented, lack of funds will prevent it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only afraid that schemes such as the derelict sites schemes start off with a certain specific purpose in mind, that is, to clear derelict sites and unsightly ruins such as broken-down stores, old jails broken-down workhouses and so forth. Then the work for which the scheme is originally designed does not seem to be proceeding.  Instead of inquiring why the work is not proceeding or why our primary object is not being achieved, we have a tendency to start spreading out the purpose of the scheme into a whole lot of related but not necessarily relevant alternatives.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the derelict sites scheme was to clear derelict sites.  I gather from the Minister's statement that the response has not come up to expectations.  I assume that the Minister has asked himself why. Everybody wants to get rid of derelict sites.  Why is a scheme designed to eliminate derelict sites not availed of?  The answer is substantially what Deputy O'Donnell has suggested&mdash;that the cost of doing the job now is so burdensome that a local authority, trying to marshal its resources, finds that it has very many more urgent calls on its available funds than derelict sites.  It seems to me it would be wiser, instead of widening the scope of the scheme, to ask ourselves if we could not use whatever sum of money is available for this purpose more effectively to achieve our end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we can contemplate providing unlimited sums indefinitely even for so admirable an objective as the clearance of sites but I would suggest to the Minister that if the scheme is not drawing a sufficient <Col N="651" /> number of proposals to his Department, he might consider reviewing the scheme, say, on a three year basis, and determining that over a period of three years some total sum would be made available and providing that in the first year 75 per cent. of the total cost would be made available and notifying local authorities that any schemes received, say, before 31st March, 1963 would, on approval, attract a grant of 75 per cent. provided they were undertaken within three months of approval issuing; that any schemes received between 1st April, 1963 and 31st March, 1964 would attract a grant of 50 per cent. on the same basis; and that any schemes put forward after 1st April, 1964 and before 31st March, 1965 would attract only 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I think that would encourage local authorities who were desirous of providing employment for the categories of persons to whom Deputy O'Donnell has referred to make a serious survey of what works could be undertaken within their resources and to expedite their formulation in order to qualify for the exceptionally liberal grant of 75 per cent.  At the same time, it would be reasonable to assume that the remainder of schemes, if they were urgently desirable, would be proceeded with on the basis of the 50 per cent. grant and there would still remain a residue which might not be so obviously desirable but which for ulterior reasons, such as local employment, might still be proceeded with at a later date on the basis of a 25 per cent. contribution, bearing in mind the volume of local employment they would still provide.</P>
    <P>Such a scheme would, in my opinion, expedite the primary purpose of the derelict sites scheme as originally adumbrated in this House and would probably cost no more than the wide diversification now proposed by the Minister, bearing in mind the overall limitation, that no matter how far we diversify the purposes for which this scheme can be availed of, the local authority remains liable for 50 per cent. of the cost and, in their present circumstances of excessively high rates, are very likely to be deterred <Col N="652" /> from joining this scheme for any purpose because they feel their own rate cannot equitably be asked to bear 50 per cent. of the total cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not agree with Deputy Dillon's idea about this change in the scheme at all because I know that while there are many derelict sites that could do with improvement, quite a lot of very good work has been carried out under the scheme up to now.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but I think the reason for introducing the change is that there were quite a number of excellent schemes proposed by local authorities, private individuals and local development associations, which turned out to be borderline cases and could not qualify under the existing scheme.  I am aware of quite a number of such schemes in my own area. The result was that the Department sanctioned a number of schemes and the work was carried out, whereas a short distance away or in the same area, there were schemes which to us appeared similar but which, for some reason, the Department found to be different, with the result that the Department refused to sanction work on them and, unless a change was made in the administration of the scheme, they could never be done.</P>

They would not do anything when they were getting 50 per cent. of the cost because they would feel, as a result of Deputy Dillon's speech, that if they held up the scheme for another few years, they would get 100 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not work that way.  I am afraid the opposite would be the case.  I would agree with the Minister that the present proposals will improve the position.  I should like to refer particularly to a number of very dangerous car parks&mdash;call them that if you like&mdash;outside churches throughout the country.  Under the existing scheme, a number of them have not qualified.  Under the new scheme, I imagine they will qualify and the result will be that the roads will be made safer and everybody will be satisfied.</P>
      <P>It is true, of course, that some local authorities do not consider that they should spend any rate money on this type of scheme.  The county council of which I have the honour to be a member believe it is money very well spent and they have submitted a number of schemes, some of which have been passed and some of which I hope will be passed in the very near future.  If the local authorities were to proceed with such schemes, the result would be far better than to wait and see if there would be bigger grants available in a year's time, in the hope that, eventually, no cost to them would be involved.  I, personally, welcome the scheme.  The improvement will make a very big difference in having the countryside cleared up.  That was the original intention when the scheme was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>With Deputy O'Donnell, I should like to plead for an increase in the grants made available from State sources for this work.  County councils, faced with rising rates, are very reluctant to take on extra work, such as the clearance of derelict sites. In some of the smaller villages and towns throughout the country, there are old houses which have become derelict.  The ground remains the property of the owners.  When a council is faced at the annual estimates meeting with the task of finding half <Col N="654" /> the cost of clearing such sites, if there are a large number of such schemes seeking qualification, the council look with a jaundiced eye upon this item and I think it would be only natural that they would say to themselves that there were more pressing things to be dealt with at present and that we could perhaps induce the councils to do more in this line if the State grant were higher than the 50 per cent. which the Minister is now offering.  It is from that point of view that many small towns and villages suffer, because these derelict sites are not being removed and because there is not sufficient interest shown by the owners in removing these eyesores from the countryside.  The local councils dealing with the problem do not like making more money available.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the other projects which the Minister mentioned, I believe these would be of great advantage, particularly from the tourist point of view and that, in the long run, they would repay the State and the local people concerned.  From the point of view of local employment, and considering that more men could be taken off the Social Welfare payments to which they would be entitled at this time of year, the State would not lose the 50 per cent.  I would ask the Minister to look at the matter again to see if he could increase the amount of grant in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Dr. Hogan Dr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has been rather precipitate in jumping to conclusions that not enough work is being done in regard to derelict sites.  The scheme has not been sufficiently long in operation to enable him to come to that conclusion.  If he had a little patience he would not find it necessary to embark on an extension of that scheme into the amenity field.  I am always a bit nervous about this question of amenities.  It is so widespread and so ill-defined that you can include almost everything under it except dancehalls.  I feel that the situation might easily arise that in one area you could have an amenity scheme going ahead, while in the neighbourhood, you would still have derelict sites which were left untouched for years, and at the same <Col N="655" /> time and in the same area you could have land flooded because of the non-operation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I feel that these things should be taken in succession and that we should attend to essential matters first and deal with the amenities at a later stage.  The derelict sites aspect of these proposals&mdash;with which I agree and which are desirable&mdash;should be proceeded with first and pushed through more vigorously and, having done that, we should come back and talk about amenities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a general misunderstanding of my mind in this matter.  I am not of the opinion that the Derelict Sites Act has not been working well or that it is not going to work.  The fact that I have come here with power to provide grants for these amenity schemes is not because the scheme is not working. As I said at the outset, during the short term in which the derelict sites grant scheme has operated, it has emerged that there is a gap and that there is an anomaly in that a site that is now derelict can qualify for a derelict site grant.</P>

    <P>Having so qualified, and having had that grant paid, either through a development committee, a private individual or the local authority, a further grant to make an amenity out of what heretofore was derelict can only be paid in the case where it was a derelict site and where already a grant had been obtained.  What is wrong with encouraging people who have put forward proposals for various sites in towns and villages, which sites have on examination proved not to be derelict but are such as to command the attention of any fair-thinking person as being the type of scheme one would like to see encouraged? If those public spirited organisations, committees and groups are prepared to do a little voluntary work&mdash;there is a growing number of them in the various towns and they are not confined to seaside towns but are in all sorts of towns throughout the country&mdash;to try to improve the appearance of their town, not solely for the benefit of the tourist but for <Col N="656" /> their own benefit, surely we would be lacking if we were not prepared, as we are, to give them some encouragement by way of these 50 per cent. amenity grants which are not conditioned by the previous arrangement in regard to a site being declared derelict.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, I should like to say that the intake up to date is in the region of 500 approved applications. Of that number, 400 have come from private groups and private individuals and 100 approved applications have come from the local authorities. We have on our hands at the moment 200 borderline cases which, as Deputy Tully said, have been turned down under existing arrangements.  There will be a greater volume, I have no doubt, if we pass this Supplementary Estimate to provide for amenity grants solely and without the tag of derelict site having to be attached to it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the charge that all sorts of obstacles have been placed in the way of the private applicant who wishes to do a job on a derelict site is correct, that he needs an engineer and a costs surveyor and probably an architect to show to the last detail what requires to be done.  It amounts to this, that the minimum type of that procedure is required but it is absolutely essential that the particular site should be identifiable by whoever goes out to see it and that some type of local map should be produced with the application so that it can be identified for estimate purposes.  I should like to say that if Deputies know that obstacles such as those outlined here have been placed in the way of applicants in some parts of the country, I should be glad to know and we shall try to get in touch with the local authorities and smooth the way, if the way needs to be smoothed.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that all this effort to clear derelict sites is likely to fold up because of the fact that local authorities cannot and should not be prepared to provide any money from the rates for this type of work.  At the time of the introduction of the Derelict Sites Act, not to mention the Derelict Grants Scheme, there was not the same outcry here saying it could not be afforded.  In fact, it was generally conceded <Col N="657" /> that the Derelict Sites Act recently enacted was much needed, that the old Act of 1940 was not effective in law and that, furthermore, no grants whatever had been payable until last year.  Therefore, we have an improved Derelict Sites Act which, I think, is said to be effective, as against the ineffective Act of 1940, and we have a 50 per cent. grant now being paid from central funds to make effective in a practical way the clearance of derelict sites throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The amenity grants scheme is, as I said, filling a gap and is not so much a follow-on or, as would seem to be suggested, in substitution for a scheme that has not worked.  I am satisfied the scheme we have has been and is working and will continue to work and that this new additional scheme will go a step further in changing the appearance of our countryside and small towns.</P>
    <P>The question specifically asked by Deputy Clinton was whether dangerous quarries and ponds could come within the scheme.  The answer is a qualified &ldquo;yes&rdquo;&mdash;qualified in the sense that if some useful purpose or amenity can be served in regard to the quarry or pond, then an amenity grant can and will be allocated.  Indeed, such dangerous quarries and eyesores of that type were at the back of our minds in bringing forward this scheme. We are hoping for a little bit of imagination from our local authorities in dealing with these matters.  Such places are not only eyesores but can be a source of great danger to the young.</P>
    <P>Turning now to this question of the county councils being the worst offenders themselves, I should like to ask Deputies who are members of local authorities to use their good offices on these councils to clear up their own derelict sites.  It is all very well to say a local authority cannot be expected to provide any money for clearing up these derelict sites when the rates are so high.  Do not forget, however, the local authorities who have such sites in their own ownership.  Surely, if the private individual can be compelled by law to clear up sites which are eyesores, it is strange to suggest that <Col N="658" /> county councils should not be expected to do this work unless they get more money by way of grant for doing it.</P>
    <P>However, I would be very loath to compel county councils to do their own sites first.  But it is something that occurs to anybody who considers that councils may be offenders themselves. On the other hand, the members of local bodies are responsible people and it would certainly take a very great deal of evidence to compel me to come to this House with a proposal compelling local authorities to do this work.  I believe they will do it.  In fact, there is evidence that they are doing some of it at the moment.  All I ask is that Deputies who are members of local authorities would add their voices at their various meetings to try to get these councils to do a little more if they are lagging behind.</P>
    <P>On the whole, rather than compulsion, the emphasis has been on voluntary effort, both in regard to the clearing of derelict sites and the encouragement of the provision of amenities solely related, as the bigger schemes under Bord Fáilte must be, to tourists.  Our own people must be considered and the development committees are doing good work in this direction.  The small encouragement which this scheme will undoubtedly give to them is something I feel I can commend to this House and one which I feel the House will welcome and help to foster in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>This section increases from 90 to 110 the maximum permitted strength of the inspector rank of the Garda Síochána. Subsection (2) of Section 5 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, prescribes that the Garda Síochána shall consist of such officers and men as the Government shall from time to time determine not exceeding the total number of officers and men respectively specified in the Third Schedule to the Act.  In that schedule, as amended by the Garda Síochána Act, 1945, the specified number of inspectors is 90 and this number is being increased to 110 by Section 1 of this Bill.  It is necessary to create 13 new inspector posts in order to implement in full the scheme for the reorganisation of the Dublin Metropolitan Division of the Force.  An additional seven posts are provided for to meet further contingencies.</P>

      <P>When the Government tell us they want this number to have more efficient organisation and working by the Garda in order to deal with their police duties, I do not suppose we can refuse them.  However, I am a bit perturbed about the system of promotion to this inspector rank, and indeed, to all other ranks, but in particular to the inspector rank.  Before we would give this measure to the Minister I should like that he would assure us that promotions to this rank of inspector in the uniformed branch will be from the uniformed branch and that inspectors being promoted in the detective section will be promoted from the detective section.  I have reason to believe that there is dissatisfaction with regard to promotions that have taken place not only recently but perhaps over the years: that members of the uniformed Force are brought in <Col N="660" /> to the detective section and promoted to the rank of inspector, and that members of the detective section who have a very good record, an excellent record, are passed over.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, that creates a certain amount of dissatisfaction.  I found myself, when I occupied the office which the Minister now holds, that there was this dissatisfaction and that it was continuing. Now that we are increasing the number from 90 to 110, there is space for greater expansion and greater opportunity.</P>
      <P>I should also like the Minister to tell us in regard to promotion, that not only will a good service record and efficiency be taken into consideration, but that where there are members of the Old I.R.A. with a 1916-21 medal, with or without bar, it will be taken into consideration in deciding on promotion to the rank of inspector, for the length of time they will be there. As a matter of fact, I would urge on the Minister that it should be taken into consideration in all cases of promotion. It is only a passing phase and in a very short time, say, in 10 years, I suppose, no one with a medal with or without bar will be left.  For the time they will be there, I feel that the Minister and the Government should take that into consideration when making these promotions.</P>
      <P>There are several other matters which one would feel inclined to raise but which would not be in order on this Bill and I do not propose to touch on them.  I want to eliminate as far as is humanly possible one piece of what I know from experience to be definite dissatisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was introduced as a result of a reorganisation of the Garda in Dublin.  That reorganisation has brought about a situation in which additional inspectors are required.  Although there will still be room for the appointment of, I think, seven inspectors more than are immediately required, I should like to ask if the Minister is satisfied that he has provided in this Bill for the appointment of a sufficient number of inspectors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am interested in is that as <Col N="661" /> Dublin has been reorganised and more inspectors are required, is it not desirable that such reorganisation should take place in Cork, Galway, Limerick, and other urban areas?  If such reorganisation takes places will the Minister not find that he will have to come back with a similar short Bill? I take it that no one finds any objection to the Bill, but between now and Report Stage, the Minister should look ahead and consider the possibility that future reorganisation in various centres throughout the country will necessitate the appointment of more people with the rank of inspector.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage, the Minister also referred to the closing down of some stations in rural areas.  I understand that takes place only where there is a record of no crime for a considerable period.  It seems therefore that possibly fewer policemen will be administering greater areas than heretofore. In that respect also, it might be necessary to have reorganisation as time goes on, which will mean the appointment of more inspectors.</P>
    <P>In Dublin today, the biggest problem confronting Dublin Corporation is the rapid growth of population. With that growth, again, is the Minister satisfied that this reorganisation will not have to be further extended, with the extension of the city area, Corporation estates, private buildings in the suburbs, and so forth?  Will the Minister consider increasing the number from 110 to, say, 120, or even 150, and then he, or whatever Minister is in office in the years to come, will be in a position to deal with any future reorganisation that might become necessary ?</P>
    <P>The present retiring age is, I think, 63 years.  In Dublin, I understand there are a large number of inspectors and officers of higher rank who will be due to retire in the very near future. A large number of them will be retiring at the same time.  Those experienced inspectors will be replaced, I take it, probably, by younger men.  Although I agree with the previous speaker that people who have given service to the country, and have medals with or without bar, should be given very favourable consideration, when it comes to finding suitable people to <Col N="662" /> fill vacancies, from the information given to us on Second Stage, it is apparent that many younger men will be considered for these positions.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if a large number retire at the same time, or around the same time, the smooth administration and running of the Garda might be interfered with because of so many changes taking place together.  To me, that is a good case for an extension of the service of suitable men, provided they are considered fit in every way, pass suitable health tests, and so on. Those extensions, to my mind, should not be granted on more than a year to year basis, but for a smooth change-over from the existing inspectors and superintendents to the new men who will replace them very shortly, I think the Minister should ensure that there is not a sudden change of a large number, and that the change will be gradual.  In order to achieve this gradual change-over, I think the Minister should consider, in certain circumstances, extending the retiring age from 63 to, say, 65.  A two year period would enable that smooth change-over to take place.</P>
    <P>I mentioned on Second Stage that superintendents and higher ranks were entitled to two years' extension, provided they have a medal with bar. I am glad that in the last year this extension now applies to all ranks. This extension is long overdue and the Minister is to be congratulated on bringing it in.</P>
    <P>As this is the Committee Stage of this Bill, would the Minister consider, before we pass to the Report Stage, whether it would be desirable to increase that figure of 110 and thereby leave himself free, in co-operation with the Commissioner, to carry out any future reorganisation which might be found to be desirable?  I hope the Minister will deal with these points in his reply.</P>

      <P>I am informed in connection with promotions that not one of those promoted was from the province of Connacht.  That is very strange because in the five counties in the province of Connacht, there are as good men in the Force as there are in any other province or county.  I <Col N="663" /> merely want to ask the Minister why no member of the Force from the province of Connacht was called for promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad Deputy MacEoin mentioned this matter of promotion.  I know he will believe me when I assure him and the House that I am just as anxious as anybody, possibly more anxious than most people, to remove any possible cause of discontent that there may be in the Force.  We know that discontent and dissatisfaction can arise for many reasons.  Men can become dissatisfied with their accommodation, with their pay, with their prospects but I think possibly the grievance that seems to be the most serious and eats most deeply into a man's mind is this discontent or dissatisfaction over promotion.</P>
      <P>I mentioned on the Second Stage that it is inevitable that in any Force of this size and this nature there should be disappointment from time to time.  Men will be disappointed that they have failed to be promoted. The important thing is to ensure, however, that that disappointment does not become anything more than disappointment and the only way we can ensure that is by endeavouring to have a system of promotion throughout the Force which will not alone be fair but be capable of being seen to be fair, so that every man in the Force will be able to say: &ldquo;Well, if I did not succeed, at least a better man did&rdquo; or &ldquo;At least I got a fair chance of promotion.&rdquo; I should be very anxious that we would be able to bring about a situation where that would be generally known and realised throughout the Force and if I can isolate any factor which would prevent such a state of affairs, then I shall be very glad to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also explained on Second Stage that promotion within the Force depends on merit, that the system is based on suitability for promotion and that in the event of other things being equal, then seniority counts.  I think that is the way it must be and that is a fair way to have it, particularly, as I pointed out on Second <Col N="664" /> Stage, as in the Garda Síochána, any man joining the Force can be promoted right up to the top.  There is no entry into the higher echelon by means of a cadet force or anything of that nature.  That being so, when it comes to promoting people at any level of the Force, regard must be had to the fact that the person to be promoted could eventually go to the very top.  Therefore, serious regard must be had to his capabilities and to his qualifications. Having said that much, I must go on to say that, other things being equal, seniority must count.</P>
    <P>I have promised the House, and I shall adhere to my promise, that I shall discuss this matter fully with the Commissioner.  I shall mention to him everything that was mentioned here and see whether there is any way in which this system could be improved, not alone to ensure that it seems to work fairly but that it actually does work fairly.  This is one clear case where justice must not only be done but be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with Deputy MacEoin in his suggestion that national service should count in regard to promotion.  The position in the Force is that national service is taken into account in deciding whether or not to grant a member this extension of two years from 63 to 65.  When I say national service, I mean, of course, national service which has merited the medal and bar.  That is as far as we can go in giving recognition to national service.  It would be undesirable and objectionable to have national service counted as a factor in determining whether or not one man should be promoted over and above another.  I know this House would be inclined in any of these matters to do what they could to pay tribute and to grant some recognition to members of the Old I.R.A. who have national service but this is not the way in which it should be done.  We have gone as far as we can in giving two years' extension to men with medal and bar.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass mentioned the question of the reorganisation and asked me if I were satisfied that 110 was a large enough figure.  In that regard, I want to point out that at the time the examination <Col N="665" /> was made of the situation in Dublin, the examination from which this proposal springs, a corresponding examination was carried out throughout the country and in the cities he mentioned, Limerick, Cork and so on. It was decided as a result of that examination that no particular change was necessary but a scheme of reorganisation was decided upon for Dublin and, as I mentioned briefly on Second Stage, that scheme involves the putting of an inspector in charge of each of 21 of the 23 Dublin stations and an inspector with each detective unit, and also provides for the establishment of a communications officer and a crime prevention officer.  Much of that scheme has already been put into operation.  The remaining part of it was held up because of not having a sufficient number of inspectors and that is the reason for this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are now giving ourselves statutory authority to appoint the additional number of inspectors required.  I should not like to come here, having estimated the number of inspectors we require, to ask for twice that number. I think the statutory provision of a maximum number of any rank is based on the fact that it is a good idea that this House should keep control of the particular situation and that it should not be left entirely to the discretion of the Government to appoint any number of any particular rank they would like.</P>
    <P>The police force is a fundamental institution.  It is a good thing that if the Government want an increase in any number they have to come to this House and justify the increase.  Therefore I think there is an obligation on me to decide the number of inspectors I need and then to ask the House to give me statutory authority to appoint that number, with a little leeway, and that is what I have done.</P>
    <P>If it transpires that a situation would develop in Cork, Limerick or elsewhere in which we would need extra inspectors, we have a leeway of seven.  In asking the House to vote us twenty additional inspectors we need only thirteen. Therefore, we have given ourselves thirteen with a little leeway of seven.  I do not think it would be desirable to look for any greater number than that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> Deputy Lemass also touched on an aspect of the force which is very much in my mind at the moment.  That is that, because of the historical development of the force, a very large number of the higher echelon will be going out within the next two or three years. For the younger members of the force at the moment, it is excellent.  There will be wonderful opportunities of promotion over the next two, three, four, five years.  However, for the force as a whole, I do not think it would be a good thing.  I am inclined to agree that is not desirable that there should be a wholesale clearance of the higher echelon, being replaced completely in a very short period of time with new people.  Unfortunately, that is the situation and there is not very much we can do about it.  In so far as anything can be done about it, it is being done with this provision that, other things being equal, seniority counts.  That will ensure a certain leavening out of the sudden transition that is due to take place.</P>

      <P>The question of the closing of rural stations was mentioned on the Second Stage and I explained the situation.  A rural station is closed only after the most careful consideration. I think it is the invariable rule that the station is closed only when it can be shown that the area covered by it has virtually been free of crime over a number of years.  In that connection, I pointed out to the House that we had a duty to the taxpayer that the force be administered as efficiently and economically as possible and that a station which is obviously an anachronism and is no longer serving any useful purpose be closed. I can assure the House that no station is closed without the most careful examination and without every aspect of the proposed closure being examined.</P>

I am glad the Minister gave me an opportunity of mentioning it.  It does not come fully within the ambit of this Bill and neither did the Minister.  I suggest that, being a young Minister, it would be a very nice gesture on his part and on the part of the Government he represents if it were agreed that the 100 or 150 members of the Garda who have a medal without bar would get the two years which their colleagues get.  They got it in the Army.  Why make fish of one and flesh of another?  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that matter.</P>

      <P>I would not, anyhow, whether or not Deputy MacEoin would.  Definitely I would not hold it against them.  I just want to point out <Col N="669" /> to the Minister that Connacht is generally considered a backward area. Many Garda sergeants are in the area &mdash;many of them are from Dublin, if the Minister wants it that way&mdash;and the strange thing is that Donegal is included as well and for all that province, from the five counties, not one of the sergeants has been called even for interview.  I thought as a Connacht man, I might point that out to the Minister.  I suppose I need not do so.  Indeed, I suppose I might have begun by congratulating the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Justice. I need not do that&mdash;he knows my feelings very well.  Because these sergeants are in Connacht, in any of the five counties of that province, they have done very hard work; many of them have degrees but not one of them has been called for interview.  As a Connacht man, I think there is something wrong with that.  I am sure the Minister will not mind my pointing out the fact and asking him to tell me why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two complaints I have received in this connection. The first is that a garda who is recommended by his superior officer on a number of occasions to go before an interview board feels a sense of grievance if, after numerous appearances before such a board, he finds he is consistently turned down.  That may be a reflection on the superior officer concerned rather than on the board. Possibly, the Minister might like to consider that matter because I can well understand that a superior officer may be very slow to say to his men: &ldquo;I will not recommend you to go before the board.&rdquo;  Commanding officers may feel that &ldquo;Garda So-and-So is a sound enough fellow; he should not be discouraged and he should get at least a chance of an interview and if he does not make the grade, that is his own worry.  I shall have at least given him the chance.&rdquo;  If commanding officers continue to recommend unsuitable material, it should be brought home to them that they are not acting in the best interests of the Force and the best interests of the individual Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second complaint I have <Col N="670" /> received is that in certain cases there is a leakage of information after the interview board has met and considered its findings.  Here, like Deputy Donnellan, I am speaking only on hearsay which may not have any basis in fact, but, as he says, I am told in certain cases it becomes known that a certain candidate has been ranked No. 4 by the interview board.  It subsequently becomes known that on further consideration, the level had been reduced from No. 4 to No. 8.  On final consideration, he discovers he is not in the running at all.  There may be just a leakage of information that is incorrect, but it is only to be expected that within a comparatively small force, not only information but rumour will spread quickly.  If a man who was before an interview board for one of six vacancies and was originally allotted place No. 3 and fell down and finally did not make the grade at all there is a terrible danger that he feels somebody was in a better position than he was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and consequently, that he was not excluded on merit but on certain information that somebody else had.  Once that feeling grows in a force, the situation becomes extremely dangerous.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not making any accusations at all because I could not justify any formal accusation of impropriety but I know these feelings are present in the minds of some members of the Force.  While I accept unreservedly the Minister's assurance that he will try to ensure that justice is seen to be done, I only mention the matter here so that he may have a possible line of inquiry which he might make and which I hope would restore confidence in the Garda generally and in the whole promotion system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Booth for mentioning these two points because they are typical of the sort of misunderstanding that can get abroad.  I agree that a man who is sent forward on a couple of occasions to an interview board and does not <Col N="671" /> succeed would be entitled to say that there was something wrong, that either his divisional officers were wrong in sending him forward or that the interview board was wrong in not promoting him.  It is not always as simple as that.  Very often there is the case where a man is not promoted, not because he is not an excellent man himself, but because there happens to be somebody better.  We all know how that sort of thing works and how misapprehensions can arise engendering discontent.</P>
      <P>The second matter mentioned is a very natural and human one, a situation where the results of the interview board purport to leak out.  Very often, as any of us know who have done examinations, the wildest and most unfounded rumours leak out as regards results.  When the actual results come out, there is disappointment for those who, going on the original rumour, thought they were successful and who, as it subsequently transpired, were not.  These are all matters which we should look at as closely as we can and try to obviate any source of discontent or grievance that might be liable to flow from them.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Donnellan and the province of Connacht, I must apologise to the House that I cannot give a categoric reply to the matter that is worrying the Deputy but I think it would be extraordinary if it were true.</P>

      <P>I know.  I can tell the House that when it comes to a question of promotion to the rank of sergeant outside Dublin, every division, that is, every chief superintendent's area, nominates a certain quota to go forward for interview.  The area officers are responsible for sending forward the people they think merit interview.  Certainly, I can assure Deputy Donnellan that so far as the four or five chief superintendents' areas in Connacht are concerned, they did send forward their quota for interview&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a proposal to build some 2,000 houses in Raheny area so that it will become a very large and important suburban area in due course ?</P>
      <P>Another matter I should like the Minister to explain is this crime prevention inspector.  I gather he will have very special duties.  Will he be senior to the inspectors in the different stations and be able to direct them on certain ways of crime prevention or will he simply be of equal status and able to make recommendations to the superintendent, chief superintendent or Commissioner?  This is a new job and I should like the Minister to explain what this man's power is to enforce any regulations on crime prevention.</P>
      <P>The Minister did refer very briefly to accommodation and in that respect in my constituency we have three barracks.  A new one is to be built in Crumlin and there is good barracks already in another side of Crumlin but in Terenure and Rathmines the accommodation is extremely poor.  I certainly think there is not a room in Rathmines or Terenure of which you would say: &ldquo;There is suitable accommodation and you are the inspector in charge of this barracks.&rdquo;  I know there are plans to build houses but what I do not know is how these plans will affect these two older barracks in my constituency and I should like some information of that point from the Minister.</P>

That will be a special role and he will not be in the chain of command above or below a particular area inspector but will be given the special job of making a study of crime prevention and advising both the force and the public on methods of prevention of crime.</P>
      <P>On the other point mentioned by Deputy Lemass, Raheny, I want to make it clear that this reorganisation about which I am talking is an administrative job and, in the existing administrative set up, it is better to administer Raheny from Clontarf and Kill-o'-the-Grange from Dalkey but if at any time population basis changes render that necessary, different adjustments can be made and there is a margin of seven inspectors on whom we can draw.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that housing legislation should be reviewed with particular reference to the following matters: (a) the hardship caused by the operation of the differential renting system by Dublin Corporation; (b) the need for a scheme of rates remission for S.D.A. house purchasers which will ease their burden for a period of not less than eighteen years; and (c) the need for continued maintenance of county council cottages during the period when tenants are purchasing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Sherwin is not here, I shall resume the debate. Last week Deputy Dunne told us that he defended the principle of differential rents but opposed any form of inquisition.  I do not see how differential rents can be applied unless there is some form of inquisition.  In his statement, he repeated the usual <Col N="675" /> grievances.  I have had occasion to repeat them myself on the local authority and they have been repeated so often I am afraid that they are almost reduced to what might be called <i>clichés.</i></P>
      <P>The difficulty I see is that Deputy Dunne did not suggest any solution to these problems except that we might set up a committee.  This Oireachtas does not decide how differential rents might be applied in any local authority area.  The Oireachtas has simply given the local authorities power to bring in a differential rents scheme if they so desire and it is a matter for the local authority in the first instance to propose and introduce amendments which can be enforced subject to the approval of the Minister. I sat on a committee along with Deputy Sherwin every second Friday for about two years and many other councillors and Deputies did the same in the Dublin area.  Since then, that committee has been dissolved and another set up which also sat and had considerable and lengthy discussions on differential rents and now I believe a third attempt is being made.  I should like Deputy Dunne and other members of local authorities concerned about differential rents to remember that if a committee were set up there should be no councillors or Deputies on that committee because, once public representatives assume duties of this nature, more likely than not political considerations will over-rule sound judgment.</P>
      <P>In the first instance Deputy Dunne asks in this motion that housing legislation should be reviewed.  He then goes on to itemise particular things which he thinks should be reviewed, but, under the general heading, I think there is a far more serious problem confronting the citizens of Dublin, Dublin Corporation and the elected representatives of Dublin, than the three items listed for particular attention by Deputy Dunne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that every alternative year the Minister for Local Government brings in a local government Bill which, in effect, reviews all local government legislation, with particular reference to housing.  I am aware that <Col N="676" /> such legislation will be before this House in 1962, provided the usual procedure is adhered to.  A few years ago, just about 1957, when the previous Government left office in a hurry, if I might say so, the City Manager was recommending the curtailment of building, on the ground that there were over 1,000 houses being vacated in a Corporation estate of 42,000 or 43,000 houses and that on top of that there was a resistance against going out to the outlying areas, having regard to the high bus fares to which Deputy Dunne refers. By the way, I agree entirely that if people have to pay 15/- or 16/- in bus fares to and from their work, they should receive consideration for that as distinct from the people who live beside their work in the central city area.</P>
    <P>I suggested at that time that no matter what curtailment had to take place in the manager's view, which was supported by members of the Housing Committee&mdash;the chairman at that time was the former Deputy Larkin of the Labour benches and the vice-chairman was Alderman&mdash;then Councillor&mdash;Sherwin &mdash; regardless of what the situation on that day might be, we should proceed with the development of the Coolock-Raheny estate; that, although the Corporation were expressing the fear at that time that if they built at too fast a rate, they would find themselves with houses left on their hands, they should still carry on with this site development work.  I said it would create employment which was badly needed at that time and in the event of a change in the economic situation of this country, that site development would be there and the houses could be built quickly and so avert any problem such as we are facing today.</P>
    <P>The problem we have today is a very simple one.  To use the words addressed to me privately in the Housing Allocations Department last week by one of the principal officers, five families are coming back from England today to every one that goes away.  It is a complete reversal of the trend three or four years ago.  These families are to a large extent families who had Corporation houses, had <Col N="677" /> clear rent books and were entitled, according to Corporation policy, to reinstatement in Corporation houses or alternatively if they could not get reinstatement in Corporation houses, they were forced to go into buildings which were condemned or about to be condemned.  The Corporation now find themselves having to house a much larger number of people than heretofore.</P>
    <P>What I am getting at is this.  When I said a few years ago that we could expect a change in the economic trends and that we should go ahead with this site development, I was told I was talking Fianna Fáil propaganda; that I was trying to make capital out of this for something that would never happen.  Unfortunately, the people who listened to the Opposition in those days were the officials of the Corporation.  They said: &ldquo;No; this economic expansion is not going to take place.&rdquo;  Even year after year as the progress has been increasing and as the demand for housing has been increasing, the Corporation did not act until very recently.  They are now developing these sites in Coolock-Raheny. It will be one or two years before we see any substantial increase in the output of dwellings.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that the officials of the Corporation did not see the way things were going in the country and prepare for the situation because now where a family of three living in one room or with relatives in a Corporation house could be offered accommodation in the outlying areas a few years ago, in a very short space of time, the Corporation are now considering only families of six for Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what this might lead to in a few years to come.  You need four children to be considered for a house in Ballyfermot today or, alternatively, be cleared out of a condemned dwelling or put out of your house through no fault of your own.  At the last survey, it was found that there were sites in Dublin at the present density of building for 6,000 houses. If the output of houses were to be restored to what it was some eight years ago, of 2,000 dwellings in the <Col N="678" /> year, in three years, every site and every dwelling would be built but if the present economic trend continues &mdash;and we have no reason to believe it will not&mdash;we will then be faced with the situation that we have nowhere to build houses and we will again return to the situation we had when the Housing Act was first introduced in 1933, that is, the situation in which families of seven and eight live in a room rented to them in a Corporation house&mdash;through the goodwill of the parents of the married children.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that, when he is considering his legislation in 1962, he will examine the present method of paying subsidy for Corporation house building.  In June, 1959, it was decided, on the recommendation of the City Manager and his technical advisers, not to build at a greater height than five storeys on the central city sites.  The reason for this largely arises from the present method of paying the subsidies.  I am not suggesting that the Minister should pay additional subsidies.  What I am suggesting is that he should revise the system of paying the subsidies, particularly in respect of Dublin or, perhaps, all urban areas and to revise them in such a way that it will pay the local authority to build to heights greater than five storeys in other words, to get more than 6,000 dwellings on the sites available.</P>
    <P>In a report to the Housing Committee dated 30th June, 1959, there was a summary of estimates by outside consultants and Corporation officials as to what it would have cost to build a nine-storey tower block in Dominick Street.  It was estimated by Mr. Fitzgerald that the cost in a nine-storey block would be £38 per flat higher. At the other extreme, we were told the cost would be up to £500 per flat higher.  I am absolutely satisfied that the situation now demands building in tall blocks to a level of 15 storeys. In 1950, a group of Dublin Corporation councillors and aldermen went on an inspection of these blocks in England.  They made comparisons of cost and administration and recommended unanimously that the Corporation should build a certain percentage, <Col N="679" /> at any rate, of tall blocks. In the following year, on the recommendation of the manager, that was turned down.  The next council, elected in 1950, also pressed to have a tall block built.  One was, in fact, designed and tenders were received.  That was in Dominick Street.</P>

I will not deal with part (c) because I have no experience of the county council administration.  It seems to me that part (b) was put in by the Deputy as a face-saver after he put in part (a). From reading his speech, it would seem to me that the Deputy wants housing legislation amended in some way that would result in an increase in rates and then come along with part (b) and says we will give an 18 years' period of rates remission to the poor unfortunate ratepayer who has to bear the burden.</P>

The amount of relief in rates is exactly the same within £5 over ten years on a £20 valuation as it was before but it is spread out in a different way.  To go further, to my mind, would have the immediate effect of being to the disadvantage of the ratepayers in S.D.A. houses at present by delaying the period where people would come on to the full rate and thus take their full part of the cost of providing public services.  I have, as the Deputy said, dealt mainly with something he did not want me to deal with at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the motion and I am particularly concerned with that part of the motion dealing with the hardship caused by the operation of the differential renting system by Dublin Corporation.  Of the two phrases more hated than any others, it would be very hard to decide in the city of Dublin, which is the more hated&mdash;the blue card or the differential renting system.  With a considerable amount of justification, the average person in the city is certainly at the end of his patience with the many anomalies and injustices which are perpetrated in the name of this differential renting system operated by the Corporation.  I do not think we are out of order in the suggestion made here, as Deputy Lemass has implied, because, as he said, the Minister must accept any proposal put forward by the housing authority.  He must consider it and, for that reason, he can be helped by the discussion we hold here. Therefore the discussion could be a valuable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Lemass and his talk about the emigrants flocking back to the city of Dublin, it was difficult to believe the factual reports of the last census which showed that there was a drop of 3 per cent. in the population. He is seeing things through distorted spectacles if he thinks the country is filling up instead of emptying.  The idea of a differential rent system is a good one, in so far as it is based on the broad principle that those in distress should be helped by those who are well off, reasonably well off, or more fortunate than they are.  It is part of the typical double talk of the conservative politicians that they should accept the validity of the idea but only for other people.  That principle applied generally to the country would have the whole nation taking responsibility to provide money for better educational services for everybody's children and better health services for everybody who fell sick.  What has happened is that they decide that in a particular housing area, where a person is disabled by an injury or other act of God, or becomes an old age pensioner, or is unemployed, he shall in effect be subsidised by his more fortunate comrade who does not suffer <Col N="683" /> in that way.  Therefore there is this variation in rent arising out of the changing circumstances of the individual.  I accept the general principle that those who are well off must look after those who are not. I accept that only when it is extended to the whole of our society.</P>
    <P>One of the points made by Deputy Lemass was that there would be increases in the burden of rates and taxation if we were to change this system too much in any significant way.  He believes that would be a very undesirable thing.  I think the Corporation Councillors to whom I listened seemed to be inextricably tangled up in the complications of the existing differential system.  The general air of helplessness, which they showed when discussing it, seems to me to show that they have thrown their hats at the proposition that it could be improved and that they do not intend to make any serious improvement in it.  I believe it is wrong that an individual, the father of a family, should find himself, if he is unemployed, supported by one of his children who is paying a substantial part of the rent.</P>
    <P>I think the case has been made by many speakers on the Government benches in regard to the rights and responsibilities of a father to provide for his children much more frequently than I have made it.  They have made the case that the father is responsible for providing the essential needs of the family and that this responsibility should not be taken from him.  Yet, under this differential system, the means of the whole family are assessed and a certain portion of their income is taken.  That has very undesirable repercussions, as Deputy Dunne and other Deputies pointed out, because there are cases where young people, a young boy or girl trying to save up to get married, find that a considerable portion of their income has to be handed over to pay the family rent. This leads to a certain amount of dissatisfaction in the family.  It is undesirable that any scheme devised by us or the local authorities should lead to such dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> Time and time again we have listened to Government and Opposition speakers making pleas on the Budget and at other times that the industrialists and businessmen, our own or imported ones, simply cannot work at their optimum unless they are given the particular facility of tax concessions, that production will not be increased and that the only incentive they really understand is more money in their pockets.  That again is never applied when it comes to the worker here. When a worker asks for an increase in his wages he is told about its inflationary implications but the profits the businessman wants to make do not affect inflation.</P>
    <P>Equally, when a father or a whole family decides to take part in a drive to increase production, and in that way increase their income by working longer hours, or overtime, or by taking on extra jobs at night to try to help the family, to educate them or whatever the purpose may be, they are penalised because of their initiative. Because they attempt to increase their income they are penalised but the wealthy person is relieved by a reduction in his taxation or by tax free profits.  The money is taken from the worker and in that way the incentive to work harder, to work longer hours, or overtime, is reduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass made a suggestion which I have often heard other speakers make.  That is that these people are not paying an economic rent, that their rents are being subsidised and that even if they are paying the maximum rent they are not paying an economic rent and that it is paid out of taxation and the rates.  What people seem to forget when they are discussing housing, health or education, is that the ordinary worker pays very considerable tax into the Central Fund and that, if he is getting a subsidy, he is merely getting his own money back. Everybody pays indirect taxation on food, drink, tobacco and all the other commodities on which new taxation is imposed in every Budget.  Whatever money the worker gets out of the Central Fund is merely his own money. It is not just surtax which is providing these low rents; it is the worker himself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> If anybody is burdened down with rates and taxation, it is the ordinary worker.  The other person is in our society the privileged person&mdash;the wealthy businessman and the industrialist who is offered in every document and brochure put out by our State these remarkable concessions time and time again.  I believe the ideal arrangement for the provision of any of these sort of social welfare benefits is that they should come from the Central Exchequer funds or the rates, or both.  None of us likes the fact that we have to pay taxes, but in that way at least the taxation is collected as fairly as possible from each according to his means and his ability to pay.  In assessing the equity of any scheme for health, education, housing legislation, or whatever it may be, there is no simpler method of assessment than the ability to pay the income tax assessment of the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not see why it is necessary for us to set up, as we have set up in respect of these other social services, a separate bureaucracy in order to keep these absurd and horrible means tests in operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said there was no way it could be done without an inquisition.  He knows that there are inquisitions and inquisitions.  There is the inquisition we all have to go through in filling in our income tax returns.  It is unpleasant, but it is a very much less unpleasant operation than the one which these ordinary people have to undergo in the Corporation estates&mdash;the repetitious inquisitions which their children have to undergo, which all the residents in the particular house or flat have to undergo at each change in their incomes.</P>
    <P>There are ideological objections, but one of the biggest objections put forward is the unnecessary cost of operating these schemes and the complexity and difficulty of operating them fairly and, at the same time, appearing to operate them fairly.  One family thinks another family is getting concessions or, in fact, knows they are getting concessions and is annoyed that they are not able to get them.  If there is any case at all for <Col N="686" /> the retention of differential systems, there is none at all for this particular one where all the members of the family are included in it.</P>
    <P>I do not see why it should not be possible to provide for the desirable objectives of this scheme.  I suppose it is what Jim Larkin had in mind when favouring this idea that the old age person, the disabled person and the generally underprivileged groups would be looked after in respect of their rent payments.  I do not think it is impossible to devise a scheme whereby that could be done.  It should be possible to fix the rent as a percentage of the income of the main breadwinner, the father of the family, and to provide that the income of no other member of the family should be taken into consideration at all.  I suppose that would mean the inquisition to which Deputy Lemass referred, but I think it would be a less frequent inquisition. With the widespread use of P.A.Y.E., it should be possible to get that basic income quite easily.  The average man would then be spared the necessity of getting documents from his employer and documents relating to every person in the family.  It would remove a considerable amount of the dissatisfaction that exists in respect of the present operation of the differential renting system.</P>
    <P>I would also favour in that type of case that, where there were children, there should be a percentage reduction in the rent to be paid by the family, particularly in respect of children under 14, and that the parents should be assisted and not penalised because of the size of the family.</P>
    <P>In respect of the disabled person, the old age pensioner and the unemployed person, a proportionate part of their income&mdash;I am not sufficiently expert to know what would be the right amount&mdash;could be paid as rent. In each of those categories, it is quite simple to tell who is an old age pensioner, who is an unemployed man, and who is a disabled person.  As I said, it would be relatively easy to find out the income of the parent, the breadwinner.  It is where one moves off into finding the income of the other members of the family that I think the great dissatisfaction arises in the operation <Col N="687" /> of the differential renting system.  I do not agree with Deputy Lemass that the politicians should not be on committees to consider this matter.  It seems absurd to suggest we are not capable of an objective examination of this question.  I also do not share the view of another Deputy that we could not alter this system because it would mean a considerable increase in the rates. If we are to take that attitude about this particular service, then it says a number of things.  First, it means one is not going to change any of our social amenities, whether they are health, education or housing, because of an increase in the money to be paid by the big ratepayers.  I presume you are concerned for the big ratepayers. Secondly, it seems to me to presume that it is impossible for the State, the Central Exchequer, to step in and provide for the local authority, if the rates burden is considered too high for the average ratepayer.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this is a complete admission of failure, a complete negation of the suggestion that we have plenty of money coming in, that the national income, about which Deputy Lemass was so cheerful, is so buoyant, if we are unable to get from the Government a subsidy for the easement of the rent in the case of Corporation householders and the underprivileged classes within that group.</P>
    <P>One other Deputy made the point that our whole problem would be greatly eased if we did not have to pay the fabulous interest rates which we have to pay in respect of the money borrowed from the banks.  That also seems to me to be one other way in which it would be possible for the Minister to ease the difficulties of the local authority.  One of the most depressing things&mdash;and I have listened to experienced councillors and aldermen who have spoken in this debate&mdash;is to hear or read their admission of failure and their refusal to face facts. If they really want to, through the Central Exchequer, an increase on the rates, by a reduction of the bank rate or some other source, it should be possible for them to devise some system whereby the present grossly <Col N="688" /> inequitable differential rents system could be dealt with in a very much more equitable way.</P>
    <P>If our society is generally interested in helping the unemployed man, the disabled person, the old age pensioner or the worker with a large family, there is no use in throwing up our hands and saying it cannot be done. If we are so hard up, if we are so near destitution that we cannot, it is an indictment of the economic system which continues to be practised.  They must then concede that the economic system in which they believe has failed, or they must concede that they are unable to help these people.  They should not transfer their burden to a small minority within the community. The burden of responsibility for the old age pensioner, the disabled person, or the unemployed man must not be transferred to a minority within the community, while they try to do their charitable work on the cheap at his expense.</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate since it opened, certainly the first part of it does not give any qualms to anyone, and least of all to me.  The motion reads: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that housing legislation should be reviewed...&rdquo; I dare say the House is aware that a review is called for once every two years.  That has been the position since 1948 under various Governments and various Ministers for Local Government.</P>
      <P>At present this review is under way, and the results will see the light eventually when the present housing legislation comes to an end on 31st of next March.  I should say at the outset that in regard to this review, any and all practical proposals whether emanating from individual Deputies, groups of Deputies, or Parties in the House, will be welcomed so far as I am concerned, and will get every consideration during the course of the review which is now, as I say, under way in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> Dealing with the three matters specially mentioned in the motion, the question of differential rents appears to have occupied the minds of most of the speakers, and the greater part of their speeches to-night and last Wednesday night.  I want to state again that while various views were expressed on the method of operation of the differential renting system, little indeed has been said against the principle of differential rents.  Not all Deputies who condemn the operation of the system in the Dublin Corporation area likewise condemn the idea or the principle of differential rents as such.</P>
    <P>Whether they condemn the principle or the detailed working of the system, this is the system which was adopted by Dublin Corporation, put to the then Minister in 1950, and sanctioned by him.  There was no reason then, nor is there any real reason now, why another form of differential rents, or the application of the differential renting system, should not be proposed by Dublin Corporation or indeed by any other local authority throughout the country which is at present operating a scheme of differential rents, not all of which&mdash;in fact I doubt any of which&mdash;are completely comparable with each other.</P>
    <P>From listening to the debate here, I feel that the bitterest complaints from those who have spoken hinge on the methods of inquisition, the methods of calculating the accurate income on which the rent is based.  That is the objectionable feature.  If it is so objectionable, a remedy should be found in Dublin Corporation, or in any other council chamber, and the objectionable feature removed.</P>
    <P>It is suggested also that there was a £2 million income, approximately, in rents to the Dublin Corporation during the current year, or last year&mdash;I think it is the current year.  I do not dispute the figure of £2 million.  That is true, but it is not the net income coming from the rents.  From that £2 million, the entire rates bill in respect of these houses must be deducted and in fact is deducted from each housing account before it becomes income to that housing account.</P>
    <P>After that, to our knowledge, this <Col N="690" /> year £470,000 is being spent on repairs and improvements of the housing stock in the Dublin Corporation jurisdiction. When you take the rates, the maintenance and repairs moneys from this £2 million, you will find that the income then remaining is not anything as great as the all round figure of £2,000,000 here suggested.  When we get the residual figure, we find that the rates general account has to add this year over £700,000 to help carry on the outgoings of the general housing account of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Added to that £700,000, another £700,000 is paid by my Department to Dublin Corporation in respect of that same housing stock, and goes into that same account in order that it should be able to carry on.  To get the thing in its proper perspective, the Central Fund is paying at the moment to the Dublin Corporation account over £700,000.  The rates pool of the Corporation is paying over £700,000 also. Out of the income of £2 million approximately, almost a quarter is being spent on maintenance of the same houses, and from the remaining £1,500 odd, rates in respect of the houses in the ownership of Dublin Corporation must be deducted.</P>
    <P>As a matter of interest, from a table of figures which I have here, the net rent in quite a number of houses let in Dublin Corporation estates in fact represents a loss or a deficit.  If we take a one-roomed flat of £4 valuation on the minimum rent, the actual rates are 8d. more than the rent being paid. If at the other end of the scale, we take a five-roomed flat on the minimum rent of 7/6d. there is an actual loss, after rates are deducted, of 4/3d. in respect of that type of house.</P>
    <P>I give these figures merely in order that the House will appreciate that it is not all a one-way traffic.  In fact, this idea of differential rents has certain points which have not been brought out, favourable to its acceptance and operation.  I should say also that there appears to be a general idea expressed here that because some person is paying more for a house than another person is paying for a similar house, it follows automatically that the person paying the higher rent is subsidising the person paying the lower <Col N="691" /> rent for a similar house.  That would be so if money were being made on these transactions, but when we set it against the background that none of these houses is in fact let at a very economic rent, and that there is in fact subsidisation on all houses and on every house, then this whole argument of the subsidisation by one tenant of the rent of another tenant in the same scheme falls to the ground.</P>
    <P>All of these houses are being subsidised and it is not true to say that if a person pays 33/- for a four or five-roomed house and his neighbour pays 10/-, that if there were no differential rents and if there were graded rents, both of them would be paying 17/6d. It does not follow again from that that the person now paying the 33/- is subsidising the person who is paying the 10/- when all houses, both the 33/- a week and the 10/- a week houses, are being subsidised and subsidised very heavily.</P>
    <P>As I have said at the outset the differential rent system will find its detractors.  Objectionable occurrences may be quoted, without proof in many cases.  That they may exist I do not doubt but that in itself should not blind us to the fact that differential renting, if operated in a reasonable way, means that people who are less well-off can get their houses at the lowest possible rents and at the same time not add a burden that the local authority is not prepared to carry on the rates.  We should not condemn the system because of the anomalies that have been of our own creation within the administration of the scheme, a system chosen by the respective local authorities, put to the Department and the Minister for Local Government of the day and sanctioned as the wishes of that local authority.</P>
    <P>There is nothing sacrosanct about any of the differential renting systems at the moment in operation.  There is no reason why they should not be reviewed and changed.  There is every reason why any objectionable features that have arisen from experience over the years should be removed so as to make them more acceptable.  There are many things that can be done in <Col N="692" /> that direction, far too numerous to mention here in the short time that remains for the conclusion of this debate.  However, I would say seriously to all members here who are members of local authorities or members of the Dublin Corporation especially that they should review in a very comprehensive and detailed manner their renting system.</P>
    <P>As regards any suggestions they may wish to make to the Department, where we come into it, we shall be only too glad to help.  Finally if they come up with a new scheme that has obviated all the objectionable features they have found during the past 10 years, everybody should feel a little more happy.  However, it is not reasonable merely to condemn the system when it is the creation of the local authority itself and to ask for legislation&mdash;I think that is the intention. Legislation for what?  Legislation to change the system, to abolish the system, legislation without any alternative being proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I say&mdash; and I do not mean this as a reflection on the sponsors of this motion&mdash;that instead of merely suggesting the abolition of the system, there should be a more positive approach.  I am certainly at this stage not convinced that the system should be abolished but I am open to being convinced if the arguments can be and are put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the second part of the motion, the need for a scheme of rates remission for S.D.A. house purchasers which will ease their burden by extending remission over a period of 18 years, you could make a good case for a person who has purchased a house, particularly a married couple whose family is growing up, as to why they would need help up to 18 years and I could make an excellent case also as to why they should get help for a further 10 years.  However, we must <Col N="693" /> study the background to this matter. Up to 1958 the remission of rates was two-thirds for seven years.  At that stage in deference to members of the House that system was changed and the remission was spread over a period of 10 years, rising by one-tenth a year after the first year of completion on occupation of the house.</P>
    <P>If it is merely a question of spreading that same relief over an 18-year period rather than a 10-year period, it is quite possible that no serious objection need be raised to it but the substance of this second part of the motion suggests that there should be greater relief over an 18-year period. A case can be made for that, too, but we have to consider the clamour in regard to rising rates.  We have cases being made that they should not be allowed to rise, and from all directions there are suggestions that the State should step in to a greater degree in order that we may continue to expand our general services through the local authorities without the rates bearing any additional cost.</P>
    <P>That is a fairly general argument and certainly is a very popular one. But in regard to adding further to the rates burden by giving longer and greater rate remission, we should remember that, as far as house building is concerned, the great majority of our local housing authorities are paying supplementary housing grants.  Those are coming from the rates pool.  If we are to continue to get this voluntary effort by the local authorities of giving these supplementary housing grants, we certainly would not be encouraging them if we say to them: &ldquo;You will have to wait much longer to gain any benefit or any worth-while benefit from the new rating being created by virtue of new houses being built.&rdquo;  It has taken many years of encouragement to get counties to pay supplementary grants at all.</P>
    <P>We have been encouraging them also in some cases to expand.  If we were now to come and say after all this: &ldquo;We shall expand the rates remission period to 18 years,&rdquo; I know&mdash;I shall not say I am afraid&mdash;there are county councils and local authorities who at their next review, which in most cases <Col N="694" /> is due next March, would say: &ldquo;If we are not to get anything from the ratings here and our rate valuation over the entire local authority area will not increase, then we can no longer afford to give these somewhat generous supplementary grants.&rdquo;  That aspect could defeat the very purpose which the sponsors of this motion have in mind to try to help people, to encourage them to build their own houses and to enable them to pay for them without unduly straining their resources.</P>
    <P>That is an aspect of it.  The general aspect is the clamour against the rising rates throughout the country over the years.  Taking the two things together, I do not feel convinced at this stage that the suggestion contained in the motion could indeed be sponsored at this time.</P>
    <P>Then there is the third and final special mention made of the need for continued maintenance of county council cottages during the period when tenants are purchasing.  At the moment, when tenants purchase and when they become vested, they are given certain concessions.  The payments are reduced to 50 per cent. of the rent they were paying up to the time of vesting.  That, no doubt, was given first of all as an encouragement to get people to come to own their own houses and, secondly, no doubt also much in mind was the fact that once tenants become purchasers they have responsibility, the same as any other owner of property, for maintaining that property and that maintenance will cost money.  Therefore the reduction of the rent and the conversion of half the rent into a repayment figure I think made sense.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong surely to say that this concession should be made and this encouragement should be given and that people should be given the right of ownership without the obligations, in order that the last argument that might have been used should be taken away, the argument that people who were in vested cottages and who were purchasing these cottages were debarred from getting the normal repair and reconstruction grants.  That was true until 1958.  Since then, these <Col N="695" /> people are entitled to apply for these grants the same as any other householder and many of them have done so.</P>
    <P>I think it is true that, overall, the people who get these cottages vested in them are, in the majority of cases, very proud owners of their property and tend to care for that property in a manner befitting that which belongs to themselves.  I do not quite agree with Deputy Dunne when he seems to imply by this term of his motion that owners of these houses are not house-proud and are not glad to have their own houses and to look after them.  I believe the experience is that these people look after their houses very well.  Indeed, in many cases, before they have come to purchase them at all, some of them look after the houses as if they were their own and naturally look after them even better when they become their own property and are given full title to them.</P>
    <P>On this matter, Deputy Desmond raised the question that cottages or houses when handed over to tenants are not always in the repair which the local authority are by law obliged to keep them or in which to hand them over.  I would say to Deputy Desmond that over the last three and a half years Cork County Council raised £430,000 by way of loans to do just this job of repairing cottages prior to vesting. If the job is being done or has been done as badly as he has asserted, then there must be something wrong with the Cork County Council and the sooner he would bring to my knowledge just what is wrong&mdash;he being a member of it, so far as I know&mdash;the better I should like it because there certainly would be something very wrong if all this money were entirely being wasted and houses handed over to tenants in an unfit condition.</P>
    <P>In addition, he has advocated that the applicant for vesting should be given the right to refuse the vesting at the last moment.  He and his colleagues in the Labour Party actually supported and accepted the change brought about in the law, I think in 1956, by the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy <Col N="696" /> O'Donnell whereby the full title of these vested houses came to be reposed in the actual tenant-purchaser.</P>
    <P>It is said that the county council do not carry out the repairs.  It is said further that the concession, as he describes it, of having these houses repaired is being flouted and that the inspectors from my Department are not doing their work; that the applicant for vesting or the person in whom the house is being vested is not getting a fair deal and, in fact, that the work prescribed by our Department and my inspectors, on investigation following appeal, is not being carried out.  I fail to agree that that is so.</P>
    <P>I would also say to Deputy Desmond that if he has made this charge, other than making it as a debating point, he should consider sending to me, as he suggested he could give us, the 18 to 28 out of the 20 to 30 cases he knows of where this flouting of the law has taken place, where the tenant purchaser has been done down, where he has been handed over a house in an unfit condition and contrary to the law.  Let him send me particulars of the cases he said he was aware of: I can assure him of a full and complete investigation.  This is a serious charge and one which should not be treated lightly by him or by me.</P>
    <P>By and large, this third part of the proposal mentioned here is one which I think, in all the circumstances, does not convince us when we come to look at the full facts.  There are grants available to those tenant purchasers. They are the owners.  Their purchase annuity, their weekly repayment for their houses, is only half what their rent had been in the year prior to their taking over.  With that ownership, there is given the concession in outgoings per week to enable them to keep their houses.  Side by side with that, since 1958 there are available the ordinary grants applicable to the ordinary householder throughout the country.  Taking the two things together, a fair effort is being made at present to meet up with the entire situation.  Again, as I said on the differential renting system and on the second part of the motion, on all these parts of the motion and, indeed, in <Col N="697" /> general on housing legislation I should be very glad to get from any member or members or Parties in this House any practicable suggestions which would get full and complete consideration between now and the introduction of the 1962 Housing Bill.</P>

We believe the Dublin differential rent scheme is in need of radical improvement, particularly as regards basic allowances and overtime pay.  We had hoped that the Minister would deal with a very vital matter that had been raised: why is it that the urban tenants have withdrawn from them, if they go to purchase a house, the subsidy which is still available for people in rural areas? That is something that I have never understood, something I consider socially unfair and undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not criticising any intervening speaker.  I am merely explaining this for the benefit of my colleagues.  At the outset I want to say that I accept the amendments moved by Deputy Casey and the addendum moved by Deputy Desmond.  This has been a very interesting debate because it revealed the minds of at <Col N="698" /> least some members on this vital question, a question that is vital at least to 18,000 families in this city, the question of differential rents, among other matters.</P>
      <P>We had a performance from Deputy Sherwin in which the differential rent tenants were variously described as &ldquo;the mob&rdquo;, as &ldquo;liars&rdquo; and their children, particularly their daughters, as &ldquo;touchy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;elegant&rdquo;.  No doubt the language could be considered by some to be entertaining.  It certainly would be considered by me, representing the biggest working class area in Dublin as insulting, untrue and unfair.  I consider that the people of Dublin, those who live in the new housing schemes&mdash;to a great extent, in large numbers they were taken from what were formally the slum areas&mdash; are the hearts blood of this city.  They are decent people and, by and large, they can be depended on to be more truthful in their everyday lives, as well as in matters relating to Dublin Corporation, than other elements of our society.  I do not think, on a matter of this kind, a debate which sinks to the level of abuse of a type such as was used in respect of these people is edifying in any degree.  It is not helpful; I think it is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I brought this matter up not as one with a few short years experience of Dublin Corporation, not as one with any illusions about owning the Corporation or having the sole right to speak on behalf of Corporation tenants, but as one who in a fairly short lifetime has been over 20 years in public life in various public bodies&mdash; county councils, corporation and in this House&mdash;and as one who, as I indicated at the outset, defended the principle of differential rents when it was very difficult to get people here or outside to accept it.  I defended it because I believed in it sincerely and because I was associated with the people who initiated it, particularly with the late James Larkin, who I think was one of the first to bring it to public notice, to suggest it and help to put it into effect.  I believed in it because I thought it was going to do good.  When it was first brought into existence by the Fianna Fáil Government by the first Act of 1948, provision <Col N="699" /> was made to enable differential renting schemes to be introduced by any county council or local authority.  I believed that it was going to help the needy in our population, the less fortunate, the old pensioners, the sick and the widows and that it would not, on the other hand, in any way worsen the already difficult position of the remainder of the working class population.</P>
    <P>But what has happened?  Let any member of this House go to Ballyfermot and try to defend differential rents and see what the reaction of the people is.  I ask are they all wrong and one or two people here right? Are the entire population, the 5,000 families in the area of Ballyfermot, wrong when they say that the differential rents scheme is bad and wrong, that they hate it and dislike this weekly or monthly inquisition into the most intimate details of their lives?  I do not think they are wrong.  I think any law which meets with such a reaction must in itself be wrong.  That is my fundamental objection to this scheme, that it has worked out in practice contrary to all that was hoped for and to my mind it should be abolished altogether.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that my attitude has just been destructive and that I have not made any proposal for an alternative.  I was in a house in Dún Laoghaire Corporation area today.  It was a five-roomed house and the man there tells me they have a graded rent system in the area.  His house has three bedrooms, kitchen, living room and bathroom for 19/- odd per week. There are houses at certain rents and houses somewhat larger have somewhat higher rents&mdash;that is the graded rents system.  This system is also used in other counties I understand, such as Wexford.  That would be better than what we have now.  We have a huge staff in Dublin Corporation who are looking after the files and whose job it is to watch and guard against the possibility of any working class family getting away with anything when it comes to rents.  It is the nearest thing this country has seen to a Gestapo system.  I am not saying <Col N="700" /> that in criticism of the individuals who must do their job; I say it in criticism of the whole system as it has been used.</P>
    <P>I speak on behalf of the people I represent and they rejected this scheme. If the system were even ameliorated and if, as Deputy Dr. Browne suggested, only the father of the family could be levied in respect of rent, there would not be such danger as has been suggested.  There would, in fact, be no danger of a wholesale campaign of deceit and lies as some members of this House have suggested would be the case.  On the contrary, these people, being decent people in the great majority of cases try to tell the truth and to rear their families to tell the truth, and they would work the scheme in an honest, decent fashion but if we are going to operate any scheme on the basis of thinking the population of the country or any part of it are a crowd of liars there is no hope for it.  There is no hope for this Dáil or for this country if that is the attitude and outlook we have.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that in the calculation of the economic rent of the houses I am informed, and informed by a very reliable authority, that the State subsidy given in respect of each house built by the corporation is not taken into account.  In other words the tenants do not get the benefit of the State subsidy.  To what other purpose the subsidy is put I do not know but that is the position, as I am informed of it by high officials of the corporation.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to reply to this debate in the short space of time at my disposal in any kind of detail but there was one thing I noted. Deputy Lemass said he was speaking to an official of Dublin Corporation in the housing allocation department and the official said&mdash;to quote Deputy Lemass: &ldquo;There are five families coming home from Britain today for every one that is emigrating.&rdquo;  The only comment I can make on that is that the official knew the person to whom he was talking.  That is the only answer.  It is very difficult to understand how anybody could believe that.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister has not <Col N="701" /> seen fit to accept the idea of an 18-year remission of rents for S.D.A. beneficiaries.  I think they are people who should be encouraged and there is no doubt that financial considerations always create thorny problems.  I touched lightly upon one solution to that and I hope that in the future the only real answer will be sought out. The interest rates operated by the private banks&mdash;and they are private banks which are there to serve their own private purposes&mdash;create an intolerable load for local authorities and for people trying to purchase their own homes under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, so much so that if somebody had a house built for £1,500, over a period of twenty-five years £4,500 would have to be paid for it though the cost originally was £1,500 and less than that amount of loan was afforded by the banks.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister did not see fit to take active steps.  He did, I must say, try to approach it in as reasonable a manner as he could from his own point of view but that is not enough to meet the terms of the motion.  He suggested that when tenants of labourers' cottages become owners they should assume the same responsibilities as other owners of property.  How can he compare a labourer, a farm worker or a road worker living in a labourer's cottage with other property owners?  He lives&mdash;barely lives&mdash;from one week to another and is not in a position to save money.  Property owners as a general rule become property owners because they have a certain amount of money, a little more than is required to meet the everyday needs of life and for that reason the propertied classes are usually privileged people in a better position to deal with repairs than the tenants of county council cottages.  The tenants of county council cottages have no chance whatever of dealing with repairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there was a grant of which a tenant might avail to reconstruct his house but is it not true that there is a limit, a certain figure for repairs?  In other words unless the amount of the repairs exceeds £50, I think, the grant will not be made <Col N="702" /> available.  The amount required in cases such as this usually runs about £20 to £30.  Even if the Minister could help by reducing that limit to something approaching the sum the average tenant would be seeking, in a certain number of years we might have got somewhere but we seem to have got nowhere with the motion.  However it has given us an opportunity to say what is in our minds and I hope the future will bring something better. As far as I am concerned, I shall continue to press this matter and I am sorry that the Minister has not seen fit to accept the terms of the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that, as a practical step to stimulate increased production through the improvement of the fertility of our land by badly needed drainage schemes and at the same time to help to relieve unemployment in rural areas, the necessary moneys to put the Local Authorities (Works) Act into operation should be provided immediately.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I regret the fact that the movers of the other motions happened to be caught on the wrong foot, so to speak. I hope they will forgive me on this occasion for taking advantage of the opportunity available to me to move what I consider to be a very important motion for rural Ireland.  I think that all the Deputies, who had motions on the Order Paper and whose motions have now dropped to the bottom of the Order Paper, will agree with me when I say that the subject of drainage in rural Ireland is of greater importance today than any other subject that could be discussed in this House.</P>
      <P>Deputies on both sides of the House who are members of local authorities for the past four to five years have listened to deputations and requests from the farming community to have something done to drain the fertile lands in various parts of the country.  Deputies in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour, Deputies who represent rural Ireland, have agreed to motions passed at local authority meetings that it was absolutely essential to have the Local Authorities (Works) Act restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in order to give the Government an opportunity of hearing the views of the Deputies of their own Party and the Opposition groups that <Col N="704" /> Deputy Dr. Browne and I decided to table this motion.  When a similar motion came before this House a few years ago, the then Government, composed of the very same group, the Fianna Fáil Party, pointed out that they found a considerable number of faults with that Act.  They did not deny that a great deal of good work had been done in many parts of the country but they did find fault with the work done in certain areas.  They found that there was a faulty section of the Bill which did not cater for maintenance work afterwards.</P>
    <P>I agree that they were sincere in this and that they believed at the time that a great deal of wastage of money took place but what have they done in the meantime?  What steps have they taken over the years either to improve the Local Authorities (Works) Act as it stood or to replace it with something that was the product of their own genius?  To my mind, they have done absolutely nothing to improve conditions by drainage works in rural Ireland in the past four or five years. They have been content merely to criticise the work done under the legislation passed by this House.  They took no step whatever to alter the Act or improve it in any way, or to bring in fresh legislation that would, perhaps, help to ameliorate drainage conditions in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I know that in my own constituency of County Roscommon the situation is dreadfully serious at the moment.  I know, as does the Minister for Local Government, that excellent work was carried out in that county over the years under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The other Deputies in my constituency who were members of the local authority are in full agreement and will, I am sure, support me when I challenge contradiction by any Minister in saying that there was no wastage of public funds under the Local Authorities (Works) Act in County Roscommon.</P>
    <P>Yet, in spite of agreement among my colleagues from County Roscommon that the work was excellent work, we are told today that the Local Authorities (Works) Act produced a great deal of wastage expenditure and, consequently, <Col N="705" /> the Government had no option but to suspend the Act.  What has happened in many parts of the country?  The local authorities had embarked upon drainage schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act. Some of these schemes were partially completed and some of them were almost completed.  Many of those schemes have been in exactly the same position as they were in when the Local Authorities (Work) Act was suspended.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, a great deal of the wastage of money took place as a result of the suspension before schemes in operation were completed.  It may be said by the Minister that in a number of special cases extra grants from other sources were made available to local authorities to complete a very limited number of such schemes as I have referred to.  That may be, but if it was possible to allow a number of these schemes to be completed under, say, the Sanitary Services Act, is it not quite logical for me to suggest to the Minister and the Government that the scope of that Act should be widened to include other drainage works in various rural areas?</P>
    <P>Regretfully, I have come to the conclusion that so far as rural Ireland and the small farmers of rural Ireland are concerned, the Government have little or no interest in their welfare.  If they had they would alter their system of priority with regard to expenditure and give first preference to what is described as the backbone of this community.  I am afraid that all that the small farmers and rural dwellers are getting from the Government is a bit of lip service and praise.  When it comes down to practical proof of the Government's intention to look after their interests, to keep them on the land and enable them to rear their families in reasonable comfort, one of the first demands on the Exchequer should be an allocation for the carrying out of much needed drainage works all over this country.  I could give examples of how money was spent by this Government, money which in my opinion, was wasted.  Far more money was wasted on other activities and projects than was ever wasted on the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, I asked the Minister for Transport and Power a question relative to the establishment of a national helicopter service.  The question has been asked on innumerable occasions because, as far as I am aware, we are the only civilised country in the world that has not got a helicopter available for rescue work or any other kind of work.  The Minister in his reply indicated that helicopters were unable to work in high winds or in bad visibility. The unfortunate loss of the <i>Halronnell</i> off the coast of Ireland recently with the loss of three lives and the subsequent rescue by helicopter of three of the sailors seems to indicate that this is a very necessary adjunct to our services.  The Minister indicated in his reply that it was a fortuitous circumstance that it was possible to carry out this rescue.</P>
      <P>It is fair that I should give the House the facts as to what happened in the case of the <i>Halronnell</i> and Deputies may then decide whether a helicopter service would or would not be of value for rescue work here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 6 p.m. on a Sunday, the <i>Halronnell</i> went ashore on the Black Rock off the Wexford coast.  No news was conveyed to the lifeboat crews in Rosslare harbour until 12.50 on the following morning, due to the fact that there is no emergency receiving service anywhere on that coast.  The lifeboat put out in very bad weather and went to the wreck, getting there many hours after the ship had gone ashore.  While they were there, the wreck broke in two.  As the Minister indicated in his reply, the front part of the wreck was left on the rock and some of the crew were left there.  The lifeboat crew did everything in their power to effect a rescue, even at the risk of being dashed to pieces on the rocks.  They then went away and came back at dawn, about 8 a.m. They were absolutely certain that there was life aboard the wreck and they indicated that the only hope of getting the people off was by helicopter.  We <Col N="707" /> have no helicopter available in this country.  They transmitted the message to the <i>Macha</i> which was lying alongside at this stage.  The <i>Macha</i> transmitted the message to another quarter&mdash;I believe to Haulbowline&mdash; and subsequently the Royal Naval Helicopter Service in Cornwall was contacted and a helicopter appeared at 12.50, which was 24 hours after the ship had gone ashore.  For three hours of that period, three men had been in the forecastle, or what was left of the ship, on the rocks, facing almost certain death.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his reply that in high wind or misty weather, helicopters cannot function.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that it was blowing practically a full gale. I have that from the lifeboat man himself.  Within a quarter of an hour, the helicopter rescued the three men and dropped them aboard the other lifeboat which was then standing by, the <i>Kilmore Quay,</i> and they were brought ashore.</P>
    <P>In the light of these facts, does it not seem reasonable to suggest that this country is entitled to a helicopter service and that the people who sail or fly around our shores are entitled to the protection that a modern contrivance such as this places at their disposal?</P>
    <P>In the second part of his reply, the Minister went on to say that the availability of helicopters for search and rescue work in Britain and elsewhere in Europe arises incidentally from a primary military requirement. I do not think that has any bearing on the situation, except in so far as it was extremely fortunate for us in this and other cases that we have been able to call upon the British and to get a helicopter.  We must be mindful of the fact that we must wait a considerable period before that service can be made available, as was evidenced so tragically in this case where three men lost their lives.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that he did not think it would be justifiable to expend £200,000 on capital and £100,000 a year operating cost.  I do not know where the Minister gets his <Col N="708" /> figures.  I do not know if he will be able to justify these figures.  Nor do I know if the Minister is aware of the fact that an offer was made to him or to his Department, and that officials were interviewed in his Department, to provide a service for £25,000 a year plus £12 flying cost per hour in the air.  That offer was made to the Minister by an Irish company, Celtic Helicopter Services.  They have offered to have two aircraft available on a 24 hours basis, one in Dublin and the other at either Galway or Shannon Airport, to have a round-the-clock service there available and to have three pilots available so that there would be no risk that they would not be able to go into action, when and where required.  Therefore, I do not follow the Minister's figures that it would cost £200,000 on capital and £100,000 a year for the maintenance of the service.  But, whether that is the case or not, if it is necessary to lay out £200,000, is it a tremendous amount of money to spend to protect the lives of sailors and airmen off our coast or to bring sick people from lighthouses or to transport people to hospital from remote districts?  That service was offered to the Minister.  I should like him, when replying, to tell me if that is the case and, if it is, why he refused to take it.</P>
    <P>The whole text of the Minister's reply to this question, which was asked by several Deputies, is absolutely unworthy of him.  I do not know if he wrote it himself or if it was written by advisers for him.  Whoever wrote it knew absolutely nothing about the facts.  It is a very serious state of affairs that a Minister should say in this House that this is something that happened but that may never happen again.  How does the Minister know we will not have a full gale tonight or tomorrow night?  How does he know that a ship will not go ashore in similar circumstances?  Is the Minister, who is responsible for seeing that services are made available immediately for those in danger off our coasts, satisfied that the existing services are what they should be?</P>
    <P>The case of this ship was wrong from the word &ldquo;go.&rdquo;  Why should these people have had to be stuck on the <Col N="709" /> rock from 6 o'clock on that Sunday evening until 1 o'clock in the morning before any help reached them?  When help did reach them, the lifeboat crew, with the utmost gallantry, dropped anchor and even allowed their boat to drift astern at the risk of their lives, and they were only saved at the last moment by keeping off the rock.  Why was it when they asked for a helicopter, even though we have not got a service ourselves, they had to wait four or five hours before a helicopter was on the spot?  Whose business is it to produce the helicopter service?  Does the Minister maintain, as I am led to believe from his reply, that a helicopter service is not necessary, that it is not desirable or even able to do its job?  Has the Minister been properly advised?  I think not.  Whoever advised the Minister on this question and whoever is responsible for this answer &mdash;he was not directly responsible for the phraseology himself&mdash;showed an absolute lack of knowledge of the circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine for people to sit in offices and work out things on paper. There is a definite obligation on this country to provide a rescue service in case this set of circumstances arises again.  I hope the Minister will at least consider what I have said.  If he will consider the offer which I have been told has been made to him, of a helicopter service at such a moderate charge to the State, he will be doing far better than listening to the views he may be getting from people sitting in warm offices while lives are being lost at sea for want of a rescue service. I ask the Minister to give this matter his full consideration.</P>
    <P>Before I give way to my colleague, Deputy Ryan, may I just say that I regret having to raise this matter on the Adjournment?  It is the second time in ten years that I have raised anything on the Adjournment.  I am doing so because I feel what happened off the coast of Wexford should never have happened.  Not only should those three men who were rescued by the helicopter, which flew in at extreme range to effect the rescue, be alive, but also those three who died should also be alive.</P>

      <P>We should be grateful to Deputy Esmonde for raising this matter.  It is quite clear from our national newspapers that there is widespread public support for a helicopter service.  We should feel ashamed that we pay such a small contribution to the Lifeboat Institution which has saved so many Irish lives.  Proportionately this country pays an extremely small contribution towards the Lifeboat Institution and were it not for the fact that our neighbours are prepared to support and pay for that Institution on our shores, we would have next to nothing in the way of lifesaving services for the people who sail the seas around our coasts.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that there is far more British shipping in our seas than Irish shipping, but I think most of the rescues carried out by life saving services around our coasts are in respect of Irish citizens who simply move a short distance from the land, and crews of Irish trawlers and Irish-based trawlers.  It is a national disgrace that we do not provide more funds for the Institution.  Since that is the situation, there is a moral, national and social obligation on us to provide at least an Irish-based helicopter service.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde has correctly challenged the Minister's figures. One of the difficulties in relation to the provision of a helicopter service is that there is really an inter-departmental row involved. No Department of State wants to take on the responsibility because it cannot justify the maintenance of the service because of its particular departmental functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Defence has not got sufficient military use for it.  But the Minister for Justice found it useful for a traffic survey and we were glad to learn it cost nothing.  It was found to be invaluable, so far as the traffic problems were concerned.  It is pertinent to say it might be of considerable value in the prevention of unfortunate incidents of a military character along a border which we hope will not be there much longer.  Certainly a helicopter would have great police work value.  It would also be of assistance in fire-fighting where not only can <Col N="711" /> property be saved but in many cases lives saved.</P>
    <P>A helicopter can be of use in the agricultural sphere.  It can be used for spraying and in the inspection of crops. Surely it would be of use in fishery protection?  It could be of use in various kinds of industrial and commercial activity.  When the matter is examined one finds that a helicopter could be used all the year round for various purposes.  It is about time our Departments settled this row about who is responsible for it.  What the country needs is a couple of helicopters based at the most appropriate places.  It is about time that was done, and that all this red tape, the inter-departmental row, the Ministerial jealousies and the niggardliness on the part of the Minister for Finance, was abolished.  Then we could have what other countries regard as a necessity, a helicopter service available for important occasions such as lifesaving, and industrial, agricultural and military use.</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to say that there are no Ministerial jealousies, no red tape within the Departments and no conflicts in the minds of the Inter-Departmental Committee, which included experts from the Irish Air Service and the Naval Service, with regard to the character of their report to the Government that six helicopters would be required for rescue service and the cost would be £200,000 capital and an annual cost of £100,000.  It is quite extraordinary for Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde to suggest that there was something unworthy in the character of officials of the Department or myself in regard to our decision in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say unequivocally that none of the three men who unfortunately lost their lives would have been saved if a helicopter service had been available off the coast of Wexford. Secondly, I want to make it clear that it was not blowing a full gale when the British Naval helicopter operated.  The speed of the wind was from 30 to 35 knots, which is just <Col N="712" /> within a helicopter's performance. Thirdly, I want to make it clear that the wireless apparatus of the vessel itself had broken down and anything in connection with the events had had nothing to do with radio reception facilities in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The question was raised about an offer by private helicopter service.  On the 3rd February, 1961 discussions took place in regard to this matter. The proposal was made to base one helicopter at Shannon at a cost to the State of £18,000 per year.  The company was informed, and they accepted, that rescue operations would not be effective with one or even two helicopters stationed at Shannon.  So the fact we were offered one at an annual subsidy of £18,000 does not have any bearing on the general question that we would need six operating on a basis of a 24-hour service with men specially trained for air rescue operations.</P>
    <P>I have already stated the facts in regard to the use of helicopters in the case of wrecks that have taken place. This is the first occasion on which a helicopter proved to be useful.  It was only through an act of Providence that the wreckage on the rock remained together sufficiently long during the night so that, when daylight came and when for the first time it was possible for a helicopter to be used under any circumstances because the wind abated, the helicopter's services were usefully employed in that connection.</P>
    <P>I should add that in the case of the unfortunate crew member who lost his life on the raft he could not have been rescued and that one helicopter alone stationed there could not have found the raft.  The search would have required the services of other helicopters and vessels and the helicopter could not have eventually found the raft because at that time it was far beyond the range of an Irish helicopter operating from the Wexford coast.</P>
    <P>In regard to the various miscellaneous uses to which helicopters could be put, we had a complete inquiry into that in which various associations, Government Departments and companies were asked how far they could make use of a helicopter.  The replies <Col N="713" /> were most disappointing both in regard to spraying, surveying and all the other various uses in which helicopters play a part in other countries. I have asked Aer Rianta Teo. to make a further inquiry and to see whether, since 1957, some of these companies changed their minds, whether in relation to our advancing economy we could find some commercial use for helicopters for various purposes.</P>
    <P>I would be quite willing to advocate the expenditure of £200,000 of capital and £100,000 annual expenditure for any life saving service if I could see the results would be productive. On the basis of past experience, as I said, I would not like to recommend the spending of this money. There would be many other ways in which a sum of money of that dimension could be spent, both in regard to preventive measures for the saving of life and measures in connection with road safety.  I can think of half a dozen ways in which such a large sum could be far better spent because of the experience we have had up to now.</P>
    <P>My Department is perfectly prepared to engage in innovations of any kind if they are going to be useful. We insist that our airports have extremely expensive equipment designed to increase the safety of passengers arriving or departing from our airports. We do not take a restrictive attitude towards the purchase of very expensive navigational aids of all kinds. We insist that Aer Lingus should continue their tradition of the most meticulous maintenance of their aircraft. We do everything reasonably possible in connection with the life-saving service around our coasts to make sure it is effective and efficient.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> I want to close by saying that beyond all doubt rescue service is international in character.  We are not the least ashamed of the fact that the ships and aeroplanes of other countries&mdash; and, therefore, in our case largely those of Great Britain&mdash;help us in rescue operations.  Rescue operations everywhere are recognised as an international service in which everyone engages. I want to pay a tribute once more to the British Navy for the part they played in this rescue operation.  I have conveyed my thanks and the thanks of my Department to the First Lord of the Admiralty in that connection.</P>
    <P>This matter must be looked at internationally. Vessels of every nation are passing around our coasts.  We are only too glad to have other countries come to our rescue and we, on our part, if ever we had the opportunity, would be glad to assist them.  That applies of course to the corvettes of the Naval Service and to any of our commercial aircraft which might in the course of their journeys be able to divert in order to help in rescue operations.</P>
    <P>As I said, there is nothing restrictive in our attitude towards this matter. We are simply facing the actual facts.  This is the first occasion on which a helicopter based in this country could have been of any service for rescue operation and we would need, not one, but six if they were to be of any use.  As a result the cost, to my mind, is beyond what could be considered reasonable under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23rd November, 1961.</P>
