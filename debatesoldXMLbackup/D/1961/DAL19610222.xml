      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what effect the decision by the <Col N="676" /> E.F.T.A. countries to advance the tariff reduction of 10 per cent. to 1st July, 1961 instead of 1st January, 1962 is likely to have on the competitive position of Irish industrial and agricultural exports in the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a Question addressed to me on 24th February last, I indicated, in general terms, the way in which our industrial and agricultural exports to Britain might be affected by the establishment of the European Free Trade Association.  I then stated that, as tariffs on industrial goods entering Britain from other members of the Association are progressively reduced, we must expect our industrial exports to meet progressively market from those countries.  I also explained the position in relation to agricultural exports.</P>
      <P>The recent decision of the EFTA Council to advance by six months the next tariff reduction, which, under the Convention, was due to take place on 1st January, 1962, means that industrial exports to Britain from the other members of the Association will enjoy the advantage of this particular reduction six months earlier than would otherwise be the case.  The decision does not, however, involve any change in the régime applicable to imports of agricultural products to Britain from those sources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that in the Six Northern Counties people in many towns and villages, whose population seek reunion with the Motherland, are left without industries or work and forced to emigrate; and if he will make a strong protest to the Six County Government to secure equal justice and rights to all its citizens particularly in view of the action of the Irish delegation in the United Nations in defending the rights of oppressed peoples in other lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen press and other reports concerning the economic situation existing in the Six Counties.  I am aware that the economic development problems of the stronger competition in the British <Col N="677" /> area as a whole are felt particularly in many towns and villages where the population is predominantly nationalist, and also by nationalists in other areas, and that this section of the population has been subjected to various forms of discrimination.  I gravely deplore this fact, and, if any action of mine could lead to the cessation of such discrimination, I would most willingly take it.  However, I do not think that protests to the Northern Ireland Government would do any good.  At the same time, there is, I believe, a large and increasingly influential volume of public opinion in the North which likewise deplores the present discriminatory practices, both as wrong in themselves and as likely to bring discredit on those responsible for them.  It is by encouraging this more enlightened tendency within the Six Counties that prospects of an improvement in the situation can best be assisted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will indicate to the Dáil what foreseeable circumstances he had in mind when he stated in Dundalk that it might not be possible to hold a general election until Spring, 1962; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose taking Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware of the decision of the High Court on Monday last declaring certain provisions of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1959, to be unconstitutional.  That decision is, of course, open to appeal to the Supreme Court and indeed the learned High Court Judge expressed relief at the probability that this decision would be reviewed by the highest legal tribunal. The Government are considering whether an appeal is to be taken.</P>
      <P>Until a decision has been taken whether or not there should be an appeal, I do not wish to make any comment on the decision of the High Court.  I should stress, however, that the provisions embodied in the Act were enacted in the belief, which I for one still hold, that they were warranted under the Constitution, and that if other considerations did not enter into the matter an appeal would certainly be taken.</P>
      <P>In arriving at the decision on the question of an appeal, the Government have to take account of two considerations. On the one hand, it is desirable that questions of the constitutionality of Acts of the Oireachtas should be finally determined by the Supreme Court, and on the other hand, there is the possibility that the taking of an appeal might necessitate that the life of the Dáil might have to be prolonged for more than five years from the date of its first meeting, viz., beyond 19th March, 1962, which is a course which I should be most reluctant to contemplate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an appeal is taken, there can be no general election until the decision <Col N="679" /> of the Supreme Court is known.  If it should happen that the decision of the Supreme Court should be against the Act, it would then be necessary to introduce legislation revising the constituencies afresh and before an election could be held, new polling schemes would have to be made and various other administrative arrangements carried out, all of which would take time.</P>
    <P>There is the further consideration that under Article 16. 2. 3º of the Constitution, it may be held that in any revision made after April 9th next, the population figures to be considered should be those ascertained at the census to be taken on that date. The provisional figures from that Census will not be available for some months, and this would mean delaying the legislation so that the prolongation of the life of Dáil Éireann beyond the period of five years which I have mentioned would be almost inevitable. Deputies will understand that a decision on the course to be adopted must be arrived at after a careful consideration of all aspects of the matter, and that for this reason, I am not in a position to say today what action will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of a decision being taken between now and to-morrow, may I assume that whatever decision is ultimately taken by the Government will be communicated to Dáil Éireann?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to forecast the possibility of a decision being reached before to-morrow.  I think I am correct in saying that an appeal may be lodged within 21 days, but for reasons relating to the time factor which I have mentioned, I would certainly be concerned to ensure that there would be no avoidable delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>The reply which I gave to a Question on 8th February, 1961, was based on information then available to the Government regarding sales of agricultural land to non-nationals in a recent period of about 12 months.</P>
      <P>In that reply I did not refer to statistics, either for a period of ten years or for any other period, as the Deputies have inferred.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on that occasion, the Government are keeping the position under close attention, and it has been made clear that, if developments should threaten the public interest, by frustrating land-settlement policy or otherwise, immediate consideration would be given to the adoption of any necessary corrective measures.</P>

I would like it to be known that while there is no special legislation permitting the use of the eyes of deceased persons for corneal grafting, this does not mean that it is illegal to do so.  I am advised that a surgeon can lawfully remove the eyes of a deceased person provided he has the consent of the next-of-kin.  Furthermore, while a person cannot by his will dispose of his body or any part of it for therapeutic purposes, nevertheless there is no legal barrier to the implementing, with the consent of the next-of-kin, of a wish to this effect expressed by the person before his death.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to a report in a Sunday journal of 22nd January alleging that he was responsible for the delay in equipping St. Luke's Hospital with a cobalt bomb to be used in the treatment of cancer, and ascribing a certain statement <Col N="683" /> to an official in the Department of Health and a further statement to a member of the Cancer Association of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted a report which appeared in a Sunday newspaper on the 22nd January last. The allegations of delay in the provision of a cobalt therapy unit which the report contained are entirely unfounded and a statement in this matter ascribed to an officer of my Department was in fact never made.</P>
      <P>On my direction, a letter was sent to the newspaper concerned stating that the report was inaccurate and that I regarded as contrary to the traditions of Irish journalism a report presented in such a sensational and tendentious manner which must have had the effect of intensifying the anxiety of persons suffering from cancer, and their relatives.  The newspaper published this letter, but omitted the sentence containing my views, with which I am sure every Deputy will agree, on the undesirable features of this type of report.</P>
      <P>The report also contained an allegation that a statement had been made by a member of the Cancer Association imputing delay to the Government. A letter from the Cancer Association denying that any such statement was made by a member was published in the newspaper on 5th instant but to this was appended a comment repeating the original falsehood in even more flagrant terms. I have ascertained that the Cancer Association then, through their solicitors, pursued the matter.  As a result of this, the newspaper published on 19th instant an admission that their original statement, repeated notwithstanding a denial by the Association, was untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I should put on record the sensational manner in which the newspaper concerned presented this story to its readers.  It first published its allegations on January 22nd.  These were printed over three columns under sensational headlines, splashed across the whole page.  On Sunday, February <Col N="684" /> 5th the paper published a further three-column story headed &ldquo;Mr. MacEntee&mdash;And the Cobalt Bomb&rdquo;. In the course of it, the mutilated version of the letter from my private secretary was printed over his signature, but with no mark to indicate that portion of it had been excised from it by the newspaper.  It was not until last Sunday that in a relatively minute paragraph the newspaper concerned made even a partial retraction of its statements.  The incident exemplifies how difficult it is to nail a lie.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether a medical service card is valid in all parts of the health authority area in which the card is issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A medical services card issued by a health authority under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, entitles the holder, and his dependants, if any, to free general practitioner services from the district medical officer of the dispensary district in which he resides.  If, however, a person covered by a medical services card goes to reside either permanently or temporarily in another dispensary district in the functional area of the same health authority, he is entitled to free general practitioner services from the district medical officer of that district.</P>
      <P>The foregoing deals with the person, entitled to avail of the district medical officer's services, who is permanently resident in one dispensary district or who goes to live, permanently or temporarily, in another district under the same health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also provision in the regulations to cover the case of a person who is entitled to, and needs, general practitioner services but who does not possess a medical card.  In that case, an authorised person, e.g., a member of the health authority or an assistance officer, may give the patient a direction in writing to the district medical officer to give that person the necessary medical attention.  This provision, while normally intended to apply to a person permanently resident in the district who did not apply for a medical card, <Col N="686" /> would operate also in the case of a person temporarily resident in the district, even though he normally resided in the functional area of another health authority.</P>
    <P>Finally, the duties of a district medical officer require him, in case of urgency, to afford medical care to a patient not covered by a medical services card or a direction in writing from an authorised person.  In such a case, however, the district medical officer is entitled to require a direction to be presented to him thereafter by or on behalf of such person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that that reply must be read to be fully understood.  Perhaps he would comment on this.  Take, for example, the holder of a medical service card who, on a visit to another part of a local authority, becomes suddenly ill or has an accident.  Is such person entitled under the regulations to free medical treatment from the dispensary doctor in the new dispensary district?</P>

The contribution of 18/- referred to is the amount charged in respect of persons in regular employment who are normally excluded from the scheme but are admitted in exceptional circumstances such as low wages, illness or other misfortune or where there are more than six eligible children.  It is clear, therefore, that the charge referred to does not relate <Col N="690" /> to poor persons.  In fact, poor persons who are in need of assistance under the Scheme and are in receipt of home assistance are eligible for footwear free of charge.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the instruction which issued to the public assistance authorities, setting out the minimum contributions to be charged, was to ensure that the best use would be made of the available funds for the benefit of the poorer classes of beneficiary.</P>

      <P>Temporary postmen are recruited from persons registered at the employment exchanges.  Applicants for these posts are not required to pay any application fee.  The Deputy is apparently referring to the open competition currently being held by the Civil Service Commissioners for pensionable positions as postman.</P>
      <P>It has for many years been the Commissioners' policy&mdash;with which I am in full agreement&mdash;to charge application fees at all open competitions held by them.  Not only do the fees reduce the charge falling on the taxpayer in respect of the expenses of the Commissioners but they serve to keep candidature within reasonable bounds and so avoid extra expense and delay in making appointments.  It would not be feasible to discriminate on the lines suggested by the Deputy in favour of any particular group of candidates at the competition.</P>

      <i>(c)</i>  The duty on watches, movements, etc., was completely revised and the particulars given relate to all imports liable to the amended heading.  In fact an overall drop in duty is anticipated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As the reply to this Question is rather lengthy and detailed, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate the desired information in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I have interpreted the Deputy's request for information on scholarships granted for each of the last two years as relating to the 1959/60 and 1960/61 academic years.  Details of the awards for 1958/59 and the significant particulars of those for 1959/60 were furnished in reply to similar Questions on 11th June, 1959, and 17th February, 1960, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Scholarships Exchange (Ireland and the United <Col N="702" /> States of America) Act, 1957, An Bord Scoláireachtaí Cómalairte made available, in respect of the 1959/60 and 1960/61 academic years, grants for the financing of studies, research, instruction, teaching, lecturing and other educational activities:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)of Irish citizens in schools, universities, institutions of higher learning and other suitable institutions located in the United States of America;</P>
    <P>(b)of citizens of the United States of America in universities located in the State.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with the United States Board of Foreign Scholarships, An Bord selected students, professors, research scholars and other suitable persons for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Except for the specialist grants (including those in the field of economics and management) the awards by An Bord to Irish citizens were in respect of a full academic year.  In awarding grants to Irish citizens An Bord gave preference to qualified applicants in the fields of Pure and Applied Science, American Studies, Humanities, and Theatre Arts.  In the case of the specialist grants awarded in the field of economics and management, executives in commerce, industry, trade unions and related fields were eligible to make application.</P>
    <P>All the awards of An Bord made provision for return travel expenses. Except in the case of economics and management grantees An Bord did not provide for the tuition and maintenance expenses of Irish citizens in the U.S.A., such expenses being met from American sources.  The awards to the American grantees also provided for maintenance and incidental expenses arising out of their academic pursuits. Tuition fees were additionally provided for in the case of the American student grantees.</P>
    <P>The Report of An Bord for the year 1959/60, which was laid on the Table of the House on the 20th of this month contains the desired information in regard to (a) the number of Irish students who studied in the United States of America during 1959/60; (b) the number <Col N="703" /> of American students who studied in Ireland during the same period; (c) the universities attended; and (d) their particular fields of study.</P>
    <P>The requisite information in respect of the year 1960/61 is as follows. Under the 1960/61 Programme of An Bord three Irish research students in the field of Pure and Applied Science and seven Irish economics and management grantees have studied or are studying in the U.S.A.  The research students are studying at Fordham University, New York; Bethesda Health Center, Maryland; and University of Illinois.  Their fields of specialisation are: Physics, Cardiology and Bio-Chemistry.  The economics and management grantees studied or are studying at: the University of Chicago; Northwestern University, Illinois; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland; Columbia University, New York; and University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.</P>
    <P>Eight American citizens have been awarded grants under the 1960/61 Programme of An Bord.  Five of these grantees are currently here as lecturers; three of them are here as students.  The lecturers are at the University Colleges of Dublin, Cork and Galway and at Trinity College, Dublin.  Their fields of specialisation are: Mathematics, Business Administration, Dairy Science, English Literature and Philosophy. The American student grantees are studying at University College, Dublin and Trinity College, Dublin. One of the American student grantees is studying English Literature.  The other two student grantees are studying Anglo-Irish Literature.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to prevent those demonstrators from marching to the Belgian Embassy was taken by the officer in charge of the Garda Síochána on the spot, in exercise of his right and duty to take such action as he deemed necessary for the preservation of the peace and of law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the decision was one for him&mdash; as it necessarily must be in such a case &mdash;I may say that I have no hesitation whatsoever in expressing my conviction <Col N="711" /> that he was entirely justified and that, had he permitted the demonstrators to march to the Belgian Embassy, and had damage to person or property resulted, he would have left himself open to severe censure, all the more so since the demonstration had already by that time become disorderly, as the newspaper reports clearly show, despite the efforts of some of its members to restore order and to adhere to what had originally been the declared intention of a peaceful demonstration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that this demonstration passed through many of the main streets of the city and had not behaved in a disorderly way?  It was a peaceful protest.  Is it not further a fact that members of the Garda were responsible for kicking a number of the delegation while they were on the ground and that, at least, one of the delegation was hit in the face by a member of the Garda? While I accept that disorderly scenes should not be permitted, does the Minister not agree that the right to assemble and protest should be preserved in Ireland if we are to maintain the essential fibre of democratic practices in this regard?  Is it not a fact that the Gardaí provoked any sort of conflict that may have taken place, that it was they who were responsible for it?  Has the Minister no reply?  He is shielding the Gardaí.  It is unworthy of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

      <P>The Garda Síochána, of course, have not only a right but a duty to use such force as may reasonably be necessary in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>Within the last two days, I received a complaint from the Afro-Asian Association of an incident in which one of their members was alleged to have been assaulted by the Garda Síochána in an alley off Lower Mount Street.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The routing of the flights to and from Dublin Airport is dictated by runway orientation, location of navigational and landing aids, the convergence of the principal routes on the east coast and the relatively close proximity of two military aerodromes at Baldonnel and Gormanston. As far as possible, the air companies avoid flying over built-up areas but there are many occasions on which it is necessary to do so.</P>

      <P>The air companies are given instructions and go as far as they can to avoid excessive noise.  The arrangements for their rate of climb and other technical matters are taken into account and every effort is made to avoid excessive noise but it is unavoidable in certain circumstances. For example, the lengthening of the main runway causes a greater number of flights to proceed over the Whitehall area than is usually the case.  When the construction is completed, the noise will diminish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £200,140 be granted to defray the charge, which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other expenses in connection with Housing, and Miscellaneous Grants.</P>
      <P>Deputies will observe from the text of the Supplementary Estimate, as circulated, that it comprises two items, one £200,000 for housing grants and the other a small item of £140 being the State's portion of the liability under a statutory guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the main item, the voted provision for housing grants for the year 1960/61 was £2,095,000.  Of this sum, £1,943,468 had been expended at the 31st January, 1961 (allowing for credits by way of refunds, etc.), leaving a balance of £151,532 to meet <Col N="724" /> commitments maturing before the end of the financial year.  In view of the present rate of the demand for payments, this balance would be insufficient to discharge claims arising before 31st March next, and to meet the estimated deficiency a supplementary sum of £200,000 is now being sought.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the excess expenditure (£130,000) arises on new house grants. The upward trend in the allocations for these grants in the year 1959-60 has continued during the current financial year.  The present indications are that the allocations for this year will amount to about 4,700 as compared with a figure of 3,868 for the financial year 1959/60.</P>
    <P>Apart from the very substantial increase in the number of new house grant allocations, payments for all types of grants have shown a tendency to mature more speedily than in former years.</P>
    <P>It is satisfactory to record that the generous assistance available for private housing operations&mdash;including the provision of private water supplies and sewerage services&mdash;has in the past two years greatly accelerated the demand for these grants.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the item of £140 in the Supplementary Estimate is to enable recoupment to be made by my Department towards the expenditure of a housing authority in meeting a guarantee under a scheme made by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1956, under which they guaranteed part of an advance made by a building society for the purchase of a house.</P>
    <P>The guarantee given by the housing authority extended only to that part of the advance which would not have been forthcoming from the society in the absence of the guarantee.  The amount paid by the housing authority in pursuance of the guarantee was two-thirds of the loss incurred by the building society concerned.  The sum of £140 to be recouped to the housing authority by my Department represents 50 per cent. of the payment so made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is <Col N="725" /> undesirable that this Vote should be sought until we know exactly the amount which will be required at 31st March.  The Minister says the main item on this Vote for 1960/61 amounts to £2,095,000: &ldquo;Of this sum, £1,943,468 had been expended at the 31st January, 1961 .... leaving a balance of £151,532 to meet commitments maturing before the end of the financial year.&rdquo;  We would like to know what are the commitments to be met out of this sum of £151,532.  Has the entire sum been committed or what is the Minister's estimate of the commitments at 31st March, next?  If there is this sum still to credit in the Department surely the Minister should await an estimate of the exact amount which he will require up to 31st March before coming to the House.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister states that it is satisfactory to record that the generous assistance available for private housing operations including provision of private water supplies and sewerage services has greatly accelerated the demand for these grants.  One would think, listening to Fianna Fáil speakers, that there has been a great upward surge in the building of houses since they took office four years ago. It is no harm to put the facts on record. As reported in Volume 180, in reply to a Parliamentary Question the Minister, on the 29th March, 1960, said that in the year 1954 local authorities built 5,697 houses and private enterprise built 4,793, a total of 10,490 houses.  In 1955, 4,143 houses were built by local authorities and 4,873 by private enterprise, a total of 9,016. Then, in what Deputy Briscoe and others wish to refer to as the bad year, 1956, 4,218 houses were built by local authorities and 5,859 by private enterprise&mdash;a total of 10,077.  In the three years of the inter-Party Government 29,583 houses were built by local authorities and private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil came into power in 1957 and in that year 4,123 houses were built by local authorities and 3,925 by private enterprise, a total of 8,048. That was the first year of the present Government.  In their second year the total number of local authority houses <Col N="726" /> fell to 2,033 and the total number of houses built by private enterprise fell to 2,904&mdash;1,000 fewer than in the previous year&mdash;giving a total of 4,937.  In 1959, 2,399 houses were built by local authorities and private enterprise built 3,066, making a total of 5,465.  In the three years of the inter-Party Government, 29,583 houses were built and in the first three years of the present Government, 18,450.  In other words, there was a fall of 11,000 in the three years of the present Government.  That is something we should remember.</P>
    <P>I prophesied at the time&mdash;evidently, I was justified&mdash;that there would be a tapering-off in the building of houses. The Minister, as a matter of fact, in introducing his Estimate last year said much the same thing.  He confirmed what I had said three years earlier.  I am glad he is now getting back to the provision of water and sewerage and reconstruction and repairs.  I remember a speech I made in Bandon, where I appealed for more reconstruction, more clearing of derelict sites and building thereon.  I am glad&mdash;although I was criticised for it at the time&mdash;that that is the policy of the present Minister and that he and his Department are now concentrating on reconstruction and repair grants.  We must never forget, however, the fact that the inter-Party Government built over 11,153 more houses in their three years of office than Fianna Fáil did in three years.  We have not yet got figures for the year ending December, 1960, but they will be available very soon and we shall then see how they compare with former years.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given were given in reply to a Parliamentary Question in March last.  They bear out the contention that the Inter-Party Government did much more for housing than has been done by Fianna Fáil since they came into office.  We have no objection to the provision of this Supplementary Vote, but we think we should know the actual commitments of the Department before voting additional money.</P>

      <P>It is clear from paragraph 3 of the circulated copy of the Minister's speech, that the additional <Col N="727" /> money provided for in the Supplementary Estimate will be needed to meet commitments up to the 31st March.  I take it, therefore, that the House will gladly approve of the Estimate so that the State may meet its commitments in respect of house building, but I should like to draw the Minister's attention to one aspect of housing grants, that is the delay which takes place in paying these grants.</P>
      <P>Many of the reconstruction and repair grants are sought by persons who have practically no resources or extremely slender ones with the result that these people enter into arrangements with contractors to carry out the necessary reconstruction work and many of these contractors themselves are small men with the result that, the moment they finish the job, they are seeking payment and, unfortunately, the person for whom the work is being carried out must depend on the Department and the local authority for the grant in order that he may pay the contractor.</P>
      <P>From cases which I have personally handled it seems there is some delay in the inspection of these reconstructed houses on the part of the inspectorate of the Department.  I gladly acknowledge that once the facts are brought to the attention of the staff in the Minister's office no time is lost in investigating the matter and the necessary contact is made with the inspector concerned. But I find it necessary, in most cases, to do that in order to ensure prompt treatment.  Unless one pursues the matter in that way and follows up representation there is apt to be considerable delay in the payment of the grant.  Of course, as the Minister knows, the local authority grant cannot be paid until the State grant has been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quite understand that if there is increased activity in the field of repair work and in the field of reconstruction, inevitably that taxes the resources of the inspectorate but I plead with the Minister to recognise that many of the contractors who do repairs and reconstruction work are men with practically no resources and every effort should be made to pay the grant in instalments <Col N="728" /> and to pay the final instalment as soon as possible.  That necessitates the close and, perhaps, unremitting attention by the inspectorate to the reconstruction or repair of houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister may plead&mdash;if he does, I shall understand his plea&mdash;that, with the staff at his disposal, he is doing the best he can.  May I put it to the Minister that, recognising the special circumstances of the small man struggling to have his house repaired or reconstructed, the small contractor, without resources, endeavouring to meet his requirements&mdash;no one else will do the work except the small contractor &mdash;very special steps should be taken to pay the first instalment as early as possible and the second moiety, or final instalment, as expeditiously as possible. That may necessitate more frequent inspection.  I suggest that should not be an insuperable difficulty.  I ask the Minister to examine that aspect of the matter to ensure that the efforts of these people, people with no great power and very little wealth, will be encouraged because of the facilities which the State will provide.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters affecting housing activities but I think they would more properly arise on the main Estimate.  I shall leave them until then.</P>

      <P>I am always very amused when Deputy O'Donnell gets up and, with the red flag of housing waving before his face, resorts to a defence of his own administration in the Department of Local Government. He started off, in his welcome of this Supplementary Estimate, by giving us facts&mdash;indisputable facts&mdash;and figures about housing activities over six particular years.  He started with 1954 and placed to the credit of the Coalition Government the fact that almost 10,500 houses were built in that year. Surely Deputy O'Donnell does not think one can build houses overnight? Housebuilding takes a considerable time.  First of all, the site has to be selected; the plans have to be completed; tenders have to be sought; tenders have to be examined.  Finally, there has to be the approval of the Minister for Local Government.  Following that, the house are built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> Deputy O'Donnell has not allowed for the fact that Fianna Fáil were in office for almost half of 1954.  If he had wanted to be quite truthful and quite fair, he might have said that 5,000 of the houses built in 1954 could go to the credit of the Coalition Government but I defy contradiction of the statement that the Coalition Government cannot claim credit for even one of the houses built in the year 1954. The whole 10,490 go to the credit, if credit is to be claimed, of the Fianna Fáil Government which ceased to function as a Government in 1954.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell claims credit for 1955 and 1956.  I am sorry Deputy Larkin is not here.  He is chairman of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation.  He has been chairman for a great number of years.  He would agree that you cannot decide to build a house on Monday morning and have it available for occupation on the following Friday.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to the three years of Coalition Government&mdash;1957, 1958 and 1959. The figures were somewhat lower.  He did not explain in detail, of course, that there was a great falling-off in private building because the moneys that should have been available under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts had dried up in the last year in which the Coalition Government were in office.  It had to be provided <i>de novo</i> almost on the re-advent of a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to tapering off.  He dismissed it in a few words.  He realises that over a great part of the country essential needs have been met almost entirely.  Much still has to be done in Dublin city and there tapering off is not possible.  The type of building has now greatly changed.  We have changed from the building of artisans' dwellings around the perimeter to flat building in the centre of the city.  Anyone who knows anything about houses knows that flat building takes longer and that such building is more costly.  Even with the expenditure of more money, fewer dwellings will be provided as compared with ordinary houses.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House with technical details.  I know that <Col N="730" /> Fianna Fáil waged war on slumdom and the elimination of a situation in which whole families lived in single rooms in tenements.  It was Fianna Fáil who initiated a general policy of providing better housing for our people.  I am happy to inform the House that the time is not far distant when we shall see an end to the housing problem in Dublin city. Having examined the position carefully, we estimate that we will finish the job within five or six years.  We require something like 11,000 more dwellings.  To a great extent, these dwellings will be flat dwellings, built on approximately 60 different sites. There are some smaller schemes of ordinary houses.</P>
    <P>That policy initiated by Fianna Fáil has proved successful in our own lifetime. Successive governments have provided substantial sums for housing. I claim, and I am proud of the fact, that Fianna Fáil, from 1932 onwards, tackled this problem in a most realistic way.  I should like, too, to give credit to the late Deputy Murphy who helped considerably to speed up the solution of the problem by the amending legislation he introduced.  We shall never get anywhere if we keep on comparing notes, but I claim that Fianna Fáil's record in relation to housing will stand for ever as a monument to the Party.</P>
    <P>I have read contributions made to debates in this House, particularly the contributions made by Deputy O'Donnell. Those contributions sought to indicate that my protests about the mal-administration of the Coalition Government in relation to housing were wrong.  I am sure our Minister for Local Government has access to everything in his Department and he will be able to bear me out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know, Sir, but Deputy O'Donnell, in a sense, brought it in with his usual battle-cry of &ldquo;We built more than you did during your period of office and you built less than we did when you took over after us.&rdquo;  They built more because they completed what we had started, and we built fewer houses in the following three years because they had failed to provide the necessary moneys to enable the programme to continue as it had done in the past.</P>
      <P>I was one of those who went on deputations to the Minister for Local Government and other members of the Cabinet on a number of occasions on behalf of Dublin Corporation.  Our attitude was confirmed by the City Manager who came with us.  The then Minister for Local Government, Deputy O'Donnell, gave the House advice as to how the Dublin Corporation and other local authorities could provide money for Small Dwellings Acts cases by going to insurance companies, and he was to make the arrangements.  We know how successful that was.  We know the extent of the money that was made available and the rate of interest demanded for it.</P>
      <P>I am speaking as one who for a number of years has been active in this important and necessary work for the citizens of Dublin.  I know what has been happening.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Deputy from the <Col N="732" /> West of Ireland has to do much greater work in connection with housing than any city Deputy.  I know a great deal about housing.  The majority of the houses in the West had practically to be re-built.  Not alone were the houses themselves old and practically uninhabitable, but the sites were wrong.  No matter what Deputy Briscoe says, it is a disgraceful thing that the number of houses built should have dropped by 11,000 in the three years after Fianna Fáil came into office.</P>
      <P>I am not familiar with the city housing problem, nor do I claim to be. I must, however, take notice of the figures of the number of houses built by private persons, which relate mostly to the rural areas.  In 1954, 4,700 were built; in 1955, 4,800, and in 1956, 5,800.  Against that, in the first year of the Fianna Fáil Government the figure went down to 3,900; in the following year, it was 2,900, and in the third year, it dropped to 3,000&mdash;almost half the 1956 figure.</P>
      <P>While I fully agree with the Supplementary Estimate before the House, I would suggest to the Minister that £300, the grant for a new five-roomed house, including water and sewerage, is absolutely inadequate.  It was reasonable three or four years ago. The Minister may smile, but I know what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Four years ago, a very decent five-roomed house could be built in the country for from £900 to £950.  Due to wage increases brought about by the increased cost of living and increases in raw materials, the same house will cost now £1,450.  For that reason, I believe the time has come for a fairly steep increase in the amount of the grant.  Today, the smallness of the grant is preventing many people from building houses who badly need them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the mentality of the city people is, but in the country people are very slow to go into debt for building.  I admire them for <Col N="733" /> that.  It is possible that they could get a loan or mortgage at the bank on their land to help them erect the house; but past experience has taught them it is very easy to tie a millstone around your neck but very difficult to untie it.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to increase the grant by at least 33? per cent., or more, if he can do it.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I should like to raise with the Minister, although I am afraid I cannot offer any suggestion as to how it might be dealt with. Throughout the country, there are people living in houses that have now reached a very dangerous condition. These people are absolutely too poor to build a new house, even with the help of the most liberal grant from the Department.  Something should be done for these people, and the Minister's officials would probably be able to advise him.  It should be possible for the Department to build a house and to arrange a loan, repayable by way of annuity, much the same as Section B of the Land Reclamation Scheme and the scheme under which the land itself was purchased in years gone by.  A good many holdings are now free of rent and many more will be free of annuity in a few years' time.  Such holdings could bear a small annuity again to provide a new house.  These people are the worst off in the whole country.  Their houses are too old and unsafe to be reconstructed, and a new house is the only answer.  The Minister would be doing a good day's work if he could deal with that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in intervening was to make specific reference to a few matters in relation to the administration of housing under the Minister's Department, but having listened to Deputy Briscoe, who, I regret to say, has fled the House, I am compelled to refute some of the allegations he made.  The figures which Deputy O'Donnell revealed drew from Deputy Briscoe denials of their accuracy, but these denials cannot be substantiated.  Deputy Briscoe advanced one reason: he said that houses cannot be built overnight. <Col N="734" /> That is agreed.  However, one would expect that in the course of four years, there would be substantial improvement in a situation which was so vigorously criticised by Deputy Briscoe in the year before his Government assumed office.  It is remarkable that over the long period in which the present Government have now been in office, we have not seen the revival in the building trade envisaged, if one were to assume that the criticisms offered were backed by the intention to do dramatically better, if given the opportunity.</P>
      <P>Whether Deputy Briscoe appreciates it or not, it is a fact that in relation to housing under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, in Dublin city alone the amount of money being expended is one-half of what it was in 1956.  Would not anyone listening to Deputy Briscoe, and not knowing these figures, believe that he was convinced that that is not true?  He asked us to ignore the number of dwellings under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts because of the greater expenditure involved in the erection of communal flats.</P>
      <P>In 1956, the year in which Deputy Briscoe ran riot, the year in which he created a panic in this city, £2,540,669 was spent under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  In 1960 that expenditure dropped to £833,358&mdash; one-third of the amount spent in the year in which Deputy Briscoe ran riot.  Those are the facts based on the argument Deputy Briscoe advanced with regard to the increased costs involved in the provision of the dwellings. I regret the Deputy is not in the House because he would have to concede that these are the correct figures.  He would have to agree, because they are not my figures, but figures provided by the Minister's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy talked about the difficulty of accelerating building and about how difficult it was to get it under way&mdash;the provision of sites and so on and so forth &mdash; and he spoke about building over a period.  In 1947, only 742 houses were built by the local authorities.  There was a change of <Col N="735" /> Government in 1948 and the figure went up to 1,371.  In the following year, it was 4,226 and in the year after, 1950, 8,117 houses were built. The period I am citing is equal in length to the period this Government have now been in office.  We were told they would get cracking in many fields; yet here is positive proof that they certainly have nothing to record to their credit in relation to effecting an improvement in housing conditions since they resumed office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe said that the only remaining difficulties relating to housing are in the city of Dublin and, to some extent possibly, in the city of Cork.  That statement has led to an acceptance by the people that everything is grand and that housing is adequate throughout the country, with the exception of these heavily urbanised areas.  I say there are rural towns in which housing conditions are extremely bad.</P>
    <P>In the town in which I live myself, Bandon, in Deputy MacCarthy's constituency, there are at least a dozen families living under shockingly primitive conditions, and seeking tenancies the moment anything becomes available. Pressure is brought to bear on public representatives of all Parties in that regard, although there is a serviced site there.  This is a problem of the utmost importance and urgency. That is a centre where housing is required, and action should be taken forthwith to ensure that these people are housed.</P>
    <P>I am glad this Supplementary Estimate is being introduced, if the intention is to improve that situation and to ensure that in the course of some months the Department will expedite the payment of grants for the erection of houses.  Before the Minister introduced this Supplementary Estimate, I was looking forward to an opportunity of mentioning the complaints to which Deputy Norton referred with regard to delay in the payment of grants for new houses or for the reconstruction of houses and the delay in sending inspectors to visit the houses.  In our various constituencies, we find that, as <Col N="736" /> Deputies, we are approached on more occasions on this particular aspect of administration than on any other. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to try to expedite, in the first place, the visits of the inspectorial staff, and secondly, the payments of grants.</P>
    <P>There is another glaring injustice in relation to supplementary housing grants which I would ask the Minister to rectify.  There seems to be some confusion in local authority offices in regard to the interpretation of the qualification clause for a supplementary housing grant.  I find that in some cases they are compelled to accept the income of the applicant in the year in which the application was made. Sometimes a person changes his abode because of special circumstances.  He might be a retiring member of the Garda, who thinks that he is now sure of his location for the remainder of his days, and who applies for a grant such as a supplementary housing grant; but because he has received a gratuity&mdash; something which will not be repeated but which is down in black and white as if it were a continuing income&mdash;in the year in which he makes the application, it is regarded as his income for that year.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look into that matter because it is a great injustice that any man should be denied a supplementary housing grant, on being pensioned off from a Department of State and given an amount of money which is intended to sustain him and his dependants for the rest of his life, because his gratuity is regarded as an income sufficient to bar him from getting a supplementary housing grant.</P>
    <P>There are other instances I could quote.  I know a case of a relative of a farmer who worked without any reward whatsoever for 30 years, and when the people who owned the place retired from farming and made over the price of the farm as an award to the person for the 30 years' service she had given to the family, that money was recorded to her credit in the year in which she made application for a housing grant, and she was refused the grant.  That is a glaring injustice and one which could be <Col N="737" /> readily remedied by administrative action.</P>
    <P>Those are a few of the instances that inspired me to make these comments. I would ask the Minister to take action as soon as possible so that these individual cases&mdash;and they are not many in relation to all who qualify for supplementary housing grants&mdash;will not suffer a distinct injustice and hardship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that housing in the South Cork area is being carried out under a planned scheme in the various electoral areas, in turn, under a housing inspector who visits the areas and examines the conditions of the applicants in order to satisfy the local authority and the Department.  The survey for the town of Bandon and the surrounding area has now been completed and is awaiting implementation.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to supplementary grants.  Of course, they are not the concern of the Minister at all.  Supplementary grants and the conditions on which they are issued are matters for the local authorities, the county councils and the various advisory boards.  I agree with what Deputy O'Sullivan has said, but this is not the place to have these matters rectified.  The fact that a member of the Garda retires from the service of the State and gets his gratuity in the particular year in which he applies for a grant should not operate against him.</P>
      <P>The same can be said about the overtime earnings of people engaged on urgent projects.  The Whitegate Refinery had to be completed within a certain period.  The extra time worked by people there was counted against them for the supplementary grants. That is something that is not likely to arise again in a lifetime.  We shall have to rectify that matter in the county council of which Deputy O'Sullivan is a member.  It would be more appropriate to do it there.  Less time would be lost if we raised such matters with the appropriate bodies.</P>

      <P>I want to place on record my disappointment at the progress in housing in the past 12 months.  In regard to the manner in which the Department of Local Government treated applicants for housing grants and grants for reconstruction, apart from delays in payment, I have no serious complaint.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to ensure that the Housing Section of his Department will see to it that when files are sent out to the various inspectors, the inspectors will not carry them around with them for weeks.  I trust an effort will be made to have the various houses reported upon without delay.  In many cases, applicants for reconstruction grants have had the work satisfactorily carried out, having obtained the cement, timber and other material from merchants who want to collect their money.  There have been many distressing occurrences because of delays.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that any time delays were reported to the Department, action was taken.  It should not be necessary for applicants to seek the assistance of Deputies.  With speed and efficiency in the Department of Local Government, including the Housing Section, it ought not be necessary for an applicant to voice his grievance to any member of the Oireachtas to obtain speedy payment of the grants.</P>

      <P>There is a change in the voice of the Fianna Fáil Party on housing in the past 12 months.  Those of us who recall the panic of Deputies such as Deputy Briscoe and others a few years ago cannot but notice their silence now, despite the fact that less money is being spent on housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a slowing-up in the housing drive throughout the country.  During the last general election, we were told from every <Col N="739" /> Fianna Fáil platform that if elected to office, Fianna Fáil would abolish slums and provide a house for every family.  They have now been in office for four years but, particularly in regard to the performance of the past 12 months, that promise has fallen short of fulfilment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister feels there is a housing problem only in Cork and Dublin, then he is not in touch with the people. There are very great housing problems in practically ever progressive provincial town.  I have often wondered why the Department has not at regular intervals circularised every local authority so as to have an up-to-date survey of housing requirements continually under review.</P>
    <P>For every local authority house that becomes vacant in Portlaoise, there are at least 15 to 20 applicants. The housing situation there is desperate. The fault cannot lie on the shoulders of the local authority.  They have submitted plans and proposals and informed the Department of their activities.  There seems to be unusual delay in giving sanction to local authorities for schemes.</P>
    <P>In Birr, the housing position is so appalling that in many cases three, four and five families are living in the one house.  The housing position in Tullamore can be described only as horrid.  Despite the best efforts of Tullamore Urban District Council, another 200 houses are required there. At least 100 houses are required in Birr; at least 100 in Portarlington; and at least 100 in Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>The Government should keep abreast of modern housing conditions. The State will have to play a bigger and more important part in housing schemes.  By the time the housing subsidy is taken into consideration by the local authority, the rents for the houses they provide are prohibitive and frequently the persons most deserving of such houses cannot pay for them.  Often an unemployed father with a large family must remain in a condemned house against the wishes of the local authority or stay with his in-laws.  He could not possibly pay the rent for the type of house he should have.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> The problem in my constituency is no different from that in every constituency. Local authorities realise they cannot go ahead with housing schemes because of the high rents which must be charged.  There must be a new approach to the financing of local authorities in relation to housing schemes.  The Minister is in his last year of office.  If he wants to do something really practical, he should recast housing policy.  The State should play a greater part in assisting local authorities to provide houses.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to say if the State has not a duty to provide houses for its citizens.  There seems to be no evidence of house-building in our large provincial towns.  There is no evidence of local authorities erecting cottages in rural districts.  Ministers and other responsible authorities are constantly appealing to people to stay on the land.  We must build up parish life by providing houses in rural areas. A farm worker, for instance, should be provided with a house convenient to his work.  We have rural electrification, and the Minister tells us we shall have water supplies in even the most remote part of the country.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why we do not try to keep our people on the land. I feel that farm workers should be given special consideration and that there should be a special scheme for financing local authorities in regard to the erection of houses on sites which will be voluntarily given by farmers for the purpose of housing the agricultural worker.  No provision is made in this Estimate nor was provision made in the last main Estimate in relation to the provision of houses for agricultural workers and I would ask the Government to give serious consideration to the matter.</P>
    <P>There are many agricultural workers who have to travel long distances from the towns to the farmers employing them.  In such cases we have examples of farmers who are prepared to give sites voluntarily upon which to erect cottages for the farm workers.  Local authorities will not undertake that work unless some direction is given by the <Col N="741" /> Department of Local Government. There is a very big problem in relation to housing throughout rural Ireland apart from the urban housing problem. The urban housing problem exists in all our cities and there is a demand for houses and flats.  A very peculiar type of problem with which every Deputy is familiar exists in regard to the very small farmer who is unable to build a house for himself.  The local authority will not touch that type of person and the Department of Local Government will give a grant only to repair an old house which will not pass the conditions laid down in regard to the reconstruction of houses.</P>
    <P>You have many small farmers in this country under £15 valuation.  They have not sufficient capital of their own. They do not want to enter into any commitments in regard to the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts simply because, in nine cases out of ten, in rural Ireland the occupant has not taken out administration to the lands on which he lives.  Unless there is full title, a local authority will not give a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this is a Supplementary Estimate and that many of the points he mentioned do not arise on it.  We are confined to the subheads listed in the Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I thought I might focus attention on the failure of the Government successfully to solve the housing problem in this country. The general trend of housing throughout the whole country is entirely slowed up.  It is unsatisfactory and out of date.  I feel that the time has come when the Government ought to review their entire housing policy in accordance with their desires and wishes prior to the general election.  If the Government acted in accordance with what they said they would do in regard to housing, the problem of which I and Opposition Deputies speak would be solved and there would be no need for comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grants for the erection of new houses are not sufficiently generous.  I <Col N="742" /> would ask the Minister to provide in his main Estimate a greater sum.  If he does that, I am sure he will have the backing and support of the Opposition in this House because the amounts now payable either for the reconstruction of old houses or the erection of new ones are not in accordance with the cost of materials, wages and other costs which have fallen heavily on people who have to build houses.  I hoped that long ago there would have been a statement made by the Government in relation to a new approach.</P>
    <P>I want to say how disappointed I am because the Government have fallen short of the country's expectations in relation to housing.  Less money is being spent on houses.  Fewer houses are being built and there is a greater demand for houses.  The demand from local authorities and the citizens in general has fallen on deaf ears.  The Minister has turned a blind eye to the problem of housing in rural Ireland.  I want to express my disapproval and condemnation of the present Minister's activities in regard to housing.  I am not satisfied with the progress.  It falls very short of the country's requirements and expectations. I trust the time will come when steps will be taken seriously to solve the problem by providing all our people who require houses with a new house and seeing to it that the proper finances are placed at the disposal of the local authorities to proceed with the work as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I came in only during the latter part of Deputy O'Sullivan's speech.  I had the doubtful privilege of listening to Deputy O. Flanagan's dissertation.  It is most surprising to hear Fine Gael Deputies criticise the Fianna Fáil Government for their lack of progress in regard to housing above all other matters which come within the ambit of a Government Department.  In passing I should like to place on record&mdash;I am very glad he is not here because it would be a source of embarrassment for me&mdash;that I think the present occupant of the Ministry of Local Government is one of the most outstanding, conscientious, energetic and <Col N="743" /> hardworking Ministers we had in that onerous position for many a long time. I think the Department and its officers are a credit to him.  I am in constant communication with these people on various aspects of housing and I am very familiar with the question of housing generally in Ireland today.  I should like to place that small tribute on record.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan gave certain figures.  He quoted statistics for 1954 and 1955 and said they were the peak years of the Coalition's housing drive. Everybody knows that the Coalition Government came into power in the latter half of 1954.  The houses which were built in 1954 and 1955 were planned and passed by the previous Fianna Fáil Government.  Any suggestion that the Coalition Government increased the tempo of house-building during their short three and a half years' reign is absolutely fantastic.</P>
      <P>I also heard Deputy O'Sullivan quote certain figures in relation to the amount of money expended in those years, particularly in the years 1954 and 1955. It ought to be remembered that the year 1956 was an appalling year with regard to the building industry but the amount of money quoted by Deputy O'Sullivan in regard to 1954 and 1955 bears no relation to the true facts.  For the first time Dublin Corporation and Cork Corporation were given access to the Local Loans Fund. Therefore, if the figure in regard to housing expenditure from the Local Loans Fund in those years shows twice the amount of previous years the explanation is that the Dublin Corporation did not borrow from the public because they could not get it owing to the financial state into which the Coalition Government brought the country.  Cork Corporation were unable to borrow from the general public and the Government had to assist them through the Local Loans Fund for the first time.  That is the answer to Deputy O'Sullivan, the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan spoke about delays in the payment of supplementary grants.  Every Deputy knows there are <Col N="744" /> delays in the payment of supplementary grants but it is unfair to place that blame at the door af the Minister for Local Government or at the door of the Custom House.  Everyone knows there are certain procedures to be adopted when one seeks a reconstruction grant.  First of all, one applies to the local authority, having filled up the application form setting out the schedule of the work proposed and an estimate of the cost.  The local authority, in turn, simply convey to that person that, in their opinion, the work would be worthy of a grant, but that has to be sanctioned before payment can be made by the Department of Local Government and a certificate to that effect issued.</P>
    <P>When the alleged delays in the payment of these reconstruction grants take place, it is the person himself, the applicant for the reconstruction grant, who in every case is to blame. There is no question about that.  In other words, the inspector will get his file, visit the job where the reconstruction work has been carried out and in many cases will say that the work specified has not been done, that something has been omitted, thereby reducing the global amount of the grant.  If it has not been omitted then in many cases the work has been done in a slipshod fashion and it would be the height of folly to expect the Department of Local Government or an inspector to certify inferior work for payment.  It would also be against the wishes of this House.</P>
    <P>As I say, there are delays in the payment of reconstruction grants but the manner in which the criticism of the delays is made is completely unjustified. The remedy is to observe the statutory regulations and it lies in the hands of the people themselves. If they did that, there would be no hold-up in the payment.  If they carried out the work according to the specification and the schedule submitted and approved in the first instance, there would be no complaints and if they waited&mdash;and this is an important point&mdash;to get approval before commencing the work.  In many instances, people have gone on <Col N="745" /> with the work without having got approval, so that the criticism is unfair.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also raised the question of hardship on merchants waiting for payment for supplies of timber, cement and so on used in a reconstruction job.  Everyone knows that the Department of Local Government will act on an assignment of the grant in question, which is a legally binding document, directing that the grant payable to John Jones, or whatever the name is, of such-and-such an address, be paid to Thomas Smith, hardware merchant of such-and-such a place.  There is really no hardship involved, and I do not think it is reasonable or justifiable criticism.</P>
    <P>I have covered the question of access to the Local Loans Fund.  For the first time, Dublin and Cork Corporations have shown that that is how Deputy O'Sullivan got this very high figure.  With regard to the drop-off, as has been alleged by Deputy O'Sullivan, in the number of houses being erected, I am afraid he must be one of the few people in the country who believe that that is the case.  It was the debate in December, 1956, which helped to put the Coalition Government out of power.  If we cast our minds back, we will remember that the building industry had been brought to its knees.  Merchants, not for three months but for a couple of years, could not get the moneys due to them and apart from merchants, the local authorities could not get any payments from the Department of Finance via the Local Loans Fund, not for work to come, or partially done, but for work actually completed on schemes of houses wherein the people were actually living.  That was the critical position.  A circular letter from the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, instructed members of local authorities to accept no further commitments.  He had this famous meeting with the County Managers' Association when a certain instruction was given which left these managers under no doubt that the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; was completely empty.</P>
    <P>That was the plight of the building <Col N="746" /> industry towards the end of 1956.  The emigration of our skilled tradesmen, to Britain particularly, reached very high proportions and, unfortunately, we are now in the plight that one of our greatest difficulties in the building industry, a difficulty which, in my opinion, is one of the main reasons for the high tenders for local authority houses, is the fact that skilled tradesmen, particularly carpenters and masons, are not available.</P>
    <P>However, I do not wish to go into detailed matters on this Supplementary Estimate.  It would be well, however, for Deputy O'Sullivan when he discusses the number of houses completed in any particular time to bulk private housing and public housing, Housing of the Working Classes operation, plus the activities of those who availed of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  Indeed, time out of mind, circular letters have come before local authorities from the Department of Local Government urging those who are in a position to do so to take the burden off the local authority by building their own houses. The result is that the upward trend of private housing is of such a nature that it has exceeded the greatest expectations of the Minister's advisers and, therefore, this Supplementary Estimate is necessary, because by 31st March, the amount we voted for Local Government last year would not be sufficient to pay grants to those who are constructing their houses at present.</P>
    <P>Then, again, it is only reasonable for the Opposition to concede that we inherited a problem whereby the central city areas in the larger cities, Dublin, Limerick and Cork, had to be built on.  Business was being lost to the trading community.  People were objecting to the cost of transport from the outlying areas and the centres of the cities were not only becoming eyesores but completely denuded of any semblance of life and were fit only for the parking of cars.  Indeed, in many cases, they were not even capable of being used for that purpose, due to the ruins and so on, which were dealt with on the Derelict Sites Bill, which was introduced some time ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> Derelict sites in central city areas cannot be built up overnight.  Title has to be investigated and there are other procedures which involve delay and hold up progress.  These delays are tiresome and appear unreasonable to the ordinary man-in-the-street.  They are unavoidable and the public should be educated to that fact.</P>
    <P>Ask any trade unionist what the position in the building trade is to-day. It was never better.  There is full employment in the industry.  The worry is how to get some of our skilled men back from England because the indications are that for many years there will be continuity of employment in the industry which is the second largest industry in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan bemoaned the fact that in certain towns in his constituency there are cases of three or four families living in one house.  I wish the Fine Gael Party would make up their mind.  According to Deputy Flanagan there are three or four families living in one house.  According to the Leader of the Opposition the position in rural Ireland is that there are houses in perfect condition with the windows shuttered, the occupants having fled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also bemoaned the fact that persons for whom houses were being built today could not afford the rents of the houses.  Deputy Flanagan is a member of a local authority and should be aware of the powers vested in the local authorities in regard to the fixing of rents.  There are ample provisions whereby the tenant's means can be taken into account and the rent adjusted accordingly.</P>
    <P>There is one point on which I do agree with Deputy Flanagan.  There is a very large demand in rural Ireland for agricultural cottages.  I think the figure would be about 20,000.  There is no political issue involved in this matter.  The members of local authorities are concerned about the cost involved.  It is quite fantastic that an ordinary agricultural cottage should cost £1,200 to £1,300 to build.  This is a serious problem for the Minister. I do not know what the solution may be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> When I was recalling the part of Deputy O'Sullivan's speech that I heard as to the expenditure by the Coalition Government on housing, I omitted to say that in March, 1957, when we came into power the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Smith, had to issue immediately nearly £1,000,000 from the Local Loans Fund to pay off debts to local authorities incurred by the previous Government which they had let lie and because of which many reputable building contractors and builders' providers were brought to the Bankruptcy Court with unfortunate results.  The position was examined by the Fianna Fáil Government.  The debts were paid.  The housing problem was tackled.</P>
    <P>At the present moment there is no unemployment in the housebuilding industry.  In one year under the Fianna Fáil Government over 11,000 houses were built.  I am not sure if the figure was not 13,000.  Taking into consideration the total number of houses erected by private builders and under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and the number under construction at the present time, it will be seen that the position is very satisfactory indeed.</P>
    <P>One thing which must be stressed, as against the previous Government, is that where a local authority submit a scheme and get approval and carry out the work they do so in the knowledge that they will be paid for the work, that they will not be in the same position as they were in in the past of being faced with mounting overdraft charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the first things that Deputy O'Donnell wanted to make quite clear was that he felt this Supplementary Estimate was not properly before the House, in other words, that it should not be sought or granted until the end of March when the actual commitments would be known.  Of course, we want to continue to pay our commitments as they arise.  Deputy O'Donnell might not be aware of that.  In order that these commitments may be met, it is essential that the money should be there to pay them as they arise.  If we <Col N="749" /> were to accept the view expressed by the Deputy, we would stop paying any grants as and from this week and no money would be forthcoming until some time next April.  We do not believe that that is the best way of doing this type of business and therefore we have come to the House to seek an amount that, from fairly reliable estimates based on allocations and inspection records, we believe will fall to be paid before the end of this financial year.</P>
      <P>As a matter of record, at the moment, out of the entire Vote provided for this purpose, we have £151,000.  Therefore, one can readily see that if we are to continue making payments beyond the next few days it is absolutely essential to have this Supplementary Vote granted.  The Deputy quoted the figures and the time which has elapsed to which these figures apply in respect of grant outpayments. He would seem to suggest that, on the average of the months gone by, that would apply on the average to the months intervening since we first came to look for this Supplementary Estimate, and a figure would arise that would not bear out the amount for which we are now looking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that these demands have been accelerating and the outpayments anticipated are in the region of £200,000 for the month.  With £151,000 in the kitty and a little over a month to go, I do not think anyone can suggest we are boosting the amount we need.  Why should we do so?  In the normal run of things, no Minister is anxious to have to come back to the House during the year looking for more money.  He has been given the amount that, it was anticipated, from the outlook a year ago would be sufficient for his particular service.  However, in this case it is somewhat different, in that it is in respect of a service which all of us, on all sides of the House, are most anxious to continue. If it expands, as it is expanding, everybody should feel quite happy. For that reason Deputy O'Donnell and the other members of the Opposition should be satisfied that there is no gimmick in coming here looking for <Col N="750" /> this supplementary amount, that in fact it is needed and that the entire amount we are asking for will be required and paid out by the end of next month.</P>
    <P>I might say, although it is rather late in the discussion to make any observation on it, that the debate has largely centred on the issues raised by Deputy O'Donnell on local authority housing and many other matters completely unrelated to this Supplementary Estimate and the debate that should follow from it.  The matter with which we are dealing here is purely and simply a Supplementary Estimate for money to defray these costs and these grants from the Department of Local Government and all the matters which have been discussed by Deputy O'Donnell do not fall within the ambit of this discussion at all.</P>
    <P>However, the answers which Deputy O'Donnell was given very ably by Deputy Briscoe and Deputy O'Malley should suffice in relation to the statements he and other Deputies on the opposite benches made in trying to make it appear, as it was sought to make it appear a year ago on a somewhat similar occasion, that this Government is falling down on the job in relation to housing.  They even had the audacity to try to make comparisons, to the disadvantage of this Government, with the performance of the last Government.  If Deputy O'Donnell would refer to the Volume of the Dáil Debates from which I think he quoted this afternoon, he would find there the reply which I had then to give in this House and which is an adequate answer to all he has said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may correct the Minister, I was quoting from a reply to a Parliamentary Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It sounded so much like what I had heard said here on another occasion that I presumed it to be from that debate, but I would still refer him to that debate of a year ago.  In that debate he will get full and adequate answers to similar suggestions made by the Deputy and others on that side of the House.  I would advise him to digest them fully <Col N="751" /> before occasion is again taken to raise this matter.  Let me repeat that when we took office in 1957 we took over after a grand spree of spending in all directions without thought to the future, to the ability of the then Government to pay or the ability of the economy of the country, as it was then, to stand up to it.  We took over at a time when this spree had of necessity to come to an end because there was little left in the kitty with which to continue it.  We took it over when the evidence of the dead hand of the Coalition was there to be seen more completely in regard to matters of local government than in regard to any other matter.</P>
      <P>Since then we have continued to arrest the decline and brought about a new upsurge in the trend, having paid off, as has been said here this afternoon, the outstanding debts that were incurred without thought by the then Government.  The encouragement we have given has not been merely circular letters to county councils or grand exhortations to the members of these councils on any opportune public occasion but rather the concrete way of, first of all, clearing the decks of the Local Government Department of all the debts that had been incurred, clearing out the files and the chests in the Department wherein were buried many worth-while and worthy projects for which no sanction had been forthcoming from that Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then proceeded to instil some confidence in the local authorities that the new Government would meet their commitments to the local authorities in regard to these matters.  We went on from there to introduce new housing legislation in which we increased the grants under various heads in order to give greater financial encouragement to the ordinary people througout the country, the private builders and those who had houses to repair.  The effects of the efforts we made are quite evident to-day and for some time past. During the discussion on the Estimate last year, it was quite clear that the steps we had taken, and are continuing to take, were bearing fruit.  The results were encouraging; the trend <Col N="752" /> was again upwards in these spheres and the situation to-day is that that trend is continuing despite what has been said by those who would rather not see the evidence which is so obvious to everybody else.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell also spoke of the statements he made as Minister at some time, I think, in Bandon.  He said he advocated greater attention to and spending on the repair, improvement and conservation of our existing housing stock.  More power to the Deputy if that is what he said.  There is no harm whatsoever in that.  He also said he talked about the effort that should be made to clear up these derelict sites.  It is all very well to talk, but I am asking now: did he do anything more than talk?  We have.  We have brought in legislation which makes it possible, in a speedy and satisfactory manner, for local authorities to clear up these eyesores.  Furthermore, in a very telling fashion, we have brought in a scheme of grants by which to encourage their clearance.  I want to nail this, lest, in a few years or a few months, as the occasion may arise, the Deputy or possibly somebody who has listened to him or who reads what he has said to-day may claim, in a short while, that the Parties opposite were responsible for clearing derelict sites and that all that may be done on that problem in the future will be attributed to the good work started by Deputy O'Donnell, merely by talking in Bandon some four or five years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised the question of delays.  I am no more happy about that than Deputy Norton or other Deputies who have alluded to delay, but, as I said before and repeat now, we have had difficulties in maintaining our staffs of inspectors in sufficient number to meet the growing demand. We have taken every possible step on several occasions&mdash;and even in recent months by way of advertisements, boards and interviews&mdash;to keep up the strength of the staff, but despite all that has been done, it is only now&mdash;and we are still somewhat under strength&mdash;that we have a situation in which the inspectorate staff are reasonably well able to cope with the demands on them.  But there is a backlog which they are trying <Col N="753" /> to liquidate and which may still require some little time before it is completely wiped out.  That will depend also on the strength of the staff remaining at the present level.</P>
    <P>I have done, and I am continuing to do, everything possible to minimise delay by inter-changing, by supplementing, by taking an inspector from one part and sending him to another that appears to need him more.  We do not want delays, and we are trying to get rid of them, but the difficulty in regard to inspectors has been there throughout the past year or so.  I hope that the coming financial year will be better from that point of view.  The House may be assured that all steps necessary are being taken and will be taken to reduce the delay to the minimum.  I am fully alive to all that has been said in regard to payment of instalments and I realise the advantage it would be to the people building, particularly those having the work done by small contractors without financial backing, to have payments made quickly.  We are quite conscious of that, and we shall continue to try to serve those people with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>For some reason, Deputy Blowick introduced himself as a person knowing practically everything about houses, grants, and costs and told us how totally inadequate is the grant of £300 which is available for the erection of a serviced, five-roomed house in the country.  Actually, that figure should read £310 but, knowing so much&mdash;by his own profession&mdash;I was surprised to hear him say how little use the grant was compared with four years ago.  At that stage, I could not help but interject that those figures were not then available.  He passed from that to tell us in a very vehement and definite way that the grants were not sufficient and that a steep increase was needed.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy and other members know that the amount of money available to-day by way of grant for building houses is greater than it was at any other stage in our history.  In addition, these grants of £310 for a serviced house in a non-serviced <Col N="754" /> area may be, and are in very many cases, supplemented by the local authority to the tune of £300.  It is possible in rural Ireland now to get £610 in grants to build a house.  If that is not considerable, even though costs have gone up, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>One thing has increased.  Deputy Blowick might know something about this, since he knows so much about housing.  For the same type of house in the Gaeltacht, the grant is £450, plus anything up to £300 from the local authorities.  We are thus operating on terms of £600-£750 in grants for the building of a house, depending on the part of rural Ireland in which the person resides.  That is the extent of aid for housebuilding from public funds at present.  Yet, we have an ex-Minister, an expert on housing, according to himself, telling us that steep increases are needed.  Certainly if we could build houses for nothing, everybody would be happier or at least they would appear to be for the moment, but in our circumstances generally, I do not think anybody can say that State assistance is ungenerous as has been represented here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick also said something that did not make much sense to me when he spoke of people in the country being slow to borrow and said that he admired them for it.  Presumably, he is prepared to admire them for staying in a bad house rather than undertaking to repay some of the cost of a good house in which they could live in better conditions.  He actually gave the lie to the impression he had already created by talking about the very poor people who, he said, should be helped by a special grant yet to be devised and he suggested their holdings should become annuity-free and that a special effort should be made to give them special loans, repayable on an annuity basis.  He cannot have it both ways: he admires those who will not borrow even though they can get the money and yet he wants a special scheme of loans to enable the particularly poor people to borrow.  I leave it to the House to judge the value of his argument.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the <Col N="755" /> inadequacy of housing other than in the cities.  I think he suggested that some people were inferring that there was no real need for housing except in the cities and that only a little remained to be done and that he did not agree with them.  I do not agree with them either.  There is still quite an amount of housing to be provided throughout the country, but unfortunately the position is that we are not clear as to what the amount is exactly and in what category it arises.  Without that knowledge, we are not able to sit down, as we should like to do, and devise, if necessary, further steps effectively to eliminate what I believe exists&mdash;isolated bad houses throughout rural Ireland, particularly in the case of small farmers.</P>
    <P>With this in view, I invoked the powers available to request local authorities to do their duty and in May and in August of last year, I asked them to carry out comprehensive surveys of all the houses required in their functional areas, regardless of whether or not people living in unfit houses had applied for council houses&mdash;in other words, a survey that would give us a picture in the Department of Local Government which would enable us to take any steps that may be necessary, based on factual knowledge rather than on observations of mine or of Deputies who, to a large extent, are talking of what they see in their own areas or as they pass through particular parts of the country.  The local authorities have an obligation to do this: they have not been doing it in the past, possibly due to the fact&mdash;so obvious for so long&mdash;that it was a question of building what you saw was needed.  You did not have to look for work.</P>
    <P>The point is that we have asked them to honour that obligation, an obligation which they are in duty bound to observe.  We are awaiting the result of the surveys.  The return so far has not been as good as we should like it to be and we have sent out reminders.  We have got certain promises from some of the counties.  We have got quite a bit of action from others.  Then there are some who are <Col N="756" /> quite far behind.  The surveys are being done at my instigation.  It is a nation-wide survey.  There is a duty on local authorities under the Inspection of Districts Regulations to do these surveys and keep them up to date. We have asked local authorities to do these surveys so that we shall know exactly where we stand.  In due course, when we have these surveys, we shall be able to find out whether changes are needed in the law or the regulations in order to solve whatever problems may be thrown up by these surveys.</P>
    <P>Specific Instance building schemes are not being availed of to the fullest extent.  Some local authorities appear to be vaguely aware of the scheme. Some utilise it a little.  If local authorities drew up schemes and forwarded them to us for approval, there would be less need for criticism here in relation to housing for the poor and the small farmer.  I exhort members of this House who are also members of local authorities to bring Specific Instance schemes before their local councils, with a view to relieving some of the hardship that still exists because of lack of proper housing for certain categories.  There are people who prefer to live in rather dire circumstances in rural areas rather than migrate to nearby towns or villages.  They will not accept houses in villages or towns, even if they could get them without paying any rent at all.  There is good reason for their reluctance to leave. They can eke out some kind of existence in their present homesteads. The Specific Instance procedure should be adopted more widely in the case of such people.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan talked about his own town and about people living there in primitive conditions.  If these appalling conditions exist, then the members of this House who are also members of local authorities brand themselves as lacking in any sense of duty towards their constituents.  It is their duty to ensure these primitive conditions cease.  Every Deputy who is a member of a local authority and who charges the Government with responsibility for these conditions, hoping the charge will stick, shows <Col N="757" /> himself up in a rather sorry light.  I hurl the charge back and tell the Deputy to go back to his local authority, do his job there properly, get houses built and wipe out these primitive and appalling conditions from his town or village.  There is no reason why such a situation should exist. Those responsible should get on with the work.  When cases of this nature come to the Department, the money is never refused.  I exhort those who criticise so freely to go back to their local councils and set about taking steps to build new houses for these people who, they say, are living in primitive and appalling conditions.</P>
    <P>On the question of supplementary grants, these grants are available. Schemes are at the discretion of the local authorities.  Naturally, local authorities adopt whatever scheme will give the best value in particular circumstances. This is permissive legislation. It does not really come within the ambit of the Minister or his Department.  It has been my experience over the years that the approach to these schemes is a sensible one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan made quite a noise here about the housing situation in his constituency, with particular reference to Portlaoise, Birr, Tullamore and Portarlington.  He claimed that a couple of hundred houses are needed in Tullamore, 100 in Birr, 100 in Portarlington, 100 in Portlaoise.  A survey has been sought from the Deputy's local authority area.  At the moment the survey is complete in three dispensary districts and partially complete in two&mdash;five surveys altogether. There are 15 in the area.  We asked for these surveys eight months ago.  Fairly recently reminders were sent out.</P>
    <P>In relation to Birr, where the 100 families are supposed to be in extreme need of houses, plans were submitted to my Department on 11th January from the Birr area for two houses.  In Portlaoise, where it is obvious that 100 houses are needed and where there are three or four families to each house, we have had a 52-house scheme proposed for that town.  Approval for that scheme issued on 20th January, <Col N="758" /> but, according to Deputy Flanagan, we need at least 50 more houses.  The Deputy is a member of the local authority and it is for him to bring to the notice of the local authority the &ldquo;500 appalling cases&rdquo; he speaks of in order to have appropriate action taken.  I believe that when the facts of these &ldquo;500 appalling cases&rdquo; in these four towns are examined, the Deputy's statement is likely to be very far from a statement of the true position.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also stated that a new housing code was required.  In case there might be credit given in any direction for anything being done at present, Deputy Flanagan brings in this umbrella cover that a complete new code is needed, that more money is needed and that, unless there are world-shaking developments to meet a situation that exists more in his imagination than in reality, the Government may be accused of not doing their duty.  That is typical of the Deputy and does not require comment from me.</P>
    <P>What we were called upon to discuss here is the matter of the moneys required for the continuation of prompt payments of all grants that fall to be paid between now and 31st March.  I have indicated that this money is definitely needed&mdash;needed, in fact, within a matter of days.  We are down to the last of the moneys available to us from the ordinary Vote.  Due to the increased demand, which we are glad to see, we require this extra £200,000.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Road Traffic Bill, 1960&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned last Wednesday, I had been saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera said some very bad cases went into the Courts. Deputy J.A. Costello said we <Col N="759" /> should leave it to the district justices, judges and juries.  With all respect to the district justices, judges and juries, I will say as an ordinary citizen that though there were some very bad cases, there were some terribly bad decisions in courts all over the country.  There seems to be a wave of sentiment all over the world when the most brutal murderer is captured and put on trial. There is a wave of sentiment for the murderer or the accused, as he would be called here.  Nobody ever thinks of the poor devils who have been killed.</P>
    <P>I want to qualify that.  When people are killed on the roads, they are soon forgotten.  However, the people who killed them, often because of careless driving, are not, I believe, adequately punished in many cases.  I am not advocating punishment merely for the sake of punishment, but I am supporting the provisions in the Bill for an increase in the penalties, because I believe that will act as a deterrent and make the roads safer.</P>
    <P>Last week, I had covered the field so far as the state of vehicles is concerned. I mentioned that there were on the roads lorries carrying very dangerous loads&mdash;loads of logs, girders and, perhaps, railway rails, though that is beside the point now.  These loads do not always appear to be securely fastened.  The Minister should ensure in the Bill that proper precautions will be taken and that the Garda can compel people to have these loads made fast.  I have seen lorries loaded with high explosives going through built-up areas during busy traffic periods.  Much greater care should be taken in regard to loads of explosives, often measured in tons.  If there were an accident, there could be appalling loss of life.</P>
    <P>I mentioned fumes last week.  There should be some control over fumes from diesel engines.  I did not get to the question of noise.  The Minister will have to take definite power to control noise, especially from the high-revving engines of motorcycles and scooters.  They go crashing through <Col N="760" /> the streets making as much noise as a machine-gun, especially at night.  This has been drawn to my attention chiefly by the mothers of young children who live in built-up areas.  It is a serious matter that, when they get their young children to sleep, they are awakened by this noise.  I do not know whether the Minister has any experience of it, but it is something to which he should pay great attention.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister intends to do about the report prepared by the German expert.  Why is it that when we want to find out about anything, we have to send to Germany? When we wanted to inquire into our traffic problems here, why had we to send for a German expert, above all people?  There are about 48 million people in Federal Germany and about the same number in France and in Great Britain.  We can make a comparison between the three countries.  In 1959, on the roads in Great Britain, over 5,000 people were killed; on the roads in France, over 6,000 people were killed; and on the roads in Federal Germany, over 13,000 people were killed&mdash;and we sent to Germany for an expert.  He would have great experience in seeing how people were killed.  We could probably have given him some pointers on how to make the roads safe, and goodness knows our roads are not safe.  I just say that to the Minister in passing.</P>
    <P>I made the point about lorries travelling in the convoy.  I also think it should be made compulsory to wear helmets on motor cycles and scooters.  Every effort must be made by Deputies on all sides of the House to do everything in their power to ensure that this Road Traffic Bill will be a good Act which will help to make the roads of Ireland safe.  A reasonable time will, I am sure, be allowed by the Minister to the House before Committee Stage in order that well-considered amendments may be tabled.  The Minister appealed to road users for courtesy and consideration. If he considers the amendments which are put forward with tolerance and toleration, the Road Traffic Act, 1960, will be a great advance in making the <Col N="761" /> roads of Ireland safer for the people of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Deputies have covered so much ground so well, there is not much that I need say.  I should like to join with other Deputies in congratulating the Minister on bringing this Bill forward, and I wish him the success he hopes he will have in reducing the amount of casualties on the road.  The Bill is most comprehensive. It had, no doubt, the advantage of being considered by a number of the Minister's predecessors, and I am sure that was of some assistance to him, but the Bill appears to have the imprint of the Minister's own personal consideration and decisions on a number of issues.  They are none the worse for that.</P>
      <P>I am concerned really with two points only.  I am not sure about the reasons for the 30 miles per hour speed limit proposition.  I wonder what justification the Minister felt he had for incorporating in the Bill the suggestion that there should be such a speed limit?  Has he found from the experience in any other country that this arbitrary figure of 30 miles per hour&mdash;not 35 or 25&mdash;is correct?  Has it had any influence in reducing the rate of accidents in built-up areas? Has the disadvantage of fast traffic travelling along fast trunk line traffic coming up against the 30 mile an hour limit at intervals of so many miles in villages, small towns and cities been considered?  Has he considered the slowing-down effect which must arise if the 30 miles per hour limit is imposed to any extent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently it has been suggested that, in fact, accidents occur at slow speeds and that the fast driver is the safer driver.  There may be a fallacy there and if there is I should like the Minister to tell us what it is.  I read it recently and I wondered if there was any substance in it.  As other Deputies have pointed out, the problem is that there is increasing danger of death on the roads, or accidents of one kind or another largely because of the increased speed of motor cars and the fact that many of our roads cannot meet the needs of these fast cars. Quite often, it seems to me that the <Col N="762" /> slow driver is a greater danger on the roads than the faster driver, particularly the slow driver who drives in the middle of the road and is unwilling to give way to traffic coming behind from either side.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that I approve of the fines on the spot proposition.  I do not know if it is a good proposition.  I do not think it is a good idea for persons dealing with the public having direct money transactions with them whether they are local authority officials, Gardaí or any officials, where it can be avoided.  I think the passing of money in certain circumstances between officials and members of the public should be avoided.  The imposition of fines where necessary should be reserved to the courts.  I think that the on the spot fine proposition could lead to abuse&mdash;not on every occasion. It may show itself to have undesirable consequences and act as a provocation to abuse by either the public or the Gardaí, and for that reason I think it is not a good idea.  The Minister may have good reasons for that suggestion, and I am sure he considered that aspect, but I should like to know if he is quite satisfied that he would not be creating a greater danger than that for which he is trying to find a remedy.  There is already an excessive amount of work in the courts arising out of road traffic offences and perhaps the purpose of the fines on the spot suggestion is to ease that amount of work.</P>
    <P>The main point of interest to me is the decision about the drinking driver rather than the drunken driver.  I suppose the Minister considered the obvious suggestion&mdash;which I understand is the law in Sweden&mdash;that if you drink at all you may not drive.  It seems to me that is a suggestion which would probably be impracticable and impossible to implement.  I suppose the Minister would get very little support inside or outside the House, or from his own or any side of the House, for a proposition that if a person wants to drink he may not drive a car.  That would be the only way we would be certain that people would drive carefully, that there would be no intoxicated drivers on the road, but I suppose <Col N="763" /> from the practical point of view it has to be ruled out.</P>
    <P>It depends how seriously we are concerned about the problem of the intoxicated driver whose judgment has been seriously diminished because he has taken drink and in consequence has caused serious bodily harm to or killed somebody.  If we were sufficiently serious and believed that this very radical suggestion of refusing to allow anyone who drank to drive had merit, we would try to put that proposal into operation.  Assuming the Minister has discarded the proposition for its impracticability, the alternative is to carry on as at present.  That is the choice taken by the Minister on the question of a test for dirnk.</P>
    <P>I was not completely satisfied with the points made by the Minister or his reasons for rejecting the blood test and other important tests.  I wonder if he would give us more substantial grounds for his rejection of some kind of objective test to assess responsibility in the case of a person charged with drunken driving.</P>
    <P>Under the present system, one is left with the evidence of the Gardaí and the members of the medical profession. I do not think any of us have any doubts as to the appalling fallibility of the evidence on both sides.  It is clear too often that the Gardaí appear to be anxious to secure a conviction; equally, it is clear from most evidence one reads, that the medical officer for the defence claims the person was quite capable of driving.</P>
    <P>There is that conflict of evidence which may or may not be conscientious and well-grounded in belief, if not in fact.  In local papers, the cases are reported in more detail.  The more one reads such cases, the more one is left with the impression that the present system is very bad because it leads to the possibility of perjury, certainly false testimony.  It also imposes too great a responsibility on the doctors on either side to decide whether a person is incapable of driving a car because of taking drink or capable of driving a car in spite of the fact that he has taken drink.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> The tests are absurd in most cases&mdash; walking along a straight line, picking up boxes of matches, reciting difficult tongue twisters, remembering the number of one's car, and so on.  All these tests are fallible and liable to misinterpretation.  A person may suffer from bad eyesight, lack of co-ordination, diabetes or from the mental effects of the accident.  An accident can alter a person's personality and certainly facility in co-ordination of action in the difficult little tests one is asked to perform by the Garda.  The fact that the person has been through an accident can be sufficient to alter the degree of accuracy with which he can carry out these tests.  If, in addition, he has taken one bottle of beer, that can alter the whole picture and create the impression that he is incapable of driving a car because of drink.  That, it seems to me, is a failure which leads to various witnesses trying to give their impression of the person's ability to drive, in spite of the fact that he has taken a drink.  It then leaves the district justice the almost impossible task of trying to sort out the truth or falsehood of the evidence or the deliberate intention to mislead.  He then has to make the very serious decision as to whether the person, in his view, was incapable of driving because of having drink taken.</P>
    <P>Usually the defendant appears to get the benefit of the doubt.  He is allowed off and can go on drinking in the hope that he will not get into trouble again.  These people are little the wiser of their experience.  It would seem that getting off in the district court depends very much on your lawyer and that there are those who play around with the evidence in order to try to mislead the court and to secure an acquittal.  All the present tests are completely inadequate.  They are of little real value in assessing the degree of likelihood that a person, because of taking a drink, has been led into the accident.  To continue to retain this very defective test and method of assessing culpability is a serious defect in the Bill and I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> The position will now be rather worsened by virtue of the fact that a serious statutory penalty will be imposed on a person who is found by the court to have caused an accident as a result of taking drink.  There will be increased litigation; there will be more appeals to the higher courts; there will be a continuation of protracted and rather dishonest and sordid differences of opinion in the courts.  Eventually, the benefit of the doubt will be given to the defendant, probably because the justice feels that, whatever his chances were in the past when he could limit his penalty, an obligation is now imposed on him to award a particular penalty which, I understand, is considered by many people to be a serious one.</P>
    <P>With the very limited facilities we are giving to assess culpability&mdash;that is, the existing ones&mdash;undue responsibility is imposed on the justices.  Many of them may feel that, in all the circumstances and in the light of the fact that they cannot be absolutely certain of culpability, unless the person is virtually unconscious, the evidence is not sufficient.  There are, therefore, bound to be more acquittals in the future, because of the burden of the increased penalty than there have been in the past.  One cannot lose sight of the serious implication of a year's disqualification.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the point about the year's disqualification for driving, while under the influence of drink, or dangerous driving causing death or serious bodily harm, I should say it does not seem as serious a penalty as might be imposed.  The fact that a person driving a car has consumed so much drink that he is incapable of driving and kills another person shows the very serious level of irresponsibility on the part of that individual.  I think that shows there is some serious personality defect in that individual.  Disqualification may not be particularly irksome to some of those drivers.  It would be to a lorry driver.  Is there any likelihood that this will have the effect of allowing the district justices to say that the minimum penalty will become the maximum penalty?</P>
    <P>Up to the present, in many cases, <Col N="766" /> people convicted of these offences had a rather more serious penalty imposed upon them&mdash;imprisonment.  Are we going to alter the attitude of the justice to this crime, allow him to feel that the statute provides for a year's disqualification and that that will be sufficient? I am inclined to believe that a certain period spent in what I would call a clinic rather than a prison would be the correct approach to the person found driving a car while so intoxicated as to have lost his sense of decision which would bring him to the position of killing or maiming somebody.  I think that person requires a period of re-education in a clinic or some sort of institution where it would be borne in on him that this is a very serious crime, indeed, and where his sense of responsibility to his fellow-members of the community would be developed so that he would come to accept it was unthinkable for him ever to do it again.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think that the disqualification suggested by the Minister is an inadequate disqualification.  In fact, the conviction should carry a statutory period of isolation in some form of psychiatric or other clinic in which the person would have to undergo treatment for a condition of mind from which he must suffer if he goes out drinking to excess and has an accident in which he either kills or badly maims somebody.</P>
    <P>That is not an unique or unheard-of suggestion.  As most of us know, many of the Scandinavian countries already accept that attitude to drink.  We know that of the many people who appear before the courts very few are convicted.  Many people who should be brought before the courts do not ever get there.  More by good fortune than anything else, they escape serious accidents.  In regard to the question of drinking to the point at which a state of impairing the individual's coordination is reached to the extent that he becomes a dangerous driver liable to kill somebody on the road, the Minister should be very much more ruthless.</P>
    <P>I think he should make it quite clear that this legislation is determined to take that kind of driver off the road, <Col N="767" /> to treat him as a psychopath, as an enemy of the public and to isolate him from the public for a period of from three to six months as the case may be with, of course, disqualification as well for a period of at least one year from holding a licence.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest that, as an alternative to the present method, the Minister should seriously consider the use of the blood test, the breathaliser or some such instrument.  It is quite clear that medical science has reached the stage where it is going to be possible&mdash;indeed, it is already possible&mdash; to assess the alcohol concentration in the blood.  We know that the fallacies or weaknesses in the blood test are said to be that individuals vary in the amounts of alcohol they can carry in their blood and at the same time suffer deterioration in their ability to drive a vehicle.  Secondly, there is the question of the rate of absorption and concentration.</P>
    <P>I think that if people were made aware that some test, breathaliser or blood test was to be carried out and if a person were found to be under the influence of drink while driving, then he would know he would be subjected to this completely objective test.  If more than a certain concentration of alcohol was found to be in the blood &mdash;I understand it would have to be an arbitrary figure&mdash;in excess of this figure, then he would be automatically treated as a person who was driving while drunk.  I think this should be seriously considered in respect of persons who drive dangerously while drunk, persons who cause serious bodily harm and persons who kill someone in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this would mean a very serious incursion on personal rights.  Clearly, we are dealing with a very serious problem in the question of death on the roads, particularly where drink is involved. If a person drinks and drives and has an accident, he cannot complain if the public take some steps to try to protect themselves.  I think the introduction of a test is a permissible step, to try to find out whether a person <Col N="768" /> has been drinking to excess or not. Apparently, the blood test and breathalisers have weaknesses.  There is no doubt that they have weaknesses but I do not think that these compare at all with the fallibility of our present system of assessment of culpability.</P>
    <P>I believe in all the circumstances that in legislation of this kind, which presumably is legislation which will last us for the next 20 years, we should make provision for the inclusion of some kind of scientific test whereby it will be possible for the Garda to go into court and say that the alcoholic content was so much in excess of the limit laid down by us, that the person was guilty, and that that person can have no plea against it and will merit some fixed statutory punishment which we could consider. It seems to me that if we are really serious about frightening the heavy drinking driver off the roads, we have no alternative but greatly to strengthen the hands of the Garda in this case.  If a person has a meal and a bottle of beer and is stopped after an accident, it is quite obvious that it would be difficult to relate the drinking of the bottle of beer to the accident.  Unless some sort of test is made available to the Garda they are in that dilemma of not knowing whether it was one or a dozen drinks a person with a good capacity to hold drink had taken already.  Therefore both suffer&mdash;the innocent person who may have had only one bottle and the Garda who are in the position of not being certain whether to take seriously or not the fact that a person had had a drink.  There is, therefore, a very good case for the introduction of some kind of test.</P>
    <P>If the Minister felt like it, I suppose it would be possible for him to make the test a voluntary one.  I would prefer it to be compulsory.  Would it be possible for him to arrange that the individual charged should ask for a test, the Minister to try to decide what figure would be acceptable to the authorities, one based on scientific assessment?  If the test did not show alcohol in excess of a certain concentration, there would be a very good case for his being found innocent.  If <Col N="769" /> the Minister is not prepared to accept the compulsory test, would he be prepared to allow a voluntary test to be asked for by any person charged with being drunk in charge or with dangerous driving, having taken drink?</P>
    <P>We have, of course, precedents for forcibly isolating people and forcibly taking blood tests where we feel it is in the public interest.  I do not think there is any doubt that it is in the public interest to isolate the heavy drinking driver and put him off the road.  The precedents we have are in the 1947 Health Act where we have the right to put a person in an institution for any particular period, until we are quite certain he is no longer a danger to the public and of course we can, in certain circumstances, take blood tests.  I am not a great believer in such a course and I would not resort to it unless a very good case were made for it but I do believe from our experience over the years, and reading between the lines in most of our court cases, that there is very much more dangerous driving due to people having taken drink than we care to admit.  In those circumstances we are quite justified first of all in introducing some kind of scientific test and, secondly, imposing more serious penalties on a person shown to have been driving a car dangerously or to have brought about serious bodily harm to an individual or killed him.  While I know the question of a test and the fixing of an arbitrary figure, discarding the old ideas which we have had, is an important and serious departure, I believe it is well justified and I would recommend such a proposal to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that I welcome this Bill.  If I have any complaint to make, it is in regard to the delay in introducing the Bill.  It will be exactly four years ago next month since the present Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass, intervened in a debate on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government and made an appeal to the then Minister, myself, to introduce amending <Col N="770" /> legislation.  Having read through this Bill very carefully, and the White Paper, I find that the main heads of the Bill are exactly the same as a Bill drafted four years ago and which was available to the Minister in the Department.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulty that any Minister for Local Government has in drafting a Bill.  I appreciate further that he is not bound in any way to follow any suggestions or proposals which his predecessor may have left. I also appreciate that he has got a number of other Departments to consult, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Justice particularly.  I appreciate his difficulty but still I do not think there was any necessity for this long delay in introducing the Bill.  I am convinced that were it not for the fact that Deputy Dillon and some other Deputies of the Fine Gael Party introduced a Private Members' Bill in regard to lorries we might be still awaiting the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a very important one.  It is a Bill which will be debated at considerable length, especially on Committee Stage.  It is a Committee Bill and I sincerely hope that when we come to discuss it in Committee, it will be left to a free vote of the House and that Deputies will not be bound by Party affiliation.  This is a Bill which will be welcomed by everybody. The Act will be a most important one. It is almost 30 years since the last principal Road Traffic Act was passed. If this Bill is to run for that length of time, it is only right that every section and subsection and every amendment should be debated at length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is the prevention of road accidents.  No matter what legislation is introduced, unless we can put across to the public what the law is, we will get nowhere. A start should be made in the schools to educate the people as to the law on the subject.  I should like to see members of the Garda appointed to <Col N="771" /> give lectures to the various classes in national schools on the main principles of traffic regulations and traffic laws. Within the next 12 months, we are to set up our own television service.  This is an ideal opportunity for television planners to include in their programmes, as other television corporations have done, instruction on the main provisions of road traffic legislation.</P>
    <P>Regular viewers of B.B.C. television know the advantages to be derived from the lessons given on that network on road traffic laws and other branches of the law.  The Ulster T.V. authorities are doing a terrific job in the lessons on road traffic they televise. Our television planners should provide for lessons on road traffic laws for the purpose of eliminating accidents.</P>
    <P>The principal criticism of the Bill I have to make is that we are again falling back on legislation by regulation. I would ask the Minister the number of regulations which have been made under the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  I am convinced that the number is 300 to 500.  It is all very fine to say that the regulations are laid on the Table of the House, but there is not much use in Deputies knowing what the regulations are, unless they can put them across to the public.  The people must know what the regulations are. By means of discussion of the Bill in the House, publication of the debates and discussion with various organisations and individuals, we will get the main sections of the Bill across to the public, but how are the public to be made aware of what is contained in regulations made under the Bill?  The Minister for Local Government may make regulations; the Minister for Justice may make regulations; the Minister for Industry and Commerce may make regulations; and the Commissioner of the Garda may make regulations.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that at the moment only members of the Garda are aware of all the regulations made under the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  When private individuals are prosecuted for breaches of regulations made under the 1933 Act, one is amazed at the ignorance of those regulations, not only on the part <Col N="772" /> of the defendants but on the part of members of the legal profession.  The regulations are procurable only from the Stationery Office.  Unless one is aware that a regulation has been made, one has no hope of procuring a copy if one has not a standing order with the Stationery Office.  Ordinarily, the regulations are issued in pamphlet form in very small print.  They must be correlated with the Road Traffic Act, which is a most difficult code to construe.</P>
    <P>Even if it meant that the Bill would contain many more sections, I would much prefer if all the provisions were contained in the Bill and could be discussed in this House rather than that we should have legislation by regulations, which very few people will have an opportunity of studying or being aware of.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to one of the methods whereby we may avoid road congestion and road accidents.  He referred to road improvements and to dual carriageways.  Unfortunately, it will be many years before we will have dual carriageways on more than a few main roads in the suburbs of cities. The Council of Europe recently published a draft report of the Economic Committee on Road Safety which refers to this question of roads.  I quote from page 10 No. A.S/E.C. 1259:</P>
    <P>Traffic and road engineering has made great progress since the war and road safety considerations have become one of its main concerns. To make roads safer emphasis is laid on adapting the road to the traffic.  This is done by determining the technical properties of the road which have an influence on accidents.</P>
    <P>It goes on to mention the hazards we ought to try to eliminate:</P>
    <P>Some of the hazards of the roads that can be reduced by road engineering are humpbacked and narrow bridges&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>These are two hazards which are very common on our main roads and now, when the necessity for these narrow bridges is being eliminated by the closing down of railway lines in some places, we could possibly go a distance <Col N="773" /> in eliminating these two hazards at a very early stage.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;the acute angle and other crossroads and junctions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>We should take lessons from the Six-Counties in that matter.  They are at the moment eliminating crossroads. Where roads intersect, the crossing from the right on to the main road is not exactly opposite the crossing at the left.  They endeavour to eliminate a direct crossing and eliminate that right angle at a crossroads.  We could do something to eliminate that hazard at very little cost.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>&mdash;sharp and unbanked bends&mdash;</P>
    <P>I think our road planners are doing a fairly good job of that at the moment.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the bad surfaces.</P>
    <P>It will take some time to eliminate those hazards, but it is something we shall have to do and which the Department of Local Government can do with the limited resources at their disposal. When that is done, we shall have gone a long way towards the removal of hazards on the road.  The Garda should be used in a preventive manner more than anything else on the roads, particularly since we have motorised the force. They should endeavour to remove what I might call passing hazards.  For instance, the hazards caused by tinkers parking on the sides of our roads.  The law at the moment does not prevent tinkers camping on the roadside, but it does enable us to prevent their grazing horses on the roadside.  These horses grazing on the roadside are a considerable hazard, and if a patrol car, at night, could endeavour to eliminate that hazard by finding out the owners of those horses and prosecuting them for permitting these animals to wander on the roadside, we would be doing a considerable amount.  We must bear in mind that if a horse is unattended and breaks away from the caravan to which it is attached and wanders on to the roadside, causing <Col N="774" /> a serious crash, the owner of the animal is not liable for any injuries which may arise from his negligence.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to speed limits as one of the methods of eliminating accidents on the road.  I think we are all in favour of speed limits, but he will have to be careful. I note he does make provision for altering the speed limits on certain roadways and for having speed limits at certain times.  I am satisfied that 30 miles per hour, particularly with the modern car of high horse power, is too low a speed even in built-up areas.  For instance, on the road between Dún Laoghaire and Dublin confining the modern car to 30 miles per hour could create bottlenecks in traffic and would defeat the end which we have in view by introducing speed limits.  On the other hand, in other parts of the city 30 miles an hour may be even too high.  Therefore, I am glad the Minister has retained the power to alter the regulations as he sees fit.</P>
    <P>There is one statement in the Minister's speech which I do not like.  I refer to paragraph 2, page 6 of his speech in which he refers to the onus of proof:</P>
    <P>A further subject is the onus of proof clause.  It occurs quite frequently in the Bill.  I am aware that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case against such a clause.  I find, however, that the trend has developed in the courts to require the State to prove matters which the layman may be forgiven for thinking were not really relevant to guilt in a case.  I am not criticising the courts in any way.  The trend is there, however, and we have been faced with prosecutions dismissed on what I would regard as technicalities, and a burden of proof thrown on the State so intensive that enforcement of the law becomes very difficult, if not impossible.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is suggesting is that where there are technicalities the State should not be required to prove them, that the onus is on the defence to disprove them.  Who is to determine what are technicalities?  All the laws of the State since its foundation, all the common law and the statute law, which is now the law of the State, lay down <Col N="775" /> that a man is innocent until proved guilty.  Here we have the thin end of the wedge inserted, that in technicalities there is an onus on the defendant to prove them; otherwise they are presumed not proved.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech admits there is a <i>prima facie</i> case against such a clause.  I would ask him to re-examine this and he may find some simple method of proving what might be called mere technicalities other than throwing the onus on the defence to rebut them.  If such a simple method of proving these mere technicalities could be found I would prefer to see it in the various sections of the Bill to which the Minister refers.  It is a dangerous principle, one we should not encourage.  Once we get into technicalities it is easy to move from that to something else.  Let us never depart from the maxim that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty.</P>
    <P>I am in full agreement with the Minister that driving tests are essential but what kind of driving tests are we to have?  I am convinced that any man who has reached maturity and who has experience of sitting in motor cars can become capable of steering a car, changing gears, braking and of performing such other elementary manoeuvres.  I do not think these elementary things are the causes of accidents and I hope the tests will lay more emphasis on a knowledge of the rules of the road because, in my opinion, the lack of that knowledge is the major cause of accidents.</P>
    <P>The Minister also has suggested that there be a test on certain vehicles over a certain age.  I do not know whether we should confine it to old cars.  I should like again to refer to the Draft Report of the Economic Committee on Road Safety of the Council of Europe, which says at page 15:</P>
    <P>Many accidents which result in catastrophe are due to purely mechanical causes.  The most common defects include brakes, improper lights, blow-out of tyres, unsafe steering mechanism....</P>
    <P>That Report lays down that there must <Col N="776" /> be certain international standards in the mechanism and equipment of motor cars.  If we had that it would go a good distance towards eliminating accidents due to mechanical defects.  It is not necessary to have an old car to have bad brakes, improper lights, blow-out of tyres or unsafe steering mechanism.  If we are to have a test on cars at all, it should not be confined to old cars.  We should provide that any car may be examined.  We see some cars of pre-war vintage which are much safer than some of the post-war models. Tests should not be confined to a particular class of car.</P>
    <P>May I mention direction signals? Surely it should be possible for the Department to get some agreement with car assemblers whereby only standard direction signals will be fitted. I remember a case not long ago where a car, with one of these flashing direction signals, was about to turn left and as it did so a lady motor-cyclist shot up and crashed into it on the left. Questioned as to why she did not see the signal, she said: &ldquo;I did, but I thought it was a short circuit of your tail light.&rdquo;  That is true.  One can understand that a person not familiar with these blinking signals can easily mistake their meaning.  It would be helpful if we had some standard signal and also if such a standard signal were made the subject of the lesson, to which reference was made, and possibly of a television programme. That might help to eliminate accidents and anything that would tend to achieve that aim would be helpful.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest that instead of annual licences, motorists should be able to take out licences for two or three years?  Many times, many of us overlook renewing our licence simply because we forget the date of expiry but if we were permitted to take out licences for three or four years&mdash;paying the appropriate amount for the period&mdash;it would be very useful and would result in savings for the local authorities as some of them send out renewal notices to motorists within their jurisdiction.  That would save them sending renewal notices annually and would ensure that certain moneys would be made available and that drivers would not overlook renewals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> Under the 1933 Road Traffic Act, and under this Bill, provision is made for the endorsement of licences. Speaking as one with considerable experience, I want to point out that the Minister and the Legislature under the Act gave discretionary power to the district justice, who found it necessary to inflict the punishment of endorsement of licence and suspension, as to the removal of that endorsement pending the hearing of an appeal.  In any conviction under any statute other than the Road Traffic Act, once notice of appeal is served there is a stay on all consequential results of the conviction.  You then appear on appeal, just as you appeared on the original summons, without any stigma and without having suffered any penalty.</P>
    <P>Under the Road Traffic Act and under this Bill, the justice must endorse your licence but he may refuse to remove the endorsement, pending the hearing of an appeal.  The Minister may say that is within the discretion of the justice and I am glad to say that from the passing of the Act until about 1936, district justices did use that discretion and in at least 90 per cent. of cases, once notice of appeal was served, the justice removed or said he would remove the endorsement pending the appeal.  But since 1936, for some unknown reason&mdash;I often suspected it was a direction from the Department of Justice&mdash;in 99 per cent. of the cases in which there has been a conviction, particularly for drunken driving, the justice refuses to remove the endorsement, pending the appeal.</P>
    <P>I knew a case where a man was convicted in the month of November under Section 30 of the Act of being drunk in charge of a motor car.  His licence was suspended for 12 months and he immediately appealed against the decision but the district justice refused to remove the suspension. That appeal could not be heard until the sitting of the circuit court in the following March.  Meantime, for five months his licence was suspended and, as he was a commercial traveller, he had to employ a driver.  On appeal, the circuit court judge reversed the <Col N="778" /> decision, as he was satisfied that the man was not drunk.  He dismissed the summons but could not compensate the man for the money he had spent employing a driver for five months.  I think that defeats the purpose of the appeal.</P>
    <P>We should endeavour to bring an accused person or defendant before the circuit court and give him a trial <i>de novo</i> without having this punishment inflicted on him in the meantime and I ask the Minister to amend the section by saying: &ldquo;The justice shall remove the suspension on service of notice of appeal.&rdquo;  If he could not go so far, the Minister might say that the justice, for some sufficient reason, may remove the suspension.  If he put such a directive in the Bill, it might assist justices in using their discretion. We can look into it in detail, perhaps, on Committee Stage and in the meantime perhaps the Minister himself would look into it.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has incorporated fines-on-the-spot in the Bill, although I think the term is a misnomer. I am afraid I was personally responsible for that.  When I decided to introduce a Traffic Bill, I found opposition to this section from every official in the Department.  I found considerable opposition from my colleagues in the Cabinet and I congratulate the Minister on being able to convince, not only his own Department but also his colleagues in the Government.  It is an excellent idea but it is a pity we did not find a better name for it.</P>
    <P>I once heard the former Deputy Cowan say in this House that on one occasion a district justice in the Dublin District Court heard 300 motoring offences in one day.  I checked that and found it was true. Most of the cases were undefended; most were parking offences; and in most of them the same penalty was imposed.  That, in my opinion, first of all takes up the time of the court and if a defendant appears either in person or through his solicitor, it takes up his time and possibly some of his money if he employs a solicitor.</P>
    <P>With fewer trains running, we have <Col N="779" /> more cars coming from the country to the city and it will take a considerable time for the parking regulations&mdash; which change not only from time to time but from hour to hour&mdash;to become known.  One can easily imagine motorists from West Cork or Donegal breaking the parking regulations unwittingly. They go home and a week or ten days later, they get a summons. They can then decide to appear in Court and explain the position; or they can employ a solicitor to act for them or they can ignore the whole thing.  Very often when such a summons is ignored, the justice treats the matter as two charges: a breach of the parking regulations and contempt of Court in refusing to recognise the summons of the Court, and a justice may, and very often does, impose a fine, taking into account the fact that the summons was ignored.  If such a motorist had the option of paying the fine, I think he would opt to do so straight away.</P>
    <P>The suggestion the Minister has made is an ideal one.  A Garda finds you parked in the wrong place; he serves a notice informing you of the offence and the penalty involved.  He cannot take the fine from you and neither can any other Garda.  You have 14 days, or whatever the period will be, within which to call at any barracks and pay the fine and the Garda there will give you a receipt and retain a duplicate to be forwarded to the authorities in Dublin.  If you think you are in the right, you may ignore the notice.  After the prescribed period, a summons will issue and it is then your own look-out as to whether or not you will defend the suit or appear at the hearing.  You have, however, the option of paying the fine. There will be no personal contact between the offender and the Garda who is prosecuting.  I do not believe there could be any abuse in this and it will have the merit of saving considerable time.  It will avoid cluttering up the Courts and save motorists a great deal of inconvenience.  The Minister will make regulations prescribing the offences and the fines.  I hope that it will be possible at some stage to increase the offences schedules.  That <Col N="780" /> would be an excellent thing and something which would be welcomed by all.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 104, under Sections 50 and 51 of the 1933 Act&mdash; Section 50 deals with careless driving and Section 51 with dangerous driving &mdash;some difficulty arises.  For the prosecution to succeed in a charge of careless or dangerous driving, the defendant must be informed at the time of the accident that he will be prosecuted.  If he is not so informed, there is a period of 14 days in which to serve notice of intention to prosecute. If neither course is taken, no proceedings can be instituted.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but this would appear to be a point for discussion on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to bring to the notice of the Minister is the fact that those provisions are being added to by this measure.  Under this Bill, not only must these notices be given, but, if they are not given, there is an alternative: a summons may be served within 14 days.  I cannot understand why a summons should be served within 14 days and also these notices, verbal or written.  It may have operated in the Minister's mind that service of the notice had to be personal service and if a defendant evaded service, no prosecution would lie.  If that is what is in the Minister's mind, then I agree with him as to the necessity for this provision.  I think he could have met the difficulty, however, by legislating for service of the notice other than personally. I think that would be a good thing because summonses do not contain the same kind of particulars as notices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall give a specific example.  Take the position of a person who comes in every day from Dún Laoghaire to Dublin. Coming in some day, he may pass out a car in a dangerous or careless manner.  He may not himself have noticed what he was doing.  A Garda may have seen the incident, or the other motorist.  If that man is on the road every day, unless the incident is brought to his notice within a very short time after its occurrence, the chances are <Col N="781" /> that he will have great difficulty in recalling it when it comes to explaining his action before a district justice.  If he is warned at the time, he knows he has committed an offence.  If he is served with a summons which merely states that he drove in a careless or dangerous manner, he will not have sufficient data to recollect the particular incident and he may have great difficulty in preparing a defence.  The Minister should look into that and provide, if possible, that notice will be served in some way other than personally. We could then do without that provision altogether.</P>
    <P>On the question of insurance, the Minister informed us in the White Paper that he would introduce compulsory insurance for all passengers in cars.  I am sorry he has dropped that proposal.  I would ask him to reconsider the position.  I think it is essential in these days of congested roads, of high-powered motor cars and of accidents that all people who are liable to become involved in these accidents should have the benefit of insurance.  Am I wrong in suggesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be no harm if I put this matter right.  Not only is the Deputy wrong but, for some peculiar reason, quite a number of other Deputies appear to have got the same idea.  There is no question of its being dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably my reading of the Minister's speech.  However, I am very glad indeed to hear from the Minister that compulsory insurance is not being dropped.  I do not think the additional premium will add very much for the motorist and I am glad the Minister has decided to retain this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter to which I should like to refer is the question of the right of local authorities to recover the expenses which an injured party may incur as a result of an accident.  One is involved in a motor accident, is brought to a district or county hospital and is nursed there for some months.  That person is entitled to free medical treatment and, following his discharge from hospital, brings an action against the <Col N="782" /> person responsible for putting him in hospital.  He may recover personal damages, but the unfortunate ratepayers, who pay for his maintenance and keep in the hospital, are prohibited from suing for damages under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe this will have a serious effect on the rates.  In my opinion, it is being used to subsidise negligence. I know the Minister will say: &ldquo;There is a duty on the local authority to provide free medical treatment for that individual because he is in the lower income group and has got a medical card.&rdquo;  But the holder of that medical card would not have to go into hospital at all were it not for the negligence of some person or other, and surely that person or other should indemnify the ratepayer who provides the free medical treatment for him in the hospital? Up to the present ratepayers were entitled to recover, and I do not think we should permit the wrongdoer to inflict this extra burden on them.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the section in the present Bill which is in substitution for the old Section 30, dealing with drunken driving.  Let me say at the outset I am all in favour of severe penalties being imposed on any person convicted of driving a car while drunk.  I want that to be clear, but I want it also to be clear that I am not in favour of leaning over too far towards the prosecution, and I speak from experience.  Deputy Dr. Browne referred this afternoon to conflicting medical evidence.  Medical evidence given for the prosecution and medical evidence given for the defence very often conflict.  But I am thinking of the case where there is no medical evidence.</P>
    <P>When a doctor gives evidence of tests carried out by him in an endeavour to come to a conclusion as to whether a man is drunk or otherwise, he specifies the tests through which he has put the individual.  He may be cross-examined on them and on the reactions of the individual to the tests.  But suppose there is no medical evidence.  Our district justices have now held that all that is necessary is that a Garda should swear <Col N="783" /> that in his opinion the defendant was drunk within the meaning of the section.  That Garda need not put the defendant through any test whatever. Once the Garda swears that he is satisfied that the defendant was drunk within the meaning of the section, there is an onus on the district justice to convict the defendant.  A practice is creeping in just now whereby the Garda do not send for the doctor.  In cases of dispute, advantage is taken of the section as it stands, whereby the Garda may give his opinion and his opinion is accepted.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister lay down some regulations in this matter. In isolated parts of rural Ireland it is impossible at a late hour of night to get a doctor to examine a man as to the amount of drink he has consumed. It may be held that, by the time the doctor gets there, the man has had sufficient time to recover from the influence of the drink he had consumed. Some simple tests should be applied by the Garda.  It should not be sufficient to say: &ldquo;In my opinion, that man was suffering from such consumption of alcohol as would render him incapable of driving a car.&rdquo;  Some simple tests should be imposed, such as making the defendant write his name and address and the number of his driving licence, which would give the district justice an opportunity of comparing the writing at the time of the alleged offence with the defendant's writing at the time of the hearing.  We should not just leave the matter where it stands, that a man may have his driving licence suspended for twelve months and have very severe penalties inflicted on him merely on the opinion of the Garda as to the amount of drink he had consumed.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy T. F. O'Higgins who mentioned that we should make some provision for the expenses of an acquitted defendant. Any defendant who defends a case and has to pay legal fees knows the burden they are.  But it is worse when a defendant has to bring a number of witnesses, possibly professional witnesses, from a distance to give evidence on his behalf.  It may be suggested <Col N="784" /> that this might become a legal ramp. I am not suggesting that the solicitor should get costs&mdash;I would not like to make that suggestion&mdash;but I am suggesting the defendant should be paid the legitimate expenses he incurred in bringing witnesses to prove his innocence when charges such as these are preferred against him.  I should like to see the Minister looking into this matter.  The cost would not amount to a lot.  Very often the expense of bringing witnesses acts as a deterrent to the defendant, who may plead guilty in the hope of getting away with a nominal penalty rather than incur the expense of pleading not guilty.  With the penalties we are imposing under this section, and taking into account the trouble and expense to which a defendant must go to prove himself innocent, provision should be made now at least to pay him his expenses.</P>
    <P>There is another provision in the Bill which I do not like.  That is the provision which says that in drunk-in-charge cases the district justice must impose sentence &ldquo;unless special reasons are given&rdquo;.  He must impose it.  With the exception of murder, in no criminal conviction in this State that I know of, is there an implied&mdash; not an implied&mdash;a compulsory penalty of imprisonment, not even for manslaughter. A man may be found guilty of manslaughter by a jury but there is no compulsion to send him to jail.  Here we are imposing a sentence of imprisonment &ldquo;...unless the court is satisfied...&rdquo;  Why not leave it to the discretion of the court itself, and say that the court may, if satisfied, impose a jail sentence?  Why say the court must impose it &ldquo;... unless it is satisfied...?&rdquo;  That is cutting across the discretion of our courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister could provide that the courts may, in their discretion, impose a jail sentence, but he provides here that the court must impose a sentence of imprisonment &ldquo;... unless the court is satisfied...&rdquo;  That is highly objectionable and cuts across criminal law practice which leaves it to the courts to exercise their discretion with regard to punishment.  The Minister should look into that matter.  It may be that <Col N="785" /> that was not the intention of the drafters of this legislation, but it is a matter about which the Minister should be satisfied before he embodies it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A Deputy mentioned compulsion on motor cyclists to wear helmets.  I know there are many reasons why they do not do so.  We have no standard helmets, but the Minister should take steps to ensure that standard helmets are manufactured or imported, and he should insist on these helmets being used.  If he does, he will eliminate some of the dangers to which unhelmeted motor cyclists leave themselves open.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is really a Committee Stage Bill.  I hope there will be discussions on every section.  I hope further that in dealing with amendments, the Party Whips will not be applied, that from this Bill we may evolve an Act which will endure as long as the 1933 Act, and that it will be unnecessary for another 28 or 30 years to legislate to amend our road traffic laws.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening statement, the Minister said that the purpose of this Bill was to reduce the number of accidents and to secure a more efficient use of the roads.  I do not suppose there is any Deputy who will disagree with those sentiments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have before us now a very long Bill greatly amending existing road traffic legislation.  I am somewhat dubious as to whether a Bill which imposes many penalties will have the desired effect of achieving, as the Minister said, a reduction in the number of accidents and a more efficient use of the roads.  It is unfortunate that no one considers penalties, or gives any cognisance to the fact that penalties are increased, until he finds himself up against it.  In other words, the fact that we impose penalties does not necessarily mean that we will achieve the objects we set out to achieve.  I cannot help feeling that a more educative approach to road accidents, road traffic and the whole position generally, would be likely to be far more beneficial than a long Act imposing mandatory and increased penalties, and giving increased <Col N="786" /> powers to the custodians of the law, the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to take a look at the approach to this problem in other countries.  It has been discussed extensively in Europe in relation to policy as a whole.  Slaughter on the roads in Europe, where the traffic is considerably more dense than it is here, has made people realise that it is essential to do something.  Unified action has been taken to try to deal with this problem.  In all countries, there are extensive discussions on the radio, extensive newspaper articles, and television and travel films have been used in an effort to impress upon people the tremendous dangers they face when they go on the roads.  Not only is all that directed at motorists but it puts the problem before pedestrians and cyclists who are themselves as dangerous on the roads as the motorists.</P>
    <P>On reading this Bill and the White Paper, it seems to me that the idea of the Minister and his advisers is that if we put the crocks off the roads, we will greatly improve the situation.  If we put the crocks off the roads, there will be an outcry in rural Ireland.  In my own county, there are quite a number of old cars which are just able to tip along in their own time, and are not able to keep pace with modern traffic.  If this course of action is adopted and old cars are put off the roads, I can envisage quite a number of people in my county who cannot afford high-powered cars finding themselves, at the dictate of the Garda Síochána or local authority officials, no longer able to drive their cars because they are considered unsafe.</P>
    <P>It is my duty as a Deputy to give my views about the cause of accidents. I do not agree with the principle of putting slow cars off the road. I do not think that is fair to the individual and I think it is creating a sort of class warfare amongst motorists as a whole.  Drivers of slow cars, which come under the heading of crocks, should be instructed and advised that they should keep well in to their own side of the road.  One cause of accidents is that if there is a slow car out in the middle of the road, or near the <Col N="787" /> middle of the road, it is very difficult for the fast-moving traffic to pass. People get impatient and that is a cause of accidents.</P>
    <P>Another thing which I think causes accidents&mdash;it is very dangerous and it is ignorance which causes them to do it&mdash;is that people do not dim their lights when sitting on the tail of another car.  There is nothing more annoying than to have a car behind you which keeps coming up on you, because the driver will not slow down at corners as any cautious driver will, and sits on your tail with lights full on, blinding you against oncoming traffic.  I do not know if this mass of legislative proposals will make dimming obligatory.  Not only should people dim when approaching but also when coming up behind traffic and about to pass it out.  It is very difficult to enforce compulsory dimming. A car passes so quickly that you cannot take the number, nor is it possible to turn round and pursue him and take an action against him for not dimming his lights.</P>
    <P>It is known that the people responsible for accidents have been driving all their lives.  Those of us who claim to be good drivers or who claim to try to keep the situation safe, have to take action almost every day to avoid some person driving around a corner at 50 m.p.h. and maybe with his wheels practically off the ground.  It is easy to drive fast and yet carefully.  It would seem that there is no reason why a person should not be able to drive his car on the open road at the full pace it can achieve.  To drive fast around corners is one way of causing an accident. Then we have the driver who will take a chance at a blind corner. Accidents would not happen so frequently if people were instructed on these matters.  Such an approach would bring about greater safety on our roads.</P>
    <P>U.N.E.S.C.O. considered compulsory instruction in schools but did not succeed in getting a majority of countries in favour of it.  It was held that in view of the heavily-loaded school curriculum, there was not time for that extra subject.  However, there are countries in which compulsory instruction <Col N="788" /> in schools is in existence. France is one such country.  In recent years, there has been a considerable reduction in road accidents there.  I am sure it would be no use to suggest compulsory instruction on road sense and road traffic in our schools, as it is frequently impressed upon us that our school curriculum at present is full.</P>
    <P>We have fewer radio talks on traffic in Ireland than in some other countries. I do not know if we shall have television instruction.  Across the water, there are frequent reconstructions of road traffic accidents.  The public see how they occur.  It brings the point home to drivers and helps to make them more cautious.  I remember seeing a truck draw up in London at the corner of a street.  An accident was reconstructed and an enormous crowd watched.  There was a very fine portrayal of how and why the accident took place.</P>
    <P>On the road, say, from Dublin to Wexford, large sums of money have been spent on the removal of corners with a view to creating greater safety. The Great North Road going out of London which allows about eight lines of traffic was supposed to do away with accidents for all time. Shortly after its opening, there were more accidents on those miles and miles of long straight stretches than there had ever been before.</P>
    <P>I understand that the road down towards Kildare has been straightened, and that every corner has been eliminated but that the accident rate has gone up rather than down.  Many accidents take place by reason of car lights. At night, on a long straight stretch of road on which there may be literally dozens of cars coming towards you, it stands to reason that there must be some blind spots.  That position can be eased.  In the past few years, there has been a considerable attempt in Europe to create artificial bends for the safety of the motoring public.</P>
    <P>We have not sufficient danger signs on our roads.  Our signs are not extensive enough, nor are they displayed at the correct angle.  Quite a number of our signs have been lowered but many of them are still right up in the air.  In Dublin the bus stop signs are too high, which is an inconvenience for <Col N="789" /> traffic.  It can cause a bottling-up of traffic which is always dangerous and productive of accidents.</P>
    <P>We do not make enough use of luminous paints on our signs.  France, Germany, Britain and other countries concentrate on luminous signs particularly at the approaches to corners, or corkscrew bends.  There are large luminous signs which no driver can miss seeing.  We seem shy of luminous paint in Ireland though we have quite a lot of &ldquo;matchsticks&rdquo; which in foggy weather, and so on, give an indication of corners.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies spoke about the time of Gardaí being taken up on trivial offences.  Hours must be wasted every day in Dublin city putting notices on cars or speaking to people about parking offences.  The Dublin public are long-suffering.  Traffic there has been growing steadily over the years.  I know of no new parking facilities in Dublin city in recent years and how people are expected to avoid committing parking offences when they have nowhere to park is beyond my comprehension.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he hopes to reduce accidents and to secure a more efficient use of the roads.  There is no attempt to meet that situation in Dublin city.  Take a person who comes into the city late any morning and who has business to do.  Where is he to park? Where are the people who come up from the country to do a bit of shopping in Dublin to park?  Out in Rathmines, Rathgar or some of the other suburbs. They may walk the rest of the way in. They come up from the country with a limited amount of time at their disposal and there is not a solitary parking place left anywhere.  I do not think that anybody can gainsay that.  There has been no rational attempt to deal with that problem.  It may not be a matter which is entirely the concern of the Minister but it is a matter in regard to which he should have consultation with his Department.  The sooner he pays attention to that problem the better.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government last year, I suggested that we had no lay-bys in this country such as one <Col N="790" /> finds in Scotland and elsewhere.  Quite a considerable amount of indignation was aroused on the Fianna Fáil benches because it was said there were no lay-bys here.  Several Deputies said there were quite a number.  I said I would be pleased to know where the lay-bys were.  I am still waiting to be told.  For the benefit of those who may not know what a lay-by is, might I give this explanation?  When travelling along a main road and you want to park, as people do, particularly during the tourist season or, indeed, at any time throughout the year, if there is a lay-by in existence, when you get out of your car, there is some place into which you can push your car off the main road.  It is a very simple thing to provide.  All it means is having a small run in and out, such as you see at garages.  These lay-bys could be on the main road at regular intervals.  The Minister would be quite in order to introduce legislation making it compulsory to use these lay-bys instead of parking on the roads. If he did that, a lot of accidents would be avoided.</P>
    <P>The question of big lorries parked on the roads is a serious one.  They are the cause of many serious accidents. Would the Minister consider making it compulsory&mdash;it would not cost a lot of money&mdash;to have the tail of lorries painted white or treated with luminous paint?  If that were done, there would be an end to this problem of people crashing into lorries parked on the roads.  Big lorries parked in dark suburbs or, indeed, anywhere on our roads without any rear illumination are the cause of accidents. Many lives could be saved by having the lorries illuminated at the back. One often meets a lorry on the road with a big trailer after it.  A car passes that and the headlights are on. The dimming may not be as effective as that on an ordinary car.  When you pass, there is no indication that there is a long trailer behind the lorry.  Accidents&mdash;and often fatal accidents&mdash;have happened by people cutting in in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>A word should be said about pedestrians.  It was only today, when coming into Leinster House, that I <Col N="791" /> saw, outside the House, the most superb piece of driving on the part of a motor cyclist to save a person from being killed in circumstances where a fatal accident would have been the fault not of the driver of the vehicle but of the pedestrian.  The pedestrian in question walked right across the path of the motor cyclist; how the driver pulled up I do not know.  European statistics show that 27 per cent. of all accidents are caused by pedestrians. Any legislation which imposes on pedestrians the obligation to preserve the safety of the road is desirably necessary.  It is not the motorist who is always at fault.  Very often it is the pedestrian's own fault that he gets killed.  For that reason pedestrians should be instructed.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to what I said at the outset of my remarks.  The drive should be to educate the public. If the public are not educated, you will not reduce accidents and you will not make the roads safe.  No doubt this Bill will be extensively discussed on Committee Stage.  That will be of no avail unless, in addition to making use of punitive measures, we have the fullest possible information given to the public, whether motorists, pedestrians or cyclists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make only a few comments on the Bill.  The Bill was on the stocks when the Minister took over.  This is the same measure, except for a few extra sections the Minister has added, as the Bill which was on the stocks when we left office. Members have made statements that they are in favour of driving tests but all the experts at the time were entirely against driving tests.  They held that an attempt to educate the driver to have patience and courtesy on the road was more important than driving tests.  Even in the very Government services themselves, it was found that drivers who passed the driving test were responsible for a greater number of accidents than those who had no driving tests.  The Minister made a speech on the Local Government Bill in 1958 and said that, regardless of what the experts might <Col N="792" /> say, he personally was in favour of having a test for drivers and was going to bring it into operation.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner of the Garda made a very important statement quite recently.  I am sure he made that statement having had the benefit of the advice and experience of Gardaí in connection with motor traffic in Dublin and elsewhere.  He pointed out that the new driver rarely had an accident unlike the driver who had driving tests.  He suggested that the driver should be educated to have patience, not to blow the horn excessively and not to attempt to pass lorries or cars on a hill.  He also suggested that drivers should be educated by means of instructions.  I think the Minister has already issued a leaflet of instruction in regard to road safety for drivers.  In England and Northern Ireland, where they have these driving tests, there is a greater number of accidents.  The driver who has a test believes he can drive at 60 and 80 miles an hour because he regards himself as an expert driver.  The man who has not had a driving test is most careful not to attempt to pass at a speed of 40 or 50 miles an hour.  If he has received instructions, he will not attempt to pass a car on a hill or on a bend.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde wants parking places along the main roads.  I do not know what width you would require for a main road to have such parking places to cater for traffic such as that which we have on the Dublin-Wexford road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what other Deputies may say I am against the renewal or restoration of licences when people have been convicted of driving under the influence of drink.  I know the pressure that can be exerted, that the poor man is out of employment and so on, and I am glad that the power is taken out of the Minister's hands.  It is most embarrassing for a Minister who has got to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The Minister has no power now, once the judge decides. Some Deputies say that the penalties are too severe.  I maintain that if a man is summoned for driving a car while under the influence of drink, there should be no sympathy for him from <Col N="793" /> any source.  If people are warned that they will lose their licences, and perhaps lose their employment as a result, if they take their cars out while under the influence of drink, then possibly we will be able to eliminate this evil.</P>
    <P>The whole Bill aims at protecting people on the roads.  I have been driving for 30 or 40 years along one of the busiest roads in the country and I know the trouble caused by pedestrians walking on the road.  I appeal to the Minister to impose a condition, when making grants available for trunk roads, that the county engineer shall provide a path for pedestrians so that they will not be a danger to themselves and to motorists.  Outside Bray in the old days, when there were only horses and carts and no motors, there were such paths which were looked after by the local contractor each year.  Now there are stones, the remains of tar barrels and briers where the footpaths were and people have no alternative but to walk on the road.</P>
    <P>If a driver meets another vehicle on the Wicklow side, he has to pull up if that vehicle does not dim its lights, because there are no footpaths and when the driver proceeds again, immediately after the other vehicle has passed, he will find pedestrians on the road in front of him.  That is true especially where you have people returning to the villages from the cinemas or other places of entertainment. Some of the people I meet at night-time carry lamps for their own protection but they are only few in number.  They carry them because we have made the main roads into racing tracks for the motorist with no concern at all for the pedestrian.  I raised this matter time after time on the public board of which I was a member and I think from the remarks he made some time ago that the Minister did make a recommendation.  What is the position?  The engineer did try to make a path but it was left in such a condition that the pedestrians are no better off.</P>
    <P>I think all members of the House welcome this Bill and we all hope it will achieve what it sets out to do and that it will eliminate accidents.  In regard to unlighted lorries, the Minister <Col N="794" /> should have some power to compel lorries of over three tons to have a helper who could carry an extra light. If a fuse goes or if a mishap occurs and the driver has to pull in to the grass margin, he will have the helper there with his lamp or torch to warn other users of the road that he is carrying out repairs.  In that way, we might be able to avoid these accidents. I have met a number of these lorries parked along the road because the fuses had gone and they had no helper to warn the people that repairs were being carried out.</P>
    <P>Tests for defective cars are also mentioned.  Who will carry out these tests?  In England, they are carried out in the garages.  Will they be done here by the Guards or will they be done in garages?  In England, a garageman interested in supplying a new car may condemn a car which is in for a test, but if the owner goes to another garage, he may find that it passes the test.  I am not in favour of &ldquo;old crocks&rdquo; being on the roads.  I believe it would be in the interests of motorists to ensure that their cars are safe for themselves and others.</P>
    <P>I hope that on the Committee Stage of this Bill no pressure will be put on the Minister in regard to the offence of driving under the influence of drink and that no excuses will be made for individuals who may be penalised for not observing the law.  There was a reference to lady drivers, but if you are leaving Dublin at 11 p.m., as I do, you will find that it is the young men in the two-seaters who do 60 to 70 miles an hour and try to pass other drivers along the road who are the danger.  I cannot understand why there are so many accidents at one particular place, because it is well lighted and it is wide but it is near the Dublin area and people are returning from dances and other places of amusement, travelling at 60 miles an hour.  They find there is other traffic along the road and when they go to pull up, they find they are into a bollard or into the ditch.  This place is on the Donnybrook side and there is no turn, the road being straight and the lighting good.  In regard to ladies driving even late at night-time, they <Col N="795" /> are most careful and keep to their own side of the road, but we have a number of motorists travelling along that stretch who think they are on a racetrack and try to do 60 or 70 miles an hour.  They pass out their friends and then create a jam at a narrow spot on the road.</P>
    <P>Everyone should welcome this Bill, in the knowledge that we are trying to remove some of the causes of accidents. I would appeal to the Minister, when he is making grants available to county councils, to insist on paths being provided.  I would even suggest that special grants should be made for that purpose.  For instance, from Wicklow to Wexford, there are tar barrels where there should be paths.  There is no place for people to walk, other than the main road. That is a cause of accidents.  If the Minister insists on county councils doing their part, lives may be saved. A fortnight ago, a man who had to walk on the road because there was no path suffered serious injury by being involved in a car crash.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will receive the co-operation of all the people and that it will help to save life on the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>All that a Deputy can hope to do on the Second Stage of a Bill of this kind is to try to generalise on it.  A number of useful points have been made in connection with various provisions but at this stage I feel it would not be appropriate to deal with them.  The Bill is a very extensive measure and can best be dealt with fully on Committee Stage.  I have just a few general points to make now in regard to two or three of its provisions.</P>
      <P>First, I want to congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this comprehensive Bill which deals with all aspects of modern traffic problems. Opposition speakers have told us that the draft of this Bill was in the Department for a considerable period while they were in office but they have not explained why they did not introduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is as comprehensive as it could be in existing circumstances and it would appear that the Minister <Col N="796" /> spared no time or trouble in examining proposals put before him before the measure was finally drafted.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister particularly on publishing the White Paper some months ago explaining the proposals.  That gave the public an opportunity of putting forward advance criticism.  I am glad to note that some of the criticism that was forthcoming was constructive and that the Minister was able to embody in the Bill certain proposals that were made.</P>
    <P>The part of the Bill with which I wish to deal is that part which refers to compulsory insurance.  We all know that prior to the 1933 Act, there was no compulsory insurance for mechanically-propelled vehicles in this country and that the number of vehicles voluntarily insured was only about 15 per cent.  of the total number registered. That Act provided for compulsory insurance of all vehicles licensed for road use.  With the passage of time, various anomalies have come to light in regard to many aspects of the insurance position.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the matter briefly in his opening statement.  He said:</P>
    <P>The 1933 Act provided for compulsory cover for passengers only in the case of public service vehicles. Section 65 enables the Minister for Local Government by regulations to specify the classes of vehicles to which compulsory passenger cover will apply.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Minister is favourably disposed to consider the introduction, in due course, of appropriate regulations whereby compulsory third party insurance will carry with it an obligation of additional cover for passenger risk.  I have very strong views in that regard.  I feel it is a requirement that should have been introduced many years ago.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, all vehicle owners subject to compulsory insurance normally carry insurance to cover injuries to passengers but there is what is know as an &ldquo;Act&rdquo; policy issued by insurance companies to cover third party only.  If the insured's claims <Col N="797" /> record is not satisfactory the insuring company will offer an &ldquo;Act&rdquo; policy only, that is, a third party policy only, not covering passengers.  That puts the insured in a very difficult position because the cover is of very little use to him.  Third party cover in itself is practically of no use unless passengers are covered.</P>
    <P>The question of insurance is closely connected with this Bill.  The previous Acts and this Bill put the obligation on the owner of a mechanically-propelled vehicle to provide at least third party insurance for that vehicle and in the case of public service vehicles, also to provide passenger indemnity.  When we are putting that obligation on the motoring public or on the owners of any type of mechanically-propelled vehicle, I submit we are obliged to ensure that they are put in a position to get that cover at reasonable terms. There is one very important aspect that I had hoped the Bill would cover, that is, the prohibitive terms imposed by insurance companies for third party cover where the applicant has an unfavourable claims record.</P>
    <P>No reasonable person could blame an insurer for specifying reasonable restricted terms where the claims experience is not satisfactory but we should guard against the insurance company or guarantee company providing such cover being a law unto itself in that regard.  As far as I understand they may impose any terms such as compulsory excesses, loading the premium or restricting parts of the indemnity. The insured-to-be has no alternative but to take what is offered. Worse still, even though there is supposed to be healthy competition between the companies who deal in this type of insurance, one finds that the terms imposed by one company are strictly adhered to by the next company to which one offers the business. There should be some form of appeal set up under the control of the Minister to which an aggrieved person could apply to have the terms reviewed, where circumstances so warranted.  At the moment, a person requiring insurance cover has no alternative to paying whatever premium is imposed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour this matter at <Col N="798" /> this stage but I do hope the Minister will take note of my remarks.  Once he is imposing the obligation on vehicle owners to provide cover, he should see that that cover is available on reasonable terms.  It is my opinion that the proper body to carry third party insurance is the State.  There would be many advantages in that.  First of all, the handling charges of the insurance would be considerably reduced and there would be a very decided advantage in the case of a claim coming to court because the State is usually better able to fight a claim than a private commercial concern.  The general experience in relation to insurance over the past 25 years is that premiums have increased by 100 per cent.  Something should be done about this matter and I suggest that this is an appropriate occasion for the Minister to examine the question.</P>
    <P>There has always been quite a lot of confusion with regard to the certificates of insurance which are issued by insurance concerns.  These instruments of insurance usually carry on the top right-hand corner a reference which indicates, as far as insurance companies are concerned, the type of cover that is provided.  For the officers of the law who are charged with the responsibility of examining these certificates, these references carry no meaning.  Standard prescribed references, irrespective of the company issuing certificates, should be provided on these certificates.  The members of the Garda who have to examine these certificates must find it very difficult to know whether the required cover is provided or not.  I know people who are associated with the insurance business for a number of years and very often if you query them on a technical point of that kind, they may find it difficult to answer.  There are at least a dozen major different type of risks that have to be provided for, depending on the use of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to consider standardising these certificates according to the category of cover provided, so that police officers examining them will know whether the vehicle is properly covered in respect of insurance. I am inclined to think there are quite <Col N="799" /> a few mechanically-propelled vehicles on the road which are not properly insured at all.  I am not referring to private hire cars because these are subject to special regulations in regard to mechanical order and have insurance certificates carrying a certain standard cover.  There is only one type of risk to be covered there, but an ordinary private car carries a multiplicity of risks, depending on the use the owner makes of it.  For instance, the owner of a car may be carrying goods of a type which may not be covered by his insurance at all.  The police examining these certificates find it hard to tell with certainty whether the insured is properly and adequately safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with the proposals contained in the Bill as regards driving tests.  Various difficulties are bound to arise as to the most satisfactory method of conducting such tests.  The Minister will have to devise some simple system of testing new drivers.  As he indicated, according to age and physique, they may be licensed to drive a particular type of vehicle and excluded from driving another.  I think the age limit fixed in respect of driving licences should be reduced.  The law provides that a person may, at the age of 16, be given a licence to drive a motor cycle but not one for driving a four-wheeled vehicle until the age of 17 or 18, as the case may be.  Persons of 16 years are now physically and mentally more mature than were persons of that age 25 years ago.  For that reason, it is quite safe to entrust a person of 16 years with the driving of an ordinary light motor car or station wagon, but not a truck or any other such heavy vehicle.  I would recommend, of course, that they should not be allowed to drive such heavy vehicles until they are at least 18 or 19.</P>
    <P>There is another problem with regard to the driving of agricultural vehicles.  Due to the scarcity of help, many farmers find themselves in a difficult position in regard to the driving of tractors and other farm vehicles because members of their family <Col N="800" /> are not allowed to have a driving licence until they are 17 years of age. With reference to the driving of a tractor, particularly with a trailer, there is a certain amount of risk above the ordinary and the Minister would have to be somewhat conservative in issuing licences of that kind.  However, even if a limited licence were issued to drive a tractor without an attachment, it would give much-needed assistance to farmers using tractors and who must on occasion send them on the public road going from one farm to another.  If the Minister could not see his way to go the whole distance, I would ask him to go part of the way by issuing some kind of limited licence to these people.</P>
    <P>The testing of vehicles is very necessary but I cannot agree that it is only vehicles which have been on the road for many years that should be tested.  My experience is that the mechanical condition of a vehicle depends entirely on the degree to which it has been serviced and maintained during use.  I have found excellent vehicles nine and ten years old.  Some of these vehicles are in much better mechanical order than vehicles only two or three years in use.  The proper approach to the testing problem is that in certain defined circumstances, for instance, if a driver is seen by a Garda bumping his car against another vehicle without some obvious reason, the vehicle should be tested whether it is new or not because in that case there is something wrong either with the vehicle or with the operator.  Testing of older vehicles is necessary in any case from the point of view that insurance companies might create difficulty about providing cover for such vehicles.  A certificate of fitness might help the owner in that regard to get favourable insurance terms.  Generally, testing of vehicles may prove difficult because, in existing circumstances, personnel may not be available to undertake such work. In future, I take it that Gardai, during training, will get a special course in the operation, checking and testing of motor vehicles.  In the long run, I think it is on the Garda that responsibility must fall; they are the people <Col N="801" /> on the spot and the most practicable organisation to undertake such work.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House in discussing points that perhaps have already been dealt with and with which, if not, I can deal on the next Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to speak at this stage without repeating something already said because since the Bill was introduced, there has been a pretty wide and comprehensive survey of the whole matter. Probably no more urgent or important legislation has been brought to the House for many years than the Bill now before us.  It was promised many years ago but it has taken a long time to reach its present stage.  I feel that were it not for the fact that the public mind has been turned to the subject by so many fatal accidents and the fact that the Fine Gael Party brought in a Private Members' Bill recently in regard to the parking of unlighted motor lorries on roads, the Bill would not have been introduced even at this late stage.</P>
      <P>This Bill is very necessary.  We live in an age of great speed and efficiency and for that reason our road traffic regulations are entirely out of date. Fatal accidents have taken place on almost every main and county road. There is much substance in complaints that have been made about lack of courtesy on the roads and there seems to be very little co-operation between the general public and road-users. From my own experience as a driver for almost 20 years I should say that, whether or not we have driving tests, the position will not change very much because all one needs to be a good driver is a bit of commonsense.  A driver who uses commonsense and intelligence cannot make many mistakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women drivers have been criticised but I have found that they exercise great courtesy, care and caution.  If we review the fatal accidents that have taken place over the past 10 or 15 years I venture to say that a very small percentage have been caused by women drivers.  They cannot be described <Col N="802" /> as a menace on the road.  I cannot say if everybody has the same experience but from what I have seen and from the records it is very seldom women drivers are involved in a serious accident.</P>
    <P>If we are to start on the right foot in regard to road safety and traffic regulations, we must start in the schools.  If the I.N.T.O., the secondary and vocational teachers' organisations give full backing to the terms of this Bill they can do an immense amount of valuable work by lecturing and training in regard to road safety. Every pupil attending vocational schools should be taught how to drive a car properly and should be given lessons on road safety and courtesy. The schools can do a great deal in this way.  We have under the various vocational committees night classes of all kinds.  Why not a class to teach people how to drive cars, tractors and lorries?  The various vocation committees would be only too anxious to have such classes.  They could be attended by those who are anxious to learn to drive and also by those who feel that they are not sufficiently proficient in driving.  But the direction must come from the top and the Minister would be wise to consult with the Minister for Education in the matter.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism of the Garda.  Now the Garda have a very unenviable job.  I doubt if anyone here envies them.  Long ago, their main work was barrack duty. Now they must keep records, diaries, and so on and so forth.  I belive they are over-burdened with work.  As well as that, I believe there is a lack of co-operation with the Garda.  As in every section of the community, one will occasionally find an odd crank in the Garda, but, on the whole, co-operation between the general public, the motoring public and the Garda has not been as it should be.  Part of the reason for that lack of co-operation is the fact that the law is out of date and not in accord with modern conditions.</P>
    <P>Minor offences should be dealt with as minor offences.  I refer to such offences as parking in the wrong place, one light out, leaving a car too far out <Col N="803" /> from the kerb, parking too near a corner.  Very often respectable people are brought into court, to their shame and embarrassment, for very minor breaches of traffic regulations.  Very often the penalties imposed are much too severe.  That is one direction in which I have an axe to grind in relation to regulations.  The Garda gives evidence that John X parked his car so near a corner that it constituted a danger to other users of the road. Without thought, the district justice fines John X £3.  Fines are far too high in the case of minor offences and far too low where serious breaches are involved.</P>
    <P>I join with others in condemnation of the drunken driver.  I believe that the publican who serves the drunken driver with drink should stand beside him in the dock.  Serving drink to a motorist who is already under the influence of drink is, in my opinion, one of the most serious offences of all. Yet, it is not covered under any legislation. I hope that some steps will be taken to punish such publicans severely.  Such publicans are not worthy of being described as business people.  They have no regard for public safety.  They are inspired by greed and the ambition to grow rich on the foolishness and folly of others.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the drunken driver put off the road and kept off the road.  I have known drunken drivers to have their licences withdrawn for three months or six months. I should like more uniformity of practice as between district and circuit court where drunken drivers are concerned. Such drivers should be put in jail for a good, long term and disqualified from driving for at least five years.  If the drunken driver is kept off the roads valuable lives will be saved.  Invariably the drunken driver escapes and it is the sober, hardworking breadwinner of a large family who is wiped out of existence.  It is our duty to protect our citizens.  I hope the Minister will put into this Bill a provision which will give the courts the widest possible powers to impose the severest possible penalities on drunken drivers and the publicans who serve them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> I join with Deputy Esmonde in a plea that local authorities should be obliged to provide lay-bys every three miles on each side of the road to cater for long distance drivers, such as lorry drivers.  With regard to drivers of heavy transport, may I say that I commend the courtesy of bus drivers.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That in view of the fact that the cost of ill health among middle-income families is a serious financial burden and a dangerous impediment to their getting ready access to a first class health service, and since the dispensary medical service does not make available an efficient or equitable service with free choice of doctor to the lower-income group, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the present blue card medical system, subject to a means test, should be abolished and replaced by a no means test national health service based on the principle underlying the present tuberculosis medical services.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The main point I should like to clarify tonight is what exactly is meant by the amendment put down by the Labour Party.  It is important to clarify whether the &ldquo;insurance basis&rdquo; referred to in the amendment is voluntary or compulsory. There is all the difference in the world in a health service in which there is a voluntary insurance scheme and one in which there is a compulsory insurance scheme.  Deputy O'Higgins, speaking for the Fine Gael Party, said he was attracted by the amendment put down by the Labour Party and he more or less favoured the idea of the insurance system.  But from the remainder of his speech it was quite clear that he is completely opposed to a no means test health service.</P>
      <P>Before the debate is concluded, we must have it clarified whether this amendment refers to a compulsory scheme or not.  If it does not, and if the Labour Party have in mind a voluntary scheme, then we are no further advanced than under the present Health Act.  We already have a voluntary health insurance scheme in operation.  I cannot see how any extension of that system will be of benefit to the vast number of people who are deprived of the benefits of the health services at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to the principle of a compulsory scheme but I do not think it would be practicable under any circumstances to implement such a scheme.  Therefore, from a practical point of view, we shall have to forget about the idea of a compulsory scheme.  The vast majority of the community, especially in rural Ireland, are self-employed.  If any Deputy can suggest to me a reasonable and practical way in which we can collect the necessary moneys for a compulsory scheme, I should like to hear it.  I have a good deal of experience myself, as a member of a local authority, of how difficult it is to get any scheme organised.  I am certain that it would tax to the utmost the ingenuity of the experts in any Government Department to bring into operation a compulsory health insurance <Col N="806" /> scheme.  Therefore, when we bring the matter down to a practical basis, I think it is quite evident that the best scheme of all is the one suggested in this Motion: a no-means test health service without introducing the question of insurance at all.</P>
    <P>The local authority can administer the scheme and the Central Fund can be responsible for the greater portion of the charge involved.  However, that is a matter into which I shall not go in any detail.  I should like if we could have the meaning of the amendment clarified before the debate concludes. Personally, I could not support an amendment to the motion that would leave the scheme on a voluntary basis. I said last week it was not my intention to speak at any length on this motion in view of the fact that so many Deputies appeared to be anxious to make a contribution.  For that reason I shall now conclude.</P>

      <P>It would be very interesting to know what the Labour Party intend to do.  However, if no other persons want to waste their eloquence on the desert air, I suppose I shall have to rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McQuillan in what he has just said, that it would be quite impracticable to operate here a general insurance scheme in the proper sense of that term&mdash;a scheme to which every adult, self-supporting person and every other adult person whether in employment or otherwise would contribute. As the Deputy has said, we have about 1,200,000 persons in gainful employment in this country.  Of this, about 700,000 persons are covered by the social insurance scheme.  The remaining half million are, as Deputy McQuillan said, self-employed persons. A large number of them are subsistence farmers whose cash incomes are not considerable.  If they were to be <Col N="807" /> brought within that scheme as contributors, either very cumbersome or costly machinery would be required to operate the scheme with, shall I say, somewhat doubtful efficiency, or else a large number of them would have to be exempted from insurance.</P>
    <P>If we cannot have this general scheme based on insurance, then what really is being urged here in the Labour Party amendment is not a scheme of insurance but a poll tax to be levied on every adult person and on every adolescent person who may appear to be in employment.  It seems to me that a poll tax, of all forms of taxation, is the most regressive. It is obviously quite inconsistent with the programme which the Labour Party have been putting to the country that they should find themselves sincerely and genuinely supporting their own amendment.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word or two about some remarks made by Deputy McQuillan when speaking on the last evening this motion was debated. Unfortunately, I was not able to be present on that occasion and did not have the pleasure of hearing him, but he painted a picture of an extravagant and top-heavy administrative machine for dealing with the collection of moneys for the maintenance of patients in Roscommon County Hospital for services which were rendered to them there.  He told the House that the annual income from that source was about £10,500 and that it must cost nearly that amount to collect what was due.  I have made some inquiries into the position in County Roscommon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly; why not? The Deputy made such an extraordinary statement that it was necessary that it should be verified.  That, at least, was due to the House, and it was also due to the Deputy that if he were labouring under any misapprehension, that misapprehension should be corrected.  The position is that for every 40 patients who went into the hospital in a recent six months, 28 out of the 40 were charged nothing at all for their treatment and maintenance, and 11 were assessed within the hospital for payment for treatment, and paid the amount assessed without demur and before they left the hospital. That accounts for 39 out of 40. In only one case out of the 40 patients treated was it necessary to send the papers outside the hospital to the county council offices and the assistance officer for investigation.</P>
      <P>The number of cases left which it was necessary to have dealt with in the way described by Deputy McQuillan on the last evening this motion was debated was 49 over six months.  That was an average of eight per month. For local investigation of these cases, these assistance officers are available so that each in his own area had only one or two cases in the month to investigate. This work naturally was dovetailed into his ordinary duties and investigations where applicable, payment of home assistance, disability allowances and so on.</P>
      <P>It is very clear, therefore, that the picture which the Deputy painted was greatly, shall I say, over-coloured. I think the Deputy's misunderstanding of the situation arose from the fact that he assumed that for every case that came before the county council, there were a considerable number of others that had to be dealt with in the way he described.</P>
      <P>In relation to the speech in which it was moved, the terms of the motion on the Order Paper are, shall I say, at least peculiar.  Let me remind the House what they are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That in view of the fact that the cost of ill health among middle-income <Col N="809" /> families is a serious financial burden and a dangerous impediment to their getting ready access to a first class health service, and since the dispensary medical service does not make available an efficient or equitable service with free choice of doctor to the lower-income group, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the present blue card medical system, subject to a means test, should be abolished and replaced by a no means test national health service based on the principle underlying the present tuberculosis medical services.</P>
    <P>The phraseology of the motion is not the most elegant, but it will suffice.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the motion makes two assertions: first, that the cost of medical attendance is a serious burden on middle-income families, and secondly, than an efficient and equitable medical service is not available to medical card holders, that is, people of the lower-income group.  It proceeds on the basis of those premises to demand that persons who enjoy incomes in the top brackets, who may even be in the uppermost branches of the surtax payers, be given a similar medical service, a similar family doctor service, hospital and specialist service, and what else have you, free of charge.</P>
    <P>When we consider this, am I not justified in saying that a motion such as this, emanating as it does from a Party composed of two such typical proletarians as Deputy Dr. Noel C. Browne and Deputy Jack McQuillan is very peculiar?  It is quite clearly a compromise motion in terms agreed upon by the Right Wing and the Left Wing of the National Progressive Democrat Party.  I suppose we should be glad that in these days of turmoil and strife, these two members find themselves able to join in demanding unnecessary, unwanted and unasked boons for plutocracy, all at the expense of the general body of taxpayers and ratepayers throughout the country. For that, as I hope to show if time permits, is what this motion amounts to.  The Don Quixote of the National Progressive Democrat Party <Col N="810" /> and his Sancho Panza demand that the State should provide medical care for the better off, the best off, the rich, the very rich and the very richest elements in the community.</P>
    <P>The motion, as I have pointed out, advances two reasons for that: first, as I have said earlier, that when a person of the middle-income group requires the services of a family doctor, the cost of it deters him from calling one in.  Of course, the reason is not stated in those very clear and simple terms in the motion.  Instead, we have a general statement designed to convey a moving picture of oppressed middle classes weighted down by the exactions of a rapacious medical profession. It drips with tears and oozes sympathy.  It is calculated to appeal to the bourgeoisie in the residential districts where perhaps the mover of the motion will be canvassing for votes at the next election.  Presumably, it is designed to show them that they have a place in his heart, as well as the Congolese.  That is the sole reason why the motion opens with that precious bit of claptrap about the conditions of the middle-income families.</P>
    <P>If it is not&mdash;if I am wrong&mdash;if there be any other reason for it, why did not Deputy Dr. Browne set out to justify by evidence these assertions of his&mdash;assertions with which I am sorry to see a man of commonsense and with a rational approach like Deputy McQuillan, associate himself.  Why did Deputy Dr. Browne not give details of the actual cases&mdash;not of just one or two isolated instances but of a sufficient number of cases to show that what he states in the opening phrase of his motion is, in general, true?</P>
    <P>I read his speech carefully.  I failed to find a scintilla of evidence to back his assertion that the middle-class in general are oppressed by the cost of medical treatment.  That speech was if I may say so, a queer sort of speech. It reminded me of nothing so much as a minestrone soup into which the Italian housewife has thrown every scrap, every odd and end of kitchen left overs, to give substance to the thin and watery fluid that is its foundation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> The speech started off ponderously with the words:</P>
    <P>I think it is some time since we had a serious debate on health services. We felt that sufficient time has elapsed for us to face the problems which are created by providing State health services and that we are also in a position to judge by the results of different services by Governments over the years.  From that judgment we must try to find out what would be the wisest way to progress in future.</P>
    <P>When I read so much of the speech, I said to myself: &ldquo;The Irish de Gaulle has returned from his prolonged meditation in the country, or should it be in the Congo, and has brought with him a solution for the very difficult problem of the Irish medical services. There is now about to be revealed to us&rdquo;&mdash;and I quote Deputy Dr. Browne again&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;the wisest way to progress in future&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What, in fact, we were regaled with was, to drop into medical phraseology, the mixture as before.  We were told about pauper laws, about the failure of successive Governments, including the one of which Deputy Dr. Browne was such an ornament, about the Infectious Diseases Regulations and so on.  Incidentally, we were told that the British have long since discarded the poor law.  What, however, really has happened in Great Britain is that they have reached the stage reached in this country long ago when the workhouses and outdoor relief were abolished and home assistance was instituted.  In Great Britain, they have for some years past national assistance, based on the same principles as our home assistance, which is that destitution must be relieved.</P>
    <P>However, no speech from Deputy Dr. Browne would be complete or characteristic if it did not feature an attack upon the Irish doctors.  The Deputy seems to cherish a strange love-hate emotionalism towards them. One day he resigns from the National Health Council because the Minister for Health is not to be intimidated by their association and, a few months later, he rises in this House to rend <Col N="812" /> them tooth and claw.  According to Deputy Dr. Browne, the attitude of the doctors under our national health service towards their patients is conditioned by the most mercenary motives.  He implies their guiding rule of professional conduct is: No cash no care.</P>
    <P>If any Deputy thinks that, in that phrase, I have misrepresented Deputy Dr. Browne's attitude towards his professional colleagues, let him turn to Column 490 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 15th February, 1961, and read Deputy Dr. Browne on the Irish dispensary doctor.  There he will read that no matter how many times a doctor sees a dispensary patient, the emoluments he gets do not increase, whereas the more private patients he sees the more money he gets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne goes on to argue that doctors tend to neglect the dispensary type of patient and concentrate upon the private and fee-earning patient.  The dispensary patient, he tells us later on, must take his place at the end of the queue.  Not only that, he alleges, but dispensary doctors deliberately try to operate a system of apartheid, again, and I quote the Deputy with &ldquo;one type of service for the poor patient, the nonpaying patient, and a superior type of service for the paying patient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Doctors, he tells us, in the same column, in order to force their impoverished patients to pay fees, will be brusque, short and ill-mannered towards them so that they may understand that if they go to the doctor's house and hand him a fee he will treat them better.</P>
    <P>The dispensary doctors, the Deputy is good enough to assure us, are not all bad, brutal, greedy and grasping. Deputy Dr. Browne, with great magnanimity, concedes as much.  There are exceptions to that general rule. However, it would appear, in Deputy Dr. Browne's judgment, that the exceptions are extremely few.  He will not believe any good of the Irish dispensary doctors, in the main, unless dispensary patients or a substantial number of them come forward and express their satisfaction with the profession. In short, Deputy Dr. Browne, <Col N="813" /> who is so devoted to freedom and justice in Stanleyville, Moscow and Budapest, would try Irish doctors according to the rules of the peoples' democracies and hold them all guilty until everybody proves them to be innocent.  So much for the Deputy on the dispensary doctors.</P>
    <P>What about the doctors who are not in the public service, who live by private practice?  They, too, according to Deputy Dr. Browne, are exploiters of the sick.  When depicting the sad plight of the dispensary patient, the Deputy told us how all the dispensary doctor's care and skill are lavished on his private patients and when he comes to treat of the private practitioner, there is conjured up for us an even gloomier picture of the lot of the private patient.  &ldquo;He&mdash; according to the Deputy; I am quoting from column 497&mdash;&ldquo;is probably worse off, if it is possible to be worse off, than the dispensary patient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would advise Deputies who are interested in this question of the relationship of the medical profession to their Irish compatriots to read the column which I have quoted and am quoting to the effect that, if anything, the private patient is worse off, if that were possible, than the dispensary patient.  There, in column 497, they will find that statement embellished and worked up to the grand climax that &ldquo;this fee for service system leaves the patient at the mercy of his fears and in receipt of an inferior service, except for those who can afford to pay for it, a service inferior even to that which the dispensary patient gets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark that statement from the Deputy who proposed that motion and who on last Wednesday just 15 minutes previously told the House that the dispensary patient must take his place at the end of the queue, that the dispensary doctors had one type of service for the poor patient, the non-paying patient, and a superior type of service for the paying patient. What way is that to treat Dáil Éireann?  The Deputy's inconsistencies may be lapped up by the beatniks who lisp his Party catchcries <Col N="814" /> and toe his Party line, but I would suggest that they are an insult to the intelligence of his fellow Deputies and, what is more, they are highly slanderous of an honourable profession. They have been uttered in this House under the cloak of the privilege of this House without a scintilla of evdence to support them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, however, having passed from this attack on the Irish doctors, having painted them in the terms which I have quoted, became highly avuncular.  He is prepared always to distribute his largesse&mdash;at other peoples' expense, of course&mdash;broadcast. He has even something for the doctors. Having beslaved them with spittle, he has now a carrot and a gold brick to offer.  They would be wonderfully happy he tells them, if only we had a service such as he proposes, a service on the same lines as the British.  They would no longer have to compete for patients; they would no longer be called upon to give patients of their best.  They could, in short, drop out of what Deputy Dr. Browne described as this rat-race of the medical profession in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Then he gives us at column 948 a tender-hearted picture, all charity and light, of the general practitioners.  He tells us that those whom he described as brusque, crude, ill-mannered and mercenary when he was describing their attitude towards the dispensary patient, and cheats and humbugs who, when they were dealing with private patients take fees and give inferior service, are at heart conscientious men, kind men, sensitive men, who worry for their patients and to save them expense will not prescribe costly drugs or call in consultants.</P>
    <P>Evidently Deputy Dr. Browne wishes to be all things to all men, even to the doctors.  Let me recall to him the words of a great humanitarian who was withal a skilful politician&mdash; I hope I quote him correctly.  &ldquo;You may,&rdquo; said Abraham Lincoln, &ldquo;fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time&rdquo; and not even Deputy Dr. Browne can fool at one and the same <Col N="815" /> time the dispensary patient, the private patient and the private practitioner.</P>
    <P>I have been at odds with the Association which purports to speak for the majority of the medical profession, but I have seldom found in any profession greater devotion and greater desire to serve humanity in general. There are, of course, black sheep among them but they are the rare exceptions&mdash;the very rare exceptions.</P>

      <P>I ask the House to reject this motion, first, because it is based on premises which are demonstrably wrong, from which it follows that the proposal is ill-conceived in itself.  Secondly, it would not give us a medical service suited to the needs of this community or which would be within our resources to carry.  Thirdly, to give effect to it would increase the cost of our health services by about 60 per cent., raising our expenditure under the Health Votes from £17.2 million, to no less than £27,250,000. One half of this additional £10,000,000 would have to be defrayed out of taxation and the other half out of rates.</P>
      <P>So far as the rates are concerned, this would mean an increase, on the average of 7/3 in the pound.  Taxation would require to be increased correspondingly to find money for the other half, so that cigarettes might go up by 5d. for a packet of 20, a bottle of stout by 4d., petrol by 1/2½ a gallon and income tax by 1/5d. in the £.  In our existing circumstances this would be financial and economic madness and for that reason I ask the House to reject the motion.</P>

He did not like Deputy Dr. Browne's solution as an improvement on the present health scheme nor did he like the solution as suggested in the Labour Party's amendment.  We must therefore assume that, so far as the Minister for Health is concerned, he is perfectly satisfied with the health scheme which we got under the Health Act, 1953, as administered by the State and the local authorities.

      <P>The motion reads: &ldquo;That in view of the fact that the cost of ill health among middle-income families is a serious financial burden and a dangerous impediment to their getting ready access to a first class health service...&rdquo;  I am therefore entitled to speak about the health scheme because this motion, plus the <Col N="818" /> Labour Party's amendment, is designed to get an improved health scheme.  Is there any Deputy, any member of a public authority, or any member of the public who can say he is satisfied with the health service?  It is now about 8 years since it was introduced and it is high time that there was a serious review of it undertaken by the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate&mdash;I am sure he does but he has not said so&mdash; the difficulties that exist for a family which has not got either the means or a medical service card?  Does he appreciate what it has meant to the middle-income group in the last few months during the influenza epidemic? Does he appreciate what it costs now to go to a doctor or does he understand that, in a family of six, if the six, or even three or four of them, have influenza, it can put a working man back a great deal when he has to pay 7/6, 10/-, 12/6 or even 15/- for each visit to the doctor?</P>
      <P>It is because we believe that these are burdens on the ordinary middle class people that we ask that a better scheme be provided for the middle income group.  I wonder does the Minister appreciate&mdash;again I am sure he does but we would like to have heard him speak about it&mdash;the cost of drugs, medicines, medical appliances and prescriptions generally, handed out by doctors to people with £9, £10 or £12 a week?  Does he know of doctors who come to visit influenza patients and freely hand out prescriptions? The unfortunate patient goes to the chemist to get that prescription compounded, expecting it to cost 12/6 but he is handed a bill for £2.  I do not know whether or not that is the fault of the doctors; I am not going to discuss how they prescribe but people in this House whose families have had 'flu during the last two months know how expensive it is to visit a doctor on such occasions and pay for drugs or any of the prescriptions that may be handed out from time to time.  I know that medical science has advanced and that drugs work wonders but they are wonders which ordinary folk cannot afford, if prescriptions to cure 'flu or the ordinary cold are to cost anything up to £2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> Every Deputy and member of a local authority knows the confusion there is with regard to the issue of medical service cards.  I remember a Fianna Fáil advertisement in 1954 which asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Can wealth buy health?&rdquo;  I am sure many members of the Party will remember that as well&mdash;meaning that health, and attention by the medical profession, could be afforded only by the wealthy.  I want to tell the Minister and members of the local authorities that health services are determined not by needs but by the availability of money.  The Minister nearly let the cat out of the bag when he referred to the extra cost there would be if more people get better services.  He talked about 5d. being put on the packet of cigarettes, 4d. on the bottle of stout and 1/5d. on income tax.  Money does not matter for the purpose of my argument.  How is the issue of medical service cards determined by the State or the local authority?  It is determined by what money they are prepared to advance, not by the number of people who need medical service cards, but how much the local authority and/or the Minister is prepared to advance for it.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties about the Health Act is that nobody knows who is entitled to a medical service card.  I wonder does the Minister know?  The Minister does not know.  He has been asked in this House from time to time who is entitled to a medical service card and the usual answer has been, &ldquo;That is to be determined by the manager.&rdquo; How many Deputies have been embarrassed by constituents asking them: &ldquo;Am I entitled to a medical service card?&rdquo;  There is not one Deputy who can categorically say who is entitled to a medical service card.  That is one of the very strange things about the health service as at present administered. If a Deputy is asked by a man if he is entitled to unemployment assistance, he can tell him and 99 times out of 100 he will be right; there is a means test applied there.  If any man asks me if he is entitled to an old age pension or if a widow asks me if she is entitled to a widow's pension, I am able to tell <Col N="820" /> them.  We could tell them correctly in 99 cases out of a hundred but nobody knows who is entitled to medical service cards.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister or the House appreciate what hospital bills may mean to persons who have not medical service cards and who have not sufficient money to pay the bills?  The Minister has quite rightly said that in many cases hospital bills are remitted but at certain cost, as Deputy McQuillan pointed out on the last occasion we discussed the motion.  Does the Minister or the House know that there are people who are afraid to enter hospitals for urgently needed operations because of the cost?  I can give at least one example.  If the Minister wishes, I can give the name and address of this person who needs an operation but is afraid that she will be pressed for the account by the local authority.  The local authority will not say to her: &ldquo;Have the operation and you need not worry about the bill.&rdquo;  I know that in very many cases the local authority does remit or reduce the hospital bill but they do not do that in all cases.  I have known people to get hospital bills for £30.  The local authority presses for it and some people pay for it, lest it be brought to court.</P>

      <P>That is wrong.  I speak about people who have been in the ordinary public ward at 10/- a day. In many cases, it is a &ldquo;try on&rdquo; on the part of local authorities.  They send bills to people who are afraid of their lives that they will be dragged into court if they do not pay them.</P>

      <P>There is the difficulty that they have some extraordinary rules in the local authority.  I have known a case&mdash;I had one today&mdash;of a person who was deemed to be responsible for a cousin living in his house. The law does not say that.  The moral law does not say it.  The Public Assistance Act, 1939, does not say that a person shall be responsible for a <Col N="821" /> cousin but the local authority tries that on in several parts of the country and tries to frighten people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many people who will approach Deputy Galvin and myself to intercede for them with the local authority and by interviewing the manager and finding out the circumstances of the household, we may secure a reduction.  How many people are there who do not approach Deputy Galvin or myself or members of local authorities and who, out of fear, pay what is to them a colossal bill to the local authority, which sets them back not weeks or months but years?</P>
      <P>I have said that I believe the health services are not determined by the local authority and by the State by need but by the availability of money. That is more or less demonstrated in the reply to a Question given by the Minister for Health last week, as reported at column 367, Volume 186 of the Official Report.  The number of persons covered by medical cards has varied a great deal in five or six years. I wonder why.  On 31st March, 1957, the number was 810,000; in June, 1957, it rose to 819,000; in March, 1958; it was 812,000; in March, 1959, 853,000; it fell to 797,000 in March, 1960; and the September, 1960, figure was down to 781,000.  These figures require explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Health Bill, 1953, was being discussed, the then Minister for Health stated that under the old dispensary system one-third of the population were entitled to free dispensary treatment.  According to the figures I have just quoted, in September, 1960, only 27 per cent. of the population were covered for free medical treatment. It seems to me, therefore, if we are to believe what the then Minister for Health said in 1953, that the number of people now receiving free <Col N="822" /> dispensary treatment is 6? per cent. fewer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that 6? per cent. are better off.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We as a Party support the spirit behind this motion and accept the valid criticism of the health system implied in the motion. We believe that the health service certainly needs vast improvement.  For that reason, we suggest that a health scheme on an insurance basis should be introduced.  The Minister ridicules the idea and says that it is not possible. He did not attempt to say why it was not possible but lightly threw out that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  Deputy McQuillan had already shown why it was not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I did not have the advantage of listening to Deputy McQuillan in full but I did hear the Minister and he brushed off the idea.</P>
      <P>We believe that there is a need for an insurance scheme in the health service. We also believe that the present system should not be retained whereby health services appear to be given as a charity rather than as a right.  Many people, and we in the Labour Party, resent the idea of the very strict means test for qualification for a medical service card.  There have been criticisms from both sides of the House of the means test that has been carried out down through the years in respect of old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment assistance and so on, but Deputies will agree that that means test is nothing in comparison with the strict means test that people have to undergo when they apply for a medical service card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that people should receive health services as a right.  That can be done by having health services on an insurance basis.  Then there would be a legal obligation on the Government to provide proper services <Col N="823" /> for the people which the people could demand as a right as they now demand as a right unemployment benefit, sickness benefit and other services connected with the Social Welfare Fund, and would not be subjected to a means test by officers of the local authority or have to make inquiries or ask public representatives to make representations on their behalf.</P>
    <P>May I say in reply to Deputy McQuillan that we believe that it should be a compulsory scheme.  There is no difficulty in establishing a scheme that would embrace the 750,000 insured workers, to which the employer, the employee and the State would contribute.</P>
    <P>There are self-employed persons.  The majority would be regarded as of the farming class.  I do not think it is impossible to devise an insurance scheme for the self-employed person on the land or elsewhere.  I appreciate that the contribution in that case would be a bigger burden than the insurance contribution in the case of an employee who would be required to pay only one-third of the contribution.  There could and should be a scheme devised whereby there would be a slightly reduced rate of contribution from those who are employed on the land of self-employed in the cities or towns.  I do not suggest that the insurance scheme should extend to those who would be regarded for the purpose of the Health Act as being in the higher income group.  I am concerned with the middle income group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be no means test how does the Deputy propose to exclude them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurance scheme would determine the type of persons who would be insured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So there would be a means test indirectly.  That is a typical piece of Labour Party propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinary thing that when the Minister was on his feet he had nothing to say; now when he is in the comfort of his seat he has everything to say.  This insurance <Col N="824" /> scheme would include insured workers, self-employed people whether they be farmers or anything else, up to a certain valuation, as in the present Health Act, a £50 valuation, or in the case of self-employed people, where one could not have regard to valuation, up to an income like £800 as again determined by the regulation made under the 1953 Health Act.</P>
      <P>We agree with the spirit that motivated those who put forward this motion.  We agree with the sentiments expressed in the motion and we believe that the solution to the difficulties involved would be the establishment of the health service on an insurance basis.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister is too busy.  This motion by Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy <Col N="825" /> McQuillan proposes in effect that we should introduce a free medical scheme.  The Labour Party proposes an amendment that that scheme should be on a contributory basis.  These proposals are put down for Private Members' time and in the short space of time available, it is not possible to discuss these matters fully.  So far as my Party is concerned let me say, in the short period of time at my disposal, that we certainly are dissatisfied with the present health service. We are not as complacent as the Minister for Health seems to be.  There is a great deal that requires to be done. I have suggested on behalf of my Party certain improvements which could be carried out.  The dispensary service we have at present is a carryon from the last century.  It is entirely inadequate in relation to modern needs and should be modified.  There should be a choice of doctor and there should be&mdash;</P>

      <P>We recognise the present health services must be changed but lest there may be any misunderstanding about this let me say my Party will support neither the motion nor the amendment because we do not think that health policy can be decided in a motion of this kind.  That does not mean, and it should not be understood to mean, that in relation to what is involved here we have a view one way or the other.  We certainly do not believe that a free-for-all medical service is a desirable thing.  In the past we have given evidence of our views in this respect.  We believe, in relation to the poor people, that there should be no stint in what should be provided.  We are conscious of the fact that it was our Party that introduced the public health service to this country.  Deputy Galvin is new to Dáil Éireann and he should understand how it is that Deputies may comfort themselves. The public health service was introduced by this Party.</P>

      <P>I shall not follow the Minister's red herring but so far as health services are concerned our Party believe, in relation to poor people, in relation to the genuine and deserving poor, that the State should so organise things that such people will get everything this State can provide. In relation to those who can afford to pay, may I say to the proposer of the motion, through you, Sir, that we firmly believe that the function of the State is a clear one and that is, to supplement and not to supplant individual effort.  For that reason we who had the opportunity to do it introduced into our health services the idea of voluntary health insurance.  That was a means provided by the State whereby people could get together in groups and help one another to provide for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> I do not say&mdash;and I do not think my Party would say&mdash;that an extension of that principle or idea of insurance should not be contemplated.  It may well be that some form of insurance will be the logical development in our health services, but, on a motion of this kind in relation to a matter so serious, it is not possible for us to consider these things and state what the policy should be.  In those circumstances and for those reasons, my Party do not propose to take any part in the divisions that may result from this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief time at my disposal, I shall try to reply to some of the points made.  First of all, there was the extraordinary eruption into the debate by the Minister who, as pointed out by Deputy Corish, dealt with me as an individual rather than with my views&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with your statements as I was entitled to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not open my mouth&mdash;as I could have done many times during the Minister's speech.  It is a good thing for public life in Ireland that the type of politics to which the Minister has such longstanding loyalty is passing and that we are getting to the point at which it is possible to discuss a point of view rather than individuals in public life. With the increasing age of the Minister, his memory appears to be slipping because he attempted to pillory me for suggesting in my motion that we should provide health services free of direct charge to everyone and, as he said, provide that people in the top branches would be given general medical services free of charge.  He went along in that vein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say his memory is slipping because he himself in 1950, when attacking me for some delay in bringing in a health scheme, said that the mother and child free scheme introduced by Deputy Dr. Ryan some time earlier would have been brought into operation in 1948.  Secondly, he said the scheme would of course have been a costly one as visualised by Fianna Fáil because they realised that the strength and <Col N="828" /> hope of the nation lay in its children. Noble words and sentiments but unfortunately the Minister no longer appears to have any loyalty to them. He seems to have forgotten them because, of course, under that scheme what he called the top branches would be given a complete medical service free of charge, the wealthy and the very wealthy.</P>
    <P>Why should we ask for health care for the rich?  Deputy Dr. Ryan, as Minister for Health, in association with Deputy MacEntee, in 1947, introduced legislation here, magnificent legislation, to provide such a scheme.  It was free to all sections, lower, middle and higher income groups.  There was no means test.  So, if I am doing anything odd or unusual, I have the precedent of the Minister himself in so doing.  If, as he said, I am serving up the mixture as before, that is more than can be said for him because, clearly, he has changed since that time since his sympathies are now with the pauper laws.  It was stated that at that time the free, no means test scheme would be costly, but at that time the Minister was in Opposition and he was in favour of it even though it was costly because, of course, they in Fianna Fáil realised that the strength and the hope of the nation lay in its children.  At that time in Opposition the present Minister was prepared to introduce a free, no means test health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A maternity service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>A free, no means-test health service which the rich and the very rich would have available to them, whether they could afford it or not, whether they wanted it or not. Then, of course, there is the free tuberculosis service, the free infectious diseases service available to the rich and the very rich.  If the Minister wants to be remembered in public life in Ireland&mdash;and he will be remembered for many wrong reasons&mdash;one of the finest reasons for which he will be remembered will be the 1947 Health Bill, in spite of his present repudiation of fine ideas in health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> On the general objection of the Opposition to those free services, suggestions were made that we were not strengthening the moral fibre of the people by giving free services.  I do not know whether that is dishonesty or cant or humbug or misapprehension. I do not know what it is.  I find it difficult to understand that such a belief is held by people in this country in this day and age, surrounded as we are by nations in Europe and outside it that have advanced their social services, particularly health services, on this principle of no means test and free of direct charge.</P>
    <P>Even though they act on that principle, apparently, there is no degeneration in New Zealand or in any of the Scandinavian or other European countries, in Switzerland, in Britain, or among our fellow-Irishmen in Northern Ireland.  I do not think they feel particularly conscious of being deprived of the opportunity of developing this curious thing&mdash;I do not know what it really means&mdash;moral fibre, by being given free, no means test health services.  If such a scheme were offered to-morrow to our people, I should say there would be 100 per cent. membership of it by the end of a year.  I know that, and every Deputy in the House knows it.</P>
    <P>If the Government honestly believe these things&mdash;I do not believe they do&mdash;then I challenge them to take the opportunity they now have in this by-election in the west.  They can go to the people and say to them that the free services which are available to us at present are undermining the moral fibre and character of our people. They can say that if their candidate is returned, it will be a sign that the people are behind them and in order to prove the people are behind them say that they would like to pursue these ideas to their logical conclusions and get rid of these free, no means test children's allowances; get rid of the free, no means test primary education; get rid of the free grants for housing, hotels, industries and so on. They can tell the people of rural Ireland that they will get rid of the free, no means test tuberculosis eradication <Col N="830" /> scheme for cattle.  Let them tell the farmers that and see how far it will get them.</P>
    <P>Of course, the attitude of speakers on the Opposition Benches is just considered hypocrisy.  The other consideration is this suggestion that they are not in favour of &ldquo;free-for-alls&rdquo;. This is clumsy, superficial thinking and it is completely unreasonable because in these days there is no such thing as a free service.  People pay in the form of rates or income tax and if they do not pay either of those, they pay in the form of indirect taxation in many different ways, particularly as our present conservative administration tends to extend the degree of indirect taxation imposed on the mass of the people in order to protect the wealthy minority that both they now and the Opposition clearly represent as opposed to the mass of the people.</P>
    <P>I offer that challenge to the members of the Opposition and to any members of the Government Party who share their views.  Unfortunately a number of them now seem to share those views, though, once upon a time, they did not do so.  It is not the responsibility of the State to supplant and nobody has suggested there should be any supplanting.  Anybody who pays taxes, direct and indirect, and rates is making a contribution.  The State is the people.  Taxation is a form of social insurance.  In paying taxation one is given the opportunity of making certain that when one falls ill, one will be covered by the various schemes established under payments made to the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Opposition's case is based on the reasons they give.  Opposition speakers, and those Government speakers who support them, know as well as I do that this absurd spectre of degenerating moral fibre is quite without foundation.  Has there been any deterioration in the moral fibre of the people of Great Britain, of New Zealand, of Sweden, of Switzerland, of Norway, of Denmark, or of any of those countries which have free services of one kind or another?  Are the peoples of these countries in any degree inferior to the people in our own Republic?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> Those who talk about the abolition of Partition and a united Ireland seem to overlook the fact that there can be no united Ireland until the people of the North are guaranteed at least the same social services as they now enjoy. They will not give up their free, no-means test health service for some voluntary insurance scheme, a dispensary system, a national health insurance scheme, and all the other patchwork arrangements we have down here.  If Deputies were really serious about solving the problem of Partition, they would bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme has failed to provide a national scheme, whatever else it has done.  I do not understand the need for a direct insurance contribution to a health service.  If you insist on a direct compulsory insurance contribution for health, then why not for education, housing, children's allowances, old age pensions and so on?  If you insist on contributions, what will happen to the unemployed man?  How will he contribute?  If he does not contribute, then he will be subject to a means test in order to decide whether or not he should contribute. How long will a man have to contribute before he becomes eligible?  I believe such a system would mean the establishment of yet another bureaucracy in order to administer such a scheme.  There is a perfectly good organisation for the collection of contributions to establish a fund to provide a proper health scheme.</P>
    <P>My attitude is that income tax is the only insurance payment anybody should have to make.  By paying tax out of income, directly or indirectly, or rates, the contributor should be in benefit at once as a citizen, with his children educated, with social benefits of one kind or another, an old age pension, and so on.  Above all, he is paying through taxation and rates for a free, no means test health service. I can see no advantage in a separate payment for health services.  I really do not know what justification there is for it.  We see the remarkable efficiency of the health services in Great Britain.  We know of the <Col N="832" /> efficiency of other health services in other countries, all of which services are paid for out of taxation.  If we do not wish to go wandering around the world in search of examples of the simplicity, efficiency and equity of different national health services based on a free, no means test principle, we can look around us here at home and see the tiny microcosm of an ideal health service in our free, no means test tuberculosis service and fever hospital service established under the 1947 Health Act.  Under that scheme, these services are provided for all income groups, including the highest.</P>
    <P>The Minister was sneering a moment ago at the higher income groups. Under a contributory scheme, a man with £8 or £10 a week may find himself having to contribute 15/- per week.  A man with £2,000, or £3,000, or £4,000 may also have to contribute only 15/- a week in order to get the same benefits.  Surely there is an absence of equity in such a system. That would not be a desirable situation; it would not be a healthy situation. I do not believe it is a necessary situation.  No reasons have been advanced which will satisfy me, at any rate, as to why we should have a scheme under which a millionaire pays 15/- and the roadworker likewise pays 15/- a week.  That is wrong.  People should pay according to their means and they should get from society according to their needs.  In my view, that is the ideal arrangement.  It is, of course, a socialist idea.  I am not a bit ashamed of that.  In fact, I am rather proud of it.  It has worked excellently in the few services we have organised on that principle.  It seems to be medically acceptable.  I can see no medical objection to it at all.  We have all the facilities we require for such a scheme.  I am glad that no one tried to drag that aspect into the debate tonight.  We are all quite clear now that it is merely a question of a number of doctrinaire politicians who, in spite of the evidence to the contrary all round them, both here and abroad, of the magnificent health services organised on a free, no means test principle, insist on adhering to their obscurantist ideas because they do not sufficiently feel the need <Col N="833" /> for improving our health services.</P>
    <P>One of the most astonishing things here tonight was the Minister's implication that the middle income group do not appear to require some form of national health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. I said the Deputy had not proved they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The implication was quite clear.  The Minister was surprised I should want to give the middle income group any scheme.  He was surprised to hear they were oppressed by medical fees.  I have no hesitation in repeating that both the middle and the lower income groups have at the present time a grossly unsatisfactory health service.  If, as a result of giving these groups a satisfactory health service, <Col N="834" /> the wealthier sections of the community also benefit, I will have no objection to that at all because the wealthier sections of the community must, of course, pay for the service in taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just on the point of finishing.  Because the wealthier sections pay in taxation for the scheme, equity demands, I think, that they should benefit from the scheme in the same way as the other groups.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the information is not readily available in the form in which it is requested in the questions and that it is doubtful if it could be extracted <Col N="722" /> in detail without an inordinate amount of labour in respect of the years prior to the year 1947, in which a separate Department of Health was established.  The position is complicated, as the Deputy will appreciate, by the fact that in many cases hospitals were partially opened as particular sections became available and is further complicated by the fact that in many cases beds provided for a particular purpose were subsequently put to other uses.  I have put in hands an examination of the position, but I am advised that it will be some weeks before final figures, which will be as comprehensive as it is possible within reason to make them, can be supplied. I shall get in touch with the Deputy as soon as the details are available.  If he so wishes, I shall supply them direct to him.  Alternatively, he can repeat the question so that the information can go on the records of the House.</P>
