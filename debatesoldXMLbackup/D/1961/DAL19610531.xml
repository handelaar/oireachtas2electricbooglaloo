    <Title>Road Traffic Bill, 1960&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In subsection (1), page 82, line 50, to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;four&rdquo;.&mdash;Deputy Corish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to recommend this amendment.  Having a sufficient interval between spells of driving is an essential to road safety.  I am aware the Minister considers that the question of hours is a matter for conditions of employment rather than road safety. However, the fact that in present-day commerce it is quite common for drivers to be asked to drive distances of from 300 to 400 miles without a suitable interval of rest should indicate clearly to him the hazard these weary drivers constitute on the road.  All our work over the past week in providing penalties and regulations for road safety will be set at nought if we permit men to do something whereby they will constitute a source of danger to the rest of the traffic on the road.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous to suggest that a man driving a heavy lorry, say, from Dungarvan to Dublin, a distance of 126 miles, and getting a break of only half-an-hour before returning the same day, could be considered as competent returning as he was setting out that morning.  It is quite common for distances far exceeding that distance to be travelled.  I heard last evening from a fellow Deputy of lorry drivers being sent as far as from Waterford to Belfast.  It is true that after a period of five and a half hours they are compelled under this Bill to rest for a period of half an hour.  I suggest and the Labour movement suggests that that period should be reduced by one hour.  There were similar proposals away back 30 years ago in the 1933 Traffic Bill.  Surely the change in road circumstances, in traffic density and the speed at which traffic is travelling should convince the Minister that some alteration should be made in the rest period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> It is quite true that good employers will not require their employees to drive excessively but we are catering not only for good employers.  The trade union movement, as far as possible, have agreements with good employers where the measures we are suggesting will be unnecessary.  However, there are many unorganised employers who take advantage of the State to compel their employees to work extremely long hours in driving. The Minister, in view of the danger to the public, should save these employees who, either for big money or because of fear of their employers, are prepared to risk the lives of others on the road in order to carry on.  The Minister should seriously consider this amendment and at least meet it in some way on the next Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is summed up in the statement that I feel that this is not properly a matter to be dealt with here&mdash;conditions of working&mdash;and that it should be dealt with if necessary in some other way.</P>
      <P>It is true that the present provisions, in so far as the hours and the breaks, and so on, are concerned are the same as those outlined in the 1933 Act.  In that Act, as well, provision was made for an advisory committee to act on this matter and to give advice as to whether or not any changes should be made.  My information is that this committee was appointed time after time, that it never met and finally, not having met, on its re-appointment people refused to act.  In other words, it became completely obsolete and went out of existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present provision does not include the advisory committee provision which was in the 1933 Act but, in subsection (7) (a) (b) (i) (ii), it makes another provision and that is that within the terms of this section and within the hours specified, the Minister for Industry and Commerce may vary these hours by agreement of the employees and the employers. In other words, if the employers and employees meet the Minister for Industry and Commerce and agree that <Col N="1176" /> certain changes are desirable then the Minister for Industry and Commerce is empoyered, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government, to vary the hours as set out in the section proper.</P>
    <P>It might be said, and it has been said, that the representatives of the workers do not embrace every lorry driver or all workers in the transport business.  However, if the workers' representatives in the unions and the employers' representatives, representing both groups of employers and employees, in a general way agree to vary or to seek a variation in these hours, then that variation, if agreed to by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, would be applicable with the full force of law to all operatives regardless of whether or not they were members of any particular union.  That is one of the outlets.  If the workers' representatives wish to press their view that these hours should be varied, there is specific provision here for that purpose.  I believe that, on that basis, the workers and their representatives have nothing to fear in this measure.</P>
    <P>It was argued that conditions are very different now from what they were in 1933, different in that it is alleged that the duties of drivers are more onerous today than they were then.  I doubt very much if the fatigue factor which is the operative one in so far as my view is concerned in regard to the safety factor is any greater now than it was then and I do not go in the other direction and believe that the physique of our drivers today is any less than it was then.</P>
    <P>By and large, I am not of the belief that from the medical point of view&mdash; you might put it that way&mdash;there is any greater danger inherent in these hours today than there has been in these same hours over the years.  The British 1960 legislation contains the same hours.  If we were to follow the argument of a greater amount of traffic on the roads resulting in greater fatigue and greater danger, if we were to follow that view expressed here in relation to Irish roads and Irish conditions, surely the British provision <Col N="1177" /> which lays down the same hours must give us very serious food for thought. There, road conditions, the density of traffic and all these factors that are being advanced as arguments here exist in even greater measure.  Yet, as recently as last year these same hours were agreed to and have been legislated for in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>By and large, I think we get back to what I have already said and that is that these hours, as laid down, are the hours beyond which no driver may be required to drive, not the hours which every driver will be asked or compelled to drive.  On that basis, no real difficulty is presented to the workers or to their representatives. The conditions of workers and their relationship with the employers of today are surely much improved.  A very great advance has been made in that regard as against conditions existing in 1933.  The workers' representatives today, without any doubt, are surely in a very strong position in regard to negotiating working conditions for their people.</P>
    <P>Again, to counter the argument that the unions do not represent all the workers and all the drivers, if they represent them as they do represent them in a general way then as such they may, in conjunction with the employers' representatives, sit down with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and reach an agreement between the employers and themselves.  Then the hours, if agreed to by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will be binding on all, regardless of whether they are members of the union or whether the employers are members of whatever general group or federation they might have.</P>
    <P>Taking that into consideration, I think the weakness pointed out in the union not representing all drivers does not hold water.  In this instance, they will have the control as if they did represent each and every driver provided they get the agreement from the employers' representatives and get the Minister for Industry and Commerce to go along with them.  I believe that is sufficient safeguard, if safeguard is necessary.  Operated in a proper manner, it can bring about all the variations <Col N="1178" /> that might be required.  To leave it as it stands and to allow this machinery to operate as outlined in subsection (7) (a) and (b) of Section 114, is, I think, fairly meeting the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming the trade unions and the employers meet the Minister for Industry and Commerce and come to some agreement similar to the Labour Party proposals, who would enforce that law?  Is it the inspectors of the Department or will the Minister write it into the Road Traffic Act by way of regulation?  It is well known that at present there are not sufficient inspectors in the Department to carry out factory inspection and other work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the Department's representatives who would enforce the law; it is the Garda authorities.  With a view to making such enforcement effective, there is a requirement in the Bill that a record of hours worked and travelled must be kept.  There would be a log-book from which checks would be made and from which it could be ascertained if the number of hours worked was in excess of the permitted figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says &ldquo;the hours worked.&rdquo;  Would that cover an owner-driver, a man with a plate? Generally speaking, I believe they are the worst offenders.  They do not think anything of themselves or the people on the road.  They continue to drive for periods long in excess even of the present regulations and they get away with it.  There does not appear to be any check at present.  Only in the case of an accident have I heard of any serious attempt to check.  Does the Minister say that the Garda will now have power to check owner-drivers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, regulations must be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce laying down what conditions must be kept.  At this stage, I certainly would not like to commit the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to what he would do.  The matter raised by Deputy Kyne and all other matters will be taken into consideration when these <Col N="1179" /> regulations are being drafted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I presume any representations made to the Minister would be useful in enabling him to draft effective regulations.</P>
      <P>At the moment proper effect is not being given to the law.  The difficulty is that no records, by regulation or otherwise, are required to be kept.  The keeping of records is, therefore, a big advance because it will enable the law to be enforced.  The present weakness lies in the fact that no records are required to be kept.  I would not like at this stage to commit another Minister, who will be concerned in the type of regulation to be made.  The power is being provided so that an effective method of detection and administration will be available and so that real control of the situation can be envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister can understand why the trade union movement, realising the difficulty of covering such a wide field, considered that this was a short cut.  We are doubtful whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce could in fact legislate in such a way as to cover people who did not come within the category of employees.  That matter will have to be examined.  But now that the Minister is limiting travelling hours, surely it would be a simple matter to examine the position and say that, in view of the increase in the density of traffic, in the number of regulations and in the strain of driving now as compared with 30 years ago, we should consider public safety?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one can deny that tiredness is a factor of the utmost importance in driving.  Those of us who feel sleep coming on as we drive&mdash;perhaps because of the night we stayed up before&mdash;can understand the grave risk not only to the driver but to the public. Any sensible driver in that situation is inclined to pull in and rest.  But if you are an employee, with a schedule of runs to keep, or if you are driven by the motive of gain, unless there is a deterrent, you are inclined to ignore the tiredness factor and continue driving.  That is why we consider we are not asking the Minister <Col N="1180" /> too much when we ask him to consider an alteration in the rest periods.</P>
    <P>The amendments put forward by us are not unreasonable.  It is true this change has not been made in Britain, but other factors may be operating there.  Not all British legislation is good, nor do they always lead.  For instance, they have no legislation such as our legislation regulating the conditions of office employment.  If we create a second precedent in this case, I think it would be something to be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Kyne and I agree with him that excessive driving hours require to be controlled.  But has he looked at or considered paragraph (c) of subsection (2), which states:</P>
      <P>any time spent by the driver of a vehicle at work (other than driving) in relation to the vehicle or load carried thereon, including in the case of a public service vehicle any time spent in any capacity (other than as driver or as a passenger) on the vehicle while on a journey, shall be reckoned as time spent in driving;</P>
      <P>I am thinking of rural conditions, with which I am familiar.  I am thinking of the travelling shop.  I want to declare to Deputies that I am a country shopkeeper, but I do not operate a travelling shop.  I know many people who do, however, and they are mostly small men struggling to earn a living for themselves.  In operating a travelling shop, they are, in fact, moving from one neighbour's door to another and sometimes from one crossroads to another.  You stop at the crossroads and deal with the goods on the vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless I am mistaken, paragraph (c) will mean that time must be counted as time driving a vehicle.  If we circumscribe too harshly the limit of time for which the vehicle can lawfully be driven and retain that definition of driving, I think we are going to cause a great deal of difficulty for many people in rural Ireland and particularly for that category I have mentioned. <Col N="1181" /> Therefore, we should be rather circumspect in dealing with a matter of that kind because although we can, with advantage, look to the experience of other countries for guidance, we must remember that we have a social pattern of our own in rural Ireland to which we should have regard.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of country shopkeepers would be very glad to see the travelling shop harassed out of existence and, being a country shopkeeper myself, I sympathise with and understand that reaction, but I believe that there is always enough for everybody and if the small man is trying to push his way into independence, into a living, his neighbour should be very slow to agitate for his elimination by legislation of this or any kind.  Many young fellows attain to a livelihood by working hard when they are young and making their way.</P>
    <P>Suppose you provide that the travelling shop cannot operate for more than 4½ hours without a period of rest and follow that through the other amendment standing in Deputy Kyne's name, cutting down the period of total driving in 24 hours from 11 to nine, bearing in mind the significance of paragraph (c), you will wipe out quite a number of small shopkeepers if the law is operated.  This makes one wonder how you are to get these people to keep the kind of records the Minister refers to, a book showing driving hours.  I should be interested to hear from Deputy Kyne if, in recommending these reductions in this series of amendments, regard has been had to the significance of paragraph (c) of subsection (2).</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment was not intended to deal with travelling shops but with drivers who had to drive continuously for a period of 5½ hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>And who may not have to work outside driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite well appreciate why Deputy Dillon says that there would be need for an alteration in paragraph (c).  There is no intention in the Labour proposal to wipe out anybody.  In fact we would feel, were it not for paragraph (c), that <Col N="1182" /> these people were not doing continuous driving at all.  It is the long distance drivers mainly, the men required to drive, and who sometimes do drive, up to eight or nine or ten hours continuously, with perhaps a stop while a tank is being taken off the lorry.  I am thinking of container traffic where a crane is used to unload the tank and the lorry turns around immediately and goes back to its base.</P>
      <P>I seriously suggest to the Minister that there is grave danger on the roads from sheer tiredness of drivers. I put down an amendment to this Bill aimed at having two people on the lorry but the Minister said he could make regulations to cover that and I was satisfied to withdraw it.  The object of that amendment was that two drivers would travel so that one could replace the other and that neither would become so exhausted as to be a danger to road users.  There is much merit in this proposal and I would press the Minister to consider it and see if, on Report Stage, he could not introduce some section containing suitable safeguards to meet the point made by Deputy Dillon, possibly by the exclusion of certain types of people or businesses from whatever regulations he may make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if it is seriously suggested that travelling shops should be allowed to have drivers in their vans driving for 11 hours of the day and employed for 11 hours each day?  I am as familar with the travelling shop in the west of Ireland as anybody and my experience is that the drivers for these travelling shops are not members of any trade union and there is no limit to the hours they may be asked to work.  So far as the Labour Party amendment is concerned, I do not think Deputy Kyne should have any worry about including drivers of vehicles described as travelling shops, in addition to drivers of long-distance vehicles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin was not here last night when we discussed <Col N="1183" /> the situation obtaining at present.  If this section is passed as it is, it will enable a trader in Letterkenny to dispatch a driver to Dublin in the morning to collect a load at some wholesaler's premises, who, after a half hour's rest, will be forced to come back to Donegal the same day. That is a journey of approximately 400 miles in one day.  Is it seriously suggested that, when we are bringing in a measure to improve road conditions and secure safer travel, any driver is capable of working continuously at that type of driving? I know Deputies who complain of being tired after a short journey from Limerick to Dublin or Cavan to Dublin, or even from Tuam to Dublin. If they had to return that evening, they might have to take a long rest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will not prevent employers in Letterkenny from sending lorries to Dublin and expecting the drivers to be back that night with their loads.  The Bill is specially designed not to alter the existing situation when the 1933 Act was brought in.  It is an evasion of duty on the part of the Minister to suggest his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will be in a position to rectify cases of injustice or hardship in conjunction with the trade union representatives and the employers' representatives. We know perfectly well that human nature does not change and that the employer is the same employer today as he was 100 years ago unless he is prodded along every year.</P>
      <P>The fact that he may have a little more respect today for the worker is due to the organisation of the worker and the power that the worker has. However, human nature does not change and if we listen to remarks made at Chambers of Commerce dinners and manufacturers' dinners we know perfectly well what they would do if they got the opportunity.  If we give them an opportunity by passing legislation to say that it is considered safe to have a man drive for 11 hours in 24 hours the argument which will be put forward by the employers' representatives to the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be that the Dáil considered that was all right and &ldquo;why should we go against what the Dáil has decided?&rdquo;  This House will have to set the example and we should put in a maximum period over and above which no man should be allowed to drive a vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment by the Labour Party is a reasonable one.  I do not want to make this comment as a personal criticism of the Minister but as I said last night godless Russia is aiming at a 35 hour week for its workers while holy Ireland is, in 1961, embodying in legislation a provision that will make it legal for an employer to put a man driving a heavy vehicle for a period of 11 hours in 24.  If that is <Col N="1185" /> progress I do not like to see it in this country.</P>

      <P>I have said all I want to say about the actual hours.  The Minister's argument in connection with subsection (7) may seem to be a reasonable one but I want to say that it is quite unacceptable to me.  The Minister says these hours may be varied by regulations after consultations between the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the employers and the employees and set hours agreed upon.  That is not acceptable because the Minister lays down hours and in these consultations we are going to work from 11 hours as the overall driving in the day in five and a half hour periods with half an hour's rest.  Would it not be much better if the Minister embodied a section which laid down the hours as nine hours driving during the day and let this consultative body work on that?  Let them increase it to 11 or reduce it to six or seven in certain cases, like the case mentioned by Deputy Dillon of the small man who must work and drive.  Let that case be dealt with there. Here the dice is loaded against the workers who have to drive for long periods by the Minister embodying a section which says that up to 11 driving hours may be allowed in any period of 24 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure this measure has the agreement of the Government.  Last night the Minister went to a lot of trouble to explain how it was possible for a man to drive for 11 hours and still be deemed safe on the road.  I assume his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce agrees with that view.  Therefore consultations will be with the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is of the same mind as the Minister for Local Government and believes 11 hours is reasonable and with the employers who in the majority of cases will try to insist that the 11 hour period be retained.  You have the third party, the workers represented by the trade unions, who, as they have said to the Minister and the Government <Col N="1186" /> over the last few months, believe that 11 hours is excessive.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, after these consultations the Minister for Industry and Commerce has to consult with the Minister for Local Government who makes the regulation.  The Minister seems to be very strongly in favour of 11 hours driving during the day and he is in favour of a continuous period of driving up to 5½ hours and also in favour of allowing a mere half hour's rest after a driving period of five and a half hours.  That section may seem to be attractive; it would be if the Minister had not set the standard himself and argued strongly in favour of 11 hours driving in 24 hours.  I would accept the Minister's argument in respect of subsection (7) if he agreed to reduce what I consider to be the limit of 11 hours to 9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>I would say that during the night Deputy Corish has been brought around somewhat to the idea of what was a reasonable and balanced approach from my point of view with regard to this matter of 11 hours as against shorter periods.  Special cases have been built up for these long distance drivers and Deputy McQuillan has worked it out pretty finely that Letterkenny&mdash;which is in my own constituency&mdash;is just the requisite distance from Dublin to demand in some way that I should allow sufficient rest for the drivers of Letterkenny who would be compelled to come to and go from Dublin in the one day.  It is quite a plausible argument but I think Deputy McQuillan knows the worth of it from that point of view just as I do. If there are special cases, and it is quite possible there are, and special classes, then subsection (7) of Section 114 is designed to deal with those special classes by the workers' representatives and the employers agreeing with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to change the hours for the special classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall pattern is there and within and around it these variations may be made for the special classes. Provision accordingly is contained in subsection (7) (a) and (b) of Section 114.  The suggestion is that all this will be very difficult; it will be a big <Col N="1187" /> feat to get the trade unions and employers together to agree and, having done that, get the agreement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. While that might all be possible, the idea that the Minister must then consult with the Minister for Local Government seems to infer that any benefit that might accrue under this section would be out of reach of the people concerned.  The reason for the requirement that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should consult with the Minister for Local Government is on the off-chance that an extension of the hours upwards could become a danger factor beyond which the Minister responsible for this legislation would not agree to go, rather than the opposite being the case as would seem to be in the mind of Deputy Corish.</P>

      <P>I am not legislating for conditions of work.  That is a matter which is done elsewhere, has been done and I am sure will be done, and looked after in the proper way, by those concerned.  I have put this matter to the House at length.  I believe the pattern of hours as given here is of such a nature that, with the safeguard of subsection (7), it can be adapted to suit all concerned.  No hardship will be created, and certainly this Bill is not directing hardship to be created. By and large, the pattern as laid down, with the safeguards and variations, is such that no one can quibble or complain about it.  Cases have been quoted as proof that these hours should be reduced.  If there are such cases at the moment under the present law, by reducing these hours, we will not remedy them.  Surely it is evident that some means must be found to eradicate those abuses?  If the present law is being abused, the new law could be abused.  This legislation in itself will not remedy that situation and some other means must be found to eradicate it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 110:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), paragraph (c), lines 9 to 11, to delete &ldquo;(other than a health institution within the meaning of the Health Act, 1947)&rdquo; and to add to the end of the subsection: &ldquo;irrespective of whether the injured person was entitled to medical services under the Health Acts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section is a very important one and both amendments should be considered very carefully by the Minister in view of the fact that the results will have a bearing on the finances of the local authority.</P>
      <P>Section 119 as it stands excludes the health authority from the right to claim against the owners or the insurers of vehicles for the cost of treatment afforded in health authority hospitals to injured persons.  This right to claim is given to the authorities of voluntary hospitals.  The result means that as far as the health authority hospitals are concerned treatment must be afforded in those local authority hospitals at the rate appropriate to the category into which the injured person falls under the Health Act, 1953.</P>
      <P>I cannot see any good reason why the ratepayers and the public purse should be saddled with the cost of treatment afforded in respect of injuries resulting from any insurable risk and the insurance companies thereby relieved. I cannot see any good reason &mdash;and I am sure members of local authorities in this House will agree with me&mdash;for relieving the owner of a vehicle or his insurer of the cost of treatment afforded in respect of an injury because the injured person happens to obtain treatment in a health authority hospital.  If the treatment for an injury was afforded in a hospital other than a local authority hospital, the owner of the vehicle or his insurers would be liable for the full cost.</P>
      <P>In the White Paper issued by the Minister it was suggested, and it was intended, I understand, to include all hospitals in the same category as voluntary hospitals are in now, but when the legislation was being prepared, that proposal was dropped and the reason, I understand, was that the Health Acts entitled each class of persons to free, or partly free, hospital treatment, and it was doubtful if the cost of the treatment in such cases would be recovered.  I think there is no trouble at all in providing legislation to ensure that this would not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A simple provision in the section excluding from the provisions of the Health Act the treatment of injuries caused by vehicles would have been sufficient to clarify the point.  In the past, insurance companies were able to avoid their liability with regard to this matter on the basis that arrangements <Col N="1193" /> or settlements were made without admission of liability.  Actually, I was not in a position to cover that matter properly in my proposed amendment but I think it comes into the next amendment which Deputy Costello has tabled.  I feel that the insurance companies should not be put in a privileged position in a matter of this nature and I would ask the Minister, if he is not prepared to accept the amendment I have put down, to consider a suitable adjustment of the section itself that will meet the point that I have raised.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that, technically, my amendment is not very satisfactory but I am concerned with bringing home to the Minister and the House here that members of local authorities and the public will be seriously perturbed if the local authority hospitals are excluded from the right to follow the insurance companies for the cost of treatment of patients in local authority hospitals.  Every local authority that I know of in the West and indeed in other parts of the country has already made strong representations to the Department in connection with this matter and I am sure that other Deputies in the House who are members of local authorities have been asked by their own county councils to ensure that this section as it stands is not allowed to go through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>With the object behind Deputy McQuillan's amendment I am of course in complete agreement and I agree to his amendment and mine being considered together because I think that, fundamentally, they are aimed at the same purpose. As the section stands at the moment and as the general law is not altogether, but to some extent, being administered in various courts by judges and juries throughout the country, the position is, and it has to be faced, that a person who is guilty of a civil wrong against another person and, under the law, is bound to pay damages to him, is being subsidised by the ratepayers and taxpayers of this country.  That is the fundamental issue that has to be faced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand the purpose behind this section at all.  I had some difficulty in relation to the original <Col N="1194" /> section in the Act of 1933.  I would like to know if that section has ever been operated to any extent at all.  In my experience it has not.  It was put into the Act, as I understand it, because of the position that existed at that time about voluntary hospitals and also hospitals then established in the nature of health institutions&mdash;as they are now called&mdash;otherwise, places where poor people had to go, and there was some reason why they were entitled to a certain amount of money.  The fundamental position is as I stated at the beginning.</P>
    <P>Let us get down to the actual principles of this matter.  This section as it stands at the moment proposes that where a person has been injured by another, has suffered damage and is treated in a hospital other than a health institution, then that hospital is entitled to recovery of a certain figure for treatment and medical and surgical expenses, I presume.  I emphasise &ldquo;a certain figure&rdquo; as it seems to me that the section as it stands limits the right to recover the full amount of the cost of hospital treatment, maintenance in the hospital and medical expenses in general.</P>
    <P>The general law is that if a person injures another through his own fault, which is the situation envisaged in this section, that person has to pay damages. These damages include what are known technically as &lsquo;special damages.&rsquo; Special damages include in particular the cost of maintenance in hospital whether it be a public hospital or a nursing home.  They include reasonable expenses for physicians, surgeons, physiotherapists, nursing attendance, and medicines.  That is all given as a matter of course.  It is no thanks to the defendant to have to pay this as juries are frequently reminded.  This merely indemnifles him against his costs and the expenses which he has actually to pay. The only check on that is that the jury is bound and entitled to give only reasonable expenses.  In other words a person cannot go wild and spend any amount of money because there is the safeguard that a jury of twelve reasonable men are bound to allow only reasonable expenses.  That is the position as it stands.  This section cuts <Col N="1195" /> into the administration of the Health Acts, and the administration of the law relating to insurance companies, whom the law makes liable for the payment of these moneys, under the Health Acts. I hope I am putting this thing as clearly as possible to people who perhaps do not understand the significance of it as it works out in the courts.  In every case that comes before the courts, there is wrangling about this before the case comes into court.  What are known to our profession as notices of petition are served by the defendant&mdash;otherwise, by the insurance companies: Is the plaintiff entitled to the benefits of the Health Acts and, if so, what is his position?  They then proceed to plead that he is not so entitled, that the defendant is not bound to pay the surgeon, the specialists and the physiotherapists who looked after him or the hospital which provided his food.  They are getting out of their liability to the plaintiff by this means and who is to pay?  The taxpayer and the ratepayer combined must pay.  I say it is quite unjust and wrong that that should be the position.</P>
    <P>I went into this matter very fully on the Second Reading of the Bill because I felt so strongly about it that I wanted to give the Minister as much time as possible to consider the matter which the Deputy thinks is causing great disturbance in the administration of the courts in relation to these negligence actions, actions arising out of breaches of duty, and other matters of that kind.  Look at the position.  The common law is that a wrong-doer now in fact, in these negligence cases, in running-down cases, is the insurance company.  The law is founded on justice&mdash;that they are bound because of this wrong-doing to defend the wrong-doer against reasonable expenses that he has incurred.  If a person is injured by another, he is not alone entitled but he is bound to take reasonable steps to become well as quickly as he can.  He is bound to get the appropriate expert surgical and medical attention.  That is not a question of a luxury; it is a question of a liability on him under the general law on damages.  The person is bound to <Col N="1196" /> minimise his own damages.  I have reason to believe that I have judicial support for the statement I am making, that it is both of benefit to the injured party and to the insurance company that the injured party should get the best surgical and medical attention, the best possible treatment, to enable him get better quickly.  He is bound to get the best surgical and medical attention.</P>
    <P>What happens in these negligence cases is that a person is injured; he is on the roadside, either unconscious or so seriously ill that he is not able to take into account the fact that he is entitled to go to the best nursing home or get the best medical attention. Because he is unconscious, because he is lying on the roadside, because of the accident and the wrong that has been committed against him, he is brought to some public health authority hospital.  He is brought there, not knowing where he is being brought. He is put there and he is bound to stay there.</P>
    <P>If he had sufficient sense or if there was a lawyer at his elbow, he would, when the ambulance came along, tell the ambulance men to go to St. Vincent's Nursing Home or, say, the Bon Secours Hospital in Cork.  What happens?  He is brought to the first hospital, which is usually the county hospital, but if he had the sense he might have said: &ldquo;I want to go into hospital as a private patient.&rdquo;  Dealing with the question of reasonableness because he is unconscious, because he is suffering from so much pain he does not know where to get relief but he is brought into a county hospital.  Then the insurance company say that because it was an accident he was brought there. That institution is subsidised by the taxpayer and the ratepayer.  Surely there is no justice in that?  Why should an insurance company be subsidised by the taxpayer or the ratepayer?  Why should the county surgeon, the nurses and the physiotherapists have to give their services to this person, in effect, free, while if he had been brought to a private hospital, the surgeons, the doctors, the physiotherapists and the nurses would get their reasonable fees settled by a jury?  I see no justice&mdash; rather do I see great injustice&mdash;in all <Col N="1197" /> this&mdash;injustice to the injured person and injustice to the taxpayer and the ratepayer.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that when I am asking for this rule to be changed, so far as it is a rule of practical law, I am doing so because the injured person is not getting benefit out of it or the best surgical, medical and hospital treatment he should get.  He is getting no benefit out of it.  He is getting general damages for pain and suffering. It is ridiculous and unjust that because a person happens to be unconscious on the road, he is brought to the local authority hospital while, if he had his full senses, he could go to a surgeon in a private hospital, or a nursing home.  Because he is unconscious, he is brought to a county hospital and this section comes into operation.</P>
    <P>May I put just another consideration from the point of view of the public interest?  These accidents on the road have become very frequent and the time and attention required to be given by county surgeons, nurses and other people in these institutions are becoming more and more demanding. Because of these accidents and the results of these accidents, because of the wrong-doer, the county surgeon has at any time this sort of emergency facing him.  The county surgeon, to the detriment of the other patients in the hospital, has to give his entire time and attention to treating accident cases. Where is the justification for that? Does it not work unfairly against the other patients who are entitled to get free treatment in the hospital, who are entitled to get the full time of county physicians, nurses and other necessary experts?  Their time and attention are being taken away from people who are being deprived of them in order that the person who has been injured by the wrongdoing of another person may be dealt with.  How can it be justifiable in those circumstances to say that the insurance company must be indemnified and, at least, subsidised by the ratepayer and taxpayer?  The thing is beyond all reason and I cannot understand why it has been allowed to go on so long.</P>
    <P>It has gone on so long because no <Col N="1198" /> one, when the Act was going through, ever envisaged a situation of the kind arising, but when the matter becomes one of practical importance, of course the insurance company sees the point and says: &ldquo;When the law gives you a right, if you are a person of means, to free treatment, although we injured you wrongly and although we insured the person who wrongly injured you, you must get your money from the taxpayer and the ratepayer.&rdquo;  Where is the justice in all that?</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes to insert a new section in the Bill which deals with the situation I have described. Deputy McQuillan has been placing health institutions on the same level as ordinary hospitals.  I think the section itself is of little use.  The plaintiff is entitled to recover damages, to recover his hospital and medical expenses; he is bound to pay these to the hospital.  Why the hospital itself should then have the particular power that is put into the Bill, I cannot say, but if it is necessary, let it be for all and let it be perfectly clear that the insurance companies are not going to be subsidised by the taxpayer and ratepayer.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that a man who is injured by a wrong-doer, which is the case envisaged in this section, is entitled to get the expenses he is put to for medical, hospital and other expenses.  He is bound to get the best of medical attention in order to minimise his damages.  He gets these expenses from the judge and jury or from a judge without a jury.  The hospital then gets what it is entitled to get for treatment and maintenance of that person and other services given to him.</P>
    <P>That is the logical and legal position as it stands, irrespective of these Acts. I think that when the matter has been brought to the attention of this House, it should right what is really a grave injustice to the ratepayers and incidentally to those people who are entitled to free treatment or partially free treatment in health institutions.  It should also set right the position in relation to doctors and surgeons who are giving their services to these classes of people at the expense of <Col N="1199" /> other classes of people and who give their services free, gratis and for nothing.</P>

      <P>I agree with most of what Deputy Costello has said, that if an injured man in his senses had the option, he would go to a nursing home. I think it is more than likely nowadays that, with the advances in health institutions under the control of local authorities, he would opt to go to the county hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking for my own county, I would say it is more than likely he would go to the health institution run by the local authority or run jointly with the local authority as in the case of a regional hospital, in which instance the expenses would fall on the county ratepayers and, of course, a proportion on the taxpayers.  We must also have regard to the fact that future legislation is likely to extend the number of health institutions coming within the scope of the Health Acts and it is not too exaggerated a view to think that at some time in the not too distant future, we may have a completely comprehensive national health scheme which will include almost all hospitals. If that should happen, it would virtually mean that the cost of treatment in a hospital would not fall on the insurance companies at all.  The easiest thing for the Minister to do in relation to subsection (1) paragraph (c) is to exclude the words &ldquo;other than&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;including a health institution within the meaning of the Health Act, 1947.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a wrong principle that where an accident occurs and the insured party is treated in an institution within the meaning of the Health Act, 1947, or any other subsequent Health <Col N="1200" /> Acts, the cost should fall on the taxpayer and ratepayer.  To my mind, it is unjust and it cuts across the whole idea of insurance as we understand it. I should like to ask the Minister to have another look at the section in the light of the views expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should look at these amendments from another angle.  One of the greatest hardships people have to bear at the moment is the ever-increasing burden of rates.  Year after year, our rates are increasing and one of the major matters contributing to that increase is the Health Act.  Health costs are rising.  The Health Act was introduced, in my opinion, for the purpose of giving to those people who could not afford it the benefit of health services free of charge at the expense of the other citizens of the State.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that these people should have to go to institutions when they fall into sickness or disease and it is also unfortunate that the taxpayers must pay for their treatment while they are there.  Is it not much worse that the taxpayer must pay for them when they are being medically treated and receiving hospitalisation as a result of the neligence of some person who has paid a premium to indemnify himself against such negligence?</P>
      <P>The cost of the upkeep of a patient in a hospital, apart from medical treatment, is, I understand, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 25/- or 30/- a day.  One can visualise the position of a labourer or a small farmer who may be unlucky enough to be maimed in a road accident, through no fault or negligence of his own.  He may find himself in hospital for a period of 12 months.  It is unfortunate for him but it is equally unfortunate for the taxpayer who must pay, apart from surgical fees, a sum of 25/- or 30/- per day for keeping him in the hospital as a result of the negligence of a third party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know who objects to these amendments.  Certainly it is not the local authority.  The local authority would be very anxious to see these amendments accepted because it would <Col N="1201" /> relieve the burden of rates.  I know of no motorist who objects to these amendments.  Therefore we must boil it down to this, that the only people who object to the amendments are the insurance companies.  If the insurance companies, with all the increases we have allowed them in their premium charges, must distinguish between voluntary hospitals and public institutions for the purpose of cutting down expenses, it is something we should consider in this House.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Costello pointed out, one can visualise a man being knocked unconscious and finding himself in a public institution where he may have to remain for a considerable time. That man, if he had been conscious, might have elected to go into a private nursing home or into part of an institution reserved for private patients.  He would be paid for by the insurance company, if he was in the right, while being treated there.  If he is put into a public ward and treated in that part of the hospital where public patients are usually treated, the local authorities cannot recover maintenance costs.</P>
    <P>Though it has been the practice for insurance companies or solicitors for the defence to say in their particulars of special damages: &ldquo;Was the plaintiff entitled to free hospital treatment?  If so, such treatment should not be included in the special damages,&rdquo; very often, however, there has been a dispute between the county manager and the patient as to whether he was entitled to free hospital treatment or not.  The patient may never have applied for a medical card.  Up to the present when such a dispute arose and if there was a settlement, insurance companies usually paid whatever fee was demanded by the county manager. Here we are relieving the insurance companies of the fee payment which they made up to the present in settled cases.  I would ask the Minister, from the taxpayers' point of view, to accept these amendments for the purpose of relieving the taxpayer of the burden of paying for those unfortunate people who find themselves in hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is well aware, under the Health Acts, eligible <Col N="1202" /> persons are entitled to hospital and specialist services as a right, not as a concession.  That being so, the conditions relating to eligibility relate to his present circumstances.  In the case of an injured party, whether by road accident, an accident in the home or wherever it may be, his eligibility is dependent on his circumstances as at that time and not on the basis of regard being had to the outcome of some possible future legal action following an injury for which somebody else is blamed.  The first thing we have to realise when a person is injured and the position is still undetermined, as it must remain for some time, is that the injury was caused by another, that that other was concerned in a road accident and that insurance claims and such will follow.  Those things cannot possibly be taken into consideration on the admission of the injured party to whatever hospital he may be brought.  To have regard to the future in that instance is not part of the condition of a declaration as to eligibility for Health Act benefits to these eligible classes.</P>
      <P>Another point which I think should clearly be understood is that no distinction whatever is made in our existing health services legislation as to the circumstances whereby the disability has arisen.  For instance, it would be strange indeed and somewhat inconsistent that a health authority would be expected&mdash;to follow the line of argument used here&mdash;to follow a person for costs who, as a third party, was negligent and that at the same time, if a person through his own negligence injures himself or brings some disability on himself&mdash;and there are many such cases&mdash;he should be treated free under our health services, whereas a person who was injured by a third party in the self-same circumstances would have his injury covered by recourse to the courts and a claim established against the insurance company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which I think is of importance in this, taking up the matter raised by Deputy J.A. Costello, is the case of the injured unconscious person along the roadside who is brought off to the nearest institution and has no <Col N="1203" /> choice in the matter.  He has no choice anyhow, if he is badly injured, even if not quite unconscious.  It is generally somebody else, particularly if the injury is in any way serious, who comes along and makes the decision as to where the nearest medical aid can be obtained.  If he is not a medical man, he does not know how serious the injury may be.  Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, the nearest medical or surgical institution is, I take it, the place to which the injured party will be brought.</P>
    <P>If the person is injured and unconscious and is brought to an institution which, by being nearest, also turns out to be a public authority institution, there is no reason why, when he regains consciousness, he should not demand and be brought to some other voluntary or private institution.  It is open to any of these parties, whether it is on the roadside where the injury takes place or later in the public institution, to decide that he wants to have other treatment, to be treated in a different place, to be treated by a different surgeon or physician or specialist, as the case may be.  Nobody precludes that person, so injured, from opting to have these things done.</P>
    <P>Also, no one, whether or not he is eligible for benefits under the Health Acts, obliges that person to avail of these health services benefits.  In fact, under Section 4 of the 1953 Act, it is specifically set out that one is not compelled to avail of them.  On the other hand, if a patient is brought to a public institution and remains there, and does not seek to get out or go elsewhere, that person may also, on leaving the institution, settle up the account and insert that cost in his claim for damages and costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably some of them interpret the law in that way.  I have no <Col N="1204" /> information that that is the interpretation of the law.  I do not disagree with the Deputy: he may be aware that such interpretation has been made. The whole outcry seems to be that, regardless of the circumstances, merely by reason of the fact that a motor accident involves some innocent party who is injured, because an insurance company enters into this matter, the insurance company should be made to pay all and sundry costs arising from or relating to a particular injury despite the fact that the person concerned is in his own right, by his own eligibility, entitled to certain specific treatments, both hospital and specialist.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to say that surgeons and their staffs in these institutions are, in effect, giving free service to these people.  Surgeons and their staffs are already being paid to give service to this category of person and an additional fee to be paid from insurance or where you will is in fact paying those people on the double for doing the job they are already liable to do under the Health Acts and through their local authority conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>Also, it has been said that a county surgeon has to give his whole time, his undivided time, to these cases which are brought in, to the detriment of others entitled to free treatment.  The person under discussion here is already entitled to free treatment from the self-same surgeon, hospital and institution. Therefore, he is not taking away from others in the hospital any rights they have.  He is not getting something to which he is not entitled already under the Health Acts.  Any argument in that direction is not, I think, a watertight argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also in some way suggested that by doing as we propose in the Bill, we are putting money into the pockets of the insurance companies.  Insurance premiums, as we have heard on many occasions, have become inflated as a result of claims settled inside and outside the courts, arising from accidents. The costs in question here are costs which, if not taken from the insurance companies, must mean, if they are of a substantial nature over a period, a lesser cost of insurance premiums to <Col N="1205" /> road users in general.  It would not be true to say&mdash;in fact it is wrong to say&mdash;that the insurance companies will reap the benefit.  It is the people who are obliged to insure who will reap the benefit in that their premiums need not, of necessity, be then as high.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, Deputy Costello's amendment makes no provision to prevent the removal to a public institution of any person injured on the roadside.</P>

      <P>That gave me the impression that the Deputy was complaining that this did happen.  There is nothing I can see that we could do to prevent this happening, if the person injured is incapable of giving directions at the time.  However, that is not the really important point.  It is this: the question of telling the public that where an insurance company is concerned in a motor accident, the insurance company is fair game for all that can be piled upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be quite frank about this.  I have had experience&mdash;and I know other Deputies have had experience&mdash; of what happens when a vehicle is damaged.  When you go to a garage, there are two prices: one, if you have to bear the cost of the repairs yourself, and the other, if it is borne by an insurance company.  In the first case, it is not such an exorbitant charge; but if there is an insurance claim, there <Col N="1206" /> is different treatment.  It may be better treatment&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but certainly it costs the insurance companies a lot more to get a job done on my behalf&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making a special plea for injured persons, eligible by right to health services, institutional and specialist treatment, that when they are involved in a motor accident, the insurance company should bear the costs of their treatment; but if there is an injury in the home or on the farm, it is not said that the person involved should follow somebody else in order to get this special treatment which only the insurance company can afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Candidly, I believe the treatment an injured person gets in this country is not related to whether or not he is an insurance case.  When a person is brought into a hospital, voluntary or <Col N="1207" /> public, in an emergency, the first thought is the treatment and who pays is, in my opinion, a secondary consideration. Therefore, I cannot see why it is felt that, because a person may be incapable of directing those who find him after an accident or who accompanied him, it is going to be to his detriment.  When he comes around to full consciousness, he can, if he wishes, ask for special treatment, perhaps as a private patient in a voluntary hospital or as a patient of a doctor other than the doctor who treated him in the first instance.  In such cases, the additional costs can be added to the bill of damages and costs for the person who caused the injury.  Under Section 4 of the 1953 Act, persons are not obliged to partake of these benefits, if they do not want to have them, but in getting treatment over and above normal health service treatment, they could legitimately claim the recovery of such costs, and I have no doubt that they would succeed in any of our courts.</P>

      <P>I do not intend further to put up my blood pressure arguing this matter because it is quite obvious that the Minister having produced specious arguments, no one of which had any validity in relation to the case put forward, has made up his mind not to accept this very just demand made in the interests of the ratepayers and taxpayers.  Accordingly, I do not propose to occupy the time of the House further.  But I want to make one observation, when the Minister talks about the unfortunate insurance companies.  Have they reduced their premiums since they started pleading the Health Act in court in order to justify their refusal to pay doctors' and hospitals' expenses? They have put them up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to the Minister's remarks.  He stated the argument had been put forward here that this was putting money into the pockets of the insurance companies. May I put it another way&mdash;that the section as it stands is taking money <Col N="1208" /> out of the pockets of the ratepayers and taxpayers, since the costs involved should be paid by the insurance companies? In the course of his remarks, the Minister disclosed that he is here as the advocate of the insurance companies. The only case he made was that about the two types of costings for the repair of cars, where in one case there was an insurance policy and in the other, the owner of the car had to bear the cost himself.  The insurance companies have their assessors and it is up to the insurance companies to protect themselves in regard to the cost of repairs.  They are very familiar with making assessments.  I cannot see how the Minister can make a comparison between assessing the cost of repairing a car and the cost of treating an injured person in hospital.</P>
      <P>If his case has any fragment of truth in it with regard to the question of premiums, will he now answer the question: why is it that voluntary hospitals are treated in a different way? Why does he single out the hospitals that are controlled by the public and whose administration is under the control of the public through public representatives? Why does he single them out and make the local authority pay the charges, thereby saving the insurance company, and give special consideration to the voluntary hospitals? Is it simply because the number of voluntary hospitals is now reduced?  As Deputy Russell pointed out, as time goes on more and more of them will be absorbed and come under the Health Act until we reach the stage where the insurance companies will be free of responsibility with regard to the payment of hospital charges altogether although people will be paying higher premiums.  In comes this young Minister to act as the defender of insurance companies in a matter like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan is not as innocent as he would like to appear.  He has tried to convey to the House that he does not realise that since public institutions are there, administration costs are practically the same one year with the other.  A few patients up and down do not interfere with the costs which are of considerable <Col N="1209" /> magnitude.  The staffs of the hospitals, surgical, medical, nursing and domestic, are the same one week with the other because these costs are continuing and a few patients more or less do not affect them very gravely.  This particular isolated group of eligible persons under the Health Acts are already being provided for.  Whatever may be their disabilities, whatever sickness, accident or otherwise befalls them, there is provision already to make the full paraphernalia of the health institutions available to them by right and for these services the local authority, through the ratepayers and the general public through the taxpayers, must contribute whether there is a greater or lesser number of patients.</P>
      <P>It is true that the amount of food eaten by extra patients would directly affect the cost but the overall cost of maintenance, the pay of medical, surgical, nursing and domestic staffs, the heating, cleaning and so on of these places is already a very big item which the local authorities or the ratepayers or the taxpayers cannot get away with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Deputy we should insist that when a person goes into this <Col N="1210" /> hospital, provided with all its services at very great cost, because of the fact that he was injured in a road accident and an insurance company stands somewhere in the background, the surgeons, physicians and anaesthetists and others should be paid additional fees for treating that person whom they are already paid to treat, by the local authorities, the ratepayers and taxpayers. It would be well, if the Deputy and the House are to have regard to reality, that they should calculate whether or not the treatment of the eligible group by the hospitals under the ordinary health services to which they are entitled, is not more economical than if double charges for the same patients were to be allowed.  I think the Deputy will appreciate that argument.  While you may suggest the taxpayers or ratepayers may pay somewhat more, it means that, taking it by and large, a more economical method of treating the injuries in these cases can be found if this measure before the House is passed than if the amendment were accepted.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to move my amendment, but I want to make it perfectly clear that my not moving it is in no way an acceptance of the Minister's case or his arguments. I want to consider the matter further.</P>
      <P>Amendment not moved.</P>
      <P>Section 120 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 112.</P>
      <P>Before Section 121 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister may establish a Road Traffic Research organisation to undertake research into matters relating to transport, traffic movement, traffic control, road construction, planning and design, vehicle construction and design, and such other matters as may be related to the improvement of the safety and efficiency of road traffic.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may make suitable arrangements for liaison between such Road Traffic Research organisation and local authorities, town planning departments, the Garda Síochána, road safety organisations, and such other bodies as may be concerned with the study of traffic problems.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment is more or less self-explanatory. I do not propose to speak at length on it but I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments. I should like to point out, however, that the British Road Traffic Act contains identically the same section. The Minister is to some extent influenced by what appears in the British legislation and I do not blame him for that because conditions are somewhat similar in the two countries.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a research organisation such as is proposed in the amendment would do a tremendous amount in the cause of promoting better road traffic conditions.  I would be the first to agree with the Minister that no matter how much legislation goes through this House to regulate traffic and to provide penalties for contraventions of road traffic rules, we still will have a tremendous number of accidents, unfortunately.  No matter how much we legislate and no matter how many penalties there are, there will still be careless drivers who will deliberately do wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A research organisation like this would certainly assist the Minister and all those concerned with trying to provide for a proper flow of safe traffic.  From time to time, traffic experts from other cities in Europe have visited this city.  Recently a traffic expert came here from Germany.  How he helped road traffic in the city, I do not know, or whether or not he did help it, I do not know.  This organisation would be in a position to get information from other countries, especially in Europe, and from England, <Col N="1213" /> if needs be, in an effort to improve traffic conditions and transport generally, to improve traffic control, road construction, planning, design, vehicle construction and design and other different matters which we all agree relate to the improvement, the safety and efficiency of road traffic.</P>
    <P>In proposing such an organisation, one does not, of course, omit the local authorities and the Garda who are primarily concerned with the construction of roads and the control of road traffic.  In fact, our case is stated in the two subsections of the amendment, which is, as I have said, self-explanatory. I know the Minister does not want any organisation which would appear to coerce him along certain lines of action.  This would be purely a consultative research organisation whose deliberations and decisions would be passed on to the Minister, the local authorities and the Garda for their information.  It would not be mandatory on them to implement any recommendations made by this organisation. In fact, we are lacking in that type of research which would provide us with better roads and better control of road traffic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters in the amendment proposed by Deputy Corish are, in fact, unnecessary for the reason that even as things now are, there are bodies carrying out exploration and consultation in certain respects at the moment.  With regard to the problem of Dublin traffic which was mentioned by the Deputy, a group representative of the Department of Local Government, the Garda and Dublin Corporation has been set up with a view to getting the fullest co-operation between all parties concerned in this matter. They are considering and studying what might best be done to improve the general traffic pattern, in particular, in the city, and to improve traffic in a general way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another group of which the Deputy may be aware representative of the Department, the Garda and the motoring organisations, local authority engineers and Bord Failte advised on the 1956 traffic signs regulations. <Col N="1214" /> Another group which had been continuously working on the Road Traffic Bill was representative of the Department, the Garda, the local authority engineers had, in fact, started to work on a review of construction, equipment and the use of regulations.  That work has had to be deferred during the passage of this Bill through the Houses. That same work and review will again be taken up as soon as we get this measure from the Oireachtas and have finished with it here.</P>
    <P>Another matter of interest also is that money has been made available from the Road Fund to University College, Dublin, at some stage or another, for research on the reconstruction of roads, for instance, over peat sub-grades.  That is merely an indication to the House of what has been done and indeed is being done as things now stand.  It is my firm belief that research of various kinds can usefully be carried out and will be carried out, and that no law and no special provision is necessary.  The Deputy and the House will appreciate that to embody it in legislation will not make it any more effective, particularly as a consultative body.</P>
    <P>Many and varied bodies set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in this type of situation are likely to be a better approach altogether than putting it into law by an amendment of this kind.  So far as research is concerned, I feel from experience that the indications plainly are there to be appreciated that such work will continue in future, and that this aspect of the whole road traffic and road safety problem is given full and due consideration and will undoubtedly get the same consideration in the future.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, and not because I disagree with the intention of the amendment in any way &mdash; because the amendment is not really necessary, or writing it into law does not improve the situation in any way, and an <i>ad hoc</i> basis of operation is, in my estimation, a preferable approach to these many matters which will arise as circumstances change &mdash; I assure the Deputy that, bearing in mind past experience, the opinions of experts at present, and the wish of any Minister <Col N="1215" /> for Local Government on this matter, all and any of these aids are a greater safety and that regulations dealing with road traffic will be availed of to the full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the different bodies the Minister mentioned are diligent and conscientious.  He has mentioned five or six organisations which concern themselves, often on a voluntary basis, with our road traffic problems, road construction and the other matters pertaining to road traffic. It seems to me from what the Minister has said now that there is a stronger case than ever for some attempt to coordinate the efforts of all these organisations. The principal organisation which the Minister mentioned was that in relation to the city of Dublin.  Whilst I appreciate that the traffic problem in the city of Dublin from the point of view of congestion is about the biggest problem in the whole country, there still needs to be established some sort of organisation which will engage in research, say, with regard to the method of construction, cambering, surfacing, the materials used, and so on.  This is a section which does not bind the Minister to anything.  I do not intend to press it to a division, but I am sure the Minister will note that the amendment says &ldquo;The Minister may establish.&rdquo;  He could, I think, well consider accepting the amendment.  It does not necessarily mean that he is under obligation to establish this organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill is passed, we all know that it will take years and years to have introduced in this House even the slightest amendment in connection with road traffic problems. That seems to be the pattern of legislation in this House.  Deputies on both sides have pressed for an amendment of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, on various counts and the attitude of successive responsible Ministers has been: &ldquo;We are collecting all these defects in the Road Traffic Act of 1933 and, when we have them all, we will introduce a new Road Traffic Bill.&rdquo;  I do not think that is the proper way to behave in these <Col N="1216" /> matters.  It is twenty-eight years now since a Road Traffic Bill was introduced into this House.  If the Minister does not accept amendments in relation to which he does not feel sufficiently enthusiastic, they do not go into the Bill; but here is an amendment which merely asks him to accept power to establish a research organisation, if he so thinks fit, and not this year, or next year, or the year after.  The amendment merely gives this power to any Minister who may feel that such an organisation is worthwhile.  It does not bind.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable that we should have such an organisation.  Perhaps the Minister would consider accepting this, or a similar, amendment between this and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Before section 121 to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister shall appoint a Road Traffic Advisory Council representative of local authorities, the Garda Síochána and of workers' and employers' organisations, to <Col N="1217" /> which regulations proposed to be made under this Act shall be referred for its observations.</P>

      <P>Under this section we are taking away the right of appeal to the Minister for Justice for the removal of a suspension of a driver's licence.  That right of appeal has been exercised in many cases down through the years.  A great deal depended on the political pull of the suspended driver where the removal, or otherwise, of the suspension was concerned. I am in complete agreement with the section, but I suggest that this might be a good time to declare a moratorium. Possibly some drivers who had their licences suspended were in a position to exercise political pull to have the suspension removed: others were not.  Would the Minister make representations to his colleague, the Minister for Justice, and ask him to declare a moratorium removing all suspensions, and then let us start with a clean sheet under this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of trouble will ensue under this section in regard to the definition of nuisance. I am told that within the next three or four months many vehicles with loud speakers attached, which might be described as a nuisance, will be operating round the country in connection with the forthcoming general election.  Here, in the city of Dublin, there are vehicles going round advertising various commodities or making appeals for various organisations.  A Garda may decide that such an apparatus constitutes a nuisance and the user may find himself prosecuted.</P>
      <P>I can give an illustration.  I know of a particular case in Bundoran.  It is the custom there during the summer months to use a vehicle known as a &ldquo;Duck&rdquo;&mdash;mechanically propelled and amphibious&mdash;for the entertainment of guests on the beach.  Certain people have taken exception to it and have suggested it is a nuisance.  It may be that these people think the vehicle too cumbersome on the foreshore.  Those who operate it may find themselves prosecuted under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, it has now been held that a &ldquo;public place&rdquo; is not necessarily a public road. In the Northern courts it has been held that the precincts of the Catholic Cathedral in Derry are a public place. People have been successfully prosecuted for parking vehicles inside the grounds of the Cathedral in Derry.  It <Col N="1219" /> may be that our courts may follow suit and we may find a public place described as any place to which the public has access.  The public has access to the foreshore and this section may cause considerable inconvenience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the Minister but when the 1933 Act was introduced it was accepted and has been accepted for a good many years after its introduction that a &ldquo;public place&rdquo; merely referred to a public roadway.  As a result of recent decisions, that has been extended and a &ldquo;public place&rdquo; is now any place to which the public has access.  That is really what worries me.  I agree that it was in the 1933 Act.  If the Minister would care to look up the debate on the 1933 Bill, he will find that when the section in that Bill was being debated it was accepted generally that it was merely referring to a public roadway.</P>

      <P>Everybody seems to be quite well satisfied.  I compliment the Minister on the White Paper he circulated, which gave us a great deal of valuable information.  It tells us in regard to Section 127:</P>
      <P>Section 127 modifies the Motor Car (International Circulation) Act, 1909, by substituting references to Part III of the Bill for references in that Act to the Motor Car Act, 1903. This provision is of a transitional nature: the 1909 Act is repealed by the Local Government Act, 1955, but the repealing provision of the latter Act has not yet been brought into operation pending the making of comprehensive new regulations on the subject of international circulation.</P>
      <P>So, this is a transitional proviso to fill a gap until the Minister makes new regulations under this Bill?</P>

      <P>I want to return to it for a moment, if I may.  There is provision here, Sir, in paragraph 4 which refers back to an offence under Section 49.  That is what we had some discussion about and I want to say another word on that.</P>
      <P>The House has decided, apparently, in principle not to adopt blood tests, breath tests or the definition of the words &ldquo;under the influence of drink or drug.&rdquo;  I want to say one last word on that matter.  The last time I spoke about it Deputy Murphy was alarmed and dismayed by what he thought was the extravagance of my proposal.</P>
      <P>I want to put it to the House that where we prescribe penalties there is a very great obligation on us to make it perfectly clear and certain what is the offence which involves the penalty.  I would direct the attention of the House to the fact that in Great Britain today, by the passage of the Homicide Act, no man now knows whom he may murder and whom he may not.  You murder one man and you are hung.  You murder somebody else in extravagantly worse circumstances the following morning and you get what is in effect nine years penal servitude.  A situation of uncertainty and ambiguity is arising there which militates gravely against respect for the law.</P>
      <P>I hope that despite the Minister's reluctance to adopt the methods obtaining in Scandinavian countries and in many parts of the U.S.A. he will be able to consider, before we finally dispose of this Bill, at least providing a person charged, with the right to ask for a blood test and providing somewhere in this Bill the minimum alcoholic content of blood which will sustain a charge of being under the influence of drink.  I think unless we do that we are creating a degree of uncertainty or ambiguity about the law in a situation which involves mandatory disqualification together with other substantial penalties that we ought not to allow.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Bill, 1961&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is to give effect to certain recommendations which the Advisory Committee on the Marketing of Agricultural Produce made in their &ldquo;Report on Shell Eggs and Liquid Egg&rdquo;.  The Bill does not deal with the marketing of eggs generally, but with two limited aspects of the egg trade, namely: removing, as far as home trade is concerned, the requirement on wholesalers to mark fresh shell eggs; and providing for the registration and control of premises manufacturing egg products, such as at present applies to the premises of wholesalers and dealers in shell eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill will give power to amend the regulations governing the marketing of eggs by wholesalers, in order that wholesalers may be relieved of the statutory obligation to mark fresh eggs intended for sale on the home market.  Under the 1939 Act, all eggs received at and consigned from registered wholesalers' premises must be marked with prescribed marks and the regulations prescribing the marks to be applied to eggs consigned from registered wholesalers' premises must provide for the marking of every egg so consigned.  It will continue to be necessary for wholesalers to mark, with the appropriate marks, eggs which are not fresh eggs &mdash; for example: preserved eggs and second-quality eggs &mdash; and, subject to any exemptions that <Col N="1226" /> may be granted, fresh eggs which are consigned for export.</P>
    <P>The Marketing Advisory Committee remarked in their Report upon the preference shown by domestic consumers for unstamped eggs, and the extent to which that preferential demand caused the home trade in eggs to be diverted into the hands of persons whose movements were such as to make it easy for them to evade inspection and control of their activities with regard to eggs.  The Committee recommended that the code mark on eggs sold on the home market should be abolished, as having failed to serve its purpose.  In the White Paper on the Marketing of Irish Agricultural Produce, dealing with the Advisory Committee's Reports, the Government agreed that opinion was generally in favour of this and indicated that the recommendation would be implemented.</P>
    <P>Effect has already been given to the recommendation, so far as the code-marking of eggs by retailers is concerned, by regulations made in May, 1960, under which retailers are not obliged to code mark eggs acquired by them from producers for retail sale.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill provide for the registration of manufacturers' premises, under similar conditions to those applicable to the registered premises of traders in shell eggs, and for control over the conditions of manufacture and preparation of egg products.  The Marketing Advisory Committee recommended that control should be exercised over the liquid egg industry so as to ensure the production of a top quality product meeting the requirements of importing countries.  As indicated in the White Paper, the matter was in fact already under consideration by my Department.</P>
    <P>Preparations consisting of whole egg or egg yolk or egg white, with or without other substances as additives or preservatives, may be put up in the form of liquids or crystals or in frozen, dried or powdered form and may be used for various purposes. Their main use is for inclusion as ingredients in foods for human consumption (in confectionery, ice cream, <Col N="1227" /> salad dressing, etc.), but they may also have certain industrial uses.  In view of the number and variety of such preparations and the different purposes for which they may be intended, it is not practicable to define in general terms &ldquo;egg products&rdquo; for the purposes of the Bill.  It is proposed, therefore, to specify in regulations the individual products which will constitute egg products within the meaning of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for control over the manufacture, testing, grading and packing of egg products, the sampling and bacteriological examination of such products, and control over the sale of egg products found to be of an inferior quality or unsuitable for the purpose for which they are offered for sale.  The absence from this Bill of any specific provision for control of the export of egg products is due to the fact that export control is already exercisable by the Minister for Agriculture under the Agricultural and Fishery Products (Regulation of Export) Act, 1947.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this Bill.  It has one rather interesting element for me because I recollect, that when I was responsible for these matters, on more than one occasion, I raised the question as to whether this practice of stamping eggs for the domestic market should not be abolished.  The interesting thing is that my recollection is that all the technical division in the Department was against this and that the consumers' organisation were against abolishing it. I personally had the view that it did no good.  It set a premium on the person who avoided its provisions as people preferred to buy unstamped eggs.  I think it is right that you should know this.  I was inclined readily to yield my own view and yet on two separate occasions that I can recollect, having discussed this with the technical branch of the Department, I was determined to allow the existing regulation to continue.  Apparently, that view is now changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister's technical advisers have changed their <Col N="1228" /> minds or whether the Minister has decided that the Marketing Advisory Committee's views override the views of his own technical advisers, but I am bound to recall the facts as I know them and to admit that my own personal views coincide with those now expressed by the Marketing Advisory Committee which are being given effect to in this Bill.  I think on the whole, the stamping of eggs for domestic sale was a well-intentioned effort, but it never really worked.  I also agree that it is necessary to retain powers to provide for the stamping of eggs for export, because we have got to comply with import regulations imposed upon us by certain countries with which we trade.</P>
    <P>To tell the truth, I thought the Minister had powers already to control the conditions of manufacture and preparation of egg products.  I am rather surprised to learn he has not.  Has the Minister not got powers to do this in his Bill?  I thought he had and I certainly agree that if he has not, he ought to have.  I take it that the Minister, in the draft regulations he has in mind, will control these matters.  I should be glad, if that is so, if he gave us some indication of the scale of fees he proposes to prescribe in connection with the registration of premises.</P>

      <P>I had no idea that the officials of my Department had any very strong views on this matter of stamping of eggs, but while it is some time since I read the report of the Advisory Committee, there seemed to be almost complete unanimity everywhere and with all their contacts during the course of their deliberations, that the stamping of eggs should be discontinued so far as the home market is concerned.</P>
      <P>I cannot completely recall the optimistic view expressed at the time of the introduction of the proposal to stamp eggs, but I must confess that, while I had no strong view on the subject at the time, I do realise that many of those who were full of enthusiasm for that course, came around apparently to see that it had not the advantages that were claimed for it at the time.</P>
      <P>I have explained the point raised by the Deputy as to the fee that will be charged.  There is a Financial Resolution on its way which would make it possible for me to levy that fee and, as I say, while we have not had any discussions on it, the fee would be as in other cases, £1 per annum.</P>

      <P>I cannot say what is the cost involved, but, as the Deputy knows, there has been a ceiling of £35,000 on the expenditure of the Institute over the past number of years since its establishment.  Even though the ceiling was never actually reached, I believe the reason was that the Institute felt themselves circumscribed by that limit.  Now with greater freedom of administration, with greater scope for research and for testing on their part, I should imagine that the existing ceiling will be exceeded by several thousand pounds.  The procedure will be that the Institute will present its budget every year, much in the same manner as a section of any of the Departments, and it will be discussed in that way.  There will be no upper limit except as will be agreed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the Minister for Finance.  I am sorry I am not able to give any accurate indication of what that figure is likely to be from year to year.</P>

      <P>I want to renew my reservation in regard to this matter. I can see some justification for the <Col N="1233" /> advance of the proposition that this Board set up by this House should exclude from its membership members of the Oireachtas who are actively engaged in the transaction of public business in the Oireachtas.  It seems to me to be highly undesirable that because a person becomes a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas, he is thereupon disqualified from being a member of a board of this kind.</P>
      <P>What is wrong with a man becoming a candidate for election to the Oireachtas? Many a person becomes a candidate with full knowledge that, if he is elected, resignation from a Board of which he is a member will be involved. It is a common experience of people in business and industry that if they become members of the Government Party and are asked to accept office in the Government, it involves their resigning membership of a company to which they may belong, and they take that risk.  Nobody says that if they stand for election, that automatically disqualifies them from membership of the board.</P>
      <P>I want to renew my suggestion that the conditions provided in Section 13 should be abridged to read that &ldquo;any person who becomes a member of either House of the Oireachtas shall. on becoming such member, cease to be a member of the Board.&rdquo; It is going too far simply to say that, because he becomes a candidate, that should disqualify him from membership of a board of this kind.</P>

      <P>I will concede that the necessity for this provision would appear to be much less than the necessity for such a provision in other Acts.  It has been a provision in other Acts such as the Export Promotion Act, 1959, the Shannon Free Airport Development Act, 1959 and the Irish Steel Holdings Act.  During the course of the Second Reading debate, it was suggested to me &mdash; a suggestion to which I readily agree &mdash; that there should be no appearance of political affiliation being used as a qualification for membership of this or any other board.  I stated, as I think we can all readily accept, that in the past people who were known to hold certain political <Col N="1234" /> views and who probably were affiliated to political Parties on either side of this House were put on Government boards.  Apart from the fact that there might be political considerations in it, many of these people were eminently qualified, at any rate.  They were appointed because the Minister involved perhaps knew these individuals better than he knew others who might be equally well qualified for a similar appointment.  However, that is beside the point.</P>
      <P>To ensure, as far as I can in this instance, that the nine members of the Board will be the very best we can get, having regard to qualifications in science, in industrial research or in industrial relations, there should be no appearance whatever of any political affiliations.  To require a person who discloses his political affiliations, by becoming an election candidate, to refrain from membership of this board is I think, a further instance of the suggestion that the board, so far as is humanly possible, should be devoid of any political colour whatever.</P>
      <P>This board will not be engaged in business activities, as such.  Therefore, any suggestion that a person might put himself in a special position of preferment by getting on the board in business relations would not hold any ground.  I am mainly putting forward the section as it stands because of precedent recently created.  I concede that the necessity for requiring a person who becomes a candidate to either House of the Oireachtas to resign from the board is not as strong in respect of other boards, the legislation for which requires resignation as in Section 13. My main reason for putting forward this section is because that precedent occurs in recent legislation.</P>

      <P>This slipped in in the Electricity Supply Board (Amendment) Act, 1958.  It is incorporated in that Bill, No. 35 of 1958, Section 9.  I remember that on that occasion I protested against the principle of saying that because a man becomes a candidate for election to this House or to Seanad Éireann he disqualifies himself from membership of a statutory body.  The anomaly is that any of the officers of this Board can not only be <Col N="1235" /> candidates but can be elected to the House and would be seconded or would be given leave of absence while members of the House.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to concede with some reluctance that, when a man becomes a member of either House, on the whole it is better he should cease to be a member of these boards whose activities may come up for discussion here at any time.  I strongly deprecate the suggestion that because he becomes a candidate he should automatically be disqualified.  I think it is all wrong and that it contributes to the wholly evil thesis that some persons in this country are concerned to promote the idea that to be a candidate for public life in this country is in some degree a pejorative activity that suggests some debasement of a man's standards.</P>
      <P>It is revolting to suggest that because a man is prepared to take part in the public life of his own country he is thereby disqualified from usefully functioning on such a body as this Bill is designed to set up.  That is a disedifying and an improper suggestion to make.  I do not think the Minister should content himself by saying that the principal reason for it is because it appears in another Act. If a mistake appears in one Act that is no reason why we should go on repeating the mistake for evermore.</P>
      <P>I do not think the people who engage in politics are an inferior breed. I have much more respect for a man who makes his political views known and takes no trouble to conceal them, whether he agrees with me or whether he is opposed to me, than I have for the Lanna Machree's dog type of person who protests he is disinterested, that he cannot see any difference between one Party and another.  If he cannot, he is a poor citizen of a free democracy.  If there is a Fine Gael Government in office and there is a distinguished Fianna Fáil scientist, I cannot see any difficulty about his being a member of this board.  I cannot see any reason why, if a Fianna Fáil Government is in office and there is an outstanding scientist of strong Fine Gael persuasion, he should not be a member of this Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> I would have much more respect for a member of this board with strong Fianna Fáil convictions who, if asked to stand as a candidate for his Party, would come out and stand, make his views known and say: &ldquo;If I am elected I shall get off the board and if I am not elected I will get on with my job&rdquo; than for the fellow who protests he has no political views at all.  If such exist, some charitable person ought to undertake their political education so as to give them political views and make them realise they have a duty to help in preserving free institutions in the society in which they have the good fortune to belong.  The best way they can do that is by participation in politics.</P>
    <P>I feel that this kind of section contributes to the general unhealthy attitude which tends to grow in modern times to the whole question of politics. Certainly, when I was a child, and when my father and grandfather were active in public life in this country, nobody looked down upon them because they were politicians.  They were looked up to then.  If an atmosphere is growing up in this country now in which a generation of boys and girls is arising who show a tendency to look down on politicians, can we blame them if we bring in legislation here which says that any man or woman who offers himself or herself as a candidate for election to this House or the Seanad automatically disqualifies himself or herself from sitting on a statutory body?  That is all wrong.</P>
    <P>To accept that as an immutable precedent for legislation in this House is a great evil.  It is one we ought to correct before we let it develop.  We ought to accept generally, as I think we could accept, the principle that persons who are elected to this House or the Seanad should withdraw from statutory bodies of this kind for one reason &mdash; that it may become the duty of this House or the Seanad to discuss the workings of such bodies and that in those circumstances it is not appropriate that one individual should be a member of the body and of the Oireachtas charged with the responsibility of supervising its activities.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to turn <Col N="1237" /> this over in his mind, because almost unoonsciously, I think, we can slip into most undesirable practices of this kind. The tragedy is that nobody appears to give a damn.  But it does seem to me we are encouraging the view amongst young and impressionable people that to be in politics in their own country is something for which a man has almost to apologise.  I do not apologise. I look up to a man who takes his place in politics and faithfully and honestly defends his point of view.  I despise a Lanna Machree's dog, but I think the legislation of the Oireachtas should confirm that point of view and that we should not give it to anybody to say the members of the Oireachtas have come to the conclusion that anyone who stands for Parliament had better be kept out of any body such as the Industrial Research and Standards Bureau, which is expected to do serious work, and anyone who expected to do serious work could not seriously contemplate becoming a politician.  I do not subscribe to that view.  I do not think our legislation should support that view and, accordingly, I strenuously object to the provision carried over into this Bill from the Electricity Supply Board (Amendment) Bill, 1958, which provides that if you become a candidate for election to this House, you are no longer eligible for membership of the body we now contemplate setting up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (1) and substitute: &ldquo;(1) The Institute shall formulate specifications for commodities, processes and practices from time to time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to suggest that the Institute itself shall be free to formulate specifications for commodities, processes and practices from time to time without moving the Minister to do it.  In fact, it seeks to confer statutory power on the Institute to do what the Bill suggests the Institute <Col N="1239" /> should ask the Minister to do under powers he has under some other Act.  I should be glad to know the Minister's reaction, whether he attaches importance to the principle in the Bill that everything should be done under the Minister or whether he is inclined favourably to the view that the Institute should have power to do certain things, such as those mentioned in this amendment, on their own initiative and by their own act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of the Section in its present form is that the Minister, having regard to his official knowledge of the needs of the community and of the production and supply position for any particular commodity, would be in a better position to be the person to require specification to be made in respect of any particular commodity.  The Institute will be largely concerned with operations which are technical rather than administrative.  While they will be able to tell the Minister whether certain commodities are merchantable, of good quality or have a good performance under all conditions, they would not be in the same position as the Minister is to determine what commodities are more likely to require standards specified, having regard to the considerations to which I referred &mdash; production, supply, market, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice is, however, that while the Minister may request the Institute to provide or formulate specifications for a commodity, the Institute, on the other hand, may suggest to the Minister that a certain commodity is one in respect of which a specification ought to be formulated and the Minister invariably accepts that recommendation. But the overall intention is that the Minister should be in the long run the person who would specify the commodity in respect of which a specification ought to be formulated.  I do not think that, in practice, the wording of the Section as it stands will make any real difference.  The Deputy might well envisage a situation in which the Institute for some reason best known to themselves &mdash; perhaps because one member of the Institute is <Col N="1240" /> obsessed with a particular commodity &mdash; might waste some of its time examining that commodity and formulating a specification in respect of it.</P>
    <P>That would, in the long run, be unimportant to the general economic well-being and to industry in particular. I suggest that there is nothing ominous in the wording of the section and that the procedure indicated here is one established in practice and one that has worked reasonably well in practice in the past.  There is nothing in the section which precludes the Institute from suggesting to the Minister that a certain commodity or commodities should be examined and specifications formulated in respect of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I explain why I do not wish to accept the amendment? The power which this subsection gives would be used mainly by the Minister to indicate to the Institute the order of priority in which it would seem to the Minister that specifications might be formulated.  The same reasons apply &mdash; that the Minister should be presumed to be the person who would be in possession of the knowledge of what would be in the best interests of the community, the knowledge of industry as a general rule, of marketing, of supply and of the requirements of the public, and in the end whether a specification should be formulated.  The intention in this subsection is that the Minister would be able to say: &ldquo;I ask the Institute to examine commodities A, B, C and D, in that order, with a view to formulating specifications.&rdquo; Again, I think, it is a matter of procedure which has worked satisfactorily in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is power of prosecution of firms whose goods do not conform to standard mark requirements and therefore firms whose efficiency perhaps may not be to their own satisfaction do not apply for a standard mark to be applied to their goods in fear of being prosecuted for not complying with the requirements. I think that is the simple answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not, and perhaps the consequences are not complimentary either.  I am removing the danger of prosecution for not complying with the requirements of the standard mark.  The only sanction there will be is that the licence to use the mark will be withdrawn in the event of the commodity not coming up to standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a general point and I do not know whether is comes under the section or not but it really gives me occasion to pause.  All this elaborate legislation is in part, in any case, designed to provide a system of standard marks and naturally the consumers seeing a standard mark on an Irish product will assume it conforms to certain specifications.  The reason our people assume such a thing is that if it did not, the person who used the mark improperly would be liable to prosecution.  Now all that happens is that he is told not to use it again. The sanction has now become so slight that one begins to ask oneself has the <Col N="1242" /> standard mark any significance at all? Has that aspect of it presented itself to the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous experience indicated that firms do not apply to use the standard mark and we can only assume that it is because they fear possible prosecution as a consequence of not conforming strictly to the conditions involved in using the mark.  In Britain, and perhaps in other countries, there is a very big sales value in being able to put a standard mark on a commodity or to advertise that it complies with certain standards set up by the Ideal Homes Institute or some such body.  It is a good sales qualification but the new system, first of all, of giving a licence to use the standard mark will I think be a mark of quality in goods concerned and the withdrawal of the licence will certainly be obvious to everybody and will convey that the goods having once enjoyed the licence to use the standard mark no longer have it.  I think the sanction will be real enough.  At any rate we are trying to see if it will produce greater use of standard marks since fear of prosecution seemed to be the main factor in not having the standard marks used more widely heretofore.</P>

The purpose of that is to ensure that that level of remuneration will not be out of line with that in the Civil Service or in industry generally.  That is the main purpose.  There may be one, or perhaps two, other officers who might be so designated but it will be limited to posts such as the Director holds now.</P>

This matter was raised by Deputy Norton last week on the Second Reading and the Minister did not refer to it in his reply.  I know that that was not deliberate.  Would the Minister give us a better idea as to what posts he has in mind?  Are they posts of special responsibility and do they call for special responsibilities or special scientific or technical knowledge?  Will the Minister designate these posts first of all as being posts of special responsibility and/or qualification prior to his actually making the appointment after consultation with the Minister for Finance?  I do not know whether at this stage the Minister can say what type of post he has in mind.  He just referred to one and I assume there are others in which he may take a <Col N="1244" /> special interest and want to take power to make particular appointments himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this legislation is to give the Board of the Institute a much greater degree of autonomy than they have at present. For example, under existing legislation the Minister had to be consulted in the case of all appointments, clerical or otherwise.  No appointment could be made without the consent of the Minister, but all appointments to the staff other than these designated posts of special responsibility will, under this Bill, be made by the Institute itself without recourse to the Minister.  I mentioned the Director's post as one that I would anticipate would be of special responsibility.  It will be a matter for the new Board of the Institute to build their own staff structure and to put it up to me and at that stage we would be able to decide.  Certain posts are of special importance and in order to expand on what I have just said I would envisage a chief scientific officer or his equivalent, or a chief administrative officer or whatever equivalent term was put on it, as posts of special responsibility.  It will be apparent to the Deputy that in cases like that it is obviously desirable that the Minister in a Board which is responsible to him, whose expenditure is from a Vote for which he is responsible to the House, should have some say in the level of remuneration offered and fixed for these posts.</P>

It might not be possible to publish immediately the amount which had been made available, because the patent rights might not have been protected.

      <P>As I say, I can see difficulties in giving the information immediately, but, at the first possible opportunity, once the patent rights are protected, the fullest information should be given, because where there is any grant procedure to help such individuals, there is nothing that prevents unhealthy gossip as much as publishing the details in the fullest possible form.</P>

      <P>To revert for a moment to what the Minister said earlier, I am not quite clear about the sanction by way of prosecution for the use of a standard mark when the goods were not up to standard.  That has been removed and prosecutions are no longer possible under this Bill. The sanction which existed was that the right to use the standard mark would be withdrawn.  Now we go on to say that not merely is the right to use the mark withdrawn, but the goods cannot be manufactured.  It does not seem to me that the right to have the standard mark withdrawn is of any consequence, if, under another section, there is a prohibition against the manufacture of the goods. There seems to be a necessity for clarification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a matter now.  It is a matter I have raised on several occasions before.  Under Section 44 the Minister may &ldquo;declare ... that it shall be unlawful to manufacture, assemble or sell that commodity unless it complies with the standard specification&rdquo;. Does this extend to the point of prescribing the size of containers?  The point is that, 50 years ago, quite a number of commodities were sold in sacks.  The sack was then 2½ cwts. and, believe it or not, I have seen men lift those sacks.  Indeed, in those days it was considered a great achievement to be able to carry one up a flight of stairs.  I suppose the world is changing, but there has survived from that time a practice, now practically confined to the fertiliser industry, of packing fertilisers in 2 cwt. bags.  I think that is almost the only commodity that continues to be packed in that form.  The plain truth is that to handle 2 cwts. of certain types of fertilisers, such as slag, is a very difficult operation for persons belonging to the present generation; they do not seem to have the physique of those who went before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no particular reason why the public should have imposed upon them the very material inconvenience of having to grapple with containers of <Col N="1252" /> this kind.  If the Minister can envisage a farmer in the field trying to put a 2 cwt. bag of fertiliser into a manure distributor he will realise what an extremely inconvenient and difficult thing that is to do.  I should be glad to know if there is power here to require that no commodity shall be packed in a container weighing more than 1 cwt.  I can well imagine some of my conservative friends speaking a word in defence of the half sack of flour, which is 10 stone in weight. Personally, I would be in favour of restricting the weight of the container to 8 stones.  That has been done pretty extensively, I think, in the United States.  I do not know how far it has been done in Great Britain. I am perfectly certain it would be an eminently desirable reform.  It is coming in because with the more general user of multiwall paper bags, which are easily disposable, the very structure of the container itself practically imposes a limitation of 8 stones on the packer.  But the jute bag can still be used for much larger weights.  As I say, the change is coming fairly rapidly.  I should be glad to know whether the Minister considers it is practical to expedite this change and, if so, do the powers under Section 44 enable him to take the requisite steps to ensure that there will be uniformity in this matter and that containers in excess of 8 stones are no longer allowed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The section does not empower the Minister to make any orders on the lines suggested by the Deputy.  The step suggested by the Deputy would require very detailed examination.  To require commodities to be packed in containers of not more than 8 stones capacity could have repercussions in a very far flung field. A great many industries have handling equipment for containers of much larger capacity and much higher weight. Perhaps they find that more economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed a case in point in the course of visiting a fertiliser factory. There was an automatic filler into bags of a certain size.  I asked the operative why smaller bags were not used. He said it was because the machine filled bags of a particular size; to <Col N="1253" /> replace the machine would be very costly.  Not only would the filler have to be replaced but the stitching machine further along the line would have to be replaced also.  As I say, making it compulsory to pack commodities in containers not in excess of a certain size would have very wide repercussions.  It is a matter which would require detailed examination.  It is not envisaged the Minister would have any power in respect to that under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the matter would require careful study.  One would have to specify the special commodities in respect of which a maximum would be fixed.  There are commodities packed in barrels and other kinds of container in which the maximum weight of 8 stones would be unsuitable, because long practice has established the custom of using mechanical methods of handling and that, in turn, removes the problem of physical effort associated with lifting.  I think, however, that the Minister ought to turn his mind to this question, at least, of commodities which are normally manhandled with a view to determining whether we should not prescribe a maximum weight, recognising at the same time that there are other commodities to which such restrictions could not properly apply.  I readily concede that there are commodities where restrictions would not suit, but it is equally true to say there are commodities in relation to which the standardisation I suggest is overdue, is now on its way, and could, with great advantage, be expedited.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that Irish citizens who are in receipt of retirement pensions and who take up residence here are not paid their full retirement pension by the British Government; and, if so, if he will augment such pensions to ensure that these pensioners suffer no loss by transfer of residence, or, alternatively, if he will make representations to the British Government to pay the full pension on transfer of residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a British retirement pension payable to a person who leaves Great Britain continues to be paid at the rate which obtained at the date of his departure from Great Britain and that any subsequent increase in the rate of such pension is not paid unless the person returns to Great Britain.  This provision is not confined to persons coming to reside here.  Representations on this matter have been made in the past without success.</P>
      <P>The suggestion in the question is that residents here who are receiving British pensions at a rate lower than the rate currently payable in Great Britain, should have their pensions increased to that rate at the expense of the Irish taxpayer.  The current British rate of retirement pension (at age 65) is 57/6 a week to which may be added 35/- a week for a dependent wife.  The corresponding Irish rates (at age 70) are 40/- and 30/- (as from 1st August next) respectively.  No reason is seen why persons who must have spent a large portion of their working lives elsewhere and who, as a result of contributions made there, have qualified for pensions, should after retirement to this country have those pensions increased at the expense of the Irish taxpayer to rates in excess of those paid to persons who qualify for the contributory pension in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in reply to a question by Deputy Gogan on the 11th April, 1961, I propose in due course to explore the possibility of making reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain in <Col N="1262" /> regard to old age (contributory) pensions, and the granting of increases in British pensions to persons resident in this country will naturally be included in the discussions.</P>

      <P>While these pensioners paid contributions towards their pensions in Great Britain, it was through no fault of their own in the majority of cases that they had to emigrate or to migrate to Britain, and in view of the fact that they are being penalised by the British Government because they return to their native country and spend their pensions here, would he not consider entering into a reciprocal agreement, as Deputy Norton did when he was Minister?</P>

The operative part of this resolution reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The General Assembly</P>
      <P>1.  <i>Calls upon</i> the Government of Portugal to consider urgently the introduction of measures and reforms in Angola for the purpose of the implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), with due respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations;</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the nationality of the ships which are responsible for oil pollution of our coasts but samples taken by officers of my Department from polluted beaches suggest that the oil comes from a considerable distance.  Inspections have been made of records of the disposal of oil waste by ships arriving here but no contraventions of our Regulations or of the International Convention have been detected.

      <P>There is no international policing system by which the <Col N="1268" /> detection of the origin of oil pollution can be obtained.  The states which have signed the Convention order their ships to report on the disposal of oil, caused by the cleaning of tanks, to the member countries concerned, but out of some 46 countries who have oil tankers, only 13 subscribed to the Convention and they do not include a great number of countries with very large tanker freight; that is to say, in all those countries, there are ships which cause pollution but it indicates the absence of international agreement, that a small country like ours is at the mercy of a great number of countries' ships.  Oil can destroy from 100 to 150 miles from the coast and we can do little about it.</P>

There are, of course, several other boats in the fishing fleet which are not on hire purchase.  The only boats repossessed by the Board in that area during the past four years were three based on Skerries.  It would not be proper to disclose details of private transactions between the Board and hire purchasers.

      <P>Sa Mheastachán seo rinne an tAire tagairt don mhéid go bhfuil deire curtha anois leis na Coláistí Ullmhúcháin.  Tá mé go mór i bhfathach leis seo.  Mhol mé ar an Mheastachán seo cheana féin go mba cheart deire a chur leo cionnas go raibh mé den bharúil nach rabh sé ceart go mbeadh ábhar múinteoirí scartha amach ón ghnáth-shaol ar fad sé nó seacht de na blianta is tábhachtaí i saol an duine agus go mór mór nuair a bheifí ag brath ar na múinteoirí óga seo a bheith ina dtreoraithe ar fud na tíre ina dhiaidh sin.  Mura bhfaghann an duine óg seans caidreamh a bheith aige le daoine i ngairmeach beatha eile ó aois a cheithre bliana déag go dtí go mbíonn sé fiche bliain d'aois ní thig leis a pháirt chóir a ghlacadh sa saol mór ina dhiaidh sin.  Tá muid ag iarraidh athrú a fháil ar an gcóras oiliúna le blianta anois.  Is é atá uainn ná go mbeadh caoi ag an ábhar múinteora oideachas ollscoile a bheith aige i dtreo is go mbeadh sé ábalta oideachas níos leithne a bheith aige ná mar atá aige faoi láthair.  Sílim nuair a druideadh na coláistí ullmhúcháin gurbh shin an chéad bhearna sa bhalla.  Dúirt an tAire tamall ó shoin go rabh sé beartaithe aige feabhas mór <Col N="1286" /> a chur ar na Coláistí Oiliúna.  Tá sin a dhíth, ach tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ag smaoitiú i gcónaí ar dhóigheanna le feabhas a chur ar an gcóras oiliúna chomh maith.  Mhol mé go minic go mba cheart cead a bheith ag ábhar múinteora freastal ar an ollscoil agus céim a bhaint amach.  Chuideodh sé sin le deire a chur leis an deighilt mínádúrtha atá idir múinteoirí na tíre seo idir mhúinteoirí bunscoile, méanscoile agus gairmscoile.</P>
      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil sé socraithe ag an Aire deontas a thabhairt i leith scoileanna a phéinteáil.  Cuidiú mór do bhainisteoirí is é sin.  Mar deir an tAire tá droch-dhóigh ar chuid de na scoileanna úra ach ní shílim go bhfuil an ceart ar fad aige nuair a chuireann sé an milleán ar bhainisteoirí.  Tá mé go láidir den bharúil go bhfuil cuid mhaith den locht ar an ghnás atá ag Bord na nOibreacha Poiblí nuair a ghlacann siad leis an meastachán is ísle i gcónaí.  B'fhéidir, de réir dlí, go gcaithfidh siad sin a dhéanamh, ach má tá an dlí mar sin ba cheart é a athrú.  Nuair a scrúdaítear na meastacháin seo ba cheart go mbeadh innealtóirí agus ailtirí na Roinne ábalta a rá go bhfuil meastachán ar leith róíseal; nach dtiocfaí dea-obair a dhéanamh ar an airgead atá luaite anois agus mar sin nach ceart glacadh leis. Am ar bith a tharla a leithéid ní fada go dtáinig droch-dhóigh ar an scoil. Caithfidh sé a admháil, áfach, go bhfuil an chuid is mó de na scoileanna úra ar fheabhas agus tá moladh tuillte ag an Roinn as sin, agus tá moladh tuillte aige fosta as an méid scoileanna úra atá tógtha le bliain anuas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ceann de na gearáin is mó a bhí ag daoine a rabh suim acu sa chóras oideachais sa tír seo ná go rabh barraíocht páistí sna ranganna agus nach dtiocfadh le múinteoir obair fhónta a dhéanamh i rang a bhí ró-mhór.  Tá feabhas ag teacht ar an scéal sin i ndiaidh a chéile agus tá áthas orm go bhfuil an tAire i ndiaidh céim eile a ghlacadh i mbliana.  Dúirt sé fosta go mbeadh post speisialta ag múinteoir i gcás achan ceathrar múinteoir a bheadh ag obair i scoil.  Tá sin inmholta. Tá cothrom na féinne tugtha aige, fosta, do mhúinteoirí nach rabh ach <Col N="1287" /> dhá dtrian dá seirbhis acu mar sheirbhís phinsin.</P>
    <P>Ag tagairt do oideachas a thabhairt do pháistí a bhfuil mácháil choirp nó mácháil intinne orthu is é an chonstaic is mó a bhí ann ná nach rabh múinteoirí go leor againn leis ná páistí seo a theagasc.  Glacann sé oiliúint ar leith a bheith ag duine leis an obair seo a dhéanamh.  Tá áthas orm a fheiceál anois go bhfuil sé socraithe ag an Aire seans a thabhairt do mhúinteoirí cúrsa a dhéanamh le go mbeidh siad oilte páistí mar iad seo a theagasc.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do scoil atá bunaithe i nDún Dealgan anois le páistí a bhfuil mácháil intinne orthu a theagasc.  Tháinig scaifte daoine le chéile i nDún Dealgan agus shocraigh siad go mba chóir rud éigin a dhéanamh do pháistí mar seo nach rabh seans acu áit a fháil sna scoileanna agus sna hospidéil éagsúla atá againn do pháistí mar iad. D'oibrigh siad go cruaidh agus anois tá scoil foscailte acu.  Tá moladh mór tuillte acu.</P>
    <P>Tá deire curtha ag an Aire leis an teastas dá-theangach.  Shíl mé i gcónaí nach rabh mórán céille leis an teastas céanna.  Is minic a theip ar ábhar múinteora as an Ghaeltacht teastas a ghnóthú ag fágáil na coláiste oiliúna dó cionas nár éirigh leis i gceann de na páipéirí scríofa.  Bé an cás ina rabh sé ansin ná go dtiocfadh leis na hábhair scoile a theagasc tríd an mbéarla ach nach rabh sé éifeachtach leis na hábhair chéanna a theagasc tríd an Ghaeilge gidh gurb í an Ghaeilge a theanga dhúchais.  Ba mhaith liom níos mó eolais a bheith agam faoin gcóras úr atá beartaithe ag an Aire. Sílim gur maith an rud é go bhfuil an tAire sásta deontas a thabhairt do mhúinteoir óg atá sásta gabháil go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Sna Sé Chontaí tá riail ann go gcaithfidh múinteoir Gaeilge trí mhí a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht. Ach ba mhaith liom dá dtabharfadh an tAire freagraí dom ar na ceisteanna seo: Caidé mar a rachaidh an scrúdú béil seo i gcionn ar phá an mhúinteora? Faoin sean-chóras ní thiocfadh le múinteoir ardú pá a fháil mura rabh an <Col N="1288" /> teastas dá-theangach aige.  An mbeidh an cás céanna anseo?  Níor cheart dó a bheith mar sin.</P>
    <P>An gcaithfidh an múinteoir fanacht cúig bliana leis an scrúdú béil a dhéanamh?  Caidé a tharlóidh mura n-Éiríonn leis sa scrúdú nuair a bheas na cúig bliana thart?</P>
    <P>Má théann an múinteoir go dtí an Ghaeltacht an mbeidh air freastal ar ranganna?  Nuair a chuitear na scaiftí móra atá ag triall ar an Ghaeltacht faoi láthair san áireamh beidh sé doiligh go leor ranganna a chur ar fáil dó.</P>
    <P>Nuair atá mé ag tagairt do na coláistí Gaeilge ba maith liom arís a iarraidh ar an Aire deire a chur leis na haistí Gaeilge sna coláistí sin. Ar a laghad ba cheart an cheist a scrúdú go mion agus barúla daoine a bhfuil taithí acu ar choláistí Gaeilge a fháil.</P>
    <P>Le tamall anuas ba ghnáthach le daoine a rá nach rabh ach oideachas bunscoile á fháil ag 80% de pháistí na tíre seo.  Níl sé seo fíor anois. Ón taithí atá agamsa tig liom a rá gur beag páiste nach bhfaghann bliain amháin ar a laghad i meánscoil nó i gceardscoil i ndiaidh dó an bhunscoil a fhágáil.  Is cuimhin liomsa nuair nach n-imeodh ach corr-dhuine go dtí scoil eile i ndiaidh dó an bhunscol a fhágáil, ach anois tá a mhalairt fíor.</P>
    <P>Bhí áthas orm nuair a chuala mé ón Aire go bhfuil an Roinn ag iarraidh níos mó ranganna eolaíochta a chur ar fáil.  Ábhar iontach tábhachtach atá san eolaíocht faoi láthair.  Tá céimithe eolaíochta iontacha againn agus tá siad a dhíth go mór orainn le cuidiú leis an fhorbairt tionscailíochta.</P>
    <P>Mholfainn don Aire iarracht a dhénamh ar eolas a thabhairt do pháistí scoile faoi na gairmeacha beatha agus na bpostanna atá ar fáil agus moladh a thabhairt dófa faoi na cinn is foirstiní agus is fearr a bhfuil seans acu a fháil ag fágáil na scoile dófa.</P>
    <P>Ní fada go mbeidh teilifís dár gcuid féin againn.  Mholfainn go mór go mbainfí an fheidhm is mó a thig a bhaint as an teilifís sa chóras oideachais. Ní dócha go mbeidh teilifís in achan scoile go ceann tamaill fhada, ach ba cheart go mbeadh cláracha <Col N="1289" /> foirstineacha ar an teilifís do pháistí sa tráthnóna.  Ní gá dom a ghabháil isteach sna mion-phointí anseo mar tá a fhios agam go dtuigeann an tAire chom tábhachtach agus atá an teilifís anois agus an dóigh a dtig leis smaointí ár bpáistí a mhúnladh.</P>

      <P>I know that there are a number of teachers on both sides who will go very fully into the working of the Department of Education.  I should like to say, however, that I think there should be a common bond between all the teachers.  I know the Commission set up recommended that there should be three distinct scales&mdash; a secondary, vocational and primary. I would urge the Minister not to accept those recommendations.  I feel that if he does so, he is dealing a very severe blow to the hardest-working members of the profession, the primary teachers. If the Minister accepts those recommendations, he is turning the primary teachers into the cinderellas of the profession; and in time he will find it virtually impossible to get primary teachers throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Over the last weekend, I spoke to a number of teachers about this matter and also to a number of parents.  There is widespread uneasiness about it.  They feel that if the primary teacher is to be belittled in this way, the children he is teaching will also suffer.  They feel the position will arise that the more backward the area and the poorer the child, the less attention he will get from the Department.  After all, the foundation of education in this country is laid in the national schools.  If it is not well laid down in these schools, secondary and vocational education will be of very little use.  I know it can be argued that secondary teachers must spend three years at a university before they can take up a position; but so it can also be argued that a boy or girl who wishes to obtain a position in a training college for primary teachers must have a very high standard in the Leaving Certificate.  After two years spent in training, he or she must teach for longer hours all subjects to a number of classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want it to be felt that, in making this plea for the primary <Col N="1290" /> teachers, I am casting any aspersions on the secondary or vocational teachers. That is not so.  But I do feel the primary teachers have much more difficulty in their work than either the secondary or vocational teachers. The Minister must know it requires much more skill, ability and patience to teach 20 infants than it requires to teach 50 semi-adults, whom you have in secondary schools, and indeed, in vocational schools.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to raise on this Estimate, that is, the problem of the retarded child.  This is a very serious question.  It is a question that has received a considerable amount of sympathy from organisations in general, but very little has been done about it.  The retarded child I speak of is the child who is backward or slow, rather than the completely retarded child.  The plight of these children can be raised on the Health Estimate.  These children obviously have no place in the national school, because the teacher cannot afford the time or the special training to keep them in line with the other children.  Therefore, they are left out of the race.  What we need are more schools to cater for these children, where they will get special treatment such as speech therapy and other therapeutic training which will enable them to face life and be able to earn their living on their own in later years.</P>
    <P>We have one such school in my own constituency, in Kilcolgan, run by a religious Order.  It is doing excellent work.  The trouble is we have not enough such schools.  Since I came into this House, I have been asked by parents if there is any hope of getting children into these schools, but in any place I have inquired they always say there is a long waiting list.  That seems to be the position all over the country.  We had hopes in Galway of establishing another school at the old sanatorium, Woodlands, with the help of a religious Order.  I understand that the Bishop, for excellent reasons of his own, I am sure, has vetoed this.  The Minister cannot question the decision of the Bishop, but I would urge the Minister to appeal to all Bishops throughout <Col N="1291" /> the country to give a little more attention to these children.  We are supposed to be a predominantly Catholic country and we do very little for these unfortunate children.  We are considerably behind other countries in this matter, particularly Scotland. I think they are far ahead of us.  There are many other aspects I should like to raise on this Estimate, but I feel I am not in a position to do so.</P>

      <P>Is maith an rud é go bhfuil beagnach níos mó ná £19 milliún á chaitheamh ag an Aire sa Mheastachán seo.  Níor cuireadh mórán spéis i gcúrsaí oideachais sa tír seo le fada ach, buíochas le Dia, le blianta anuas tá athrú ar an scéal.  Dá bhrí sin is comhartha maith é go bhfuil Meastachán chomh mór sin le caitheamh ag an Aire Oideachais i mbliana.</P>
      <P>San óráid a thug an tAire deir sé go bhfuil sé ar intinn aige deire a chur leis an teastas dá-theangach agus go bhfuil sé beartaithe aige scrúdú béil eile a chur ina áit.  Ní rabh mórán seans agamsa fós an t-athrú sin a scrúdú go géar.  Ach ón méid cainte a bhí agam le daoine faoin athrú sin, ceapann siad gur maith an rud é.  Té sé ar intinn ag an Aire scolaireachtaí a thabhairt do na múinteoiri óga le dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht chun an scrúdú béil seo a bhaint amach.  Ceapann na daoine go rabh me ag caint leo nach amháin go ndéanfadh sé sin leas do na múinteoirí féin ach go ndéanfadh sé leas do na paistí faoine gcúram freisin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Estimate of over £19 million, I am glad that the Minister gave it as his opinion that before we can be in a position to say we have an educational system that approaches the ideal, we shall have to increase still further our educational facilities.  This is one of the biggest Estimates we have had for this Department.  As the previous speaker said, education has long been the cinderella, and it is good to hear the Minister in charge propose the expenditure of over £19 million on this occasion, and that before we can reach the ideal it will be necessary to increase it still further.  In <Col N="1292" /> that regard we are only keeping in line with other nations, even the nations beyond the Iron Curtain, which consider education to be of vast importance.</P>
    <P>I agree with other Deputies who have said that we should not have the different branches of education&mdash; as it is in the Minister's speech&mdash;in watertight compartments, primary, secondary, vocational and so forth.  I agree with other speakers who advocated that there should be a common basic scale for the teachers in all branches.  I have listened to some of the speeches in this debate and the speakers seemed to be mixing up education in its truest sense with the mere imparting of knowledge.  Education in its truest sense does not mean the imparting of knowledge.  Later in my speech I shall quote from some statements which have been made by prominent ecclesiastics which bring out that point.  Education in its truest sense is the development of the mind, the intellect, the soul and body of the child so that the child can use them to his best advantage to lead him to the goal for which he was created.</P>
    <P>The formation of character and the moral and religious training come in as well, the development of the attributes of soul and intellect that will lead that child to its ultimate goal, not just the imparting of knowledge to help him pass examinations or perhaps secure some suitable position. One child may use his hands instead of his intellect and therefore we have the vocational system of education to suit the child who would be better adapted to that form than to using his brain or intellect.  For that reason when the child comes to four, five or six years of age the first school he has to go to is the national school.  Now, in vocational and secondary schools there is a certain amount of selectivity and all children do not go there.  As I say the child who is going to use his hands may decide, or his parents may decide for him, that he should go to the vocational school.  Again, all children do not go to the secondary school.  If the child is not bright the parents may feel that he is not going <Col N="1293" /> to benefit and they are not going to send him forward for that particular type of education.  By law, however, children are compelled to go to the primary and national schools.  In that type of school there is no selectivity and the teacher has to deal with the bright child, the average child, the dull child and perhaps even the mentally deficient child, if there is no school in the locality to which mentally deficient children can be sent.</P>
    <P>All types come along and the teacher then has to try and strike an average to suit his particular lesson so that it will benefit the majority, at least, of the pupils under his care.  Therefore I consider, naturally enough, that the primary branch is really the most important of all these compartments into which our educational system is divided and if I were giving priority naturally I would be inclined to give priority to that particular branch because of the nature and importance of the work they have to do.  Nevertheless I am in agreement that at least there should be parity between the branches. I cannot agree with the Commission that was set up and I cannot understand how they found that there should be a difference between these three branches.  I hope, with other speakers, that the Government and the Minister will not act on the suggestions made by the Commission.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote one or two extracts from the Minority Report of that commission showing the importance of the primary branch and that at the same time the majority did not seem to attach that importance to it. Most Reverend Dr. McQuaid, Archbishop of Dublin, is quoted in this report when speaking to the students of St. Patrick's Training College for National Teachers on May 31st, 1959, as saying:</P>
    <P>You must wonder how a bishop regards his diocese.  In very many ways.  He sees it spread before him like a map in large contours and small details.  He sees it dotted with churches, in each of which is the Real Presence of God made man, who once was found only in the little land of Palestine.  He sees it, also, covered with schools, in each <Col N="1294" /> of which another sacred presence dwells, that of the Catholic teacher. To the men and women teachers, salt of our earth, whose influence has conserved the Faith and formed our nation, I pay tribute of grateful reverence.</P>
    <P>I could not wish for you who will succeed them, a greater grace than that, by the help of God and the protection of His Blessed Mother, you should imitate their integrity of life and their devotedness of the divine Vocation of Catholic teacher.</P>
    <P>Then the chairman of Muintir na Tíre, the Reverend M. Morrissey, speaking at the I.N.T.O. Congress in Kilkee, in 1960, at which I was present, is quoted as follows:</P>
    <P>I am fully conscious of the tremendous potential of the National Teachers to mould the characters of our children in the true Christian Irish way.  As our late founder, Canon Hayes, put it&mdash;teaching is not a job, it is a work of love for God, and the children of Ireland. &ldquo;We couldn't pay our teachers too much,&rdquo; said Canon Hayes, &ldquo;as long as they are good men and women.&rdquo; They have the most responsible job in the world.  They are God's own men and women, who kept religion, decency and sacrifice in the country. Here in Ireland, the National Teachers not only educate the children, but they play a very important rôle in the life of the parish community.  They were looked up to, they were trusted, and they never failed.  It is, therefore, with good reason that our organising committee states in its latest report, while the National School Teachers have done trojan work for our movement, the other professions do not seem to have grasped their potential as leaders in their local community.</P>
    <P>There are several other quotations from that report I might give but it all goes to show how highly the teachers in charge of our national schools are regarded by the people I have quoted, and I cannot understand how a Commission could come to the conclusion that they were the cinderella of the teaching profession.  The Commission's <Col N="1295" /> findings constitute a slur on the primary branch.  It will be very hard to encourage young men and women to enter that branch of education when that slur is being cast upon it.  It is also a slur on the children under their care.  I trust the Minister will not act on the findings of the Commission.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the building programme to which he referred.  I was glad to ascertain, in reply to a Parliamentary Question last week, the number of new schools that have been built in the past five years in County Galway and the additions that have been made to other schools and the number of new appointments that have been made.  This is very encouraging. I have read speeches in the local papers in the last month or so from Opposition members in my own county who are going around like banshees bewailing that the schools are being denuded of children, bewailing emigration and the closing down of schools.  That is why I put down my question and I was glad to find that instead of schools closing down&mdash;I knew before the Minister answered at all that the opposite was the case because additions were put on to the school in which I teach and on to three or four neighbouring schools&mdash;still more teachers are to be appointed as the accommodation becomes available.  In other words, further additions are being made to schools, due to the averages increasing.  I ask the Minister to expedite the building of these further additions.  These appointments will ease the work of existing teachers which is becoming very difficult because of increasing numbers on the rolls.</P>
    <P>As regards school buildings in the country generally in recent years the Minister is to be complimented.  He has made another contribution, as he indicated in his speech, which will be of great benefit to managers, the two-thirds grant for the painting of schools. We already have grants for heating and cleaning which are rather inadequate in some cases and must be supplemented locally.  This further concession is very welcome and will <Col N="1296" /> be welcomed by teachers, parents and the children.  One of the biggest costs of national school maintenance is painting which has to be done regularly unless the school is to be allowed to go into disrepair.  This grant will encourage the maintenance of the schools and help to keep them in proper repair.</P>
    <P>Last year, or the year before, I urged that there should be some sort of first-aid outfit in each national school, especially in schools in places far removed from a doctor or a nurse. Teachers in training get a two-year course in physiology and physical training and, although perhaps not fully qualified in First Aid, many of them have been in the Red Cross.  Courses are run by the Junior Red Cross and, if a teacher attends during the holiday period, he can get personal leave as a result.  Between the Red Cross and the Department somebody should ensure that a proper first-aid kit is kept in each school to treat minor injuries.  It might mean the saving of a pupil's life to have such a kit available if a child meets with an accident in the playground.  I have been asked to urge this matter again on the Minister.  Where new schools are being erected, provision could be made to have the first-aid press incorporated in the building.</P>
    <P>I also urged it some time ago, but I do not think any grant has been made yet towards the provision of materials for kindergarten and needlework.  These materials are provided by the teachers at their own expense and I do not know that the income tax authorities allow them anything for it.  A grant in respect of these materials is overdue as these materials are handed out by the teachers to the children to enable them to carry out the exercises.</P>
    <P>I again congratulate the Minister on all that he has done for the teaching profession since he came into office and particularly for what he has done for the pensioned teachers.  He has earned the undying gratitude of the pensioned teachers for the manner in which he treated them when he gave them the other two-thirds of the gratuity to which they felt they were entitled. They had already got one-third and two-thirds remained.  They felt&mdash; and I think the Minister gave them to understand&mdash;that when the country's <Col N="1297" /> financial position improved, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, they would be paid that gratuity.  He has done so, and has also honoured the findings of the conciliation and arbitration committee with regard to salaries of national teachers, and he has improved their position in many ways since he became Minister.</P>
    <P>He has also, of course, increased the principal's allowances, with particular reference to the smaller schools. I have had experience of teaching in various types of schools, and from my experience, I have great sympathy with the teachers in charge of infant divisions. The teacher in charge of those very junior classes has not the same field of promotion.  The field of promotion open to them to become principals and to earn the capitation grants which the Minister has increased, is not very wide.  If long-term increments, or service increments for satisfactory service, were given to assist teachers in charge of infant classes, second and third classes, and preparatory classes, it would compensate those people for the onerous work they have to do.  In view of the fact that the opportunity for promotion is limited, it would encourage them and make them happy in the work to which they are accustomed.</P>

    <P>I have never been able to understand the relationship between the school managers and the Department of Education.  In fact, I have been told on occasion that even the Minister cannot interfere with school managers.  While I have no comment to make on the educational system as I am satisfied that has been dealt with very well by other speakers, there is one point I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister who possibly <Col N="1298" /> might convey it to the school managers.</P>
    <P>Teaching has been described as a profession and I accept that.  I also feel that it would be a good thing if we could inculcate into the children the ideal of God and country.  In that connection, my only suggestion is that, if it lies within the jurisdiction of the school manager, apart from whatever knowledge may be imparted to the children by teachers, whether religious or otherwise, the first lesson in the case of these children should be God and country, and a development of respect and honour for the flag of this country for which so much has been given and so many sacrifices made.</P>
    <P>The managers should get a direction from the Minister that the flag shall be prominently displayed in every school.  Representations were previously made to the county managers that the 1916 Proclamation should be so displayed in the schools, but those representations failed.  I have travelled extensively and it has been a pleasure indeed to me to see the national flag displayed in schools abroad, and even in countries where religion is not given as prominent a place in daily life as it occupies here.  Physiotherapy and all the other training necessary for the child's future life have been mentioned here but it would be far better, without being in any way irreverent, to inculcate a respect for and an appreciation of the flag, as well as the lesson of God and country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider that suggestion.  This Government and previous Governments have failed, for whatever reason, to establish the 24th April as a day of honour.  Perhaps the Minister could now add to his laurels and merit even more all the good things that have been said about him&mdash;I mention this lest any monetary consideration be thought of&mdash;by making the 24th April a school holiday, so that, even in their young way, the children will recognise and appreciate it for what it is.</P>
    <P>As I say, heretofore I have been unable to get any satisfaction with regard to the position of school <Col N="1299" /> managers in relation to the Department. I am sure I will not be charged with being anything but democratic but it seems to me that as we have a Minister for Education, a Department of Education and this Estimate, which relates to all the financial matters, the display of the flag in these schools might well be arranged.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to a special grant for the painting of schools.  I appreciate that suggestion because I have seen, to my horror, some of the amenities provided even in Dublin city schools.  I shall be perfectly satisfied and feel that my contribution, small as it is, has been valuable if some consideration is given to these questions.  I notice it now seems customary to bring children to see this House.  I do not know whether they will go home in any way better educated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall address the House in the language of the foreigner. In the first place, it is the only language I know and, even if I did know another language, I should not persist in speaking it all the time.  I should have some consideration for the rest of my colleagues in this House.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker mentioned the school children visiting here.  I noticed the school children who were here this afternoon flying from the Gallery because of the sounds that were coming from the floor of the House, sounds which were supposed to constitute the Irish language.  Never in my life did I hear the language so battered about as it was battered on the far side of the House for nearly 20 minutes here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some admiration for the present Minister for Education, but I do not intend to throw out compliments to him, right, left and centre.  I intend to take him to task at the outset. <Col N="1300" /> Perhaps that will be a change for him.  In the <i>Irish Times</i> of 29th March of this year there is a report of a speech made by the Minister at a Fianna Fáil Central Discussion Group in Clery's Restaurant.  That is a most dangerous place for any Fianna Fáil Minister to visit; they always seem to put their feet in it there.</P>
    <P>The Minister was reported as saying:</P>
    <P>... the Council of Education's Report on secondary schools would be published soon.  There was still ... a serious defect in our social system in so far as it impinged on education; that defect boy or girl who was poor but clever had often no adequate opportunity of receiving the entire course of education available.</P>
    <P>I intend shortly to make a start at remedying that defect.  I say &ldquo;make a start&rdquo;, for nowadays the walls of Jericho do not always fall down at the first blast.  The help of all of you will be needed, but if once we can establish even the pattern of free education the whole way up for the poor but clever child, it should not be too difficult thereafter to continue that advance.</P>
    <P>That is lovely</P>
    <P>... four years ago there were tens of thousands of national school children who had never laid eyes on a trained teacher and 25 per cent. of national teachers were untrained.</P>
    <P>We may as well put the blame where it lies.  It does not lie with the present Minister or with the former Minister here on my left.  It lies with the Fianna Fáil Party and their successive Ministers for Education right from the day they first took office.  We will go back to the year 1932 when Fianna Fáil first got in.  If, from the time they took office, and if, all through the time they were in office, they had continued to train teachers there would today be enough teachers in the country.  If the Minister's statement that there are not enough trained teachers is correct, one has to remember that the year 1932 passed by, the year 1933 passed by, the year 1934 <Col N="1301" /> passed by, and the year 1935 passed by.  Then, true to the policy of Fianna Fáil&mdash;as far as my constituency is concerned, when anything has to be lopped off, it is lopped off in Waterford&mdash;in the year 1935 they closed the De La Salle training college there.  Had that college been kept open there would undoubtedly have been more trained teachers.  Put the blame then where it lies right on the shoulders of Fianna Fáil and on the policy of Fianna Fáil.  The policy has been an unbroken policy of destroying everything in the constituency I come from and in the city in which I was born.</P>
    <P>On the Vote for the Department of Justice I and other speakers had something to say about juvenile delinquency. We come to the root of the trouble on this Estimate for the Department of Education.  It is very easy to say that this, that and the other should be taught in the schools.  The teachers should teach the pupils this, and that, and the other.  Parents in Ireland have a duty to their children.  In my opinion there should be more propaganda by the Department of Education directed to instilling into parents a proper sense of their duty.  Propaganda should be used to instruct parents that when they send their children to school they are sending them into the care of the teachers and they must be prepared to allow the teachers to discipline the children and to punish them, if punishment is necessary.  I do not subscribe to all this nonsense and all this &ldquo;do-good&rdquo; talk that we hear: &ldquo;There is no such thing as a bad boy.&rdquo;  All boys and all girls can be very naughty and very bad.</P>
    <P>The foundation of a civilised community is discipline.  We would have a better State and a better country if the school children knew that there was no High Court to which they could go and that there was no use going home and bringing mamma up to threaten the teacher or papa, as has happened in some cases, with his coat off to fight the teacher.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Lindsay.  He spoke here about these truculent and impertinent young fellows who will threaten a teacher before the entire class and the teacher is quite helpless.  All discipline has broken <Col N="1302" /> down.  A teacher so threatened or so abused should be able to report to the Minister and the pupil concerned should be expelled from the school.</P>
    <P>We will have to grow up.  We have had our own Government now for 40 years.  We should be mature as a nation. I have had experience.  I have seen letters and I have interviewed teachers whom small children defied in class.  I do not lay the fault for that at the door of the Minister but, as I said at the outset, more propaganda should be used via the Department and through the clergy who are the managers of the schools.  They should be asked to speak from their pulpits and to tell parents that, if they are not prepared to put their children completely in charge of the teachers, it would be better for them not to send the children to school at all.</P>
    <P>The conduct of children today is not good as compared with that of those who went before them.  I know it is customary for people to bewail that the younger generation are going to the dogs.  The fact is that the deterioration today is so marked that no one can afford to be complacent about it.  We all know the amount of wilful damage done all over the country.  It is done because there is no discipline.  There is no discipline in the schools.  I do not blame the teachers for that.  The parents have failed to stand behind the teachers.  It is the duty of parents to support the teachers.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Miss Hogan, said that the foundations of education are laid in the national schools.  They are.  Great people in this country came out of the national schools and never got anything but a national school education.  Is our system of education today as good as it was in the past? Has is improved on what it was 50 years ago or 40 years ago?  I remember about 10 years ago reading a report of a meeting of the I.N.T.O.  A young man at that meeting said that he was getting away from the idea that children should write copperplate writing and have a good knowledge of the three Rs.  I should have liked to have been at that meeting.  I should have liked to ask that gentleman what was wrong with the three Rs?  What <Col N="1303" /> was wrong with the system of education that taught children how to write properly?  What was wrong with the system of education that taught children how to spell?  What was wrong with the system of education that taught children there were such words as &ldquo;please&rdquo; and &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Carroll said we should put more stress on God and country.  We have always been a religious people, thank God.  I agree with his comments about the nation's flag.  This is a matter in which perhaps teachers could foster the cause and further the crusade.  I know a teacher in a country school who erected, with the aid of the parents, a magnificent flagpole and the National Flag is hoist there every morning with ceremony by his pupils and taken down every evening.  I think that is what Deputy O'Carroll has in mind.  That could be done and if it were done by the pupils, the teachers and the people of the area it would be much better than having it done by direction of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Like my namesake of whom the Bard of Thomond wrote, I know my country's history well but I deplore the manner in which history has been taught to children.  I am sure the members of the Government deplore it also.  A great deal of history is being taught in a great number of schools but it is not history that is being taught but hate.  The sooner we get away from that the better.  It is a good thing to know the history of your country.  It is a good thing to know about the leaders in all the centuries.  History should tell the children of today about the ordinary plain people of Ireland, the peasants as they were called, the man in his bare feet, who had to live in a cabin without a window, who had no dinner, who eat no meat, tea or sugar, who had no bed to lie on.  Not enough is known about that phase in our history.  We are always told about leaders and battles but we are not told how people lived, what they did, what their hopes were, what they had to suffer, what their joys were.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to the Minister that some of the officers of the Department <Col N="1304" /> of Education would read a book written by an American and published recently, <i>To the Golden Door</i> by George Potter.  It tells why the Irish people were poor, how they were kept poor, why they had to emigrate, where they emigrated and what happened to them.  It is told with magnificent sentiment. Every boy in this country should know about the matters described in that book, should know that in spite of the grinding poverty and hardship our people had to suffer, their nobility was such that they were able to rise to great things.</P>
    <P>It is mentioned in the book that Irish emigrants were thought so little of that they were looked upon as dirt in America and that when you wanted a name lower than anything else, you described it as &ldquo;Boston Irish&rdquo;.  We know the answer to that.  There is one of them in the White House today.</P>
    <P>I have to return to the question of punishment in the schools.  Questions have been raised in this House.  A pamphlet has been published to discourage the teachers.  I say to the Minister: &ldquo;Stand behind the teachers.&rdquo;  I should like to tell the Minister a story about a predecessor of his, a member of his own Party.  I went into the Library.  The late Seán Moylan was there.  He was then a Deputy.  He was talking to a gentleman and a lady, who were interested in this pamphlet on punishment in schools.  He dragged me into the conversation by introducing me to these people.  These people were against all forms of punishment in the schools; their view was that teachers should not be allowed to say &ldquo;booh&rdquo; to a child.  I did not want to be impolite and I saw that the former Minister did not want to be impolite but one of these people said: &ldquo;We want to do away with these straps and canes&rdquo; and the former Minister, Seán Moylan, said, &ldquo;Well, I suppose you are right.  The man who taught me had neither straps nor canes.&rdquo;  They were delighted.  I think they were about to take a note of his statement.  &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he had an ash plant with a knob on it.  The fact that he had it there was the great deterrent.  He did not use it, except to strike the desk with it very savagely sometimes and <Col N="1305" /> kept it to threaten some delinquent with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are people who want to teach by high psychology or some such means.  They say that you should not threaten children at all.  If children are not threatened and if they are not punished they will become juvenile delinquents.  They will get out of hand. They will not be good citizens.  They will turn out to be blackguards.  The child whose teacher is a stern man has a much better chance of becoming a good citizen because he will be on the ball all day.  He will be looking in, as the children did in Goldsmith's poem, to see if the teacher is in a good humour, that there will be no &ldquo;day's disaster in the morning face&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that the demand for secondary education is increasing.  That is all to the good.  I consider&mdash;and I am sure the Minister will examine this&mdash;that for those people who are going to the training colleges for primary teachers there should be some means of helping them through the university because there are many of them who would like to become secondary teachers and to qualify as secondary teachers.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister that a great deal more notice should be taken by his Department of the kindergarten school.  I know that we can have it only in big centres of population but there are big schools in the country districts and there should be a special kindergarten teacher appointed to these schools.</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody from the other side to say &ldquo;The Deputy wants to spend a lot of money.&rdquo;  I would not mind spending the money.  It would be a great preparation and a great help to primary teachers. Primary teachers have said to me that where children came from kindergarten schools these children were much easier to teach.  These kindergarten schools have been going on for a long time.  As a matter of fact I am nearly sure that the Montessori system was started in Waterford by the Ursuline nuns.  It was they who introduced it into Ireland but I would like to see it more commonly used throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> I think there is a great deal of rewriting to be done in the case of many text books.  I would be tempted to say that we should bring them more up to date and that we should look back on the great readers that the Christian Brothers had&mdash;the fourth, fifth and higher readers.  I have never come across anything like them since.  Maybe the Department of Education has copies of them.  They have become collectors' pieces of late.  For the education of Irish boys and girls the general run of these books was good.  They contained literary pieces, good historical pieces, and some of the best of our poetry both in Irish and in English.  I think the time has come when we should have a good general reader.</P>
    <P>I come to a portion of the Minister's Estimate about which I have spoken every year since I came into the Dáil &mdash;the National Museum, the National Library, the National Gallery and the National College of Art.  I often heard Deputies here speak of our national heritage but if you asked them what it was they would not know.  I put it to the Minister that a great portion of our national heritage consists of the treasures in the National Gallery, the National Library and the National Museum.  I say once more to the Minister, and I think he is sympathetic, that the staffs of the National Gallery, the National Library and the Museum are dedicated people.  Were it not that they loved their work, they would not have remained there under the conditions under which they work.</P>
    <P>I was in the National Library only last Thursday.  The Reading Room was overcrowded.  It is good that the accommodation is overtaxed but the necessity is there for much more accommodation. I know that this is a headache. There is the question of what should be done or the decision that should be taken, whether we should take the National Library out of Kildare Street and build new premises or take the College of Art out of Kildare Street and add these buildings to the National Library.  I am sure if we were doing that, the National Gallery would want a good portion of the College of Art because, through no fault of the Curator or his staff in the National Gallery, we have no proper inventory of what is in <Col N="1307" /> the Gallery.  All the stuff is just packed into it and there is no room to store all these magnificent treasures.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Grant-in-Aid for the purchase of books is £5,000.  I would say to the Minister that £5,000 amounts only to pence with the cost of books today.  Before the war you could buy the first edition of any new work coming out and if it cost 7s. 6d. or 10s. 6d. you would consider that you were paying sufficient for it.  Now when a book comes out that you think the National Library should have the book will run from 50s. to maybe £6. I went to the trouble of finding out how matters stand with the library run by our fellow countrymen in Belfast.  They get £20,000 for the purchase of books.  I say to the Minister that the sum provided for the National Library of this country is grossly inadequate.</P>
    <P>For the survey and reproduction of Irish historical records in foreign collections the Grant-in-Aid is £3,250.  I would support that but at the same time I know how expensive it is to send people to Spain and Rome where a great deal of valuable records are kept.  They have to be copied and photostat copies made.  That is a very expensive business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> For the Survey and reproduction of films the Grant-in-Aid is £300.  In 1961-62 it was £600.  The Minister should pay a little bit more attention to that.  We had a film shown here some time ago by Gael Linn.  They went into the National Library and obtained access to a lot of old films belonging to Pathe Gazette and various people who used to make films and they were able to make a magnificent commentary on a phase of our history.  It was worth while.  I have been told that a great deal of the films from which they were copying have practically perished.  The type of films they were using in those days, say from 1900 on, would be very bad. From 1911-12 and on to 1925-26 films improved but the type has deteriorated.  I say to the Minister that he should be prepared to increase that amount substantially, to have an immediate survey made of those films and that they be reprinted and recopied. I do not want anybody to spring on me and say I am making an attack on the Irish language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state in respect of specific instance or nominee site houses in Dublin County during the past six years the number of proposals for houses submitted to his Department for sanction and the number of houses (i) sanctioned and (ii) not sanctioned, indicating whether the nominee site houses qualified for a subsidy on loan charges of 2/3rds or 1/3rd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department's records of housing schemes which have been sanctioned do not identify the number of houses the erection of which on nominee sites was proposed or sanctioned.  Similarly, the amount of annual subsidy determined for each scheme is not related to the question whether or not houses were provided on nominee sites.  The differential rate of subsidisable loan charges in respect of cottages provided under the Labourers Acts is applicable only to <Col N="1283" /> cottages the erection of which was commenced on or after 30th June, 1958, and is financed out of loans sanctioned on or after that date.</P>
      <P>I have, however, ascertained from the housing authority concerned that between the dates 23/9/1952 and 31/12/1960, they have provided a total of 974 cottages of which 60 were built on nominee sites.  Subsidy under the differential rate procedure has been fixed in respect of only one scheme provided by the housing authority, comprising seven cottages which, I understand, were built on nominee sites.  Six of the seven cottages in this scheme qualified for the higher subsidy rate.</P>
