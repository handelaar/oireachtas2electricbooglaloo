    <Title>Health Services: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Mr. T.F. O'Higgins on 23rd November, 1961:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that existing health services have been proved to be inadequate, and that in their place there should be provided a comprehensive health service based on the principles of insurance which will extend to 85 per cent. of the population, and which will provide without charge an adequate medical service with free choice of doctor, free hospital, specialist and diagnostic services and which will <Col N="1420" /> remove the necessity for medical cards for all those within the scheme.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendments:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute: &ldquo;a select Committee of Dáil Éireann, consisting of nineteen members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, of whom seven shall be a quorum, be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  to examine to what extent, if any, experience has shown that, having regard to the general structure of our society, the existing system of health services does not meet in a reasonable way and at reasonable cost the essential needs of the various sections of the population for medical care and attention and, if the examination should disclose any significant defects in the system, to what these are due;</P>
    <P>(2)  to review the income and other limits applicable to the categories eligible for the different health services;</P>
    <P>(3)  to review the existing arrangements for determining whether a person is or is not within an eligible category;</P>
    <P>(4)  to consider whether it is practicable to extend the free choice of doctor at present available under the general practitioner maternity and infant service to</P>
    <P>(a)  the general medical service, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the hospital and specialist services,</P>
    <P>and if so extended to indicate the consequential arrangements which would require to be made with existing and additional personnel, hospitals and nursing institutions;</P>
    <P>(5)  to prepare an estimate of the cost of any extension or modification proposed;</P>
    <P>(6)  to examine the existing arrangements for meeting the cost of <Col N="1421" /> the services and alternative arrangements which might be adopted for meeting such costs and the costs of any extended or modified services recommended and in particular to examine the practicability, desirability and economy of meeting these costs by means of a scheme which would be based on the principles of insurance and which would make provision for and have due regard to the position of self-employed persons and persons who would be unable to contribute to an insurance scheme or for any other reason might be outside the normal scope of an insurance scheme; and</P>
    <P>(7)  to make recommendations on these matters and such other matters related to the health services and their operation as the Committee think fit.&rdquo;&mdash; (Minister for Health).</P>
    <P>To add at the end of the amendment the following:</P>
    <P>That the Committee report before 30th June 1962 and that pending the report by the Committee the Minister for Health request County Managers and Health Authorities to liberalise the administration of the Health Act particularly in relation to the issue of medical cards and charges for hospital treatment.&mdash; (Deputy Corish.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking last night, I referred to the home assistance officers and it was my intention to try to get some sense of appreciation of their difficulties in administering the Health Act.  A good number of them have been complaining repeatedly and, in consequence, are on the verge of collapse in most cases.  They could be described as suffering a great deal from frustration.  When this Committee is set up, a good deal of time could usefully be spent on examining the dispensary system and, in particular, paying strict regard to the dispensary atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great need for some arrangement to offset the delay involved for <Col N="1422" /> many people who must avail of the system.  Most people who attend spend three or four hours a day at dispensaries. There is also the problem of the married man with a medical card who is entitled to dispensary services but who does not need to be out of employment although he is ill.  No facilities are afforded to that man at night.  There is need for night dispensaries for people who want to avail of them.  We should have a review of the location of dispensaries so as to ensure that people will have the services of the dispensary near them.  Recently, I came across a case where a man living 250 yards from the local dispensary went there for attention and was told he would have to travel three-and-a-half miles because he was living on the wrong side of the road.  He was not a resident of County Dublin&mdash;he lives in north-west Dublin&mdash;but he was told he would have to go into the county to obtain dispensary services.</P>
    <P>Other problems exist in regard to the choice of doctor.  We have the situation where persons living in Cabra require a doctor late at night.  They are given a telephone number to ask for a doctor to come to see them but the doctor is found not to be available. The <i>locum</i> is found to live at Finglas and he cannot come and says: &ldquo;I shall see you to-morrow.&rdquo;  There is a good deal of that happening all over the city.</P>
    <P>Another undoubted grievance is the hospital charges.  Very often people are charged 10/- a day while the social welfare benefit they get is £3.12.0 a week.  How can anybody expect a person to pay £3.10. a week out of £3.12. and run a home also?  I heard of a case recently of a person living in a small dwelling having an income of approximately £12 a week being asked to pay 18/- a day for his child in hospital.  He has made several representations about his problem but is told nothing can be done for him.  I came across another case of a man with £10.1. a week whose wife has been in hospital for the past three months.  He has a son in hospital for the past six weeks and he has four other children.  He is expected to pay for them in hospital.  Simultaneously he <Col N="1423" /> is obliged to pay someone to look after the other children while he is out at work.</P>
    <P>I also consider it very wrong that, when the head of the household falls ill, he does not get the relief he anticipates; if members of his family are working, their earnings are taken into account in assessing whether or not he should get a medical card.  I know of a case in Finglas.  There is a woman there suffering from paralysis.  She has to travel from Finglas to James's Street once a week to get the tablets she requires, and she has to pay 12/6d. for them.  The income in her home is £9.15. a week.  There are eight children. I have come across another case where a man has £9.2s. a week.  He has two children in hospital.  There is another suffering from a wasting disease in the stomach.  He has been told that the child must get special food.  He must get a special type of biscuit which costs 1/9d. a packet per day.  He must get a block of ice cream and that ice cream must be a certain firm's ice cream.  He must be given veal and liver and boiled fish.  This family has been refused a medical card.  This woman is confronted with the problem of conforming to this diet for this child and, at the same time, feeding the rest of the family.  Needless to remark the woman finds herself in difficulty in relation to paying her rent and recently she was threatened with eviction.</P>
    <P>These are types of cases that clearly indicate the unsatisfactory position that exists with regard to the medical card system.  There is widespread dissatisfaction and I am sure every Deputy is plagued with complaints about the operation of the Health Act so far as the issue of medical cards is concerned.  If this proposed committee does nothing else than recommend some proper and positive policy in this matter and does away with the present unsatisfactory position in which a card is given to one and not to another, both having the same means, they will do a good day's work.  Last night the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lenihan, said every local authority had a guide or a rule of thumb.  It is <Col N="1424" /> clearly evident in Dublin that there is no such guide or rule of thumb so far as the issue of medical cards is concerned and there is very grave need for the institution of some guide or rule of thumb.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the manner in which this Health Act is charged for, or levied, if you like, by way of impost on the rates.  We are told that the total demand for next year on the ratepayers of Dublin will be increased by £104,350.  At the moment three-quarters of the rates are being expended on the Health Act.  That postulates the problem of how this increase will be met.  If there are to be improvements will the improvements come about at the expense of the ratepayers? In speaking of ratepayers I have in mind in particular workingclass people endeavouring to buy their own homes. There is no doubt about it; some relief will have to be given to these people.  Perhaps the suggested Committee could do a useful job in making recommendations in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have advocated in their amendment a date line for this Committee to report back.  There is good reason for that.  We have a motion from Fine Gael; if it is passed, there is no indication of how many years it would take to bring about the reliefs recommended in relation to the operation of the Health Act.  Similarly, if the Minister's amendment is accepted without a date line we shall find ourselves in the same unsatisfactory position. I believe that, if this Dáil is to fall on anything, it deserves to fall in relation to the unsatisfactory operation of the Health Act if nothing is done to remedy the present position.  What motivated the Labour Party in insisting on a date line was the urgency, the clamour, the repeatedly expressed desire on the part of the people to have improvements in the Health Act, particularly in relation to the issue of medical cards, charges in hospitals, and the operation of the dispensary system.  As I said last night, there are many features in the Act that are undoubtedly satisfactory.  There are other features which require immediate alteration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am neither an accountant nor a mathematician.  I can speak only from experience.  I cannot decide whether the Fine Gael motion is as good as it is said to be in regard to the financial side of it.  I accept the motion in principle in so far as it aims at spreading the cost in such manner that there will be no great hardships. It should be the aim of every Government to spread costs because then they do justice to everyone.  We all know, however, that there are sections of the community who would rather have what they are getting for nothing.  That is the whole problem.</P>
      <P>With regard to this proposal by the Fine Gael Party, it sounds all right, but I do not accept their conclusions. They say it would cost about 1/6d. per head for those who benefit, excluding those, of course, who are unemployed and who would not be asked to pay any subscription.  It would cost the State about another £1,000,000.  I am not accepting that conclusion.  While there is something to be said for the proposal, I agree with the Government that the matter should stand up to examination.</P>
      <P>I am never very much impressed by what I hear in the Dáil.  There is good advocacy on both sides, and good advocates can make a pretty good show.  Defending advocates in court usually try to cover up.  That is why one will find a good advocate trying to prove a murderer innocent or hang an innocent man.  Likewise, here in this House, one hears a good case made on both sides.  The only way in which the case can be proved is if it stands up to close examination.  In court, they have a way of doing that in the form of cross-examination.  That is not allowed here.  You can tie a person down by putting one or two questions to him in court and his whole case will fall, even though it appeared to be a very good case.  Therefore, I am prepared to accept that.  The principle sounds all right.  It means that the cost would be spread.  The rates would save and there would be no great hardship for anyone.  At the same time, I am not accepting the financial conclusions. That is why I am prepared to accept the Government's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> But I am going to go further and agree with the amendment of the Labour Party, or at least with the principle of the amendment, that there should be some time limit for reporting back and that the existing Act should be liberalised in the meantime.  I have put down a short amendment extending the time limit to 30th November. My reason for doing so is that I do not believe that such a huge task as this, involving so much sifting of evidence, summoning of witnesses and so on, can be carried out and a report made in June.</P>
    <P>In fact, I do not believe the Government would accept the Labour Party amendment because it ties the Committee to a report by 30th June.  I do not believe the Government will accept that.  I have no reason for knowing they will not but I do not believe they will.  Therefore, to save the principle of the amendment, I propose to insert the words &ldquo;30th November.&rdquo;  Perhaps the Government would then accept the amendment as amended.  It is up to the Labour Party to think of that between now and 2 o'clock.  If their amendment is not accepted and if the Government's amendment is accepted, then we will have an amendment carried without any time limit and all the things we fear will arise.  So it would be advisable for the Labour Party to consider that aspect of the matter and accept my amendment of their amendment&mdash;that the time limit be extended to 30th November.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there will be any election inside the next two or three years.  Whatever was said about this Government in the past, it is said that it is now a good Government.  It may become a Utopian Government because they are meeting all reasonable complaints and they are prepared to set up commissions and examine proposals put forward.  It does not matter who the personnel is.  That should not matter.  I know it matters a lot to some people but from the point of view of the people the personnel does not matter. It does not matter whether it is Deputy Seán Lemass or anybody else if it is a good Government.  We have arrived at a situation where any reasonable proposal will be examined by the Government.  It is being said that it is <Col N="1427" /> a good Government.  Even the Press says it is all for the better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two grounds upon which I complain.  One is the effect of the present Health Act on workers who are denied the blue card. There is another aspect which has not, so far as I am aware, been mentioned. It concerns those people who are alleged to have an income of £800 per year.  I will deal with this matter first, having regard to the fact that it has not been mentioned in the debate.</P>
      <P>I asked a leading member of the Health Authority what he thought of this ceiling of £800.  He said that from his experience&mdash;and these people deal with these claims&mdash;some are able to pay and some are not.  Why is this so? Obviously, the reason is that some people have the £800 or whatever they have above that just for the normal home meals, whereas some other person is permitted an expenditure of several hundred pounds per annum over which he has no control.  Perhaps it is necessary to hold his job.</P>
      <P>There is the difference.  That was not taken into account.  The Act states that if you have £800 income, you have to get private treatment, pay the maximum 18/- per day, four guineas for an X-ray and all that sort of thing.  Let me give a case in point.  I do not like to bring up my own affairs in the House but somehow or other one knows one's own business best.  Sometimes what you hear from other people is exaggerated. Of course, one could exaggerate these complaints, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of this House, I have £1,000 a year, less the £60 deducted for the pension fund.  It so happens that I am one of those fools who let his business go.  I have no income at all except this £1,000.  I have not even a <Col N="1428" /> pension, which I should have.  In fact, I have nothing.</P>
    <P>I sent one of my children to the local hospital.  He had a pain in his tummy.  I went there the next morning and I was told to leave the child there for a day or two.  I left him there for two days.  There was nothing wrong with him; yet I got a bill for £7.1s. I do not believe that he ate 3/- worth of food.  They had him X-rayed.  There was no need to do so.  I did not ask them to carry out the X-ray.  I was charged four guineas, 18/- and £1 for examination.  Of course, I have £1,000 a year but in the past four and a half years, I have fought four elections which cost me £1,200 or £1,400 which I have had to pay for out of the £1,000. I did not fight the last election on buttons.  I have to pay £20 to a person for the next 12 months.  I have £1,000, less the cost of four elections, all my telephone bills, letter bills and expenses for the little bit of entertaining I do which is not very much.  I have £1,000 on paper.  I have nine in family.</P>
    <P>When we received our increase last year in allowance, we became subject to income tax.  The boys moaned here and so a fair percentage was not taken into account for income tax on the ground that this money was intended as an allowance to enable Deputies to carry out their work as T.D.s, but in the Health Act it is not taken into account.  I have only £10 per week as I have to spend the other £10 on fighting elections.  I am making my own point but I will not enlarge on it. The point is that thousands of others are similarly situated.</P>
    <P>There is the man who has to travel 30 miles each day to his job.  He has proved conclusively to me that it costs him 10/- a day for petrol.  He has to pay 10/- every day, and that is not taken into account.  The result is that when someone is ill, he is treated as a man with £800 a year, but how can his case compare with the man who works in the city and has to pay 3d. for a bus ride?  There is no comparison at all and some allowance should be made for those people who are alleged to have over £800 a year. <Col N="1429" /> The ceiling should be raised because the cost of living has increased generally.  Apart from the ceiling being raised, certain outlays will have to be taken into consideration before his means are calculated for the purposes of the Health Act.</P>
    <P>Let us get away from those alleged millionaires under the health system and come down to the workers.  It is my experience that the worker, the labourer, gets no blue card, unless he has a large family.  They come to me and complain that unless they have three or four children, they get no blue card.  If one of the children is ill and has to go to hospital, they get bills for £20 or £30.  That is what I am against, the lump sum practice.  I have experience of people who have to pay electricity bills and the main argument amongst people like old age pensioners is: &ldquo;We cannot pay the meter fee and the accumulated cost of electricity every two months.  We cannot pay out £1.  We do not mind 1/- or 2/-.  We will not miss that but when it comes to £1, we cannot pay it.  We have to buy some butter or cheese and we spend our money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know a woman who is on the 2/3d. weekly system and the E.S.B. are threatening to cut off her supply. They want her to go on the meter system but she will not.  She says that she can pay 2/3d. but she cannot pay 16/- or £1 every two months.  That is the lump sum practice and that is why to some extent I support the Fine Gael motion which suggests that small amounts like 1/6d. should be spread over a period.  Even a pauper can sometimes spare 1/6d. but he cannot spare 10/- or £1.</P>
    <P>What is the backbone of industry in this country or in any country today?  It is hire purchase.  Take away hire purchase and half the factories would have to close down because the poorest person, or the ordinary worker, can buy £100 worth of goods and pay 10/- a week, but he cannot put down £100.  That is the small amount as against the large amount.  That takes away the hardship.  As I say, I accept the principle of small amounts in the motion and I disagree entirely with <Col N="1430" /> workers getting bills for £10, £20 or £30 which they cannot meet.  I am suggesting that the Health Act has caused as much ill health as it has cured.  I know the position of the working people in this city.  I spend all my days meeting them.  I know that 5,000 people every year get notices to quit from the Corporation because of rents which a large number of them cannot meet.  I have to sift the whole business and try to get the whole story and a settlement.</P>
    <P>On many occasions, the whole story is: &ldquo;We had to pay £1 to a doctor and 15/- for the medicine and we could not pay the rent, and when it came to the second week, we could not pay the double rent and the rent collector would not take anything unless he got all the rent.&rdquo;  That is the evidence I have.  In other words, a child falls sick and the doctor is called in.  His fee may be reasonable enough at 7/6. About three months ago, I had made arrangements to go on holiday but I had to call in one of the local doctors and his fee was 7/6d.  He gave me a prescription for a drug which cost £2. What a difference! Yet, I am a T.D. and I am alleged to have £1,000 a year.</P>
    <P>What about the worker who will get the same doctor's bill and the same bill for the prescription?  How can an ordinary worker with a family, but without a blue card, afford to have his children treated if he has to pay 7/6d. to the doctor and 15/-, £1 or £2 for a prescription?  How can he do it?  He will have to let his children suffer on. That is the effect of the Health Act. I have seen children coughing their lungs out in the public street and when I asked them why they did not go to the doctor, they said: &ldquo;My mother has not got the money.&rdquo;  Children are left to develop colds and pneumonia because their parents have not got 7/6d. for the doctor and 10/- or more for the prescription which they have to pay if they have not got a blue card. That is the fault of the Health Act.</P>
    <P>The question is: what is the remedy? Whether or not the present system is all right, except for its administration being bad, I do not know.  Certainly it is all wrong for the person with £800 a year, and it is all wrong for the <Col N="1431" /> person whose outlay is not taken into consideration as it is for income tax. The income tax people consider certain outlays and do not take certain outlays into account.  This Health Act does not make allowance for those outlays, to my knowledge.</P>
    <P>As I say, this Fine Gael motion sounds all right.  I want it examined and I want the ceiling for the blue cards raised but somehow I have a feeling that no matter how much it is raised, hardship will still be caused to the border-line cases, and there will always be border-line cases.  We have differential rents and we never hear the end of the differential rents.  Some system should be organised under which everyone pays something, and the State contributes.  I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands jibing last night at the Fine Gael Party.  He was not correct. His remarks were to the effect that people who never paid before would have to pay 1/6d. and what would they have to say?  He was being political.  We must all remember that a great number of people who do not pay now may have to pay later, and may come under the full force of the Health Act.  Possession of the blue cards is an annual affair.  They are taken back annually and you have to prove your entitlement to them every year.  One might be the possessor of a blue card this year and be deprived of it next year.  That is being penny wise and pound foolish.  A person might be against having to pay 1/6d. this year and next year he might wonder why he did not pay it.</P>
    <P>There is a case for this proposal to spread the costs.  I have made my two points.  There is hardship among at least 30 per cent. of the workers in the city and the Health Act is responsible for a good deal of ill health because people cannot afford to engage a doctor and pay for the prescription, on the one hand, and there are the others who are alleged to have £800 a year but who have, in fact, certain outlays which should be taken into account. If they were, it would be found that their income was £500 or £600 a year and not £800.</P>

      <P>Although the Fine Gael motion has been subjected to a good deal of criticism, at least it has brought about a full-dress health debate.  I think every Deputy, no matter what his sentiments are for or against the Health Act, must welcome the motion.  From my own point of view, I have a perfectly clear conscience in the matter, because I felt from the beginning that the Health Act, such as it was, would not prove to be a success and would not give the services to the people which it was intended to give.</P>
      <P>Of course, debating health now is a very different proposition from debating it in 1952, when we had a long and extensive debate before the passing of the Act.  Charges have changed considerably since then and there is increased pressure on the community as a whole to maintain people in hospital, to pay doctors and, above all, to pay the cost of drugs, which has increased out of all proportion to what it was before, largely because drugs have been modernised and treatment has been modernised and everything is far more expensive than it was.  That puts a different complexion on the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health, in his contribution to this debate, produced very able arguments, as he always does. I sometimes feel that he would have made a very good senior counsel in that he is often able to state a bad case very well.  He came into this House to defend the Health Act, an Act which, I think, has not been a success.  The fact that we are having this debate and the fact that the Fine Gael Party, which must have some responsbility as the major opposition Party, has seen fit to undertake all <Col N="1433" /> this work and these actuarial calculations with regard to the Health Act and to bring in this motion, must show that the Deputies of that Party have had innumerable representations as to whether the Health Act is a success or not.  There is further proof in the fact that the Government have been moved to bring in the amendment.  I wonder if they would have brought in the amendment if the Fine Gael Party had not put down the motion? However, the motion has produced this debate and has brought Deputies from all sides of the House&mdash;Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil&mdash;to take part in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health defended the Health Act.  He seemed to think it was satisfactory, that the people were satisfied, that those whom it was intended to benefit were getting the benefits.  He admitted that all things are not perfect in it but he said nothing contrived by human agency ever was perfect.  That was as far as he would go.  He seems to be satisfied with the Health Act.</P>
    <P>Last night, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, Deputy Lenihan, defended the Health Act and made statements which, of course, he cannot stand over.  He said that every farmer whose valuation was under £20 had a medical card.  He said there was no difficulty or trouble about medical cards.  I ask Deputies on the other side of the House, in all fairness, are they not getting, as I am, continual representations and complaints about people not having medical cards.  The Labour Party have admitted that freely here.  At times, when we make representations, persons get medical cards and it is fully admitted that an injustice was done.  At times they do not. I know many cases of hardship in my own constituency and very recently the position has been far worse than it has been before in regard to people who should have medical cards and have not got them.</P>
    <P>I could cite many cases.  I shall cite a typical case of a man who wrote to me only two or three days ago.  He is earning £7 a week.  He has a wife and three children.  His rent is in the <Col N="1434" /> neighbourhood of 15/- a week.  He has a daughter who is ill and he finds it quite impossible to pay the cost of the drugs necessary for her treatment.  He finds himself in difficulties in regard to paying the doctor.  Can anyone imagine the acute and continuous anxiety involved for that person?  He is a decent type of man who wants to pay his way.</P>
    <P>That brings me to Deputy O'Higgins's motion, which has been applauded mildly by some and condemned by most people in the House.  The motion sets out to produce a domiciliary service, to produce a private practitioner service or service at general practitioner level, family doctor level, for the people, which they have not got at the moment and which is the great weakness in the existing Health Act.  I am not a practising doctor at the moment, but I am a qualified doctor and I was in private practice over the years.  I say that one of the provisions of the Health Act and, to my mind, the only provision, that has really been a success is the free choice of doctor in maternity cases.  Anybody who knows the first thing about it knows that a woman must have her free choice as to the doctor who will attend her at that particular time, a very important time for her, an important time for her family and, furthermore, an important time for the nation.</P>
    <P>Every woman that I have ever met wants to have the right to go to her own particular doctor.  In my opinion, that is the only respect in which the 1953 Act was a real and unqualified success.  It gave people an opportunity to go to whatever doctor they wanted to go to.  Therefore, they went to the doctor and they went to the doctor in time and had ante-natal treatment. As a result, the position in regard to births has improved tremendously.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say about the Health Act.  You cannot have hard and fast lines.  You cannot put the State in control of medical services without creating hardships and without prying into the private affairs of people, which I do not think is right.  When a doctor takes his degree he takes an oath to preserve secrecy.  Today, doctors cannot preserve secrecy in full, under <Col N="1435" /> existing circumstances, because in certain cases they have to reveal facts that should not be revealed.  If people have to go to hospital and have a certain type of treatment, the county manager has to be told so that he may decide whether it has to be paid for or not.  That is wrong and that is my main objection to the health services as they exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has <i>ipso facto</i> admitted that these health services are unsatisfactory, because he is going to set up a commission.  One solution may be to set up a commission because then the matter can be gone into properly and many anomalies dealt with.</P>
    <P>With regard to private practitioner service and the choice of the doctor, great play was made, when Deputy O'Higgins was speaking here, of the fact that one could not have choice of doctor in certain parts of the West of Ireland where there might be only one doctor.  Let us be realistic and practical. Deputy O'Higgins, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, introduced this motion to give, where possible, a free choice of doctor.  Everybody knows that if in a remote part of the country there is only one doctor you cannot have free choice of doctor.  Payment to doctors to enable them to live in such areas and to be on guard to attend to their patients will continue but there will be incentives under this scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like the scheme which has been drawn up here to encourage doctors to give better service and the better service they give, the more patients they will get and the more incentive there will be for them to work and look after their patients, and the better service the people will get.  I do not see anything wrong with that, but to have a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister spend over an hour arguing that it was futile to have a choice of doctor, is nonsense.</P>
    <P>I practised as a doctor and, as I have said before, I never held a public appointment but was purely a private practitioner.  Many people came to me and of course I had to live the same as anybody else and I had to charge them.  This system means that in a big centre where you have three or four <Col N="1436" /> doctors the people will have a choice. That applies to practically every town in rural Ireland, be it in Munster, Leinster or Connaught, or even in Donegal.  If people want to go to a particular doctor, they are entitled to do so.  It is a free country and if people prefer to go to a particular doctor, why should they not go to him?  I do not think there is anything strange in that, one way or another.</P>
    <P>I am not fully qualified to speak at first hand for the city of Dublin and I can go only on what I have been told by Dublin dispensary doctors. They are fully engaged on that work. They have no private practice.  Ninety per cent. of them never see a private patient, for the simple reason that they have not the time to do so.  They are overworked.  Repeatedly, one hears of doctors in Dublin and in the bigger centres dying literally in the prime of life from overwork, working practically day and night.  What is the objection to easing that work and allowing a free choice of doctor so that people can go to any doctor in the area?  Nobody can object to that. They would get a better service and the doctors would not be overworked. The doctor would be in a position to give better service to those he has to attend.  If a doctor is working morning and night, how can he give a first-class service?  Doctors are only human beings like everybody else.</P>
    <P>I think that disposes of the arguments advanced by those on the Government benches who say that the scheme is nonsense from beginning to end.  The scheme is intended to give a free choice of doctor, where a choice is available.  That is only right and fair.  This is a free country and anybody who wants to go to a particular doctor has the right to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin mentioned the ceiling of £800 a year.  Just to show how fallacious these official calculations are&mdash;it is all arranged in the Custom House&mdash;if a man has over £800 a year, he is not entitled to any free treatment and he is not entitled to any benefits under the Health Act, unless he goes to the county manager.</P>
    <P>There may be £800 coming into the <Col N="1437" /> house, or say, £900 to make the argument easier.  There may be six or seven people in the house and £900 represents the collective earnings of the different people there.  They have to be fed and clothed.  They may have continuous and persistent illness which may strip them of everything they have. If you have two people in the house with a total income of £900 a year, it is a different story altogether.  That is not allowed for in the Custom House. This is all dealt with at official level by officials who are only carrying out the laws made in Dail Eireann.  I pointed out when we were passing the Health Act in 1953 that you cannot make hard and fast rules.  This scheme is a national, voluntary health insurance and it is worked out on an actuarial basis.  Nobody has attempted to deny the figures.  People just got up and advanced blind arguments.</P>
    <P>Does any Deputy believe that for the £18 million or £19 million being spent to-day, we are getting a proper health service, a health service in line with the amount of money being spent? If that were the case, would Deputies, county councillors and members of corporations be making applications from morning till night, day in day out, for people looking for treatment? Many cases come to me, and many of them would come to me as I am a doctor, and many of them are cases of grave hardship but they have been kept out by this hard and fast rule set by the Health Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health referred to health services here and in Great Britain and pointed out that we pay so much towards health services that our percentage is practically as high as that of that great industrial nation. Are the health services in Britain as satisfactory as all that?  My experience has been that people there sometimes have to wait for nine months to get into hospital.  We have good hospitals here with accommodation available for practically everyone it is necessary to accommodate, in all spheres of medical care, except mental defectives. That is a sphere in which we are very much behind time.  There is a lot of leeway to be made up there and we <Col N="1438" /> require to establish more institutions. It is also necessary for us to evolve a new policy in relation to this matter because we have been working on the old system and it is not satisfactory. There is a tremendous waiting list at the moment which is causing undue hardship for mental defectives and those who require special institutional treatment and those who should get it at a certain age so that the treatment will be successful.  That is one matter that needs to be attended to right away.</P>
    <P>I have tried to show the House that in my experience as a medical man, the health services are not satisfactory. I think this is the basis of a very fine voluntary contributory scheme which would embrace all sections of the community requiring it.  I do not say it is perfect but if the Government accepted this scheme and brought in a Bill, it could be debated and amended.  I say that anyone who thinks that the present health services, costing £18 million, with their frustrations and restrictions, and all the prying into the lives of private individuals, are satisfactory is wrong.  I said that in 1953 and I say it now with far more conviction. I see no reason in the world why the House could not accept this motion.  I know that they will not do so but if they do not accept it, they can be grateful to the Fine Gael Party for having had a full discussion on the health services, which nobody can consider satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I think we are entitled to say that this scheme is ill-considered.  As a matter of fact, the last speaker, if one takes two or three points from his speech, appears to be entirely out of line with what Deputy O'Higgins said about his scheme.  For instance, he criticised the £800 limit.  I understood that the £800 limit was remaining in Deputy O'Higgins's scheme.  It is too soon for a Deputy of the Fine Gael Party to start criticising his own scheme because if Deputy O'Higgins had given this full consideration and thought, the £800 top limit on salary for that sort of free service should have been mentioned or should have been amended. The Deputy who has just spoken also <Col N="1439" /> said that this is a national, voluntary health scheme.  I did not think it was voluntary.  I understood&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  As far as I can see, the main complaint which Deputies generally have made in this debate against the present administration of the Health Act is that people are not getting the free medical service which they should get; in other words, that they cannot afford to pay.  Deputy Sherwin and others took that line, that people who should have them are not getting the blue cards.  The Act lays down that people who are unable to provide for it by their own industry or other lawful means are entitled to free medical, surgical, ophthalmic, dental and aural treatment, medicine, medical, surgical and dental appliances &mdash;all the various things a person might require&mdash;if they cannot afford to pay for them out of their own industry or other lawful means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that many of the Deputies who spoke in this debate would have no complaint if that had been interpreted as they think it should be interpreted.  There may be&mdash;and as far as I can gather from the debate, there are&mdash;differences in the various ways in which the Act is interpreted by the county managers. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, when speaking here last night, gave the directive issued by the county secretary in Roscommon.  In that directive, it is mentioned that farmers under £15 valuation are entitled to free treatment, and above £15, there is a scale according to the number of children, and it goes up to £20 valuation. The directive also mentions a single man with £6.5.0. per week and goes up to £9.5. per week, according to the number of children.  That may be a more liberal interpretation of the Act than that taken by some county managers.  That being so, there is a <Col N="1440" /> good case to be made for an examination of the administration of the Health Act and, as the motion says, if more than the administration is wrong, recommendations may be made for any necessary amendments.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear I am not against an insurance scheme.  My only worry about an insurance scheme is that it will be extremely difficult to apply.  The Health Act is coming under severe fire here.  I do not think any Deputy could find any great fault with the Act if he read through it and saw what it laid down.  Every attack made on the Act was on its administration. If we appoint a Committee to examine whether the Act is not being interpreted as it should be and recommendations are made accordingly, perhaps that can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Because some Deputies do not appear to be familiar with it, I should like to point out what the Health Act lays down.  As I said, it lays down, first of all, that those who cannot provide for medical services out of their own industry or other lawful means are entitled to absolutely free services all round.  That, of course, was the case before the Health Act was brought in.  There was the same definition. The only change the Health Act made as far as the lower income group was concerned was to give them a choice of doctor and a grant in the case of maternity services.  That was an added benefit for the lower income groups.  That is not a legal phrase, but we know what is meant by it.  For the middle income group, who had no right to any service up to that period, it was provided they should get hospital services and specialist treatment and also free maternity treatment.  That would appear to be as far as the mover of the motion is going, so far as the patient is concerned. In the motion also, of course, there is free practitioner treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If possible, we have to have a principle. The principle we have been following so far in the health services here is to provide for the people what they cannot afford to pay for themselves. The Health Act was based on that principle.  At that time, it was <Col N="1441" /> believed by me, as Minister for Health, and by the Government, that we should give free treatment to the lower income group.  We all agree with that.  It was believed the middle income group could afford to pay for the ordinary practitioner service.  As a matter of fact, it was laid down in the Act that if anyone could not afford to pay, he should get it free.  As far as anybody in the middle income group is concerned, according to the Act, he should be in the lower income group if he cannot afford to pay.  It was provided in the Act that everybody in this country, no matter who he might be, if he could not afford to pay for the general practitioner service, must get it free.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act gave him authority, not the Minister.  It is right that the Act gives the county manager power to decide, but the Act also puts the burden on the county manager to give free practitioner treatment to everybody who cannot afford to pay for it.  If the county manager is not interpreting the Act properly, that matter can be investigated by this Committee.  The Act lays down that general practitioner service should be given to everybody who cannot afford to pay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit the Deputy is going a bit further than that because he is going into an insurance scheme. <Col N="1442" /> We went further in the 1953 Act.  We said it was quite possible that a man might be able to afford to pay the general practitioner, but he might not be able to meet hospital bills.  I had known cases of that myself.  I had known medium-sized farmers practically bankrupted by long hospital treatment for themselves or members of their families and bills by surgeons and so on.  In order to meet that, it was decided that the middle income group, as defined at that time, should have free general hospital service.  The income group was defined as insured people, farmers up to £50 valuation and those in receipt of salaries up to £600 a year, but that was subsequently amended to £800 a year.  The only thing that could be charged against those people was a maintenance charge of 6/- per day.</P>
      <P>If it is worked as it should be worked according to the Act, that is a fairer system than a system which says there is to be absolutely free treatment for everybody up to £800 and no free treatment for those over £800.  In the Health Act, you at least have this tapering.  Those coming near the £800 were paying something and it was laid down, though I think Deputy Sherwin did not appear to realise it, that the person over £800 a year could get the benefits of the Act, if the county manager thought it was a hard case.  We do, therefore, deal with the person of £800 also.  If we could get a better arbiter than the county manager, it could be done.</P>

I remember pointing out to the then Minister that if people required treatment, they would go to hospital anyway and that beds would not make any difference.  The Minister then got support from the Labour Party; in fact, the Labour Party did all the arguing for him, but when it came <Col N="1443" /> near another general election the Act was brought into operation, even though the number of hospital beds did not show any great change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; the Deputy did not.  I admit that.  The maintenance service was 6/- per day but when we came back in 1957, we were presented with the situation, which I do not want to go into now, in which we had to try to cover a deficit of £11,000,000, which the Coalition left us.  We had to face up to that.  We had to cut the food subsidies; we had to bring in a provision under which the maintenance services would cost more.  Those things would never have had to be done if we did not have to cover that deficit of £11,000,000.</P>
      <P>On this subject, let us go back another bit.  In 1947, I brought in two Acts, one of which provided for the division of the charges between the Exchequer and the local authorities who were then paying 80 per cent. and the Exchequer 20 per cent.  I brought in a Bill to make it fifty-fifty as between the local authorities and the Exchequer and it has gradually come up to fifty-fifty. I also brought in an Act dealing with maintenance in cases of infectious diseases and also providing benefits for relatives, including, of course, those of tuberculosis patients.  We went out in 1948.  The Coalition came in and remained there for three years, doing nothing in this matter.  They argued for three years about the Health Act but it was never brought in.  There was only a mother and child scheme but no general hospital scheme.  Even the mother and child scheme was not brought in&mdash;the Government broke up and went to the country.  The Coalition came in again in 1957 and again nothing was done except to suspend the Act of 1953 for two years.  At the end of two years, it was put into operation. That was the sum total of the work of the Coalition in this respect from 1954 to 1957.  The Act is now in operation.  It may not be all it should be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but if it is not, the best thing is to have some sort of expert committee to examine it.  We have been attacked for suggesting the setting up of this Committee but I should like to point out that when this Health <Col N="1445" /> Act was going through, the Fine Gael Party brought in two amendments to set up a Select Committee.  Surely we can at this time give the matter more effective consideration after eight years' working because now we can see what the result of the implementation of that Act has been.  In 1952-53, the total expenditure on health services was £10.5 million; it is now £18.1 million &mdash;a huge increase.  I have often been attacked by Fine Gael for saying that the Health Act would not cost the rates more than 2/- in the £.</P>

      <P>The Minister was substantially right in relation to individual health services.  What increased the cost was that under the present Act there is more hospitalisation than there should be.  The real increase has been in hospital maintenance because you have a defective auxiliary health service and there are more people going to hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy, when replying to the debate, will explain how, in his scheme, the hospital service could be made more effective. That would be most interesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must follow some principle.  I have explained the principle we have been following in the Health Act.  If there has to be a different interpretation or an amendment, well and good.  If a Committee is set up, it can consider such a point.  The Deputy is taking on a different principle. He says: &ldquo;Give everything up to 85 per cent. of the cost.&rdquo;  I do not think that is a very fair scheme because you stop abruptly at 85 per cent. with 15 per cent. left to pay by people who still have to pay their rates and taxes. Those people will also have to contribute to the general charges for the health scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also a motion by Deputy Dr. Browne which calls for a free-for-all scheme.  There is a principle in that, though I do not agree with it.  Deputy T.F. O'Higgins has not <Col N="1446" /> got a principle.  He has, if you like, tried to put flesh on the bones.  That was announced before the general election. He has found it very difficult to do so.  He is putting flesh around the bones to try to give them the appearance of some sort of a scheme.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the blue card. There is nothing in the Health Act about the blue card.  For some time before the Health Act was brought in there were complaints about it.  People thought it was too pauperising an idea and when the Health Act was brought in and when the county managers were asked to decide who was entitled to free medical service, the county managers combined thought it would be a good idea to give each person some sort of ticket or card telling him or her that he or she was entitled to free service for 12 months ahead and not put them to the inconvenience of going off to the warden for a red ticket when a person became ill in the house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made a long speech and I did not interrupt him. All these things are absolutely irrelevant. I am just talking about the Act. I never heard of a case being reviewed when a person became ill.  I heard of many complaints, but not that one. The Labour Deputies are anxious to say the Health Act was a great mistake and they have acted like that for the last eight years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A choice of doctor has been referred to.  It is an extremely difficult problem.  I should like very much to see a choice of doctor.  When I was bringing in the Health Act I was very keen on having a choice of doctor if at all possible, but there are two difficulties. The first one is a difficulty for all time; in the very sparsely populated areas it is difficult to see how you could have more than one doctor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact it is necessary to give them salaries to keep them. <Col N="1447" /> Unless the dispensary salary is continued a doctor will not stay there. Secondly, there is a temporary difficulty; there are 650 dispensary doctors who are being paid a substantial salary. I do not say it is too much but it is a substantial salary.  If we give a choice of doctor&mdash;perhaps the Deputy would deal with this point&mdash;I assume the dispensary doctor would have to be guaranteed his salary.  I do not know how he could get over that without guaranteeing his salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy says we will give him six months' notice and out he goes, that is a solution.  I do not know if it is a fair solution.  We must guarantee him his salary.  If I am a dispensary doctor and a person comes to me and says: &ldquo;Will you take me on?&rdquo;, I can say: &ldquo;There is a young doctor down the road.  Why should I take you on?  I will be paid in any case.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter we would have to deal with.  I do not know if that would be a fair system. There were a few points raised by Deputies which do not appear to be altogether true.  Deputy Mullen said that three-fourths of the rate is expended in implementing the Health Act.  That is a huge exaggeration.  It is the sort of thing that has been said about the Health Act in different parts of the country.  People down the country will say: &ldquo;The rates are going up because of the Health Act.&rdquo;  Deputy Mullen has said it.  The rate is 40/9 of which the Health Act accounts for 13/9, which is one-third, not three-quarters. That is the type of thing being said all over the country by irresponsible people and people who are hostile to the Health Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mullen also said it would be a good thing if there were night dispensaries. They were tried and they were not a great success but they could be tried again.  When I was Minister <Col N="1448" /> for Health we tried them.  I thought there would be many people in the city of Dublin working all day who would be glad to avail of the night dispensaries but they were hardly patronised at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, but that was the position that time anyhow. Deputy O'Higgins said every patient without a medical card must pay 10/- per day.  That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I said every patient is charged that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Charged 10/- per day.  I have not been able to get the full figures because, unfortunately, where no charge is made there is no record kept.  Therefore I do not know what percentage of people are not charged at all.  However, of those charged, 50 per cent. pay 10/-, 20 per cent. pay between 5/- and 10/- and 30 per cent. pay under 5/-.  These are based on returns from 16 counties so it is a fairly reliable figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins also said citizens should not be asked to pay for a comprehensive service without being able to benefit from it.  He has departed from that principle by leaving 15 per cent. of the people outside the scheme. Those people have to pay their rates and taxes and they will not benefit. Deputy O'Higgins covers in his scheme a general practitioner service for the lower income group and for the middle income group, also hospital services, in so far as they are contributed to by the patient, maternity and child welfare services, drugs and medicines, dental and ophthalmic services, and so on.  That is all right but when we consider that institutions generally in this country will cost about £12,500,000 this year <Col N="1449" /> and that in a scheme like this we would have to contribute £500,000 or slightly over that out of an insurance scheme towards these institutions, it seems hardly worth while.  It is too lopsided, to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered also that under Section 25 people can go to the institution of their own choice.  The Deputy does not say what we should do about those.  First of all the Deputy should know that these people go to an institution of their own choice and get a subvention from the local authority of 8/- per day.  We have no record to show what the total bill is.  Under the insurance scheme, I presume, taking this choice of doctor and so on, they would get absolutely free treatment in that case.  That may or may not be a costly scheme&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but it has not been referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In any good insurance scheme we must try to have equal contributions for equal benefits.  It is not a very sound scheme if we do not. There are very many people outside this scheme, 700,000 or 800,000.  Many of those in the scheme are paying 1/- a week, 1/6 a week or 2/- a week and so on.  However, I want to make it clear I am not against the insurance scheme if it is feasible.</P>

In the meantime, wage negotiations can of course be pursued through the existing machinery. </P>
    <P>What was contemplated was (1) machinery to deal with wage disputes only and (2) that the tribunal would not commence operations until the bonus scheme was applied to the whole country, which has only recently been achieved, as the Deputy is aware.</P>

These ex-members in common with other State pensioners have received increases in the amount of their original pension awards under the provisions of the Pension (Increase) Acts, 1956, 1959 and 1960.  Should there be a further revision of the pension awards to State pensioners generally, the claims of Garda pensioners will, of course, be considered.</P>

      <P>As the House has been told on several occasions, the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Garda Síochána provides that all matters coming within the scope of the scheme shall fall to be dealt with exclusively through the machinery of the scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I am not prepared to agree at all that the last award was unsatisfactory.  As I pointed out to the House some time ago, the last award was accepted at conciliation level and did not go to arbitration. Therefore, it can only be assumed that it was regarded by those representing the Garda as satisfactory.  In any event, it is not for me to review an award of that nature at all.  Indeed, it is not for me to decide any matter relating to the pay of the Garda Síochána, who have been granted a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  It is impossible to envisage dealing with matters affecting pay or pay claims otherwise than through that machinery.</P>

I can assure him that none of these men will refuse an increase, if he gives it to them.  That is what ought to be done.</P>

      <P>I think the protests which were made recently were far more concerned with the representative machinery than with any particular issue of pay.  I think the Garda Síochána are quite satisfied with the scheme of conciliation and arbitration <Col N="1479" /> and I do not think any Deputy speaks for the Garda Síochána in any way when he suggests that we should have matters of pay decided outside that scheme.  I think the only way in which we can conduct these affairs in future is through the conciliation and arbitration machinery, which machinery is available at all times to consider any claim in regard to pay put forward by the Garda Síochána.  Furthermore, I should like to say that the relations between myself as Minister for Justice and the Garda Síochána were never better than at the moment, and I deplore any attempt to muddy the waters in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  First of all, as the mover of the motion, I should like to express my appreciation to Deputies who have joined in this debate and who have faced up to their responsibilities as members of this House by considering carefully and responsibly this very important social problem of how best we should organise our health services.  It was the object of my Party, the Fine Gael Party, in tabling this motion at the outset of the new Dáil that there should be a fruitful discussion and, we hoped, an acceptance by the Government of a policy in which we sincerely believe. I appreciate that, generally speaking, there was an effort on the part of Deputies on all sides of the House to discuss this matter objectively and properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal further with the motion and the amendments, I should like to correct one or two misapprehensions <Col N="1481" /> which were expressed by Deputies with regard to our proposal. Yesterday evening, while expressing his appreciation and support for the services envisaged in our insurance proposals, Deputy Tully said that it was like asking for the moon because they could not be achieved.  He said he could not see how these important services could be provided for a total sum of £8½ million when the cost of the present services to the State totals £18 million.</P>
    <P>There is a misapprehension, I fear, in Deputy Tully's mind with regard to that, because that is not our proposal. At present, the cost of what are known as individual health services carried in the Health Estimate&mdash;these are the domiciliary medical services, the dispensary service, the mother and child service, institutional services, and so on&mdash;total roughly £3 million and that £3 million at the moment is divided into two, half paid by the State and half paid by rates.  The figures are very rough, but the balance represents the cost of maintaining our hospitals and institutions.  Our scheme is directed towards the cost of individual health services.  Institutions will still have to be maintained, financed and paid for in the way in which they are at present paid for.  So that, in fact, what is involved in our proposals is an increase in expenditure on health of the order of around £5 million a year and that additional expenditure will be financed, as we propose, on the basis of an insurance approach; in other words, on the one-third approach, that the State will pay one-third, employers one-third, where people are in employment, and employees one-third, where that is possible.  So that, in fact, there is no impossibility in that.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, you cannot have better health services without an increase in expenditure and what we are concerned with is to achieve better health services and to achieve it in a way in which it is possible in our society.  Obviously, everybody would love to have all the services increased, without having to pay a penny for it. Unfortunately, the facts of human <Col N="1482" /> society do not permit that and, if you desire to improve the social structure, you have to face up to the way in which it is to be paid for.</P>
    <P>We recognise and believe sincerely that once you have the main burden of the financing of health legislation falling on the taxpayer or the ratepayer, falling on a few, if you like, you will always be up against any improvement in the service; you will not, in fact, get such an improvement.  I do not blame people for it but the fact is that the taxpayer or the ratepayer today would start a revolution in the country if he were told that he had to face immediately an increased expenditure on health of the order of £5 million or £6 million.  It just could not be done.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the services which we ask for are of the most rudimentary form, the most elementary form in any civilised Christian country.  It is essential, in my view, that an ordinary person of limited means should be able to face the prospect of sickness or illness in his family with some mental calm.  It is wrong, in my view&mdash;and if something is not done about it in the near future, it will lead to serious problems&mdash;to continue a system whereby a worker's child or a worker or his wife falls sick and they have to face the prospect of paying for a doctor.  I am not suggesting that the doctor's fee will be exorbitant&mdash;it probably will not be&mdash;but the visit of the doctor to the house means for that worker a prescription for a drug or medicine at the chemist's shop, which often he is unable to face.</P>
    <P>It is no good going around the place in blinkers.  It is wrong to have that gap and that defect in our health services and that is what is there and that is what will remain so long as you have the Health Act, no matter what changes you bring into it, in its administration or so on.  The Health Act does not cover domiciliary medical service for persons except those who can show that they are totally unable to provide for themselves.  That was one misapprehension that was in the mind of Deputy Tully and, perhaps, in the minds of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I have dealt with that.  Perhaps I will talk to the Deputy some time.  I do not want to delay the House unduly.  Another misapprehension that was mentioned by some Deputies was that, under our proposals, contributions would have to be exacted from those who at the moment get such services as are there free and without charge, that is, medical card holders.  That is not so. That is not intended and will not happen.  In the way we organise our society, there are clearly defined categories of persons who are amongst the poorest of the poor.  They are: the unemployed person&mdash;he is known; he has not got to prove himself in any way, apart from registering as unemployed; he is out of a job and he is known; the figure is known; the people are known&mdash;home assistance recipients &mdash;they are established under one branch of our social activities; old age pensioners&mdash;they, again, are known; there is no question about them.  The other category of very poor people is, surely, land holders whose valuation does not exceed £15.</P>
      <P>These are, clearly, the poorest of the poor and, in fact, of the total number of medical card holders in the State at the moment, 271,000, I have little doubt that the vast majority are already covered by these categories. There may be other cases that it is not possible to define or put into immediate categories.  We bear that in mind, but, in relation to all those people in those circumstances, they will get the same services as everybody else but no contribution will be taken from them. They will be carried under the scheme by the insurance fund.</P>
      <P>I shall not chase all the points that were made in the debate but certain points were made by some of the Deputies opposite who from time to time did commit the venial sin, if you like, of forgetting their objective approach to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health, speaking on behalf of the Government, started off by making the debating point that I had changed my view in relation to the Health Act and that having left <Col N="1484" /> that side of the House and come over here, I was now opposed to the Health Act, and he made the case that, as Minister, I was in its favour.  I would just like, for the record, a Cheann Comhairle, very briefly to re-state the facts.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister for Health, in 1954, I was faced with absolute chaos, so far as the health services of this country were concerned.  There was a smouldering, bad row going on between not only the doctors, but with the nurses and every other service in the State concerned with health.  No arrangements, good, bad or indifferent, had been made by my immediate predecessor to bring into operation the services laid down in the Health Act. Apart from necessary arrangements with the professions concerned, there were not even the hospital beds in the country to provide for the operation of the services.  I was aware, as a Fine Gael Deputy, and as a Fine Gael Minister in the inter-Party Government of the day, that a majority of this House had voted in favour of the Health Act.  We had not; we had opposed it; but a majority of this House had passed it and it was, therefore, my duty to see that it went into operation.</P>
    <P>That did not mean that I was in its favour.  I was not, but I was concerned to discharge my duty to this House and I proceeded to do it.  I, first of all, sought time and I did it by coming into this House and stating precisely what I had in mind.  I asked the House to postpone the operation of the Health Act for which my predecessor had made an Order bringing it into operation on August 1, 1954.  He pressed the button.  It was to be a delayed explosion.  He left office and pressed the button, in the hope that the bomb would go off when his successor was there.  If it had gone off, health services in this country would have disappeared.</P>
    <P>The Dáil, in its wisdom, gave me the right to bring in the Health Act in my own way and in my own time.I proceeded as a matter of urgency with the hospital building programme and I proceeded to have discussions with <Col N="1485" /> those who were to operate the services. After all, the necessary medical care cannot be given to sick people by a policeman; it is necessary to have a doctor.  You cannot send a soldier to act as a nurse in the hospital; you must have nurses.  I had to get the co-operation of these people and the Minister was rather unfair when he quoted a speech, which I made as Minister in 1955, in which he said that I had expressed approval of the Health Act.  I did no such thing.  If he had read fully the passage in the speech from which he was quoting, he would have read to the House these words:</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in order to avoid complete chaos in this country, and particularly in order to avoid unnecessary hardship being imposed on persons and classes who up to 12 months ago were being provided with services, I found it necessary to move in this House a Bill entitling me as Minister to build a scheme out of the Health Act bit by bit, according as the necessary facilities would become available.  In doing that, I did not express any approval of the methods contained in the Health Act for the achievement of better health services in this country.  In fact, I still regard the Health Act as not being the best course for achieving even the limited aim that it sets out to achieve. </P>

      <P>Volume 151, at column 1553 of the Official Reports. I made the position perfectly clear and the view which my Party and I expressed when speaking to this motion is consistent.  We were against the Health Act when it was introduced. As a Party in the inter-Party Government, we did our best to make it work.  I undertook in 1954&mdash;if there is a political point to be made out of it, I will give it&mdash;particularly to the Labour Party, as a matter of political honour, that before we left office, so far as I could, I would see the services promised in the Health Act in operation. I was able to achieve that, not as <Col N="1486" /> an election stunt, as the Minister for Finance said today, but at the beginning of April, 1956, before there was any discussion about a general election.  I was able to make the necessary orders providing that the different sections of the Act went into operation, not on paper but as a real measure with the co-operation and understanding of all professions and bodies concerned and with the necessary hospital buildings completed.</P>
      <P>It is my complaint now, and the complaint of my Party, that since that, despite the efforts, this Act just cannot do it; it cannot provide the service because the policy is faulty.  You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear and that is what is facing this House.  It is unnecessary to go over again the defects of the Act but remember under the Health Act&mdash;and it is no good saying it is not there as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands wishfully said last night&mdash;a free medical service, a service without direct charge, is provided only for those who can prove themselves to be paupers.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that medical services should only go to &ldquo;those unable by their own industry, <Col N="1487" /> or other lawful means, to provide for themselves.&rdquo;  I invite the Parliamentary Secretary to take down the Oxford Dictionary and look up the definition of a pauper.  He will find that a pauper is a person who is unable, by his own industry or other lawful means, to provide for himself.  Do we not know it?  There are unfortunate people who may be able to pay something, some portion of a doctor's fee, part of a chemist bill, but they will not get a medical card because they have not shown that they are completely unable to provide for themselves.</P>

      <P>That is part of the policy of the Health Act and can people not realise that?  Are we going, by committees and window-dressing, to allow that system to continue?  No amount of window-dressing or changes in administration can affect the written word of the Health Act, because it is there and it is the law.</P>
      <P>Again, under the Health Act, and no change of administration will alter this, there is no medical service provided for what are called the middle income group.  The middle income group are not persons of affluence. Generally speaking, they are the generality of producers in the country, the workers, the small farmers, those engaged in different industries and trades.  They total some 1,600,000 people.  These, the backbone of the country, representing at least 50 per cent. of our people, under the way we organise our health services at the moment, receive no help whatever in relation to medical service outside hospital.  I think it was Deputy Hogan who made this point very succinctly, that the result is that we drive those people into hospital.  Sickness in the family means large medical drug bills, apart from fees for medical treatment. What happens inevitably is that that possibility is not faced and the simplest thing is to go into hospital, and into hospital they go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have today, as a result of a faulty medical service for the poor, operated through one doctor who <Col N="1488" /> frequently cannot meet their requirements, and as a result of no medical service for the middle income group, a very high hospital intake.  Look at our bill for hospital maintenance. When I was Minister for Health it was £7½ million or £8 million in 1954. Each year it is increasing by sums of the order of £2 million.  It was £10 million last year; this year it is going to be £12 million and next year it will be £14 million.  Up it will go each year, because more people are there.</P>
    <P>Our hospital beds are always full and the costs of medical treatment and hospital maintenance are just mounting all the time.  We are paying now in the cost of health services largely for the maintenance of institutions. Should we not have a look at why that is?  Should we not try to bend things the other way?  Instead of maintaining the system of services that tends to force people into hospital, should we not have a look at them before they go into hospital and try to bring about, if it is within our means, the development of services that will keep them out of hospital?</P>
    <P>That is what we have in mind.  We want to build up, through an insurance scheme, a proper medical and nursing domiciliary service so that, when sickness affects a family, the worker whose wife or child is sick or who fears sickness himself will not be afraid to call in a doctor, that he will be able to go to the doctor of his choice and say to him &ldquo;I do not feel too well&rdquo;, or &ldquo;One of the kids is a little bit sick&rdquo;, that the doctor will have the interest to visit that person and will not be hesitant, as he should not be, in prescribing a necessary drug or medicine or whatever it may be, so that, by a simple operation of that kind, frequently the recourse to hospital may not arise.</P>
    <P>I cannot see in what way we are wrong in desiring that.  I cannot see in what way the people would not be served by such a service.  I can see immense benefits from it.  There are 14,000,000 working days per year lost at the moment to our labour force; 14,000,000 working days disappear at the moment from our production <Col N="1489" /> because of casual or occasional illness amongst workers and hospitalisation of one kind or another.  Is it not in the interests of the country to try to obviate that?</P>
    <P>We are faced at the same time with a rising hospitals' maintenance bill, costing the taxpayer, the ratepayer and everybody else more and more, merely in discharging the bills.  Should we not try to obviate that?  Should we not try to dispel the anxiety, worry and neurosis caused to many decent families with the prospect of illness? If we can do that for a cost within our resources, which is going to be spread amongst heads of families, at a limit that can be easily afforded, in my view we should.  We will never do it unless we accept the principle of insurance.  You are never going to get, in the way in which our system is organised, a situation in which a large sum of this kind can be collected, certainly in taxation.  You may aim towards it and you may grope towards it but, as you are groping towards that objective, the other bills are increasing all the time.  As I say, no amendment of the Health Act can alter that, because it is not in the Act.  It is not the policy and it cannot be provided.</P>
    <P>As an example of what I mean, under the Health Act there was to be a dental service, not only for the poor but for the middle income group. Everybody was to get free dental service.  Is it there?  Is there any hope of its ever being there?  We all know it is not and that it cannot be provided because it costs too much.  To provide a dental service&mdash;and the section of the Act has not even been put into operation&mdash;an estimate given to me when I was Minister put the total cost at £2½ million.  This equalled the cost of all the other services put together.</P>
    <P>Of course, neither I, my successor nor anyone else is ever going to ask the taxpayer to foot that bill for an ancillary health service.  Therefore, that section does not apply.  It was a political carrot at one time to be dangled in front of the public.  Now the carrot is gathering dust in the back shelves.  We have no dental service, and so long as we have a Health <Col N="1490" /> Act with that policy we will never have a dental service here.  There are many other defects in the Health Act to which I have referred and I shall not refer to them again.  The fact is they cannot be cured by changes in administration.  The policy is wrong, the Act is wrong, and there it is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne intervened in this debate after the Minister for Health.  I am a little bit sick of Deputy Dr. Browne.  He is not here now, but he wraps himself in a cloak of shining white and comes in here, abrogating to himself the sole right to talk in relation to poverty and disease among our people.  What is he doing?  He is trying desperately to fan up the old flames which some years ago made him temporarily an important person in this country.  He says our views here are confused.  I am not going to swap epithets with Deputy Dr. Browne, but his solution for our health services is to provide them absolutely free on the basis of the T.B. scheme and other measures in relation to disease.  He says that, and he hopes nobody will take him up on it.  I will take him up on it.  If we are to finance our health services in that way, will Deputy Dr. Browne, some other time when he attends to his duties here, stand up and tell our people what taxation is going to yield a total of £23 million? Who is going to pay for it?  Is he going to advocate taxing bread and butter and the simple articles of diet which the poor people have to have?</P>
    <P>It does not solve anything saying our proposals are confused or ill-thought out and that we are in some way antediluvian, when he himself has no constructive suggestion whatsoever to put forward in this House.  Not even England, that he so greatly admires in relation to social services, would seek to finance health services on the basis of general taxation.  They do not do it; they ask the people to contribute on the basis of insurance, and the insurance proposal is part and parcel of the national health services in Britain.  Deputy Dr. Browne apparently does not appreciate that.  I hope we shall have an end to that sort of arrant contribution.  During discussions here <Col N="1491" /> Deputy Dr. Browne has never in relation to health matters put forward a single constructive proposal ever since he was Minister for Health away back ten or 11 years ago.  He has added nothing except confusion and trouble.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, speaking, I suppose from a very old brief, said that under the Fianna Fáil Health Act, all specialist services were provided free. You know, that was the situation when I left off.  I brought those services into operation.  When a person went into hospital&mdash;a person of the middle income group&mdash;no charge could be made, but my successor introduced the Health and Mental Treatment Act of 1957 which, in its very first section, provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There shall be charged for specialist services for middle income groups such charge as may be specified by the Minister, and that such charge shall be collected in such manner as may be directed from time to time by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I moved an amendment to substitute for &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The Fianna Fáil Party lined up to defeat that amendment.  The position now is that there is no discretion on the part of local authorities: these charges must be imposed.  Furthermore, they must be collected.  There is no question of wiping it out.  I have said enough in relation to our proposals.  They are clear proposals.  They have been called ill-thought out by some Deputies. I can only assure the House that our plan for health took a number of years to prepare.  It is well documented; it is fully thought out; and it was not prepared, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands said last night, on the spur of the moment as an election gimmick.  Our views on this were crystallised a considerable time before the election took place.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that inevitably, whether now or in the future, these proposals will be accepted.  For that reason, we look with considerable suspicion on the amendment put forward <Col N="1492" /> by the Minister for Health and the Government.  We are being asked to permit a number of Deputies here to get together and make recommendations to the Minister for Health on health policy.  The motion contains our recommendations.  We know it is right. We believe the country will think so also and we find it slightly strange that any Government should renege on their own responsibilities.  We believe it strange indeed that the Minister should come into this House to throw the health baby at the House and ask the House what to do with it.  Surely it has been accepted by this time that a Government are elected to carry out their policy and to bring proposals for legislation before the House.  It is, accordingly, a very strange thing that the House is asked to make proposals for legislation to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope the Labour Party does not fall for that because if it does, it will rue it.  If it falls for this stunt put forward by the Government, the Party will be very sorry indeed.  Let the Labour Party apply a test to the Minister's amendment: will the Government agree to the Labour Party amendment to have a time limit on the deliberations of this Committee?  If it does not, the object of this Parliamentary exercise is to take health out of this House for a number of years, to put it into the political limbo of forgotten things because it is awkward for the Government, because the Minister for Health and apparently the Minister for Finance still believe in the Health Act, though I have no doubt many of the younger Fianna Fáil Deputies realise that policy is wrong. These men cannot turn their backs on it, so it is to be postponed.  We believe that is wrong.  We have a clear proposal and we certainly do not fall for that sort of inaction on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I express my appreciation to the Deputies and the Minister for Health of the manner in which this debate has been conducted? I hope it has served a useful purpose and that, however it is achieved, from the discussion we have had, there will be some change, I hope, urgently and quickly, made in the interests of a <Col N="1493" /> proper health service.  If that is done, we will feel we have achieved the object we had aimed at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled a Question, No. 78, on 30th November with regard to the filling of a most important position in Limerick Technical Institute and I am not satisfied with the answer I received, particularly when the Minister said: &ldquo;It came to me in writing, through the official channels, as a unanimous decision.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As a public representative, I have grave responsibilities to my constituents in the city and county of Limerick. Much public attention has been attracted as a result of the Minister's action in this case.  The position of principal teacher in a technical institute never existed before in Limerick.  It is a position second to that of chief executive officer.  When this position was first mooted, it was recommended, according to the official minute of the committee, that it be incorporated on the agenda for the September meeting.  When the recommendation was put on the agenda on that occasion the committee proceeded to fill the position without, in the first place, consulting the Department of Education.  It was stated and decided at that committee meeting:</P>
      <P>The Chairman expressed the view that the procedure being adopted might have repercussions among the staff.  He referred to the seniority of service of Mr. John Hersey who had similar status of Graded Teacher as Mr. Clancy.</P>
      <P>In reply to queries regarding grading of teachers the C.E.O. said that the Senior Teachers had Grade II status.  Promotion beyond this consisted of Grade I Vice-Principal and Principal&mdash;depending on the size of the institutes and Schools and the administrative responsibilities involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1498" /> After further discussion: the proposition to appoint Mr. Clancy as Principal of the Municipal Technical Institute was adopted. <i>nem. con.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have an authority here which disproves the Minister's statement that this appointment was unanimous, and I want to quote him, Sir Walter Citrine. He says that <i>nem. con.</i> means &ldquo;no one contradicting&rdquo;.  In debate, it means &ldquo;carried without a count&rdquo; and not &ldquo;carried unanimously&rdquo;.  These matters were pointed out to the Minister and the Department of Education. Previously they had received a protest from the organisation of teachers involved because of the principle adopted.  Notwithstanding these things, the Minister wrote to the Committee:</P>
    <P>I am to refer to your Committee's minutes of the 27th September, 1961, and to the unanimous decision of the Committee therein recorded to appoint Mr. Clancy to the post of Principal of the Municipal Technical Institute, Limerick.  The normal procedure in this case would have been that your committee should first have furnished evidence that the creation of a post of Principal was warranted and, should the creation of the post have been approved, applications should have been invited either from teachers already in the service of the Committee or by public advertisement.</P>
    <P>Consideration has been given to the need for this new post.  Because of the burden of his general duties it is considered that the C.E.O. should be relieved of the responsibility of the duties of Principal of the Technical Institute.  Some difficulty, however, arises from the fact that the Committee's present plans will mean a substantial change in the educational activities of the Technical Institute and later developments in the Committee's plans may result in further changes.  The present, therefore, does not appear to be the most suitable time to make a fundamental change in the administration of the Technical Institute. However, after giving the fullest consideration to this matter and <Col N="1499" /> to the fact that it was the unanimous wish of the Committee to make this appointment, the Department decided to sanction the appointment of Mr. Clancy as Principal of the Technical Institute.  In addition to his duties as Principal, Mr. Clancy will also be responsible for the Building Trades Department of the Institute.el</P>
    <P>The salary scale will be as follows : £1,123 to £1,468 per annum. </P>
    <P>This is a greater salary than the C.E.O. himself receives.  I put it to the House that our responsibilities to our constituents, particularly to the students and teachers of Limerick, deserve greater consideration than the Minister has shown in this case.  He has flouted all the rules and regulations relating to such an important post.  He has refused to recognise the wishes of the organisation of all the teachers concerned and we have in that Institute in Limerick four or five men qualified &mdash;some better qualified than the man appointed&mdash;to fill this important post. The matter was put on the agenda for discussion and as a result of the discussion, the appointment was made without giving anybody an opportunity of knowing that this principalship was being created or an opportunity of applying for it.  I want to air this grave action on the part of the Department of Education which approached this matter in a completely irresponsible way.  The blame must lie on the Department which has acted irresponsibly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am charging the Minister.  We have 3,500 students and over 100 teachers in Limerick now faced with an appointment that has not been made with the co-operation of the teachers in Limerick.  That has been proved to the Minister.  While a committee may make suggestions and pass resolutions, we must remember this: had the committee on that or on any occasion decided they would set fire to the Limerick Technical Institute and it was passed unanimously, does <Col N="1500" /> it not follow from what the Minister has said in the letter, he would let them put a match to the place?  As a responsible Deputy for Limerick, I protest against the action taken in regard to this appointment, depriving men qualified for this post of an opportunity of applying for it.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell has asked to be allowed to speak on this matter also and I shall give him an opportunity to do so but I want to make this clear. A similar position could arise in Tipperary or Monaghan or Dublin tomorrow and if this is to be the Minister's approach to the education of our children, it is time it was stopped. While I am in this House, I shall see to it that justice and fair play are meted out all round.</P>

      <P>I have not very much to add to what has already been said.  I should like to say, first of all, that I am convinced the procedure followed in making this appointment was a bad one.  Certainly a bad impression has been created among the general public.  It has also led to a considerable amount of dissatisfaction among teachers and students in this important educational institution.  I am sure the Minister will agree that dissatisfaction among teachers and students in any type of educational institution is a bad thing.  No time should be lost in remedying the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that this was a newly created post, extra care should have been taken in making the appointment.  In ordinary circumstances the appointment of a man who has no outstanding qualifications for a post, which has been newly created and which was not advertised, would give rise to suspicion.  A certain amount of injustice has been done to the other senior members of the staff since they have been denied the opportunity of even submitting applications. The Minister, if for no other reason except to restore confidence among vocational teachers in general with regard to their prospects of promotion, should take steps to remedy the situation.  The post should be re-advertised. That would serve to clear the air and dispel the confusion, the <Col N="1501" /> dissatisfaction and the suspicion which have been aroused following the making of this appointment.</P>

      <P>To clear the position for Deputies who are not members of committees, I should like to point out that the position of the Minister is one of sanctioning.  The committees appoint their own staff.  The Minister sanctions the appointment, if he thinks it is necessary, and the appointee, if he is qualified.  In these particular circumstances, I was advised by the people appropriate that the post was necessary and that the man who was appointed had all the qualifications.  Despite anything that may be said by anybody who does not like him, he was fully qualified for the post.</P>

      <P>The method of making the appointment has been questioned. It is not true to say that the regulations require that the post should be advertised.  The memorandum referred to by the Deputy requires that every prospective appointment to a whole-time position should be advertised in the public press.  This refers to the ordinary Class III appointments.  It was never intended, nor is it the practice, to insist that promotion appointments be so advertised.  Paragraph 15 of Memorandum V. 7 states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All proposals for promotion or appointment to posts carrying higher scales of salary than those referred to at paragraphs 10 and 12 of this memorandum&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is, the scales appropriate to the Class III posts&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;are dealt with by the Minister as they arise.  The appropriate qualifications for each such post, the scale of salary and the terms and conditions of appointment will be determined by the Minister having regard to the nature of the appointment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is not true, therefore, to say that the regulations require that the post be advertised.</P>
      <P>There was, too, a suggestion that other members already employed by the Committee did not get an opportunity to apply.  There were five Grade II teachers on the staff of the Municipal Technical Institute when the Committee at their meeting in September decided to appoint Mr. Clancy. The Minutes of that meeting show&mdash; indeed the Deputy showed it when he was reading them&mdash;that the Chairman brought to the Committee's notice the fact that there were other teachers who should be considered for the appointment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said &ldquo;one teacher&rdquo;, but it was pointed out at that meeting&mdash;the minutes clearly show it&mdash;that the Chairman brought to the Committee's notice that there were other teachers who should be considered for the appointment.  Other teachers on the staff were qualified. The minutes go on to say:</P>
      <P>after further discussion, the proposition to appoint Mr. Clancy as Principal of the Municipal Technical Institute was adopted, <i>nem con.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>They were perfectly entitled to do what they did.  Appointments as Principal have been made elsewhere&mdash;in Dublin City and in Cork City, for example&mdash;without advertisement or invitation of applications.  If there was a question of making the appointment at some other meeting it is the same Committee which would make the appointment.  There is no question of some underhand method <Col N="1506" /> of making the appointment.  It would be the very same people who would make the appointment anyway.  It would be the same Committee.</P>
      <P>I do not know if there is any point following what the Deputy said last week that the appointment was a question of the man's political affiliations. My information is that there is a Committee of 15 with three from the Party alluded to by the Deputy.  I do not think that anybody could imagine three out of 15 carrying a whole Committee and then getting a new meeting of the Committee to say this was unanimous.  The Limerick V.E.C. acted completely within their rights. The man appointed is fully qualified and well qualified.  If there is any question of politics involved, it may be that the Deputy is witch-hunting after a man whom he wants to victimise for some other reason.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2.15 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday 14th, February, 1962.</P>
