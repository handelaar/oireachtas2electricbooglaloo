      <NameTxt>Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha (Proinnsias Mac Aodhgáin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go ndeonófar suim nach mó ná £6,937 chun slánaithe Barrachais ar an Deontas le haghaidh Gnóthaí Eachtracha don bhliain dar chríoch 31 Márta, 1960.</P>
      <P>This excess arose mainly on two subheads of the Vote for External Affairs&mdash;subhead B.2, travelling expenses by representatives abroad, and subhead B.3, postage, stationery, telegrams and telephones abroad.  The excess over the gross estimate for External Affairs was £7,573.  There was, however, a surplus of £636 in the Appropriations-in-Aid.  The net excess, therefore, was £6,937.  I am asking that this sum should now be made good.</P>
      <P>In the case of subhead B.2&mdash;travelling expenses by representatives abroad &mdash;the expenditure of £27,376 exceeded by £5,376 the estimate of £22,000. Such expenditure varies appreciably from year to year and has always proved extremely difficult to forecast The Estimate for 1959-60 was upset by the death of one Head of Mission abroad and the illness of another.  As a consequence there were seven transfers of officers at a total cost of approximately £5,000,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> The excess on subhead B.3 arose largely as a result of higher expenditure than had been anticipated on postage, stationery, telegrams and telephones in the United States of America. In fact, our offices in that country spent just over £1,500 more on these services than had been provided in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>My Department experiences a special difficulty in determining towards the end of the financial year whether the amount voted is sufficient to meet actual expenditure or whether a Supplementary Estimate may not be required to provide for a possible excess in spending.  The reason for this is that seventeen sub-accounts of ours are held abroad.  This makes it impossible to have before the end of the year quite reliable figures of the expenditure actually arising.  Any forecasts made some weeks before the end of the financial year as to the total expenditure which will have been incurred during the year are thus only approximate estimates; and there is, consequently, a risk of expenditure exceeding the sums voted especially when the annual Estimates are finely drawn.  This proved to be the case in the financial year 1959-60.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, add that on many occasions in previous years the total provided under some subheads has been exceeded and, in particular, under subhead B.2, which was primarily responsible for the Excess Vote with which we are here concerned. However, in all such cases in the past there have been sufficient savings elsewhere in the Vote to offset the excess on particular subheads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to make to this Excess Vote but I do not think the occasion should be allowed to pass without the comment being made that resort to the Excess Vote procedure is one which I think we would all deprecate as something to be regarded as normal practice. While fully recognising the special difficulties that arise in connection with the Department of External Affairs and the various accounts held abroad, ordinarily the device of virement <Col N="840" /> should be sufficient.  Where that is not sufficient I think the Minister should agree that in ordinary circumstances it is very desirable that Supplementary Estimates should be submitted to the House so that their purpose and amounts can be adequately discussed before any charge falls upon public funds.  The seeking of an Excess Vote is not a common occurrence, and in the circumstances set out by the Minister today we have no serious criticism to make.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it is very undesirable that Excess Votes should have to be introduced, but there were special circumstances this year, as I have outlined.  We could not foresee at the beginning of the year that these changes would have to be made.  I regret that we could not deal with the matter by way of Supplementary Estimate rather than by an Excess Vote.  We shall do our utmost to avoid repeating this procedure.</P>

      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for External Affairs comes before the House because of the need to make provision for the newly established Mission at Lagos, the capital of the Federation of Nigeria, and because it is now clear that expenditure on a number of subheads of the Vote for External Affairs is likely to be somewhat greater than was envisaged when the original Estimate was framed.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be well aware of the strong connection that has long existed between Ireland and Nigeria.  Irish missionaries have been labouring in that country for some fifty or sixty years.  We can indeed be very proud of the work they have done there and of the important role they continue to play in the educational and medical as well as the spiritual life of the Nigerian people.  It is estimated that there are at the present time upwards of 1,500 Irish citizens resident in the Federation and making their contribution to the development of this important new African State.  Among these citizens there are 1,000 priests, brothers and nuns.  Our educational institutions at home are happy and we are happy to see so many Nigerians come to our own country for training in medicine, law and other disciplines.</P>
      <P>It is our hope that the establishment of a Mission in Nigeria will prove beneficial to the work of our missionaries and other citizens there.  I know that they will appreciate having an official Irish representative in Nigeria, as indeed they and the people among whom they live and work appreciated the Taoiseach's presence at the Independence Celebrations at Lagos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Federation of Nigeria&mdash;the most populous single national unit in Africa&mdash;is bound to exercise an important <Col N="842" /> influence in the future development, political and economic, of that continent, and it is already playing an important and valuable part in the United Nations.</P>
    <P>We hope, too, that the presence of a Mission in Lagos will be rewarding for the development of our export trade.  It is as yet too early to speak with any certainty of the prospects in that regard but it is at least reasonable to expect that a community of 35,000,00, embarked on the material development to which the attainment of independence gives a most powerful impetus, will provide openings for mutually advantageous trade exchanges with this country.</P>
    <P>Last summer the Government decided that it would be appropriate that, before Nigeria achieved independence on the 1st October, 1960, a consular office should be established at Lagos to take care of the interests of Irish citizens and to foster commercial and other contacts.  It was not of course possible to have diplomatic relations with Nigeria at that time. After the attainment of independence, however, most other countries which had hitherto had consular missions in Lagos transformed them into diplomatic missions and the Government felt that it was proper for this country to do likewise.</P>
    <P>Our Embassy will consist of an Ambassador and a First Secretary with such subordinate staff as may be found to be necessary.  Pending the arrival of the Ambassador-designate in Lagos in a few months' time the Embassy will be in the charge of the First Secretary as <i>Chargé d' Affaires ad interim</i>.  In the Supplementary Estimate for the current year, therefore, provision is made for the salary and allowances of the First Secretary and subordinate staff and for incidental expenses connected with the running of the office.  The estimated expenditure in the current financial year arising out of the establishment of the Embassy at Lagos will be £1,900 under Subhead B.1, £750 under Subhead B.2, £150 under Subhead B.3, and £50 under Subhead B.4.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other factors which have necessitated my introducing <Col N="843" /> this Supplementary Estimate, I should mention that we were conscious of the fact that the original Estimate was somewhat tightly drawn. It now emerges that additional sums are required under a number of Subheads, namely, in respect of</P>
    <P>(a)salaries, wages and allowances at headquarters and abroad (Subheads A.1 and B.1).</P>
    <P>(b)travelling and subsistence expenses in respect of headquarters and abroad (Subheads A.2 and B.2),</P>
    <P>(c)official entertainment of distinguished persons (Subheads C.3), and</P>
    <P>(d)postage, stationery, telegrams and telephones abroad and incidentals at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Deputies will find details set out in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>It is now expected that the Appropriations-in-Aid will fall short of what was originally estimated by £1,750.</P>
    <P>The net supplementary sum required is accordingly £15,775.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the proposal to open a diplomatic mission in Nigeria.  As the Minister said, this country has been closely connected with the development of Nigeria. Great numbers of persons, particularly priests, nuns and brothers, have gone out there as missionaries and teachers. Indeed, when the Independence celebrations took place in October, quite a number of representatives from religious houses from this country, who formerly laboured there, were invited to attend as well as the official representation on behalf of the Government by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Many expressions of gratitude were tendered on that occasion for the enlightened role which these missionaries played in the development of that country and for the contribution they had made in educational and other spheres.  It is therefore appropriate on an occasion such as this that this country should have representation there.  Nevertheless, this is probably a suitable opportunity to express the view that there may be a tendency for this country, in the changes which are taking place generally throughout the world, to take on too many responsibilities for our resources.  We ought to proceed with a certain amount of caution in embarking on new missions or incurring increased expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth of the Department's Estimate and of the Estimate for International Co-operation has been continuous over a number of years.  While we have always accepted the view that this country should play an effective part so far as we can in international affairs&mdash;and I believe we have, within the limits of our resources, done so since the establishment of the State&mdash; nevertheless, compared with other countries, our resources are relatively <Col N="845" /> limited.  The part we have played and the commitments we have entered into are quite considerable for our size and for our resources and it is important that we should not lose sight of these facts when matters of this sort fall to be considered.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a Mission here offers not merely an opportunity for further contact with the Nigerian people but also, I hope, scope for trade development and the possibility of an expansion in trade between the two countries.  It is a matter of satisfaction that the Nigerian people have over the years sent so many students to this country and that we in turn have sent so many missionaries and other people to Nigeria to undertake work which they were peculiarly fitted to do.  We approve the proposal to establish the Mission but it is important that we should view all these matters in the light of the size of the country and the resources available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we should be careful before we establish more Missions abroad but there are certain cases where it is essential that we should establish Missions and undoubtedly one case is Nigeria.  It is a country with which, as I pointed out, and as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, we have had very close associations and very valuable associations for the Nigerian people.  Now that they have become independent, it is in the interests of both the Nigerian and Irish people that formal diplomatic relations should be established.</P>

      <P>Go ndeonófar suim fhorlíontach nach mó ná £80,765 chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Mhárta, 1961, le haghaidh ranníocaí do Chomhairle na hEorpa agus don Eagras um Chomhar Eaenamaíochta san Eoraip agus do na Náisiúin Aontaithe; agus le haghaidh costais eile i ndáil leis an gcéanna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> The principal reason why I bring this Supplementary Estimate before the House is that, as Deputies will be aware, the United Nations has for some months past been facing a very serious financial crisis.  The Organisation began the financial year 1961 with a virtually empty treasury and with arrears of contributions to the Regular Budget amounting to $8.5 million and to the United Nations Emergency Force (Gaza) account of $22.5 millions. The crisis was brought to a head by the added heavy financial burden of the United Nations operation in the Congo since last July which is of the order of $10 million monthly.</P>
    <P>The alternatives now facing the Organisation are either to revise its policies drastically and face withdrawals from Gaza and the Congo, with all the consequences such steps would have, or to make appropriate and speedy arrangements to cover the very high costs imposed by the policies adopted to meet these situations.</P>
    <P>Various measures have been suggested to meet the situation such as augmenting the Secretary-General's borrowing powers, increasing advances to the Working Capital Fund or establishing a Peace and Security Fund. It may well prove necessary to resort at some stage to one or more of these measures.  In the meantime, however, there is one course which Member Governments can adopt to at least alleviate the situation, namely, to pay their contributions to the 1961 budgetary accounts at an early stage in the year.  It is the Government's view that, as a concrete manifestation of our loyalty to the United Nations Charter and our determination to stand by it, we should take that course; and this is the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate now before the House.  If, as I confidently hope, the Dáil approves the Estimate, the Government will then be in a position to effect payment of our 1961 contributions to United Nations expenses some six months or so earlier than in previous years.</P>
    <P>Of the amounts falling due for payment, details of which are set out in the Estimate, our shares of the United Nations Regular Budget and of the United Nations Emergency Force <Col N="847" /> (Gaza) Budget are calculated in accordance with a percentage scale of assessments.  This is determined by reference to national income, population and other related economic factors. In our case the percentage is small and stands at present at just under 0.16.  The net cost of ONUC&mdash; the United Nations Organisation in the Congo&mdash;for the period 14th July to 31st December, 1960, has been apportioned among member States on the same basis subject to the application of certain voluntary contributions to reduce the burden on member States with the least capacity to pay.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Fund for the Congo is a voluntary fund to be used under United Nations control and in consultation with the Central Government of the Congo for the purpose of assisting that Government to maintain certain essential public services with the ultimate objectives of preserving its unity, territorial integrity and political independence, protecting and advancing the welfare of its people, and safeguarding international peace. The Secretary-General estimated that the immediate financial support needed under this head from all Member States is $100 million if United Nations operations in the Congo are not to be jeopardised or even nullified. The Government consider it important that Ireland should make a contribution to this fund and subject to the approval of the House, they propose to contribute $25,000 or £8,950.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the House will agree that we should do what we reasonably can to help the United Nations in the extraordinarily difficult financial position in which it finds itself this year.  It is vital for the future of the Organisation that nothing should be left undone which would contribute to the success of its task in the Congo.  It would be particularly unfortunate if the United Nations efforts were to fail because of financial difficulties which, with the goodwill of Member States, could be overcome.  This country has met its responsibilities to the United Nations in relation to the Congo.  We have every right to be proud of the gallant service of our soldiers and medical teams who <Col N="848" /> responded to the request of the Secretary-General. In the Government's view, we should be prepared to bear the very much smaller burden involved in making the payments covered by this Estimate.  I therefore propose that the Dáil should approve these payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that our view is that the gesture suggested by the Government is a reasonable one in all the circumstances, but it causes me some surprise that the Minister did not think it appropriate to tell us what corresponding gesture is contemplated by the other members of the United Nations.  I understand that some members are in default of their contribution and it would be helpful if the House were told what the position is in regard to the various member nations and how many have indicated their willingness to emulate the example set in the procedure adopted by our own Government with regard to advance payment of the 1961 contribution.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the extremely complex and difficult situation which obtains in the Congo at present; yet there are certain aspects which we are bound to consider on the occasion of the submission of an Estimate such as this.  We are faced, in that difficult and dangerous situation that has arisen in the Congo, with all the consequences of the horrors that ensue when murder is adopted as an instrument of policy.  Murder begets murder.  One side murders a politician and the other side murders a priest.  One side murders simple people in their homes.  The other side wreaks vengeance on those whom they conceive to be responsible for that outrage until ultimately a country such as the Congo, peopled by so many different races, approaches the full horror of civil war.</P>
      <P>To apportion blame in all that dialectical horror is very easy if one is utterly irresponsible, extremely difficult if one recognises the limitations of one's own information and if one realises how rarely it is possible to simplify the complex affairs of a distant State, more especially those of an emergent State where normal political institutions have never existed before.</P>

      <Col N="849" /> We have, in common with many other nations, decided that such help as we can offer to the Congo people in their trials and tribulations should be channelled to them through the medium of the United Nations and that policy has so far enjoyed the unanimous support of this House.  We still believe that to be the right policy but we have noticed that, within the recent past, the United Nations have decided by a resolution of the Security Council, by the unanimous vote of those who voted albeit with two abstentions, that the responsibility of the United Nations Force should now be extended beyond its original charge to preserve the peace to the further responsibility of using force if necessary to avert civil war.</P>
    <P>The armies of several States who have made contributions to the United Nations Force are at present serving in the Congo.  Amongst them is the contribution made by our Army. It is difficult for us to keep constantly present to our mind, as we have a clear duty to do, the realisation that General McKeown is now not serving the Irish Government but is in the service of the United Nations and is the United Nations Commander there.  Bearing that fact in mind, whether the United Nations Commander is one of our own or a national of Sweden or anywhere else, it behoves us to ask ourselves the question: if the United Nations have decided to accept the very substantial additional responsibility of undertaking to avert civil war, if necessary by force, what decision have they taken to provide the United Nations Commander in the Congo with forces and equipment adequate to bear this additional grave responsibility?</P>
    <P>The Congo is a vast country.  I think it is true to say that it is as big as France, Germany and the Low Countries combined.  Its communications are extremely primitive.  It is inhabited by a variety of tribal peoples There is a struggle for power proceeding. Even though a Government has been recognised by the United Nations, various rivals claim a variety of rights in regard to the autonomy of the various districts they inhabit and <Col N="850" /> the danger of conflict amounting to civil war is pretty imminent.</P>
    <P>I think our Government and every other responsible Government attending the United Nations have a clear duty to measure the liabilities they undertake as members of the United Nations with the resources they are in a position to deploy.  I put it to the Minister for External Affairs that, with the resources which the United Nations Commander-in-Chief at present disposes of in the Congo, to charge him with the responsibility of averting civil war, if necessary by force, is to charge him with a responsibility far beyond the resources he disposes of, both in men and material. That is not a reasonable thing to do.</P>
    <P>I believe the policy of the United Nations as expressed in various resolutions to date in regard to the Congo represents the best policy, in all the circumstances.  It would be a very good thing if the United Nations could succeed in putting an end to the internecine warfare that has threatened the very existence of the new State, but it would be the greatest of all disasters if the United Nations undertook a responsibility expressly without carefully counting the necessary cost and providing that cost in full time to meet any emergency that may arise.</P>
    <P>We certainly cannot feel easy in our minds that the United Nations have made any corresponding decision in regard to men and materials with the new decision to charge the Commander-in-Chief in the Congo to stop civil war, if necessary, by force.  We feel that very substantial additions of men, materials and equipment should be made available to the United Nations Commander forthwith, if he has this added responsibility.  We would be gravely concerned if we were told that the United Nations Commander in the Congo were called upon to meet these responsibilities without the additional force.</P>
    <P>I know that in circumstances such as at present confront us in the world, it would be very easy to use the language of panic and alarm and I am concerned to refrain from that course. However, I do not want the Minister <Col N="851" /> to underestimate the anxiety we feel in this regard.  It would be idle to deny that the pride we have all legitimately taken in the contribution our Army has made to the valuable work that has been done to date adds to our anxiety lest in the present circumstances when the United Nations Commander is an officer of our Army, he should be placed in an impossible position which no personal sacrifice on his part could redress.</P>
    <P>I am not fully informed, and I do not suppose the Minister himself is fully informed, of all the details of the situation obtaining in the Congo, but I think both of us know enough to realise that the task of preventing a civil war, if necessary, by force, in a country of that kind, in a territory of that size, is a formidable assignment. We all know from our past experience in this country and elsewhere there can be no greater disaster than to ask the forces of order to meet an emergency with inadequate resources.  There is no more fundamental rule in situations of that kind than the obligation, if you have to meet disorder, to deploy forces so amply as to make the success of the effort certain.  Such forces to meet the situation in the Congo must be very considerable and they are subject to the further limitation that the sources from which they can be drawn are strictly limited because it appears that practically every major power which could quickly deploy overwhelming forces and material is virtually excluded from participation in this operation by political considerations.</P>
    <P>In that delicate situation, we ask reassurance from the Minister for External Affairs that, if we are correct in believing that the recent resolution of the United Nations has considerably expanded the responsibility of the United Nations Commander-in-Chief in the Congo, the Minister is satisfied that the United Nations are in a position to and intend to place at his disposal adequate resources of men and material to carry out his charge. If that is done, then our anxieties will be largely allayed.  If a situation <Col N="852" /> is allowed to develop in which the United Nations Commander-in-Chief in the Congo is called upon to undertake these very substantial additional responsibilities, without corresponding reinforcement of his resources, we would consider the situation to be extremely difficult and one which the Government, in our judgment, should very carefully consider.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to help out as in the Gaza affair where fully adequate forces were available to deal with any possible situation which could arise under the limited responsibility the United Nations had accepted in that area.  It was very limited, almost restricted to the function of an observer force.  There is a very great difference between that and the almost unlimited responsibility which the recent resolution of the United Nations would envisage.  We want assurances that the recent resolution is not going to wind up on the part of the United Nations as a pious hope and that the United Nations are in a position to provide the additional forces requisite and that they have a firm intention of doing so without delay.  I do not doubt that the Minister and the Government share the anxieties which I now mention but I hope that before this Supplementary Estimate is disposed of they will be able to reassure the House.</P>
    <P>As regards the finances of the United Nations, one finds it hard to imagine that the States which are members of the organisation will allow it to go bankrupt.  I do not think they will and I suppose the present financial stringency is simply part of the general campaign on the part of the Soviet bloc to bring pressure to bear on the administration.  I imagine that is a crisis that will be relatively easily overcome.  In any case the attitude of our Government as outlined here is the correct one.  I should be glad if the Minister would tell us when concluding what the judgment of the Government is as to the ultimate prospects. I rather imagine that whatever else may affect the future of the United Nations it will not be finance but I should like the Minister's view on that aspect of the Estimate we have before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Supplementary Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do this as a measure of our criticism of the Government's, and I suppose the Minister's failure since July last&mdash;when we accepted responsibility in the United Nations by sending troops to the Congo&mdash;to exercise proper initiative or to make positive suggestions for active protests against certain decisions taken by the United Nations in the Congo during the last eight or nine months.  At the outset I should like to make it clear that I appreciate that the Army authorities and personnel&mdash;every one of them, as far as we can gather&mdash;have behaved in the most exemplary way and that anything I say is not meant to be a criticism of anything they have done because, of course, they are merely the instruments of Government policy and must do what they are told, whether it be right or wrong.</P>
      <P>I should also like to make it clear that any intervention I make or have made here in the past is merely because of my great concern for the fate of the United Nations.  Everybody must know now that the world could be faced with the final cataclysm and that the only shield between us and final annihilation is probably an effective United Nations in which all the peoples of the world should be encouraged to meet, debate and even abuse one another so long as they continue to maintain peace.  We, Deputy McQuillan and myself, are as anxious as anyone to help to see the United Nations continue as an effective instrument in attempting to maintain peace in the world.  We have had the example of the failure of the League of Nations to prevent war in the past and we should learn something from our experiences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope it will be possible for us to get information from the Minister on his actions from time to time in the United Nations.  Due to the continued inexplicable reticence of the Taoiseach on occasions when I have asked questions we have been&mdash;I have been, at any rate&mdash;denied information which I <Col N="854" /> should have liked to have.  There may be reasons for that information being denied but I hope that we shall get it now because we have not had an opportunity of discussing in any great detail this terribly serious and tangled problem since last July.</P>
    <P>As the Leader of the Fine Gael Party points out, the whole pattern of events has taken a particularly dangerous and frightening turn through the decision of the Security Council to accept responsibility for imposing peace by means of force.  It was a shocking decision to have to make and one which I am sure was reached with the greatest possible reluctance.  I am sure it was a decision that the unfortunate Mr. Hammarskjoeld must have been more than reluctant to advise the Security Council to take.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should say that I believe that the total responsibility for any failure in the Congo lies with the United Nations, with the General Assembly and the Security Council and that I think it is unfair to criticise the actions of the Secretary-General.  Like every human being, he has erred from time to time, but effectively, he is merely, as is our Army in the Congo, the instrument of the United Nations policy.  It would be as unfair to blame him for United Nations failures as it would be for a Government Minister to blame a civil servant for his own failure in the operation and control of his Department.</P>
    <P>We are a component part of the United Nations and so we must accept the imposition of collective responsibility. For this reason I should like to criticise the Government decisions that are taken from time to time.  Taking up the point mentioned by Deputy Dillon, I suppose the most important matter now to be considered is the position of our troops in the Congo following the decision to take forceful action to suppress civil war, should it break out.</P>
    <P>I do not share Deputy Dillon's view. Deputy Dillon appears to believe that the present United Nations Force could be used for this purpose.  Taking the vast size of the Congo and the appalling problems of communication, <Col N="855" /> climatic conditions, and lack of administration into consideration, I cannot see how the present United Nations Force, as at present constituted, could be expected to carry out the latest recommendation of the Security Council.  For that reason, I believe a very much more radical approach must be considered.  The radical approach I would suggest is that both the United States and the U.S.S.R. must somehow come to an agreement to send the necessary reinforcements, personnel and equipment, staff and technicians, into the Congo as a United Nations Force under some neutral high command, if possible&mdash;and it must be &ldquo;if possible&rdquo;&mdash;such as India or some other acceptable country.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly&mdash;I shall give the reasons later&mdash;the present forces in the Congo cannot be expected to intervene to prevent civil war.  If they do, they do so at the peril of their very lives and I do not believe our men should be subjected to the intolerable risks involved.  Let them play their part to the extent they can, but the reinforcements necessary will have to come from the Great Powers.  I know the intricacy of the considerations involved in such a proposition, but it now appears that we are dealing with two Heads of State, one of whom is quite clearly completely different from his predecessor.  I refer to the present President of the U.S.A., Mr. Kennedy. As far as one can see, he is anxious to bring the cold war to an end.  Mr. Khrushchev has made many protestations of his anxiety to bring it to an end.  This would seem to me to be an ideal opportunity to call the bluff of both Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Khrushchev.  They may be completely sincere.  I hope they are.</P>
    <P>It seems to me this can be a vital test case.  If the United Nations Organisation fails, it is completely discredited almost before its task has properly begun.  The Suez affair was successful, but it was relatively small. The tasks that lie ahead are limitless because of the continued emergence of the many new former colonial African societies.  It is quite clear, <Col N="856" /> looking at the chaos in the Congo, that there is no one responsible colonial African leader at present fighting for freedom in Africa, who will in the future turn to the United Nations for help, should he have to meet problems such as those which the emergence of the Congolese people has thrown up for them in the past eight or nine months.</P>
    <P>The United Nations has lost the confidence of most of the nations of the world.  That is no consolation and could be no consolation to any responsible person in any country.  I believe that, because of the various actions taken from time to time in the Congo episode, the United Nations has forfeited the regard, the respect and the confidence which that Organisation should have built up in the minds of the people of those nations, in leaders like Nyeri, Aboya, and all these other African leaders who will need help but will not be able to seek it from the United Nations, if the present situation continues.</P>
    <P>It seems to me inexplicable that this situation should have been allowed to develop because it was clearly predictable in practically every single detail. It was predicted by both Deputy McQuillan and myself with our grossly inadequate sources of information.  We predicted the inevitable conflict between the colonial powers refusing to give up willingly, attempting to maintain a foothold in the wealthiest part of the Congo, the Katanga Province, and, while nominally relinquishing power, in fact retaining it.  It was suggested by us last July that the Security Council would eventually come to be dominated by the colonial powers and decisions taken would be taken not in favour of the Congolese but, rather, in favour of the financial interests concerned in the Katanga Province in particular.</P>
    <P>That is precisely what has happened. The three great interests&mdash;the Rockefeller mining interests, Captain Waterhouse, Conservative M.P., actively and acutely interested in copper mining in Katanga, and the Belgian interests&mdash;are all anxious to retain real power in the Congo, financial <Col N="857" /> power and the power to continue to exploit the wealth of the Congolese people for the Belgians, the British and the Americans at the expense of the unfortunate Congolese people.</P>
    <P>It is a criticism of our Government's action in going along with these interests since July last that they should have gone along with them so happily. That is something which seriously perturbs me.  In the beginning, we had a suggestion from the Taoiseach that it was not our business to interfere. Our job, he said, was to send these troops to the Congo to act under the command appointed by the Security Council and it was not for us to question their decisions.  That seemed to me to be absurd.  I said so at the time. Some weeks later, the Taoiseach mended his hand; he said there were certain conditions in which we might protest and express disagreement with decisions taken in the Congo.  Our attitude at the United Nations appears to me to have changed fundamentally and radically since the election of the present President of the United Nations.  I do not know if there is any relation between the two events and the change from the policy of non-commitment, the policy of neutrality <i>vis-à-vis</i> the two powers, Russia, and America, involved in the cold war. The policy of non-commitment created a great measure of goodwill for our country, a measure of respect and high regard in the United Nations and, in particular, amongst the emergent Afro-Asian societies&mdash;a position which I believe we have since sacrificed by our attitude of support for the policy of colonialism in the Congo in the past nine months.</P>
    <P>It was clear in July last that the Belgians intended to partition the Congo. They had appointed their puppet Tshombe, who expressed his fealty on many occasions to the Belgian ruling classes, and presented a wedding present to the King.  He demanded that Belgian troops be allowed to remain in the Congo, and demanded that Belgian troops should reinforce the existing troops in the Congo, and in Katanga in particular.  Since the United Nations went into the Congo, he declared the secession of Katanga, and <Col N="858" /> we made no effective protest at this effective partitioning of the Congo.  In allowing the secession of Katanga, we permitted the removal from the Congo of its whole basic, real mineral wealth. The sole wealth of the Congo is in Katanga&mdash;the main wealth is certainly there.  We, above all people, it seemed to me, should have protested and protested again until it was made quite clear to Tshombe that he would not be allowed to carry out the partitioning of the Congo on the same lines as we have suffered here for the past 40 years.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me that that was the first occasion on which the United Nations failed.  They asked for the removal of Belgian troops from Katanga, and Belgian troops not only remained there from that time to this day, but reinforcements have been continually built up.  Equipment, ammunition, personnel, aircraft and advisers of all kinds have been allowed to percolate into Katanga.  Every bandit, brigand and highway-robber, every no-good from South Africa, from our own country, from Great Britain, from Belgium, gangsters of one kind or another, every freelance soldier who thinks there is something laudable in killing, all have been allowed to swell the forces of Tshombe and Mobutu.</P>
    <P>Those reinforcements have gone on continuously and no effective effort has been made to stop them.  Now, in the heel of the hunt, when these armies are properly and fully armed, highly trained and well equipped, led by vicious Belgian paratrooper officer cadres, having been handed a machine gun, as a result of vacillation, equivocation and failure to take positive action, our unfortunate boys and officers are told to go and take that machine gun from them.  That is the predicament in which we have now placed our troops.</P>
    <P>It is no good saying that the Belgians were requested to leave Katanga, or that protests were made against the building up of a force in Katanga.  If it was possible to take forcible action the day before yesterday, or to decide to take action, it was possible to take that action seven or eight months ago.  When Tshombe cocked a snook at the United Nations, <Col N="859" /> that was the time the United Nations should have acted and prevented the present appalling drift into civil war and anarchy.</P>
    <P>I know of no single decision by our Government to protest at that, in spite of the fact that our job was to attempt to establish and maintain law and order, to establish an effective administration and civil service and to organise some form of Parliamentary Government or democracy.  I cannot see that any effective action was taken by the Security Council of the United Nations or our Government to protest against the deposing of the very man who asked the United Nations into the Congo, Mr. Lumumba.  I do not know anything about the personal merits of the man, but if words have any meaning, this man was the Premier of the Congo.  He was elected by an adult universal suffrage, with the largest single Party in the Congo.  He was elected Premier by the House of Representatives and the Senate and ratified in that position after his illegal deposition by Kasavubu.</P>
    <P>Our purpose was apparently to establish and maintain law and order, and while we were doing that, the Premier of the Congo was taken, locked up and kept in prison, and the United Nations sat by and twiddled their thumbs.  No; they did not twiddle their thumbs.  While he was free, they refused permission to the Premier of the Congo to broadcast to the people.  They closed the radio station and put a young English soldier in charge of it with orders to shoot him&mdash;to shoot the Premier of the Congo.  Think of it&mdash;to shoot President de Valera or Deputy Costello or the Taoiseach, if he went down to Radio Éireann to use the station.  The order was to shoot Mr. Lumumba if he tried to use his own radio station&mdash;and what did we do? Our people, and particularly our Minister with his own fine record in this whole struggle of anti-colonialism &mdash;what did we do to help this man in his hour of need?  We stood by and made no protest of which I am aware. They locked him up: they locked up <Col N="860" /> the Premier of the Congo.  They dissolved Parliament and suspended parliamentary immunity.</P>

      <P>All this was carried out by Mr. Kasavubu, who has been described by the President of the United States, Mr. Kennedy, as the puppet of the American Intelligence Service.  That is who he is&mdash;a puppet of the American Intelligence Service. We stood by and the United Nations stood by, and we twiddled our thumbs and went to the Waldorf-Astoria and ran up bills to the tune of £1,900 for entertainment and drank our champagne&mdash;and Lumumba languished in jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The order was countersigned by Mr. Ileo.  He had never been given the power to countersign this order and consequently the order was illegal.  Mr. Lumumba was illegally imprisoned and we stood by.  We stood by while we knew quite well that the forces of the new dictator, Mobutu, Kasavubu's nominee&mdash; Mobutu, the army general&mdash;were being paid for by the Eisenhower Administration.  We continued to wash our hands of the problem when eventually they delivered Mr. <Col N="861" /> Lumumba to Tshombe, and, when they did that, they signed Mr. Lumumba's death warrant.</P>
    <P>In November last, I believed Mr. Lumumba would not survive that imprisonment and said so in this House. It was quite clear that they had to get rid of Mr. Lumumba, if they were to discharge their responsibilities as puppets to the puppet masters in Belgium, America and Great Britain.  In time, they did kill Mr. Lumumba&mdash;and all the time we stood by and let this go on.</P>
    <P>I believe our behaviour in this whole thing is out of character with the Minister's personal behaviour in the past. I believe he was frightened (1) by the campaign carried on against him for his decision in relation to Peking, China, by the Fine Gael Opposition and (2) by the fact that, owing to the vicious and unscrupulous activities of our national newspapers, the Premier of the Congo was smeared as a Communist, because, when the West failed to help him, he turned to Russia.  So, in the eyes of the West, no matter what his merits, no matter who elected him, no matter how democratic a Prime Minister he might be, he became an untouchable&mdash;and Deputy Aiken continued to side with the Americans, the British and the Belgians.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to read of the unfortunate man the other day that when he was getting the bullet in the back of his head from the Belgian officer, he was on his knees saying his last prayers &mdash;this &ldquo;Communist&rdquo;.  At least, they accorded him that right&mdash;and, of course, our Press did smear him.  Pro-Lumumba men raped nuns; pro-Lumumba men killed the priests; pro-Lumumba men did all the deeds of arson, pillage and village burning, according to our national newspapers&mdash; I suppose the basic idea being that Catholic Belgium could do no wrong. Casement told us what Catholic Belgium was doing 40 years ago and nobody has refuted it since.</P>
    <P>It was only after the death of Mr. Lumumba that the <i>Irish Independent</i> came out with their editorial in which they talked about Mr. Lumumba, the legal head of the Congo.  Up to that, he was a terrorist, <Col N="862" /> an anarchist, a Communist and a trouble-maker.  What surprises me and disappoints me is that there is not a single worthwhile Minister on the Fianna Fáil Front Bench or among the older generation on their back benches who, in his own time, was not called a trouble-maker, anarchist and communist.  &ldquo;Shaking hands with murder&rdquo;.  All these and other epithets were thrown at them by the same murky Press 40 years ago.  It surprises me that they should have forgotten so quickly, that they should not have stood by this man going through his Gethsemane as they did 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>Now we are seeing who is the friend of U.N.O. Mr. Lumumba asked U.N.O. into the Congo.  Tshombe refused to have them.  Ileo is now refusing to have them.  They are threatening to go to war with them, if they send in their troops.  These are the people we spent nine months bolstering up, equipping and staffing their armies.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note we are not going to recognise the Government of Mr. Gizenga, the deputy leader of the Lumumba Party.  The only positive act I know we have done in the United Nations is to refuse to condone the decision of the Belgian, American and British Governments in insisting on seating the Kasavubu delegation at the United Nations.  On that, again, we looked for another basin of water and the Minister calmly washed his hands. He abstained from the vote&mdash;knowing that Kasavubu had no legal right, while Lumumba was alive and legal Premier of the Congo, to nominate a member to the United Nations.  We stood aside on that occasion, as we had stood aside on so many occasions.</P>
    <P>We have now the position where Mr. Lumumba and a number of his Ministers have been executed, while prisoners, some of them without trial, and some of them alleged to have had trials.  Probably the most bitter irony of all is&mdash;and I was interested to read an editorial in one of our papers the other day criticising them for killing their prisoners, criticising them as &ldquo;savages&rdquo; or some word of that kind for so <Col N="863" /> doing&mdash;that they tell us that, in doing this, they are merely doing what we did, what the British and the Americans did after the last war when they killed the German and Japanese prisoners whom they took.  Of course, we are the last people to pass any judgment when it comes to killing prisoners without trial.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach attempted to give the impression here that the decisions of the United Nations High Command were in some way sacrosanct and could not be protested against or queried by us, that we were inviolably committed to any action or decision they might take.  That was rubbish, and I said so at the time.  The Taoiseach changed his view to some extent after it was proved to be rubbish by the fact that the United Arab Republic, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Malaya, Burma and, to a certain extent, India, all protested in varying degrees against these decisions and in particular against the decision to continue to imprison Mr. Lumumba, the properly elected Premier of the Congo. When they saw their protests were ineffectual and clearly had no influence in changing the decisions of the United Nations in the Security Council, they took the only decision which, it seems to me, was open to them&mdash;to refuse to condone these flagrant violations of the rule of law in the Congo by retaining their troops there.  They withdrew their troops in an attempt to bring the Security Council to its senses.  They did not succeed in doing that until a couple of days ago.</P>
    <P>What did we do?  We scabbed, we blacklegged on the Afro-Asian countries. We refused to support them in that effective protest&mdash;effective because it worked the other day.  The white nations realised that they could not control the Congo, that they had not a hope of controlling the Congo without the support of the majority of their Afro-Asian colleagues.  Therefore, they were brought to their senses by this decision.  But we were not a party to that decision.  As far as I know, we disapproved of it.  Once again, we, the great, ancient nation, fighting against colonialism for 700 years, sided with <Col N="864" /> the colonialists&mdash;America, Britain and Belgium, the Rockefellers, the Waterhouses and the mining interests in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The net result of our intervention and decisions in the Congo has been that we have betrayed the unfortunate man who invited us in to help, Mr. Lumumba.  We have betrayed the Congolese people to the various financial interests now dominating the Congo.  We have permitted partition of the Congo.  We have permitted the murderous and traitorous Tshombe to go on re-arming his forces and establishing a position which is going to be nearly impossible to question, both from the military point of view and the political point of view, in the partitioned province of Katanga. Most important of all, we have betrayed&mdash;we have effectively played our part in it, at any rate&mdash;the hopes of the world in the United Nations, that it might become a force which would ultimately lead to some kind of world government and prevent this apparent, inescapable and inevitable drift to war.  For these reasons, I move to refer the Vote back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made it abundantly clear that we support the efforts which have been made by the United Nations force in the Congo to restore order.  When this country first sent a contingent to the Congo it was expressely done for the purpose of restoring order, preventing civil war and establishing peace.  During the last eight months this country has played its part in that operation.  We have, so far as our resources permit, played a useful and constructive role in the efforts to maintain peace and to prevent civil war.</P>

    <P>The responsibilities which we undertook were taken in accordance with the directive of the United Nations. The task which was assigned to the United Nations Force there was not an easy one.  Initially, when the decision was arrived at, it was well known that the duties and responsibilities which would fall to be discharged by that Force might tax to the very limit the resources, the <Col N="865" /> patience and the ingenuity of those responsible for its direction.  Since then considerable changes in the position have taken place, many of them anticipated, some of them unexpected, but all indicating that the original conception which recognised that the problem was a complex one was a correct assessment.</P>
    <P>The recent decision of the United Nations Security Council that force may be used to maintain order is, in my view, a hopeful sign and a definite indication that the United Nations are prepared to take action.  But, having taken that decision, the equally important assignment which the United Nations must accept is to provide adequate forces properly and effectively equipped.  It does not require much knowledge of history or experience of conditions elsewhere to realise that there is nothing more futile than accepting the responsibility for establishing order and not providing those responsible for maintaining order with the forces necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>We are most anxious that the assignment accepted by the Irish troops and also the assignment accepted by the present Commander of the United Nations forces in the Congo should be capable of fulfilment. If the United Nations forces are to be effective there, they must have adequate numbers of troops and they must be properly and effectively equipped to discharge the task they have undertaken.</P>
    <P>The information available about the very complex situation there is inadequate to enable one to express opinions on the various problems which arise.  Similarly, the scope of the territory, the extent of the area which has to be covered, of itself involves difficulties and creates problems which a force similar in size would not be faced with elsewhere. But it is important that, having accepted these responsibilities, the United Nations should provide adequate forces and equip them with the necessary military and other equipment, such as transport, etc., to undertake the task assigned to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> The recent decision of the United Nations appears to be a practical decision&mdash;a decision that should have been taken earlier but, recognising the very nature of the United Nations, when we look at the various interests represented there, it might have been too much to expect that a decision such as the recent decision would have been taken in advance, more especially when so many interests are seeking to defeat the objective of the United Nations and in particular the use on many occasions of the Russian veto to block action when action was necessary.</P>
    <P>I believe that the policy we have adopted in this matter and generally the independent line that we have taken in the United Nations, have reflected credit on this country and have been in accordance with our history and our attitude in international affairs generally.  It is not true to suggest that this country was ever neutral <i>vis-á-vis</i> the situation as between the United States and Soviet Russia.  Our future, the future of everything we value, is indissolubly bound up with the free countries of the world, with the United States, Canada and Western Europe.  We have taken an independent line on many issues and we have endeavoured to play a constructive, useful and helpful rôle in the various problems that have presented themselves in the United Nations and before other international bodies of which this country is a member.  As to the suggestion that this country was neutral in the great issues which divide the world ideologically or otherwise, this country has repeatedly made it clear that we value the part which the United States, Canada and Western Europe have played in defending the free world and the beliefs which we hold dear and which we believe are essential if mankind is to live in the way in which not alone many in this country but many people throughout the world aspire to live by playing the part we have played in the effort to establish and maintain peace in the Congo.</P>
    <P>We have undoubtedly assumed responsibility and assumed a rôle that is different from any we have adopted or had to accept previously but we <Col N="867" /> have undertaken our duties there on the basis of the directive taken by the United Nations initially when the Force was sent in there.  It was one of the weaknesses of that directive that in many respects it was vague. As I say, the very nature of the organisation probably prevented a more definite directive at that time.  The recent decision is, in my view, an obvious sign and an indication that the United Nations recognise that if the Congo effort is not to end in failure and if an extension of the existing chaotic conditions in many parts is not to increase, the method to prevent it is to employ force in order to do so.  We believe that if that is to be done, the United Nations Commander there should have adequate forces at his disposal and that those forces should be properly and effectively equipped to discharge the responsibilities which they have undertaken.</P>
    <P>The part which this country is playing is an indication of our desire to make our contribution to the United Nations effort in that direction.  I hope that, if opportunity offers, this country will endeavour to secure the necessary financial response from other members of the United Nations who are in arrears with their contributions. Some time ago, a table was published which showed the arrears in respect of contributions to the United Nations. I hope that, should an opportunity offer, we will make it clear that if the United Nations is to continue as an effective organisation, it is an inescapable obligation of member countries to pay their contributions.</P>
    <P>As evidence of our desire to render what assistance we can as expeditiously as possible, the Minister said it is proposed on this occasion to pay the contribution at an earlier date. That in itself is an indication of the desire and anxiety of this country to contribute as reasonably as possible from its resources to the work of the United Nations and, in particular, the force at present operating under United Nations auspices in the Congo.  In so far as that is concerned, we are in favour of this proposal and believe <Col N="868" /> that the measures which have been taken should have our full support and co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be very careful in speaking on this Congo situation that we do not follow the lead of Deputy Dr. Browne and indulge in gross over-simplification, to put it very mildly.  Deputy Dr. Browne has used a number of clichés which are quite unjustifiable in this connection.  In addition, in his tirade this morning, he made the most vicious attacks on &ldquo;them&rdquo;.  I intervened at one stage to try to find out who &ldquo;they&rdquo; were, but it appears that those whom he described as &ldquo;they&rdquo; are rather hard to identify.  In his mind, however, &ldquo;they&rdquo; are always wrong; &ldquo;they&rdquo; do the most impossibly wicked things; and &ldquo;they&rdquo; are being supported by us.</P>
      <P>As a commentary on a chaotic situation, I find that less than helpful.  It does appear to be established that the difficulty of the United Nations has been to find out what the actual facts were or are now.  Yet Deputy Dr. Browne refers to the break-down of the rule of law in the Congo as if in fact the rule of law had ever been properly established, which is at least far from definite.  My personal opinion is that the new independent government of the Congo never established the rule of law at all because it was faced with a situation which was far too difficult for it to cope with.  The fact that it was not able to deal properly with the situation is not really a reflection on those who formed that Government; it is simply due to the fact that the country was not properly prepared for independence and that in fact the country was not a unit at all, in the political sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne refers to the Congo as if it were an ancient and historic nation, quite overlooking the fact that the territory which used to be known as the Belgian Congo was simply a large tract of Africa which fell into the hands of the King of the Belgians in his personal capacity.  That certainly was colonialism in the very worst sense.  But, at no time has there <Col N="869" /> been a united Congolese nation. There has been general resistance and opposition to Belgian colonialism over that whole area.  The situation was that the new Government which was set up rather shakily lost control and began to disintegrate.</P>
    <P>We got a tremendous denunciation of the sin of partition from Deputy Dr. Browne this morning.  I honestly do not know whether Deputy Dr. Browne really believes that the Congo was an historic nation which has now been partitioned by industrialists.  He may and, if so, his simple mind is even more simple than I thought it was.</P>
    <P>I admit, of course, that there are very large business interests in the Congo, particularly in the Katanga Province, but that is a matter which will have to be dealt with quite separately from the general political situation and I hope the United Nations will deal with it in due course.  To say that it is a crime against the united Congolese people for the people of Katanga to cut themselves off from other areas is again a gross over-simplification.</P>
    <P>The Government have been castigated for their support of colonialists and colonial powers.  Here, again, Deputy Dr. Browne used this phrase purely as a term of abuse.  He should be more careful and should try to define his terms.  He refers to Belgium, Great Britain and America jointly as the colonial powers.  What an odd trinity of nations to be grouped together in this way!  He blames these three nations entirely for the lack of decision in the United Nations and claims that our Government have supported these three nations all the time.</P>
    <P>It is so easy to make such accusations but it was noteworthy that the Deputy was able to produce no evidence whatever to support his allegation. Not only that, but he completely overlooked the fact that the main difficulty faced by the United Nations has been that the Soviet bloc has consistently acted to block and discredit the whole Congo operation.  Not only has it used its voting strength, but it has used financial pressure by failing to pay its dues to the United Nations, <Col N="870" /> thereby trying to force the United Nations to abandon the operation.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that when the Soviet bloc uses financial pressure, it is acting justifiably, but if Belgium uses financial pressure, it is acting as a brutal colonial power.  It all comes down to what is a fact in Deputy Dr. Browne's mind, that the Left is always right.  There, again, we have this gross over-simplification.</P>
    <P>Time and again when the United Nations, both in the Assembly and the Security Council, were on the point of making a strong decision which would have a real chance of successfully dealing with the chaos in the Congo, it has been the Soviet bloc which has prevented it.  That cannot be questioned.  In his childish simplicity, Deputy Dr. Browne now suggests that the Soviet and the United States of America should join in sending troops into the Congo.  If the Deputy can believe that that would be successful, he would believe anything.  I honestly believe that he would believe that, because he even believes that the Minister has been terrorised by Fine Gael on the question of the debate on China at the United Nations.  I think he is capable of believing both those things.  I can assure him that his belief in each case is without foundation.</P>
    <P>The greatest risk which has existed so far in the Congo is that one or other of the Great Powers should become actively involved there.  It has been the great hope of Russia that they would be able to take the initiative and get a grip on the whole situation for their own needs.  Here, again, this effort by Russia which is still being made is not seen by Deputy Dr. Browne as colonialism, although of course that is what it is and the Soviet is, of course, the greatest colonial power in the world at present.</P>
    <P>Even if that were its only success, the United Nations deserve the greatest credit for having avoided the intervention of the Great Powers in this situation and I hope the United Nations will continue to do that, because the dispatch of troops by any of the major powers into the Congo could  <Col N="871" /> only in further deterioration of the situation.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am very proud of the attitude which our Government have taken in this matter.  They have acted courageously and with foresight. Above all, I am proud that we have not attempted to bring pressure to bear on the Security Council in the way that some of the Middle Eastern countries have done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne insists that we should protest and bring pressure to bear whenever we object to something being done.  To my mind, that is not the way in which a loyal member of the United Nations should behave. We have tried in every conceivable way to influence the voting in the United Nations, but where the voting has gone against us, we have loyally accepted the decision.  It is only when nations are prepared to accept a majority vote against them that there will be any chance of establishing an international rule of law.  It is very much to our credit that even though that vote went against our wishes, there was never any suggestion that our troops should be withdrawn.  We have taken our stand as a loyal member and I hope we shall maintain it.</P>
    <P>The criticism that has been expressed that we have sided with colonialist powers has not been substantiated and should not have been made.  I hope that even at this stage Deputy Dr. Browne will have more consideration for our lads who are in the Congo at the moment and will not try to inflame the situation even more than it has been inflamed already.  We can easily inflame the situation by taking sides and making irresponsible decisions as to who is right and who is wrong.  There is so much in the Congo which is unknown that no decision has commended itself to anyone except Deputy Dr. Browne.  A decision in such a case is never a decision quite clearly between absolute right and absolute wrong, between absolute good and absolute evil.  Very often one has to take the lesser of two evils.</P>
    <P>In that complex situation, we have <Col N="872" /> acted with courage and determination. I only hope that our action now in making our payment in advance, as it were, in discharge of our financial obligations to the United Nations will in itself be an example to others so that they may see that, even though they may be greater in power than we are, they are failing in loyalty where we have not failed.</P>
    <P>In every instance, our Government have set an example which is supported by the great majority of our people and I hope that the resolution of the Government to continue along those lines will not be shaken by subsequent events even in the Congo.  We are probably facing a very difficult situation there in which our men will almost certainly be involved.  Let us not only pray for them but let us give our support to them and to the Organisation which they are serving. If we do that, we shall be doing something of value to many people, apart from ourselves.  Unless Deputy Dr. Browne can speak in a more responsible way, more coolly and with greater regard for the facts, it would be better if he kept silent.</P>

      <P>It was obvious when we joined the United Nations that we would have to accept full responsibility in any situation that presented itself.  Therefore, it does not surprise me that the Minister has to come to the House with a Supplementary Estimate to meet the extra cost his Department will incur in the Congo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Congo situation is probably one of the most difficult that have faced the world since the advent of the United Nations as a controlling force in world affairs.  In the first instance, we have to consider the Congo is composed of <Col N="873" /> several nations and any political unity that was achieved within that country was achieved very much as a makeshift at the last moment in a united effort to obtain independence.  We in Ireland can appreciate and understand that.  The difficulty in the Congo was that so soon as they had achieved that for which they had set themselves out to fight, politically and in every other way at their command, there was a division among the nationalist ranks in the Congo.  That is very easily explained by the fact that there is the rich Katanga province and also that within the geographical confines of the Congo there is one of the richest mineral belts in the world containing uranium for which many people are looking nowadays.  What then transpired was that the makeshift unity or the unity that they hoped to achieve and maintain became disunity.  The sudden departure of the Belgians who appeared to me to have panicked somewhat, to have left sooner than they might have done without setting up all the normal machinery of government, created a situation in which there was virtually no central Government functioning.</P>
    <P>As I know the position, in those circumstances the United Nations were invited to go to the Congo by the then leader of the Congolese Parliament who, I regret to say, is since dead.  Ireland as a member of the United Nations was bound to answer that call and I understand that the Secretary-General of the United Nations specifically and deliberately asked for Irish troops as we were a European power entirely devoid of colonialism; we ourselves had sought the right to govern ourselves and never sought to impose our mandate on anyone else. For that reason the Swedes were also asked to go into the Congo as a neutral power, a power that was not in N.A.T.O., and with them many of the other African and Asian countries.</P>
    <P>The situation was a confused and difficult one; in fact it was almost an impossible situation.  The question was: were the United Nations to go in and endeavour to establish law and order or were they to fail to answer the call and let the Congo sink into <Col N="874" /> chaos?  Make no mistake about this, that with all these rich deposits so vital to the chemical advances of today, if the United Nations had not acted as they did, the Soviet Union would have gone in there.  From some people's point of view that might be desirable but I do not think that is a point of view that would be accepted in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne suggested&mdash;and I accept that he is sincere in his beliefs although I do not agree with him at all&mdash;that there should be a rapprochement between the President of the United States and Mr. Khrushchev, that they should combine and send a united force to the Congo to restore law and order.  He also indicated that there was a new look in Russia.  I do not think he categorically said that&mdash; I want to be fair to him&mdash;but he believed there was a new look there on account of the recent remarks of Khrushchev.  Of course, one must always judge international Powers by deeds rather than by words.  One of Mr. Khrushchev's deeds recently has been to take off his shoe, hammer on the table at the United Nations and try to turn it into a rough-house.  He did not succeed in doing what he thought he would succeed in doing, in uniting the Afro-Asian Nations behind him.</P>
    <P>Another of his deeds was that when there was to be a Summit Conference he behaved in what I consider, from the point of view of political politeness, to be an outrageous fashion.  His argument was that he would have nothing to do with ex-President Eisenhower.  Now everything is sunshine again.  There is a new President and a new look.  Is Deputy Dr. Browne gullible enough to believe that the two Great Powers should go into the Congo with forces to settle the question? Anybody who knows anything about the Afro-Asian groups, anybody who knows anything about the emergent nations who were once colonised knows that they do not wish to embroil themselves in any way in the rivalry that exists between the two big Powers.  That has been categorically stated by leaders of the different countries and for that reason the suggestion <Col N="875" /> that those two Great Powers should enter the Congo seems to me to be nothing short of ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Our position is that we have gone to the Congo.  Our forces in the Congo have lived up to the traditions of Irishmen who have fought and served all over the world.  Our troops are trying there to carry out the mandate of the United Nations.  The world has sufficient confidence in Ireland, small though we are, to ask one of our soldiers to be the leader of the United Nations force in the Congo.  At the moment an Irishman presides over the United Nations.  We have a lot to contribute to the world.  We have proved so far by acting as any responsible Government would act, that we shall answer the call when necessary, that we shall play our part in securing that the world will be spared the holocaust of another war.</P>
    <P>Our policy must be to stand or fall by the United Nations.  At present nobody knows what the outcome will be in international politics.  We can only hope and pray that the United Nations will stay in the Congo and that they will establish law and order there.  We can only hope that they will not be called upon to use physical force to defend life and liberty, but if they have to, it is their duty to do so. It is their duty to protect those they are sent to protect.  I might add in conclusion that the attempt on behalf of the Soviet bloc to discredit the United Nations has failed among the very people with whom they thought they would be successful, the Afro-Asian nations.  Furthermore, it has failed among nations who are French speaking in the main and who were well able, through that language, to discuss the facts fully among themselves. Their vote the other day upheld the attitude of the United Nations and I am glad to stand up in Dáil Éireann and support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks will be brief and will not be detailed in respect of this Supplementary Estimate. In the ordinary course, I would not expect the Minister for External <Col N="876" /> Affairs to make a long statement with regard to the United Nations and in particular with regard to the Congo affair but in view of the fact that the situation seems to be so serious, in view of the fact that events in the Congo are moving very swiftly, the time is long overdue for the Minister for External Affairs to make a comprehensive statement on certain matters.</P>
      <P>It is about eight or nine months since the Taoiseach introduced a measure to this House to provide for military assistance from this country for the preservation of peace in the Congo.  We have had two contributions, I think, from the Taoiseach; we have had contributions from the Minister for Defence; and we have had discussions on the military implications of our intervention in the Congo on the various stages of the Bills which the Minister for Defence introduced.  Our obligations and responsibilities, so far as military assistance is concerned, seem pretty clear. We are members of U.N.O. and I hope we are fulfilling and shall always fulfil our obigations and live up to our responsibilities as members.</P>
      <P>We assist when required; there is no question of our being directed by the United Nations to provide a force of a certain size, but I think we should be acting contrary to the spirit of U.N.O. if we refused a request to provide assistance in the form of military personnel to go to a particular place to assist in the preservation of world peace.  But it is time we heard something about the political implications in the Congo&mdash;and there are such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not pretend to have as much detailed information as Deputy Dr. Browne or Deputy Booth but I am sure the Minister has information that the members of the House and the public have not got.  If we were to consider the political implications in the Congo on the information we get in the Press or in any of the magazines&mdash;usually either British or American&mdash;we should be, as we are, very confused about the whole situation. I think the Government have <Col N="877" /> been failing in their duty in not having the Minister for External Affairs make a statement in the House.  I may be doing him an injustice but my memory is that this is the first time since last July that the Government presented the Minister with an opportunity to make such a statement.</P>
    <P>We have, and we accept, certain responsibilities and obligations as members of the United Nations in the matter of contributing military forces to the Congo but I do not believe it is sufficient merely to leave it at that. We must know where we are going and what we are doing.  The Minister should tell us whether or not, in his opinion, the use of all soldiers in the Congo is directed&mdash;so to speak&mdash;in the right way.  It seems now from reports we get that the onus of preventing civil war is on the Supreme Commander of the United Nations Forces in the Congo.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Commander, after all, is not a politician, nor is he expected to be one.  Are his orders merely to prevent civil war?  How do outside nations prevent civil war?  It seems to me and to many people that there is an effort to support the secession of the Katanga province from the rest of the Congo.  Deputy Booth seems to justify that when he says that the Congo cannot be be regarded as a country in the sense that Ireland, Britain, Germany, France or Spain are countries, that it is just a vast area of land.</P>
    <P>I do not like to be party to supporting a division of what we now know as the Congo.  It seems to smell of the situation we have in Ireland now, the situation created in 1922 when the division of the country into the six Counties and the Republic took place. If the mission of the forces in the Congo is merely to maintain peace at any price, a temporary peace, I do not think we should subscribe to that. Again, if it means the division of the Congo into a Katanga province and the rest, I believe such a decision should not be left to the rulers or the junta of the Katanga province: it should be a decision by all the Congolese people.  Are we supporting that <Col N="878" /> view in the United Nations?  If it is the wish of all the Congolese people to have this type or that type of government or a federal government, if it is their wish that the Katanga province should establish its own government and secede from the rest of the Congo, that is all right with me, but it is not good enough that all we should be told is that our forces are there in the Congo merely for the preservation of peace or the prevention of civil war.</P>
    <P>It must be a difficult situation for the Supreme Commander&mdash;in this case he happens to be an Irishman&mdash;to go in there merely with those directions. He is not a diplomat and does not pretend to be one.  He was not appointed as such.  He is not a politician. Is he expected to deal with all the political implications existing in the Congo?  I ask these questions because we do not know the answers. The Minister has not taken the opportunity over the past seven or eight months to make any statement on the Congo situation.  As a matter of fact, the Minister has been absent from the country on United Nations business for 95 days and therefore, having spent so much time in the United Nations, he must be fully aware of everything that has happened.  Certainly he must have made up his mind as to what course he would pursue in regard to the political implications, considerations and questions that are bound up with the Congo situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to pursue this; I asked the Minister about representation in the United Nations.  Up to now, Mr. Boland, who is president of the Assembly, was our chief delegate.  Has the Minister for External Affairs substituted for him?  I should like to ask if it is necessary for the Minister &mdash;who has always been regarded as a senior Minister, not so much because of the Ministry he occupies but because of the person he is&mdash;to stay away from this country, of whose Government he is a member, for 95 days?  I am not criticising the expenditure involved because whether it was the Minister or some high-ranking civil servant, the cost would be approximately the same, but I wonder if other <Col N="879" /> member-countries of the United Nations find it necessary to send the political head of a Department, their Foreign Secretary, Minister for External Affairs or whatever he may be called, to the United Nations as a delegate?  I think the Minister should clear that up and let us know whether he is now the chief Irish delegate to the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Any criticism made here is, in my opinion, understandable.  Deputy Dr. Browne has posed a number of questions. People want the answers to those questions and I wonder if, from that point of view, the Government should not consider the establishment of a foreign affairs committee representative of all the political Parties in this House.  Everybody will agree that it is desirable that we should have an agreed foreign policy.  We cannot have that so long as we get little or no information from the principal Government spokesman. Such a committee may not have been necessary in the past but, with the establishment of the United Nations Organisation and our membership of it, and the problems that are cropping up from time to time in connection with that Organisation, it is highly desirable that such a committee should be established now.  It may be protested that the pursuance of foreign policy is the business of the Government, but we have quite a number of examples of such committees being established in other countries with, as far as I know, complete success.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Government may argue that the framing and pursuit of foreign policy are matters for the Government.  As far as the Congo is concerned, we are all involved.  We are all concerned that the good name of our country should be maintained. We are concerned to ensure that we shall pursue a policy which will not smack, or appear to smack, of support for colonialism.  We are concerned that the policy our Government pursues in the United Nations is a policy which will not antagonise the African Continent and people who <Col N="880" /> have always shown themselves sympathetic towards the aspirations of the Irish nation.  Some damage in that direction may already have been done so far as the Congo is concerned and, if we do not mend our hand, we, and indeed the world, may be faced with a very precarious situation.  Such a situation may arise if United Nations intervention is called for in Northern and Southern Rhodesia.  The situation will be just as complicated and intricate as the Congo situation now is.</P>
    <P>There are differences between Northern and Southern Rhodesia; there are differences of opinion between the two main parties in Britain. The Minister should, therefore, take this opportunity&mdash;it is the first offered to him&mdash;to give us a comprehensive statement on the attitude of the Government towards the Congo, towards the general question of military intervention by the United Nations and, above all, render an account of his own stewardship in the United Nations where he appeared to be the chief delegate for this country from September of last year until January of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>After the passage of some eight or nine months, since Irish troops took on the assignment in which they have gained such credit in the Congo, there is now one thing clear; the decision of the United Nations was to confine army personnel in the Congo to non-committed nations such as ours.  If they have not succeeded in their ambition there as well as we would desire, that lack of success may be attributed to the fact that the U.S.S.R. has maintained a constant political, if not military, intervention directed towards discouraging neutral nations playing their part to the utmost of their ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of the non-committed nations should have been as closely, if not more closely, concerned in the outcome to the Congo as Ireland.  It is most discouraging, therefore, to note the casualness with which some of these nations withdrew their contingents in response to political pressure from outside.  I view with consternation <Col N="881" /> the proposal of Deputy Dr. Browne to substitute joint U.S.-Russian forces in place of the forces of the non-committed nations.  That proposal shows the despairing attitude there is now in regard to any possibility of obtaining from the non-committed nations a properly responsible reaction.  Surely they should be just as much alive to the situation as we are.  If they are, surely they should provide the forces and materials necessary, as outlined by Deputy Dillon, so absolutely essential to augment our forces.  If our Irish troops are to continue in their worthy effort the Minister must make every effort to ensure that they are augmented as quickly as possible to the strength which will permit them to deal effectively with the colossal problem that exists.</P>
    <P>I do not entirely agree with Deputy Corish's comments relating to the political entity known as the Congo. The situation in Africa is peculiarly different; Africa is a combination of tribes existing in a country carved up by colonialism with very little regard to the ethnic character of the people. For generations they have been dealt with exclusively on the basis of tribal affiliations rather than as an individual constituted nation.  There is very grave danger that a political problem will arise there which will take a great deal of effort and thought to solve. Federation should be given due consideration.</P>
    <P>Recent reports give some hope inasmuch as the people in the area are now directing their attention towards some measure of mutual understanding.  The immediate problem that exists at the moment is one which concerns us deeply.  I hope that the Minister will give us some information regarding the intention of the Government to ensure that the Irish contingent will be augmented as quickly as possible with sufficient men and material to ensure that the mighty task they have undertaken will be dealt with adequately and without creating undue danger for the Irish forces in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>We all appreciate the fact that the Government have a difficult situation on hands.  I should not <Col N="882" /> like to contribute in any way towards increasing that difficulty or making the position more awkward.  None of us here is an expert on the Congo situation. I am sure most of us will admit that our knowledge is gained mainly from newspaper accounts, accounts which cannot be regarded by the widest stretch of imagination as either completely accurate or non-partisan.  For that reason, we should be slow to pronounce judgment or suggest solutions for what is a very difficult and delicate problem.  Our main concern&mdash;it is implicit in the contributions here today&mdash;is for our own troops in the Congo, troops who have been drawn from practically every constituency in the country.  If we appear to the Minister to be frustrating or difficult in our attitude, I think he will understand that we have a very human approach to this problem.</P>
      <P>At the outset, the Taoiseach introduced a measure to send our first troops abroad last July, and he received the wholehearted support of the House. Deputies of all political Parties supported it and wished this first effort of ours, in sending our own troops abroad in their own uniforms, every possible success.  Since then, a radical change has taken place in the duties of the United Nations Forces in the Congo. That change has caused the sense of uneasiness which was evident in the House this morning.</P>
      <P>Originally, the Taoiseach described the duties of the United Nations Force as police duties for the preservation of peace in the Congo.  Within the past few days, the Security Council decided that the United Nations Force may now use force in order to prevent civil war.  In other words, what was originally to be a police operation could now become a military operation.  To a layman's eye, that appears to raise problems of a far different nature from those originally anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other Deputies have said, the main question that concerns us, in the light of this new development, is: will the forces at the disposal of the United Nations now have the requisite personnel and material to carry out that task?  The Minister has not told us the Government's view in that connection, <Col N="883" /> and I hope, with other Deputies, that when he comes to reply, he will tell us the Government's considered opinion.  As I said a few moments ago, we have not got information at our disposal to enable us to form an accurate balanced judgement of the situation.  We must rely on the Government, through the Minister, telling us their assessment of the situation in the light of the information at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The question of the financial contribution is a very secondary issue.  If that were the only consideration, this Supplementary Estimate would have been passed through the House in a matter of a few moments this morning. The situation in the Congo appears to be even more bedevilled, now that several of the Congo political leaders have themselves repudiated the United Nations Force there and have called on the United Nations to withdraw all foreign troops from the Congo.  Again that adds to the difficulties of the situation and, to my mind, makes it all the more urgent that sufficient personnel, resources, materials, arms, etc., are available, if we agree with the United Nations policy of preventing civil war in the Congo.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, of course, Russia and her allies are using every opportunity to make the situation more difficult than it is.  One of the great powers which, with its apparent interest in human suffering and misery outside its own territory all over the world, one would naturally think would be the first to step in and assist in preserving peace and freedom in the Congo, is actively using the situation to make the position even more difficult than it is.  I think criticism of Russia for seeking to break up the United Nations through their activities in the Congo is receiving more and more support every day.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Congo is not a nation but a collection of tribes, a territory which fell into the hands of a former Belgian monarch.  There is some substance in that statement, but I suppose if we went back far enough, we would find that every <Col N="884" /> nation emerged from that condition at one time or another.  The fact remains that the Congo is an existing entity and has been for 60 or 70 years.  Irrespective of any criticism we may make about the Belgian financial interests which waxed so rich out of the rich resources of the Congo, the fact remains that the situation is as it is and it is our duty, and the duty of other nations contributing to the United Nations, to accept the situation as it is, and to do what we think is the best thing in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like, therefore, to suggest to the Minister that he should give this House the reassessment the Government must have made of the situation, arising out of recent developments.  Will he honestly tell us that the policy which the United Nations now intend to pursue is the right policy, and if it is the right policy, do the Government think sufficient men and materials are available in the Congo to carry out that policy? The prevention of civil war is a very serious task indeed.  We have had some experience of what civil war means and if we relate the situation in the Congo to the situation here 40 years ago&mdash; the conditions are far more difficult in the Congo&mdash;we shall be able to make some assessment of the difficulties that may arise.</P>
    <P>Therefore, my personal view is that sufficient troops, materials and money should be provided to enable the United Nations to take adequate steps to preserve law and order in the Congo, if necessary for many years to come, and to allow, in the course of events, a democratically elected central Government to emerge, with all the institutions of such a Government: a civil service, a judiciary and the military appurtenances which go with a modern State.  I do not intend even to guess how long that may take.  It may take five, 10 or 20 years, but if the United Nations want that situation to develop democratically under their mandate or tutelage, they must provide adequate forces and material.</P>
    <P>If they are not prepared to do that, if they are prepared to allow things to drift on in the hope that something may turn up, I would prefer that we would <Col N="885" /> withdraw our troops completely.  There is no use in trying in a half-hearted sort of way to carry out what is a very difficult and onerous task.  Unless the United Nations are prepared to tackle that task, the Government should very carefully reassess the whole situation.</P>
    <P>At the moment reading the reports one sees daily in the papers, there appears to be absolutely no solution to this apparently hopeless position.  I hope that is not so, and I think everyone in the House will join me in expressing that hope, but there is no use in shutting our eyes to the facts. The situation is that there are a number of leaders who command a certain amount of respect and support and, apparently, at the slightest provocation, they are prepared to slaughter one another in the manner of primitive tribal peoples.  Undoubtedly, they have all the infra-structure of a modern society: hospitals, buildings, schools, houses. The only thing lacking is people to take the country and run it as a modern democracy.  How that will be provided without someone taking charge from outside, I do not know.</P>
    <P>It would be grand to believe that if all foreign troops withdrew, peace would suddenly descend and that those disagreeing political leaders would come together and decide to set up a centrally-directed Government.  I cannot see that happening in the future. That is why I believe the United Nations will have to exercise sufficient control over the country until it is, itself, in a position to exercise control.  I may be accused of suggesting a modern form of colonialism.  I do not wish to suggest that in any measure.  I am trying to review the situation.  I suggest what I think is the only possible solution and the only possible way of tackling this problem urgently because it is urgent.  If it is allowed to drift or if it is tackled with inadequate troops or materials, there may be very serious results.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I hope the Minister, when he comes to reply, will give us a fair and honest assessment of the situation.  I trust he will take us into his confidence and tell us what he and the Government think of the situation and whether or not the United Nations are adequately equipped to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I am amazed that the Minister for External Affairs has not so far made any statement with regard to the new situation that has arisen in the Congo as a result of the Security Council's decision within the past few days.  For the past eight or nine months, the task of the United Nations in the Congo could be described as one of keeping the peace. The Taoiseach made it quite clear in this House that our soldiers were going there for police action.  When questioned very carefully, he said that if the situation altered in any respect in regard to the reasons for taking part in the Congo operation, this House would be consulted and the country would be given the full facts because a different decision might be taken with regard to our troops there.</P>
      <P>At column 776 of Volume 185 of the Official Report, the Taoiseach made it quite clear that the second contingent which recently went to the Congo was going there only on the basis that the objective of the United Nations Force in the Congo will still be as it was when the first contingent was dispatched, namely, to keep the peace in the Congo. That situation has changed completely as a result of the decision of the Security Council in the past few days. It is no longer just a matter of police action.  If we accept what we read in the papers, then, according to statements by the various political factions in the Congo, they are not prepared to accept this decision of the United Nations Security Council and are prepared to fight to the bitter end to prevent that decision being implemented.</P>
      <P>What is the implication of that situation for our troops?  We must have regard to the safety of our troops in the Congo.  It is beyond doubt that if the decision to disarm were to be carried out, not 20,000 troops would be required in the Congo but a minimum of 100,000 men.  There are experts who say that 500,000 men with material and equipment would be necessary to carry out that Security Council decision.  I gather that at the moment there are fewer than 20,000 troops in the Congo under the command of the Irish general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> Is it suggested that that decision is to be implemented with the present force?  Is it suggested that the Irish troops who have played a wonderful part up to the present will be put in the position that perhaps not eleven lives will be lost but the entire contingent wiped out?  The position all along the line for the past eight months has been that equipment, ammunition and modern guns of all sorts have been poured into Katanga and other parts of the Congo.  United Nations troops had to stand by, because their instructions forbade them to interfere, while foreign legions were formed, armed and trained.  They are the foreign legions which must now be disarmed.  Are our troops to be used to disarm these people?</P>
    <P>For months we pointed out that the Belgians were using backdoor methods to send in foreigners, equipment, ammunition and modern means of destruction into Katanga.  No action was taken to prevent that.  I have seen letters from some of the soldiers who were in Niemba.  They said that, in that area, there was no shortage of European volunteers to train the local Congolese, the Katanga people, and that these foreign volunteers had nothing but contempt for the United Nations soldiers and brushed them off the streets when they met them.  The Irish troops, well-disciplined, had to put up with this.  Now, these foreign troops and the gendarmerie of Katanga are armed to the teeth, in addition to other factions.  Is it now suggested that without any consideration by this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will he agree that this House should have an opportunity of discussing the significance of the change that has taken place? Deputy Dillon has stated, and I <Col N="888" /> accept it, that, as a result of the decision of the Security Council in the past few days, this House should have a special opportunity of considering the position of our troops and that special time should be made available for such a discussion.</P>
      <P>The objects of the United Nations Force have changed.  Let us recall that on a number of occasions we put questions to the Taoiseach about the Congo.  His reply was that so far as internal political affairs in the Congo were concerned, there would be no interference.  He said point blank in this House that he was not interested. We were doing a job in the Congo because we were asked to do it by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.  We would carry out the commands given to us.  There would be no interference with the internal political affairs of the Congo.  Has that situation not altered radically?  What is there now but absolute interference in the internal political affairs of the Congo, since a decision has been taken to disarm all the Congolese?  Before the Government make up their minds, time should be given in this House for a debate as to whether we agree or disagree with the new decision by the United Nations Security Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must put the safety of our troops first.  The older members of this House have recollections of what a civil war can mean.  I have not, because I was not born then.  It would be a tragedy if Irish troops were used in the Congo for the purpose of bolstering partition there.  I was hurt by the speech of Deputy Booth, who said that it was for the various groups in the Congo to decide whether or not partition was desirable.  He went so far as to suggest that if the Province of Katanga wished to secede from a united country, they were entitled to do so.  Within the past 12 months, I recollect Deputy Booth publicly declaring his views on the Six Counties. He stated quite bluntly that a minority in the north of Ireland were entitled, if they wished, to break off from the rest of the country.  He condoned Partition here, and it is quite evident from the views he expressed today that <Col N="889" /> he is prepared to condone it in the Congo.</P>
    <P>Is Deputy Booth speaking for the Government when he makes statements of that importance?  The Minister for External Affairs should rebut Deputy Booth's statement.  It is too serious at this stage to have a prominent spokesman of Fianna Fáil saying here that if the Province of Katanga wishes to secede from the rest of the Congo, it is entitled to do so.  That is the same gentleman who said that if the Six Counties wish to stay out, they are entitled to do so.  We want to find out is there a change in the Fianna Fáil policy on Partition.  If Deputy Booth is speaking for his Party, then it becomes clear that the Government are not seriously interested in ensuring that the Congo remains a united country, that they are prepared to allow Mr. Tshombe and his group, who are guided by the Belgians, to hold the rest of the Congo to ransom by threatening to cut off its lifeline.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne made a suggestion which was sneered at by Deputy Esmonde and other speakers.  He referred to the fact that there was a new President in America who has, so far, appeared to have disowned the Eisenhower policies of the past and is prepared to use commonsense in international affairs.  He made a suggestion&mdash;perhaps it is a naïve one &mdash;that the two major powers in the world, the United States and Russia, could help to solve the Congo problem at this stage.  I see nothing wrong with the Americans and the Russians each offering troops, equipment and money as part of a joint effort under the U.N. command to try to improve the situation in the Congo.  I do not know what the purpose of the United Nations is if we are to spend all our time dealing only with one section. The United Nations Organisation consists of all the nations in it.  If there is to be a true Assembly, a true meeting of minds and a breaking down of the barriers of suspicion, the only way <Col N="890" /> that can be achieved is by a discussion and understanding of the problems involved so that they can be overcome, if possible, by co-operation.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we are a little less cynical than some of the other Deputies who spoke when we suggest that at this stage, in view of the magnitude of the task in the Congo, it is desirable that the major powers should offer contingents to the United Nations under the control of some group acceptable to both.  It may not be feasible, but at least it could be tried out.  We would then find out which group was bluffing and was not prepared to play its part.  I cannot understand why that proposition should be sneered at by some of the Deputies who have spoken.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy is in agreement on the magnitude of the task in the Congo.  I have already said that the number of troops at the disposal of General McKeown is absolutely inadequate to carry out the decision of the Security Council.  We cannot be asked to give another contingent for the simple reason that we have not got the troops.  What other nations will provide the troops necessary to enable the Commander to carry out the decision of the Security Council?  I do not think it is possible to get sufficient trained troops and equipment in what have been termed the uncommitted nations.  Those nations which have the troops and equipment at present should co-operate in such a venture under neutral leadership. I should like to hear the Government's view on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken mainly because I am worried about the position of our troops.  The Government should be severely censured for failing to make time available to debate the situation of our troops, in the light of the decision of the Security Council to change from a police action in the Congo to a military one.  If these groups in the Congo refuse to be disarmed, it means that the United Nations troops will have to use force.  We did not send our troops to the Congo for such a warlike job. Further, the number of troops available are insufficient to carry out such a task.  Therefore, where do we stand as far as the safety of our troops in the <Col N="891" /> Congo is concerned at the moment? Is it intended now, within the next week or next month, to state a date on which this action of disarming is to commence?  We want information on all this.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that they should make time available for a discussion of the new situation that has arisen as a result of the decision of the Security Council to take the necessary steps to disarm all the Congolese.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but I am constrained to do so by the remarks of certain speakers.  On this Supplementary Estimate, it is only natural that our thoughts should turn to our soldiers across the sea.  We are not accustomed to having our soldiers stationed overseas, but out thoughts are with them to-day.  I must certainly take exception to some of the remarks made by Deputy Dr. Browne when he sought to defend certain elements in the Congo&mdash;the pro-Lumumba group.  There is certainly one thing that is known about the pro-Lumumba group from one end of the country to the other.  They were the gentlemen, if I can call them such, who cast the shadow of death on many a home throughout this land.  I do not know what prompted certain Deputies to defend these groups.  I could not see myself taking the same line.  I do not wish to refer disrespectfully to the dead when I advert to the reference by Deputy Dr. Browne to Lumumba being a very good Catholic.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but I think many Deputies are unduly pessimistic. Our troops in the Congo are well trained young men.  They are disciplined and they are led by officers that nobody need fear for a moment are not as good as the world's best.  Being so led and disciplined, I do not think that we can have any undue fear at all as to what our troops will do out there.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time that Ireland, small though it is, has sent people abroad in the cause of peace and Christianity.  We all feel, and must, of necessity, feel, very proud of the men who were there and came back, and of those who did not come back alive.  We offer our very sincere sympathy not alone on this but on every occasion to the relatives of those gallant men who gave their lives in such a worthy cause.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that many people are not taking the position of the Congo seriously enough.  It is, to my mind, and to the mind of many others, nothing short of a barrel of dynamite. That is why I say that our troops will not be responsible for anything that may be ignited, but they will be there, as they have been, in the cause of world peace and that at a time when we have nations gasping, so to speak, to go to war, regardless of its dreadful consequences.  We can feel happy that our troops are not going to take part in any war.  They are going to take part in the mission for which they were sent out there, that is, peace in the Congo&mdash;world peace, for that matter.</P>
      <P>We know that our task is a very difficult one.  There are language difficulties and the difficulty, perhaps, that those people who are now free may not be fully prepared for that freedom. Unfortunately, there are the demons who would try to stir up trouble or try to make out of the Congo what they have made out of other nations.  If for no other reason than that and to try to combat the satanic policy of Russia especially, we feel very happy that this little country of ours has taken such a prominent part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hasten to congratulate the Minister <Col N="894" /> on the attitude he has taken in his many sound, sensible and sincere contributions towards world peace&mdash;fearless contributions from a man of his calibre who has been through the fight and the struggle for independence here. It is obvious to us that his statements were in keeping with our sentiments.</P>
    <P>I also hasten to congratulate that great Irishman who has been selected as President of the United Nations&mdash;Mr. Boland.  He sat in this House on many an occasion.  We can feel certain, knowing him as we do, that he is and will continue to be an ornament to any organisation that demands and has a genuine love for peace.</P>
    <P>It is indeed very strange that this country should play such a very prominent part in the affairs of the Congo. Many people very foolishly say that we are only a small nation but on this occasion we are playing a very big part and a part that we can be very proud of.  There is, unfortunately, as I said the black mark there that thirteen of our gallant soldiers lost their lives. However, I suppose that is a soldier's privilege, to die.  They knew there were hidden dangers there and they volunteered.  I was very pleased to hear the Minister for Defence say that three volunteers offered for every one man that was needed.  That in itself shows the true mentality of the Irish soldier.  It was not a love of war&mdash; because we hope and pray that war will not develop&mdash;but a love of peace, of a genuine lasting peace, among a people who have been fortunate enough to secure their independence.</P>
    <P>We hope nothing will be said here that will in any way misrepresent the attitude of the Government towards the Congo or the attitude of the soldiers towards the Congolese and other armies which are there.  I am very proud to be a supporter of the Government which sent out these men. We pray that their mission will be fulfilled in the spirit that every true Christian desires and that they will return to this country having fulfilled their contract, so to speak, that contract which the United Nations so desire them to fulfil.</P>
    <P>We want a lasting peace there but if <Col N="895" /> bigger nations send in any new contingents, then other nations will probably follow suit.  I feel that in the interests of the Congolese our Army must be the most welcome of all.  We ourselves re-emerged as a nation a few years ago, having regained our independence through a method which we considered the only one that would ever give us independence, and that was force.  I congratulate the Minister on his many strong and fearless contributions towards the maintenance of peace and I congratulate the Chairman of the United Nations Assembly.  This country naturally must feel proud of our Minister, of our representative at the United Nations and of our Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Minister's address he referred to the fact that one of the reasons for this Estimate was to enable the Department and the Government to pay our contribution to the United Nations earlier than usual.  No Deputy has any objection to that course; rather every Deputy thinks that if the United Nations feel that contributions should be paid at a particular time the Government should comply with any reasonable request that is made in that regard.  No member of this House can voice any protest against that.  If the contribution is to be paid, it might as well be paid six months earlier as on a later date when the full contributions might be required by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>I trust that when the Minister is replying he will refer very fully to the query put to him by the Leader of the Opposition with regard to member nations and whether they have paid their contributions and if, having regard to the financial position of the United Nations, all member countries have paid their contribution on the prescribed dates.  If the contributions have not been paid by other nations it is the duty of the member countries to direct the attention of their Parliaments and Governments to that fact, as the Minister for External Affairs has done here today arising out of our membership of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by the previous <Col N="896" /> speaker to the troops who are serving and who have served with the United Nations force in the Congo.  I want to add an expression of my praise and admiration of the excellent work undertaken by the members of the Irish Defence Forces in the Congo. When the last battalion returned the tributes paid to them by the chaplains who had been serving with the forces were very striking.  They paid tribute to the fine devotion of the troops, their good example and spoke of the high respect and esteem shown the Irish soldiers in the Congo.</P>
    <P>By their good example, their bravery, skill and manliness, by the manner in which they carried out their duties with great devotion and with their exercise of charity, I feel they must have been a shining example to others who were serving in the Congo and particularly to the people of the Congo.  It is indeed encouraging and I feel our soldiers will play a big part in preserving the peace by the religious example which they show to those in the Congo who are probably in need of it.  The tributes paid to them by the serving chaplains are admired by members of all Parties.  There is no doubt that the men serving in the Congo are carrying on the fine traditions which are expected from a Christian country such as ours.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Department of External Affairs will keep a very close eye on all the activities of all our soldiers and that their health, protection and safety will be their primary concern.  Ireland should be very proud of the Commander of the United Nations Forces, who is an Irishman, a fact which focusses world attention on the ability of the Irish soldier to command and the great respect, confidence and trust which a great world organisation such as the United Nations places on an Irishman in that regard.</P>
    <P>However great the tribute paid to the Minister by Deputy Davern, there have been times when the ordinary person reading the speeches of the Minister found difficulty in understanding what our policy was in the United Nations.  One often wondered if we <Col N="897" /> had an external affairs policy in the United Nations.  There were many occasions when the Minister could have been more tactful in his observations. I and most Deputies feel that our aim in the United Nations should be to increase the number of Ireland's friends.  As a very small nation, we may have no enemies but our effort should be to retain the friendship of those countries that have been friendly disposed towards Ireland and not by ill-advised remarks or speeches to estrange our friends or insult them.</P>
    <P>Whatever line of policy may be pursued in the United Nations by the Minister, I hope it will be based on the desire of the Irish people to increase the number of our friends abroad, realising that the Irish people have no desire to have the countries that have been friendly disposed towards Ireland discredited, insulted or reflected upon.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered whether the Minister realises that the greatest and freest country in the world today is the United States of America.  Great ties of friendship have existed between this country and the United States of America for generations.  For generations up to the present time, families from every part of Ireland have been settling in the United States of America. There has been a tradition of Irish people emigrating to the United States of America.  Attention has been focussed on that tradition by the recent election of President Kennedy whose forefathers emigrated from Ireland many years ago.  There is no reason to doubt that the election of President Kennedy will be an asset to Ireland. We hope and trust that the friendship between Ireland and the United States of America will continue and that the election of President Kennedy will make stronger these ties of friendship. I think President Kennedy during his term of office will endeavour to increase co-operation and friendship between Ireland and the United States of America.  There are many ways in which the Minister and the Department can help to secure that greater friendship and co-operation between the two countries.</P>
    <P>If the Minister sees no reason to <Col N="898" /> regret any of his statements in the past, I hope he will bear in mind that whatever his own personal feelings or intentions may be in regard to the United States of America, the vast majority of the Irish people regard the United States as having been always our friend and that it is their desire that the United States should always be a great friend of Ireland.  I make that statement in the hope that the Minister will realise the great bond of friendship that has existed for generations between this country and the United States of America.</P>
    <P>The election of Mr. Boland as President of the United Nations has also focussed attention on our country, to our credit.  I notice that the Government have not made any appointment to the United Nations to replace Mr. Boland.  I imagine that as a result of Mr. Boland's elevation to the Presidency of the United Nations, there is a vacancy for a permanent representative in the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the many speeches made by the Minister for External Affairs in New York, Boston, Washington and elsewhere, I cannot agree with Deputy Davern that his speeches were always in the vein of a demand for world peace.  A number of his speeches tended to antagonise Ireland's friends.  World peace is one thing. Offensive speeches are another thing. If it is the intention of the Minister to return to the United States in March for the next session of the Assembly, he ought to guard his tongue carefully and say nothing which would offend Ireland's friends.</P>
    <P>I addressed a Question to the Minister yesterday:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for External Affairs the length of time spent by him in the United States of America during 1960 and the total cost of such stay, including entertainments.</P>
    <P>That was a simple question.  The Minister stated in reply that he had been 95 days in America.  If it would not be too embarrassing for the Minister&mdash;I doubt if anything would embarrass the Minister for External Affairs&mdash;I would ask him to indicate whether a Minister or Foreign Secretary <Col N="899" /> of any other member country of the United Nations was present in the United States of America for 95 days. I do not think that Britain had their Foreign Secretary there for 95 days.</P>
    <P>I am sure most member countries depend upon their permanent staff at the United Nations.  The Irish staff must have been the best in the world, seeing that Mr. Boland was elected President.  Whether there was a necessity for it or not, the Minister was in America for 95 days and he was the only member of a Government, the only Minister for External Affairs or Foreign Secretary of all the member countries who remained so long in the United States during 1960.  I would ask the Minister what he was doing for 95 days in the United States of America.  The debate on this Estimate is the only opportunity Deputies have to get information in that regard.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why Ireland could not be represented by some of the senior officers of the Department of External Affairs.  On practically all the Estimates a tribute has been paid from time to time in regard to the high quality and the high standard of efficiency of our Civil Service.  It is only right to express the same views on this occasion, that in the Department of External Affairs the Civil Service staff are regarded internationally as the best in the world.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the Minister for External Affairs should go to the United States for 95 days as he did, at a cost of £1,862 15s. 4d.  When there is a general pruning of expenditure, when we see that emigration has taken so many of our people to the four corners of the world, when we see the numbers that are unemployed, this wild extravagance on the part of the Minister for External Affairs is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister who was being entertained or whom he was entertaining?  I thought I read in one of the papers that the Minister was the guest of the Consul-General in New York.  If he was a guest, surely the Minister was not expected to pay; I doubt if the Consul-General <Col N="900" /> in New York, if the Minister was his guest, stretched out his hand to the Minister when he was leaving for the payment of his board and lodging. I may be quite wrong, but I thought I remember reading that he was the guest of the Consul-General.  In the case of his trips to Chicago and Boston, if he was the guest of any of the Consuls there, surely he would not be expected to pay or the Irish taxpayers would not be expected to pay on his behalf?</P>
    <P>I would like to know who was being entertained.  Are we to understand, if some reports are correct, that some of the leaders of the Communist countries and some well-known Communist leaders in the United States were invited to some of the functions sponsored by the Minister for External Affairs and paid for by Irish taxpayers? I fail to see why we should set aside £1,800 towards an entertainment for Communists, for the enemies of freedom, the enemies of free speech and the enemies of freedom of religious worship.</P>
    <P>I recall the days of the Inter-Party Government when ex-Deputy MacBride was Minister for External Affairs and when there was a barrage of questions from this side of the House by several Fianna Fáil speakers asking when the Minister for External Affairs was coming home.  They asked was he living in the United States? Deputy MacBride, when Minister for External Affairs, was never 95 days in the United States.  Nevertheless he was criticised from every platform at every chapel gate in every town and village: &ldquo;Mr. MacBride is living in the United States.&rdquo;  There was never a word from any of them when the present Minister for External Affairs went to the United States.</P>
    <P>The job of the Minister for External Affairs is to be at home at the head of his Department.  There is enough confusion and difficulty in the United Nations without their having to put up with the Minister for External Affairs and without the Minister for External Affairs adding to the confusion.  I hope that when the new season opens arrangements will be made to have Ireland represented by the proper <Col N="901" /> type of person&mdash;by that I mean the new permanent representative.  Let that be sufficient and let us not be duplicating entertainment and other expenses, permitting the Minister for External Affairs to go skating around Boston, Chicago, Washington and New York having the life of Reilly and entertaining lavishly at the expense of the wealthy, generous Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Now that we have succeeded in finding out the cost of this entertainment, I hope we have seen the end of it.  I can say without the slightest fear of contradiction that no criticism from this side of the House can compare with the criticism offered when the inter-Party Government were in office and when the former Minister had gone on very urgent business to the United States and stayed no longer than was really necessary.  I trust that in future the Minister will be cautious about those he entertains in the United States at our expense.  If he wants to entertain the leaders of Communist countries let him do so out of his own pocket.  I object to Communists being entertained by our Government at the expense of Irish Catholic taxpayers; I protest against it in the strongest possible terms.  I appeal to the Minister for External Affairs that he should stay at home during the new session.  If he has to go off for a week or ten days let him guard his tongue and, if he makes speeches, let him do so in order to get on the right side of free nations like Britain, the United State and others of our friends.  Whatever contribution he has to make, let it be made in an effort to multiply our friends and, if possible, to ignore those who are antagonistic towards the Irish nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for his support for the payments which the Government propose to make to the United Nations and also the Leader of the Labour Party and other Deputies who supported the Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the payment of our subscription by means of a Supplementary Estimate means that we shall not have to make provision for that subscription in the ordinary <Col N="902" /> Estimates which will be reduced next year by the amount of the Supplementary Estimate.  We feel we should make this gesture.  It is not that the United Nations will &ldquo;go broke&rdquo; if they do not get our contribution six months ahead of time but we think that, in these critical days, when the United Nations Organisation is under very fierce attack and when its Secretary-General who has guidedits affairs so wisely and bravely over the past few years is also under attack, it is right that Ireland should make this gesture of confidence in the United Nations and its Charter and of support for its gallant Secretary-General.</P>
    <P>The second matter dealt with in this Supplementary Estimate is a sum of £25,000 for the special Congo fund. Already a number of nations have subscribed to that fund.  Towards the end of last year&mdash;in October, I think &mdash;the United States contributed 5,000,000 dollars to meet a shortage in the United Nations Exchequer.  A number of nations, of course, pay their subscriptions in January or early in the year&mdash;I am referring again now to the ordinary annual contribution for the general purposes of the United Nations budget&mdash;but we are not accustomed to pay it until after the commencement of the financial year.  We usually forward it in April or May. There are other countries that have not paid their subscriptions for a number of years or they are at least in arrears, and there are also those who are in arrear and have refused to pay for the support of the United Nations effort in the Gaza strip to keep the peace between the Israelis and the Arabs.  They have refused also to pay anything towards United Nations operations in the Congo.</P>
    <P>I think we should give a good example when we can do so and I believe the Irish people will be very glad to support the United Nations by paying their annual contribution a little ahead of time and also by making this contribution to help in putting the Congolese back on their feet.  However poor our people may be I think they are rich enough in spirit to share what they have with people who are worse off.  Undoubtedly, <Col N="903" /> the Congolese are highly intelligent but, through the vicissitudes of their history, they have been denied the chance to find their feet, become educated and gain experience in government.</P>
    <P>The Leader of Fine Gael spoke about the terms of reference&mdash;if I may put it that way&mdash;of the United Nations Forces in the Congo.  Perhaps it is as well to make clear exactly what the situation is.  The basic resolution regarding the Congo was passed by the Security Council on the 13th July and, after certain introductory paragraphs and after calling on the Belgian Government to withdraw its troops, it declared that the Security Council &ldquo;decides to authorise the Secretary-General to take the necessary steps in consultation with the Government of the Republic of the Congo to provide the Government with such military assistance as may be necessary until, through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations, the national security forces may be able, in the opinion of the Government, to meet fully their tasks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From my quotation of that resolution it is clear that at that period of time the preoccupation of the Security Council was to get the Government of Belgium to withdraw its troops and secondly to support the central Government of the Congo and to provide such military assistance as would enable it to find its feet.  At that time, there was a Parliament in being in Leopoldville; Mr. Kasavubu was President and Mr. Lumumba was Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>We go on to the 22nd of July when a somewhat similar resolution was passed&mdash;a little stronger&mdash;calling for the immediate action in regard to the Belgian withdrawal.  That resolution commended the Secretary-General for his prompt action in trying to carry out the resolution of the Security Council and for his first report.  His prompt action, of course, was to call upon a number of countries, including ourselves, to send military forces to support the Congolese Government in trying to keep the peace in the Congo.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> On the 9th August the Security Council adopted another resolution and in the first operative paragraph it says that the Council confirms the authority given to the Secretary-General by the Security Council resolutions of the 14th and 22nd of July and requests him to continue to carry out the responsibility placed on him thereby.</P>
    <P>The reason for the resolution was not to urge a willing Secretary-General but to call upon the Belgian Government to withdraw its troops immediately, etc., etc.  There was then a special meeting of the General Assembly.  It was called towards the beginning of September. The resolution it passed stated, first, that the General Assembly fully supports the resolutions of the Security Council.  I have given extracts from those resolutions.  Secondly, it requests the Secretary-General to continue to take vigorous action in accordance with the terms of the aforesaid resolution to assist the Central Government of the Congo in the restoration and maintenance of law and order throughout the territory of the Republic of the Congo and to safeguard its unity, integrity and political independence in the interests of international peace and security.</P>
    <P>The resolution adopted by the Security Council quite recently had one very important operative clause, the first one.  Under this clause, which I shall read, the Security Council urges that the United Nations should take immediately all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo, including arrangements for cease fire, the halting of all military operations, the prevention of clashes and the use of force, if necessary, in the last resort.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that point.  The House will have noted that in the original resolution the Secretary-General was authorised to provide military assistance for certain purposes &mdash;not policemen armed with batons but military assistance.  Troops were sent out to the Congo to help the Congolese keep the peace so that they could organise their economic and political <Col N="905" /> life.  The most recent resolution emphasises once more that the principal objective of the United Nations is to help the Congolese Government to keep peace.  The United Nations are endeavouring to achieve that objective by asking countries like our own to send forces to the Congo to help maintain peace.  In the last resort, if conciliation and palaver do not work as they worked with our Irish troops for many months in the Kivu area and in parts of the Katanga area, they should be empowered, and clearly recognised as being empowered, to use force.  In fact they have always been entitled to use force as a last resort and, unfortunately, they have had to use force on a few occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the need for the latest resolution then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  I think it is a certain strengthening of the Secretary-General's hand and of the United Nations Organisation because it states more clearly and explicitly not only the functions but the powers, the rights and the duties of the U.N. Forces in the Congo.  The principal weapon of the United Nations is not bullets or bombs, or anything like that.  Its principal reliance must be on conciliation, on trying to persuade the Congolese to realise they have a job to do which nobody else can do for them, and to create conditions in which they can work harmoniously together and in which we can co-operate with them towards achieving conciliation amongst themselves.  Undoubtedly many horrible things have happened in the Congo in the last nine months, but no more horrible than many things that happened in Europe over many centuries.  The Congolese were thrown on their own resources without any of the preparation that modern European communities have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We pride ourselves on being a well-developed country politically, with certain resources, and we should, I think, help these people who are trying to find their feet now.  They are not in any way inferior to us intellectually. They simply lack the political experience other countries have had <Col N="906" /> after thousands of years of development in the course of which much more blood was shed than has been shed in the Congo so far.  I believe the Congolese will find their feet, just as all African entities will find their feet.  It will take time.  What is required at the moment is not the stirring up of bitterness about the terrible tragedies that have occurred but rather the impressing on the Congolese, and outsiders who may be fishing in the troubled waters of the Congo, that reprisal and counter-reprisal are not the solution.  The solution is to get together in the interests of the Congolese people as a whole and in the interests of world peace.</P>
    <P>We must not forget that there are two reasons why Irish troops are in the Congo today, together with troops from other countries.  One is in the interest of the Congolese themselves, to help them to find their feet and develop their own resources; the second is to try to prevent world war breaking out in the tropical forests and swamps of the Congo.  I have no doubt that a general world war might have developed long before this from the incipient flames that were being fanned in the Congo some months ago, had not independent, free nations like ourselves undertaken this peculiarly delicate task.  Disappointed as I am in some directions because we have not made more progress in achieving ordered government, we must at least thank God that we have postponed the outbreak of world war as a result of a power vacuum in the Congo. We have tried to fill that vacuum.  If we are interested in keeping world peace, and we must because we are part of the world, we should do all we can to ensure that the difficulties created by the Congolese themselves, and by the interference of outsiders, are overcome.  We shall persevere in our endeavours until they are finally fruitful.  That fruition may take some time.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate that the Congolese had only the one run over the course where elections are concerned. If there had been two or three elections, they might have picked other leaders, or the leaders, having gained <Col N="907" /> political experience, might have developed to the point where they could handle their affairs in a better way. There is no use in crying over spilt milk.  We have to take things as they are, and if we wish to make them better, we have to will the means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The means to make the Congo situation better are, first of all, that all the great powers should keep out of the Congo.  If they want to help the Congolese people, it must be done through the United Nations and not directly.  Then we want the small countries, who are in a politically acceptable position, to supply troops if they can do so.</P>
      <P>Another point which Deputy Dillon raised, and which preoccupies the Government, is: what is the size of the force necessary to do a reasonable job in the Congo, and will that force be forthcoming?  It is hard to estimate what size force will be required.  The one Irish battalion in Kivu&mdash;before people became interested in making trouble&mdash;kept that vast area as quiet as a church.  There were certain incipient signs of trouble but they maintained good relations with the Congolese people and army, and that part of the Congo was more peaceful and law-abiding than many other parts. When some houses were evacuated by the Belgians, furniture was left, and not a stick of that furniture was touched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If someone asked me to make a calculation as to how many troops would be required to keep order in the Congo, I would say that before we could make a mathematical assessment, or any approach to a mathematical assessment, we would have to know the situation in the Congo.  If the situation improves, very few United Nations troops could help to keep up the morale of the Congolese, and help to reassure and calm them, but if foreign powers interfere, all the armies of ancient Rome could not keep the peace there.  We must all hope that the great powers, and, indeed, some of the smaller powers, will be wise enough <Col N="908" /> not to pursue their own selfish interests in the Congo and that they will co-operate with the United Nations in an effort to seek, first, the interests of the Congolese people and, in sustaining their interests, the interests of all the peoples of the world.  If there are a number of countries, large or small, interfering in Congolese affairs, and seeking their selfish interests first, more troops will be required.</P>
    <P>I should like now to give some information to Deputy Dillon in answer to a question he put to me.  I understand the Secretary-General has issued invitations for more troops&mdash;there are now 17,000 or 18,000, I think&mdash;to bring them up to 25,000.  I hope the smaller independent countries, and, indeed, the larger independent countries who are politically acceptable, will answer the call of the United Nations and supply these troops.  I feel that the greater the United Nations military force in the Congo, the less chance there is of their being used or of force being necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have not heard whether or not there was.  I am just giving the information.  Another matter which is agitating the minds of people, naturally, is how far the Irish Government can have any influence over the methods or ways in which the Irish troops are being used.  I want to say, first of all, that I agree thoroughly with what Deputy Booth said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We participate in an advisory council to the Secretary-General. We can have our say there, and we have it.  It may happen that the advisory committee advises the Secretary-General on certain matters in relation to the Congo in a direction that we would prefer to have otherwise, but we feel that, if the United Nations are to make progress we must be prepared to accept the various decisions of the various organs or subcommittees of the United Nations of which we are members.  We do have the influence of our votes and voice in that committee over the methods to be used by the United Nations forces, civil and military, in the Congo. We have no direct influence, and we believe it would be wrong for us in any way to attempt to influence our troops directly.  We must trust the Secretary-General and the officers, civil and military, appointed by the United Nations to do a good job of work.  If they cannot do it, if one single well-defined line of authority cannot make a success of the Congo, several lines will not be a success.</P>
      <P>One reason for the present difficult situation is that many Governments acted otherwise.  I think I have covered that aspect of the debate fairly fully.  If any Deputy thinks I have missed out on something I should be very glad if he would say so.  I thought it better to take it in a rather broader way than to answer each sentence by every Deputy.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to follow all the points by the various speakers.  The Congo situation is developing.  We hope that before very long the result of the work of the Conciliation Committee will bear fruit.  From time to time, we see reports from the Congo which indicate that their work had an influence for good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently&mdash;it was in some of the papers&mdash;President Kasavubu had an idea that a round-table conference <Col N="910" /> should get together, fully representative of all the parties in the Congo, to try to get agreement on a new Constitution which would provide not for the six States with very little power as at present but for at least 12 States which would take more account of ethnic and tribal differences and have more local control over their affairs.</P>
    <P>Even in to-day's paper, there have been some indications that Mr. Tshombe from Katanga is having a new look at a conciliation committee and, according to reports&mdash;I want to emphasise, according to the newspaper reports&mdash;he proposes to invite Mr. Gizenga who was Mr. Lumumba's Vice-Premier, President Kasavubu and other leaders from Kasai and elsewhere to meet at a round table conference, first in Geneva and afterwards at Elizabethville.  We hope these ideas will make progress.  Only through conciliation of that kind, only by having a new look at the Constitution drafted in Brussels, by amending it so that it will be more suited to the situation as it has developed in the Congo, can we hope to make peaceful progress.</P>
    <P>I am not an optimist by nature.  I never thought this matter could be settled in a very short time.  I feel that a steady, patient, conciliatory attitude on the part of the United Nations will finally bring the Congolese people together to form a federation or some sort of government for the centre, with governments in many districts which will take account of the ethnic differences among the people.  Under such a Government, we hope the Congolese people will settle down to develop their resources and improve themselves.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the Congolese should not go in that direction.  A couple of thousand years ago, Europe was as divided as the Congo is now.  Europe is still divided but it is rather more orderly and peaceful than it was a couple of thousand years ago.</P>

      <P>There is no such thing as permanent war or tribal battles going on all the time as there were. You could call the various nationalities in Europe tribes, if you liked.  I am hopeful that if the Congolese people get a chance and if the outside powers pursue the interests of the Congo and the world at large, instead of their own interest, the Congolese people will settle down, come together and begin to make progress.  That is our hope.  That is what we are working for.  Because of that, I do not reply to some of the remarks made here to-day. It is not that I could not do it but I do not think it would be wise to do it at present.</P>
      <P>I want to reply to the question the Leader of the Labour Party put to me yesterday and to-day.  Ambassador Boland was appointed the Permanent Representative of Ireland at the United Nations in 1956.  He remains the official permanent representative. Like a number of other Ministers for External Affairs or Foreign Ministers, I have gone to the United Nations for the past three or four years.  On the first occasion, I stayed about 20 days. On the next occasion, I stayed perhaps 30 days.  The year before last I stayed longer.  We had a resolution in which I was interested and felt should be put through.  I considered I should stand by in New York.  This year, Ambassador Boland was in the Chair.  As President of the United Nations, he had a full-time job.  I saw him occasionally, but we could not burden him with responsibility for Irish decisions, while he was so overburdened with his work as President.  I remained for 95 days in New York and, in the same circumstances, I would do so again.  I feel that any other Minister for External Affairs appointed by the Dáil would do likewise.</P>

I <Col N="912" /> think a number of Foreign Ministers remained there all the time.  I could not be sure they were there every day, but I did see them at the beginning, through the middle and at the end.  All told, 57 of them turned up to the United Nations this year&mdash;12 heads of State, 13 Prime Ministers and several other Government Ministers of various kinds.</P>

      <P>I do not want the Minister to conclude because I want to mention this to him.  Having listened very carefully to his reply to this motion, we still feel considerable anxiety in regard to the question I have already mentioned.  Despite what the Minister has said in bringing to our attention the various resolutions, we think a new situation has been <Col N="913" /> created by the last resolution to which the Minister refers.  We feel that that has thrown on the United Nations Force in the Congo a responsibility which cannot be effectively discharged if their resources are not added to.  We shall wait with anxiety to hear from the Minister and the Government what success has met the request of the Secretary-General for reinforcements for the Force at the disposal of the United Nations Command, not only in personnel but in equipment, so that they may be equipped to deal with any situation that might arise within the ambit of their new responsibilities.

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 together, and to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the information available.</P>
      <P>There is not sufficient information available regarding external assets in private hands or the total liability of Irish residents and concerns to externs on which to base reliable estimates of their magnitude.  It is not possible, therefore, in relation to gross or net &ldquo;external assets of the State&rdquo; to include data for the external assets and liabilities of Irish persons and concerns apart from the Banks, Government Funds and the other bodies mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In the case of Departmental Funds &ldquo;gross&rdquo; and &ldquo;net&rdquo; external assets are identical.  In the case of the Central Bank the figures for external assets do not take into account certain liabilities representing working balances of international financial institutions.  These balances are, however, relatively small and for practical purposes it can be taken that &ldquo;gross&rdquo; and &ldquo;net&rdquo; external assets are identical for this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Associated Banks, figures for the gross external assets are published in the Quarterly Statistical Bulletin of the Central Bank, together with figures for the Banks' liabilities outside the State.  The net external assets of the Associated Banks are obtained by deducting their liabilities outside the State from the figures for gross external assets.  It is not correct, however, to refer to the total gross external assets of the Associated Banks as part of the &ldquo;external assets of the State&rdquo; since some of these <Col N="915" /> banks are incorporated outside the State.  In the case of banks incorporated outside the State, it is the excess of their liabilities in the State over their assets in the State (which is equivalent in value to their net external <Col N="916" /> assets) which is part of the &ldquo;external assets of the State.&rdquo; In amalgamating the figures for the Central Bank, Associated Banks and Government Funds, the net figures is used for the external assets of the Associated Banks.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>EXTERNAL assets of the Central Bank, Associated Banks and Departmental Funds at 31st December, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959 and 1960.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power in what way the carriage of goods would cause widespread illegal competition with Córas Iompair Éireann and licensed hauliers in the case of farmers carrying goods and their milk cans in the same vehicle, having delivered their milk to the creamery; if this problem can be overcome by placing a limitation on the mileage as in the case of cattle being carried to marts; and if he will enter into discussions on this matter with the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, or any other organisation representative of the milk producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be practicable because of the difficulties of detection and proof of abuse to circumscribe a concession on these lines, either by limitation of mileage, quantity, or classes of goods so as to ensure that the carries concerned could not engage in haulage for reward on a commercial scale in unlawful competition with public transport and licensed hauliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> As there is no objection to transport of goods on a genuine obligement basis without reward, I cannot see that there is any case for amending the law.</P>
    <P>I may add that the difficulty in the particular case which the Deputy may have in mind appears to have arisen from the terms of the contract between the co-operative creamery concerned and the milk carriers under which the latter were required, in part consideration of the payments made to them, to deliver goods other than the empty milk cans.  Any goods carried under such a contract would, it appears, be deemed by the Courts to be carriage for reward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that there is no question of carrying for reward in this case because the farmer is carrying back his own property.  The big difficulty is&mdash;and I am sure the Minister will understand&mdash;that legal proceedings have to be instituted in order to prove there is no reward.</P>

It is understood that the More O'Ferrall estate was recently sold by private treaty, but I am not aware of the identify of the purchaser.

      <P>I am aware that there has been complaint of the kind mentioned by the Deputy affecting telephone calls in the North County Wexford area.  The matter has been the subject of investigation but it has not so far been possible to eliminate the trouble.  I am having a special examination made with a view to remedying the situation as early as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not put the Minister to that trouble.  It does not seem to me to be sufficient to put a kiosk in Ballybofey to serve Stranorlar. You would be a wet man before you got to Ballybofey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not seem to be a question in respect of which it is necessary to get cross, but I do submit with respect to the Minister that, if he knows the area, he should know that to walk from Stranorlar across the bridge to the Butt Hall, which is the first building in Ballybofey, must be in the order of a quarter of a mile. If you want to make a telephone call on a wet day in Stranorlar, you have to walk half a mile, which does not seem to be reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will consider the advisability of establishing a post office at Monageer, County Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The limited volume of business likely to be transacted would not warrant the establishment of a sub-post office at Monageer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the nearest post office to Monageer is five miles on one side to Enniscorthy and five miles on the other side to Ferns, and in view of the fact that this is a populous district, will he not reconsider the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>From the information supplied to me by the Department, I am satisfied that an office would not be warranted.  The amount of business likely to be transacted in an office, if it were established there, would be so small that it would not be feasible to establish such an office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the regulations that obtain at present, a telephone kiosk is not established where there is no sub-post <Col N="942" /> office.  Therefore, the only solution would be to have a coin box telephone if there was a shop in the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very reason I am asking the Minister for a sub-post office.  Further, I would respectfully draw his attention to the fact that though people have to walk from Ballybofey to Stranorlar, which is a distance of a quarter of a mile, in this case the distance is five miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs why Brendan Hughes, who was employed on relief work as an auxiliary postman at Carlanstown Post Office, County Meath, was dismissed without reason given and as a consequence receives 26/- per week unemployment assistance, while the man who replaced him was in receipt of unemployment benefit amounting to £4 2s. 6d. per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>When a temporary auxiliary postman was urgently required at Carlanstown sub-post office recently, Mr. Brendan Hughes was employed provisionally, pending recruitment through the local employment exchange in accordance with the normal practice.</P>
      <P>When the names were subsequently received from the exchange, the claims and qualifications of all eligible candidates were considered and Mr. P. Fitzsimons was selected as the most suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that this man was unfairly treated in view of the fact that he had done this job many times before, that at present, as a consequence of his dismissal, he is in receipt of unemployment assistance, 26/- per week, that he has a wife and two children, one of whom is a cripple, that he was <Col N="943" /> actually employed on this job from 14th December to 23rd January, and that he was dismissed without notice by the postmaster and someone else was taken in his place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prevented from giving in the House the circumstances of the people whose names were sent forward by the labour exchange because it is not the practice to disclose such details, but it is a fact, of course, that the head postmaster did take on in an emergency Mr. Brendan Hughes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As he often did before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>As he often did before, but he was not on the job often enough to secure the right of priority and the head postmaster when he found that the vacancy would last longer than he had thought got the names from the labour exchange on 15th December, 1960.  He allowed Mr. Hughes to remain in the post because it was coming up to Christmas and because of the Christmas rush.  He did not put the general Government direction into operation until 16th January.  The postmaster was quite within his rights in doing that and he was quite within his rights in obeying the general direction which is applicable thereto for a long number of years.  I think that the head postmaster treated Brendan Hughes fairly and kept him on as long as he possibly could.  When he could not keep him on any longer, he sent for the other man who had a greater claim, according to the record from the labour exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain how the man appointed had a better claim, seeing that he was an unemployment benefit recipient, whereas the man who was sacked was an unemployment assistance recipient?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say that it was because of an approach by this man to him and the Minister's <Col N="944" /> subsequent intervention that caused this man to be appointed?  I would ask the Minister to confirm or deny that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> The rule relating to the responsibility of Sub-Postmasters for the work of their offices provides that a Sub-Postmaster must either himself perform the duties of his office or otherwise make suitable provision for their proper performance.  The Sub-Postmaster is held responsible for the proper performance of the duties of his office and he is expected as far as possible to exercise personal supervision over them.  He must sign all official reports and periodic accounts.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if in connection with his statement in the Dáil on 9th February, 1961, that the effect of the introduction of the group system of telephone exchanges was to convert a great number of trunk calls into local calls at an estimated cost of £160,000 a year, he will give the estimated loss to subpostmasters by the introduction of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible without a heavy expenditure of staff time, which I consider would not be warranted, to form a reliable estimate of the effect of the group charging system on sub-postmasters' salaries.  It may meet the Deputy's purposes, however, if I say that there has been no special revision of sub-postmasters' salaries as a result of the introduction of the group charging <Col N="946" /> system.  Of 745 salaries reviewed in routine course during 1960, 171 were reduced involving a total reduction of £3,823 a year and 574 were increased involving a total increase of £9,496 a year.  The salaries at a further 194 offices were reviewed but no change was made.  The revisions covered other business as well as telephone work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>A sub-postmaster is paid a cash allowance of £1 1s. Od. per annum plus bonus in respect of a call-office on his premises.  Where the call-office is connected directly to an exchange at another office, then if there is a coin box no extra payment is made for calls but if there is no coin box, he is paid 10 per cent. of the fees for local calls in excess of £10 10s. Od. per annum.  In addition, where the sub-postmaster operates the exchange to which the call-office is connected he receives a line allowance which varies according to circumstances and is given half a unit credit for each call made to another exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to assume the officer of a Department can be trusted. When an officer carries out an examination, we have confidence in him not to disclose information or do anything that would be prejudicial to the examination.  As well as that, a second person is present at the oral examination who knows the candidate. It would be absolutely impossible to keep the name of the candidate a secret in the circumstances.  Even if it were possible, I do not think it would be absolutely necessary since the examination is conducted by an officer of the Department in whom we have confidence.</P>

      <P>Last evening when Deputy Flanagan asked a question in respect of the sale of an Austin Princess car he made a statement in a supplementary question to which I replied: &ldquo;It is a pure canard.&rdquo;  That was not reported in the Official Report.  I must admit that there was a considerable amount of interruption taking place at the time, but I used the same word on a second occasion and in neither case was it reported.  Deputy Flanagan insisted on repeating the statement that a member of the Boland family had driven out the Princess car.  Arising out of that, I have made special inquiries at the Depot where the Princess car was kept and I have been assured beyond any question that there was no such thing as anyone driving out the Princess car much less a member of the Boland family.

I also dealt with fatal accidents statistics and I said that it was evident that few women drivers were involved in fatal accidents.  That gives the lie to the charge that women drivers are careless. The figures show that only a small number of traffic offences are committed by women drivers in comparison with the number committed by men.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to serious offences, the law is at the moment far too lenient.  Probably the leniency of the law is the principal reason this legislation has been introduced.  It has been suggested by a responsible organisation that moving vehicles should carry, in addition to the ordinary lights, a small green light to indicate that they are moving vehicles.</P>
      <P>There is a very grave problem with regard to parked vehicles and it constitutes the main reason the Fine Gael Party recently endeavoured to introduce a Private Bill here.  Everyone knows the number of fatal accidents which have occurred through the thoughtlessness and negligence of those who leave unlighted vehicles parked on the roadside.  I hope that so soon as this measure becomes law, we shall have finished with that offence.  Vehicles should not be allowed to remain overnight by the side of the public road.  The general public can play an important part in this matter.  Anyone who sees an unlighted lorry, tractor-trailer, or other vehicle parked on the roadside, unlighted, at night-time should notify the nearest Garda barracks and the Gardaí should take action immediately.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde referred last night to the necessity for providing lay-bys. The Minister should make available from the Road Fund sufficient moneys to enable local authorities to provide these facilities.  I agree with the observation of Deputy Everett with regard to the growing tendency in his constituency&mdash;it is true of other constituencies also&mdash;of the local authority to cut away footpaths entirely, leaving no place for pedestrians to walk except on the public road.  Unless drivers are very experienced, when cars endeavour to pass one another out, there is immediately some danger to pedestrians who may be using the road.  In recent years, there have been many fatalities amongst school children. There was one appalling accident in Tipperary.  Generous grants should be given to enable local authorities to provide proper facilities for pedestrians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> Another source of danger&mdash;it has not been referred to so far&mdash;is the habit of local authorities of leaving a number of tar barrels on the side of the road.  Sometimes in winter, they are left on the road lighted.  If the weather is bad, these lights are extinguished. Fatal accidents have occurred because of this hazard.  In Laois, a number of people were killed as a result of crashing into tar barrels at the side of the county road.  Local authorities should be prohibited from leaving these barrels at the side of the road.  If that prohibition cannot be fully implemented, then the barrels should be painted with luminous paint. There are other obstructions, apart from tar barrels.  Very often steam-rolling impedimenta are left at the side of the road, as is certain local authority machinery.  If an end is put to this practice, there will be an appreciable drop in fatal accidents on our roads.</P>
    <P>The provision of safety belts in new cars should be considered by the Minister.  Each new car that comes off the assembly line is fitted with every manner of modern appliance. It should be possible to fit it also with a safety belt.  I have no doubt that car owners will themselves be prepared to fit their not so up-to-date cars with safety belts.  Certainly all new cars should have safety belts fitted in the two front seats.</P>
    <P>With regard to the registration of bicycles, I want to say here and now that I am opposed to any tax on bicycles.  Bicycles are the only means the poor man has of getting to his work.  They are the only means many children have of getting to school.  I fail to see why there should be a tax imposed on a household because that household uses bicycles.  If the Minister wishes, there can be a registration of bicycles.  I would strongly disapprove of any attempt to impose a tax on bicycles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quoting from the Bill but from the memorandum.  I am telling the Minister that I am opposed to a tax on bicycles.  Motor taxation, lorry taxation, tractor taxation, and other taxation have all been increased, and I hope there will be no question of taxing bicycles.  There have been cases <Col N="960" />&mdash;and the Gardaí have been notified time and again&mdash;of people carrying passengers on crossbars, handle-bars or carriers of bicycles, and very serious accidents have resulted.  It is most unfair to motorists and to the drivers of other vehicles for cyclists to carry passengers on the handle-bars, crossbars or the carrier.  I hope that will be regarded as a serious offence and that consideration will be given by the Minister to it.</P>
      <P>Some cyclists go &ldquo;bravoing&rdquo; along with their hands off the handle-bars of the bicycle.  Such people are a danger on the public road, not only to themselves but to the people they meet. That should be looked upon as a very serious offence and there should be severe fines on such people.  We see them in the city of Dublin also frequently. It should be considered a serious offence to cycle three abreast and I hope serious notice will be taken of such offences.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether a driving test will improve the standard of driving because, as other Deputies have said, driving is a matter of commonsense and intelligence, and unless he has commonsense and intelligence, no test in the world will make a good driver.  There is a suggestion that the driving licence should cover three years.  That is a good suggestion, as it would save people from having to renew their licences every year.  It is a well-known fact that people do not always get a reminder that their driving licence has expired.  Local authorities send out notices that car tax or lorry tax has expired, but some local authorities do not send out notification that a driving licence has expired, and people who do not intend to break the law have been found driving without a licence.  It would be very convenient for the holder of a licence if it covered a three-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very serious view should be taken of a motorist who fails to dim his lights.  Everyone who travels from Dublin to Naas knows that there is a straight patch of road near Kill.  A number of accidents have taken place on that road since it was straightened out.  The evidence given in court with <Col N="961" /> regard to those accidents showed that drivers failed to dim their lights.  Every car should be tested for a dimming device, and it should be the duty of the Garda to see that there is a proper dimming device on each vehicle.  People walking along the road are completely blinded by those dazzling lights, and some lorries have high-powered spot lights, which I consider should be illegal.  Out of pure villainy, some drivers do not dim those high-powered spot lights when meeting another car. They should be made to realise the seriousness of that practice and that it could mean not only the loss of their own lives but the loss of a number of lives, perhaps the life of a father of a family.  It is most essential, therefore, to see that all cars, lorries and other vehicles, are equipped with proper dimming devices, and trailers should be equipped with proper danger lights.</P>
    <P>Everyone from the country realises there is a big difficulty in Dublin with regard to parking.  A number of people who come to the city for shopping purposes feel they are hunted from street to street by the Garda.  The Garda are very reasonable people and they have been reasonable in this regard, but they have a certain code of regulations which they must carry out under the supervision of their sergeants and inspectors.  The parking facilities in Dublin certainly must be worse than in any city in Europe.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made by Dublin Corporation, and it has been suggested that the Liffey could be covered over and used as a suitable car park. Special arrangements should be made to provide proper car parks in order that people will know where they can park.  I have known country people who came to Dublin on a shopping expedition and drove into Grafton Street.  They were hunted from there by the Garda and went to O'Connell Street, but found no place to park there.  They then went down Mary Street and were hunted away, with the result that they had to park well out of the city.  Parking arrangements are most unsatisfactory and Dublin Corporation have a duty to provide proper parking facilities in this, the principal city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> Local authorities should be generous with grants for the purpose of providing suitable car parks in towns.  In large provincial towns, we see cars parked on both sides of a street because the local authority did not make a bye-law.  They are a hindrance to the free flow of heavy traffic.  I hope that when the Bill becomes law, arrangements will be made for each local authority to submit proposals to the Minister in regard to the provision of car parks, and that reasonable 50/50 grants will be made available for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to animals wandering on the roads.  They are a source of great danger.  In many cases, cows or horses roam around the public roads, having got out of fields without the knowledge of their owners.  Quite a number of the itinerant class also have horses, ponies, goats, dogs, etc., roaming on the public roads.  Arrangements should be made to keep these animals off the roads.  I hope and trust that when we tighten up these regulations, we will have a suitable section dealing with that problem.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the fines-on-the-spot proposition because I do not think the fines could be collected.  If a person is guilty of a parking offence and is approached by an officer of the Garda Síochána who says: &ldquo;You have now overstayed the parking limit; I am fining you 10/-&rdquo;, and if he has not got the money, how is the fine to be collected?  He may not report to the local Garda.  What is the procedure in that case?  I believe the collection of fines on the spot will not work.  It would cause endless trouble and inconvenience to all concerned. I know there is the option of going to court but that is equally distasteful. I would say there would be great difficulty in collecting fines on the spot.</P>
    <P>A very serious view should be taken of failure by motorists to report accidents.  All accidents should be reported to the proper authorities.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I want to raise and I notice it is mentioned in the memorandum circulated by the Department of Local Government, <Col N="963" /><i>Proposals for Road Traffic Legislation</i>, 1960.  At page 13 it states:</P>
    <P>A local authority may make bye-laws to prevent the obstruction of traffic by fairs and markets.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that an effort can be made, under the various local authority machinery, to kill fairs and markets in towns, if they so desire?  That is very serious for some towns.  Some towns are trying to revive and build up fairs so as to increase business and spending. The Minister for Local Government is about to authorise the making of bye-laws to prevent the obstruction of traffic by fairs and markets.  The farming community will not like that. Fairs and country markets have almost disappeared.  Now, some local authorities, probably at the whim of the county manager, may forthwith declare a fair or market an obstruction to traffic and decide it shall be held elsewhere. Thousands of people will object to that.  The Minister will not get away with the idea of killing country fairs.</P>
    <P>If he has in mind that local authorities should provide fair greens, I would point out that that has been tried in many country towns.  A fair green established over a number of years is quite all right.  In most provincial towns, the fairs are held along the main streets.  That has been the pattern for generations.  They have brought business to the town.  To interfere with the fairs and markets will cause severe injury.  This is the thin end of the wedge to give the farmer a kick in every piece of Fianna Fáil legislation.</P>
    <P>Interference with fairs and markets for the purpose of facilitating traffic will be strenuously opposed.  What will the farmers think if they will not be allowed to attend their fairs and markets in the most convenient places and where they have been held for generations?  What will they think when they are told the fairs and markets cannot be held in the usual places so as to facilitate some speed ace who, on a wet day, will flash by them and splash them from head to foot and laugh at them?  It is hard enough to sell a beast at the moment without <Col N="964" /> introducing legislation to do away with our present pattern of fairs and markets. Is the farmer to be sent home? I trust the Minister will take a very serious view of that matter.</P>
    <P>Special arrangement should be made to erect barriers outside national schools alongside main roads in urban areas so that the children will not be free to rush directly on to the roadway when leaving the school.  That will have to be dealt with by the school manager.  Local authorities say they have no function in the matter.  In many cases there are no paths.  The door of the school opens on to the verge of the road in some cases and there have been quite a number of fatal accidents.  School teachers do their very best to warn the children. It is understandable that, in his desire to get out of school, the child will run straight into oncoming traffic.  Suitable barriers should be erected, wherever necessary, outside schools.  Grants should be made available to school managers to assist them to provide such barriers.  In addition, more traffic wardens should be appointed for school children in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I have seen traffic wardens outside schools at Inchicore.  They are doing a very good job.  They are easily seen in their white coats.  They are very kind, courteous and helpful to children crossing the roads.  We should have school traffic wardens in every area where large numbers of children attend a school.</P>
    <P>There is a platform in O'Connell street on which a Garda is on traffic duty.  Yesterday evening and this morning, I spent a considerable time watching the Garda operating there. I noted how much notice was taken of his signalling and of his use of the whistle.  It is a good idea.  It may not look the best but it is worth while continuing it.  Motorists can easily catch sight of the Garda.  The white batons for directing traffic are also a good idea.  As a result of the traffic platform on O'Connell Bridge, there is a quicker flow of traffic in O'Connell Street.  It would be well to consider the erection of similar platforms in other parts of the city.  However, that is not a matter for consideration now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> The A.A., Bord Fáilte and others have done a good job in the sign-posting of roads.  More safety signs should be provided.  Any money spent in that way is well spent.</P>
    <P>On the whole, this measure is long overdue.  Were it not for steps taken by the Fine Gael Party in respect of this legislation, the present Government would have put it on the long finger.  It has been on the long finger for four years and I am glad to see it at last.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be a general improvement in the standard of courtesy on the roads.  We desire to see a substantial reduction in, if not the total elimination of, fatal accidents.  There should be greater co-operation between the motorist and the general public and between the general public, the motorist and the Garda.  All that is wanted is co-operation.  I trust that people charged with the responsibility of administering this law, the district justices and others, will be given a headline on fines.  The fines in the Bill are not sufficiently heavy.</P>
    <P>We shall have a lot of exchanges of views on the Committee Stage.  My only fault with this Bill is that it is too lenient with regard to serious offences.  There is a comeback for the drunken driver.  If I had my way, he would be given no comeback but he would be kept completely off the roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan spoke about fines on the spot.  Typically, he likes to misrepresent what is generally before him in this House.  The Bill does not provide for fines on the spot.  It provides for tickets to be issued.  The person has the option of going to the police station and paying a fine, if he admits he is guilty of the offence, or, if he wishes to defend the case, he can go into court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan said it is apparently the intention to put fairs off the streets in our various towns. Under this legislation, only the local authority can do this.  I do not know whether I am prying into the Deputy's mind or not.  He is a member of a local authority, and perhaps further <Col N="966" /> to misrepresent the position under this Bill, he might intend to press that such action would be taken in the local authority area for which he is responsible.</P>
    <P>He also said the bicycles will be taxed.  Again, he misrepresented the position, as I read it.  The Bill suggests that a registration fee of 2/6d. might be fixed over 10 years as a protection, particularly against theft.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, public opinion has been aroused by the press, by individuals and groups of individuals regarding our road traffic and the problems connected with it.  Efforts have been made to speed up the traffic and efforts have been made to slow it down.  We have had campaigns for additional parking space in the central city areas, and we have had campaigns to do away with parking in certain streets.  We have had people expressing the view that there should be wider and better roads and bridges, and we have had other people expressing the view that in certain streets there should be one-way traffic only.  We have had campaigns to have obstacles and monuments removed from the centre of thoroughfares, and other campaigns to have new ones erected.  All in all, it was obvious that some type of comprehensive legislation was required.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on this Bill.  It certainly is a most comprehensive piece of legislation.  It makes new laws or permits regulations to be made in respect of everything about which public opinion has been aroused.  Although I feel some of the provisions might be altered, I would prefer to support every single provision in this Bill rather than have any delay in having this comprehensive legislation made law.</P>
    <P>I have some criticisms.  I am sure my first criticism is not the Minister's fault.  In my view&mdash;I know I have not been here many years&mdash;this is a very cumbersome Bill.  If there was not urgency about having comprehensive legislation brought in fairly quickly, I would have probably made an earnest appeal to the Minister to get a small committee, consisting of, say, a Parliamentary draftsman, one or two legal gentlemen, a professor of English and <Col N="967" /> a chairman holding some prominent position in business, somebody like Mr. &ldquo;Tod&rdquo; Andrews, and say to this committee: &ldquo;Here is the Bill.  Rewrite it so that it may be easily understood and so that it can be reduced in size.&rdquo; However, to cover every conceivable aspect of this very complex problem, it has probably been found necessary to have such a lengthy Bill.  Even to read it completely takes several hours.</P>
    <P>The first confusion I came across in the Bill is in Section 1.  I do not think that the heading of the Bill &ldquo;Road Traffic Bill, 1960&rdquo; and Section 1 are in agreement.  Section 1 states &ldquo;This Act may be cited as the Road Traffic Act, 1961.&rdquo;&ldquo;1960&rdquo; and &ldquo;1961&rdquo; might lead to confusion at a later date.</P>
    <P>I have a few other queries in regard to the interpretations.  The first is in relation to parking.  The interpretation section states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;park&rdquo;, in relation to a vehicle, means keep or leave stationary, and cognate words shall be construed accordingly;</P>
    <P>When a bus stops to pick up or leave down passengers, is it considered to be parked?  If not, therefore, is it legal at present for a private car to stop where parking is prohibited in order to let down passengers?</P>
    <P>I think I have figured out another description in the Bill, that which refers to a &ldquo;Pedestrian-controlled mechanically propelled vehicle.&rdquo; Deputies will agree, particularly Deputy Sherwin, that the description is rather cumbersome.  The interpretation section states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;pedestrian-controlled mechanically propelled vehicle&rdquo; means a mechanically propelled vehicle&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  which is neither intended nor adapted for use for carrying the driver or a passenger, or</P>
    <P>(b)  which is intended or adapted so that there are alternative methods of driving it, namely, by a person carried on it or by a pedestrian,</P>
    <P>except during a period during which <Col N="968" /> it is driven while carrying the driver or a passenger;</P>
    <P>That is a very complicated description. It took me some time to figure out what exactly a pedestrian-controlled mechanically propelled vehicle is.  I may not even yet have arrived at the right conclusion.  I take it that it is something like a mechanically propelled lawn mower.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point for me when replying?</P>
    <P>This is the type of thing one comes across in the Bill.  I found I had to read some of the provisions twice or three times to understand what the implications were.  Probably all the phraseology in the Bill is recognised Parliamentary phraseology and is perfectly correct legally, but when the man-in-the-street comes across something like that before he has got through the first dozen pages, he will say: &ldquo;I shall throw it away and go down and get my solicitor to advise me if I am to be found guilty of an offence under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My main criticism of the Bill is that I believe, in order to satisfy public opinion to the maximum extent possible, a certain amount of the liberty and of the constitutional rights of the individual have been interfered with. Admittedly, the provisions satisfy to a very great extent the demand of public opinion, of mass thinking.  At the same time, we must never forget the rights of the individual.  It is not always possible to prescribe that the penalties provided in any Bill impose the same hardships on one person as on another.</P>
    <P>For example, at Column 397, Volumn 186, No. 3, of the Official Report, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>....the fact that some accidents are unavoidable and the fact that very many are due not to any serious culpability on the part of road users but to a brief distraction or an honest error in judgment, there can be no doubt that a considerable number are without excuse.</P>
    <P>Then, at Column 408, he said that some of these consequential disqualifications are:</P>
    <P>(c)  light, but, nevertheless, irksome <Col N="969" /> disqualification in the case of certain minor offences, where the offence is repeated three times or more in a year.  These offences are listed also.</P>
    <P>Let us be very clear on one point. If a person driving a car&mdash;a person who is commonly referred to as a weekend driver&mdash;purely and solely for domestic and pleasure purposes is disqualified under the provisions relating to minor offences in this Bill, it certainly can be considered an irksome disqualification, but in the case of the lorry driver, the deliveryman, the commercial traveller and other such people, such a disqualification could mean the loss of his right to earn his livelihood in a particular trade. It could mean loss of his job and considerable hardship and suffering on that particular family.  In these matters, I think justice would be better administered if the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; were used in these various provisions which I will come to later on in my speech. In fact, there are provisions in the case of an appeal where the court can take certain factors into consideration as to whether an appeal to restore a licence should be upheld or not, but, again, as I said, I would still prefer to support every single provision in this Bill rather than cause any delay in having it implemented.</P>
    <P>It is a point, I think, that merits consideration and it might be more advisable to give the courts an indication of what the State would like to have done in these cases rather than make it mandatory upon them to bring in these disqualifications.</P>
    <P>I should like to make another observation. I think that every Fine Gael speaker who stood up here started his contribution to this House with expressions like: &ldquo;It took a Fine Gael Private Members' Motion to bring this Bill before the House.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>They only approved of the heads of a Bill, as far as I understand.  I am quite certain from my own information that there was no Bill drafted when the Coalition left office and that this Bill was drafted on the instructions of the present Minister and covers a large number of points that were not public issues when the Coalition were last in office.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to a recommendation that came from the Dublin Corporation about a year ago.  The Committee appointed by the Corporation to look after matters of this kind in the Corporation's interest made a suggestion that a permanent committee might be set up in relation to Dublin traffic problems and that this permanent committee, consisting of Garda, Corporation, C.I.E., Port and Docks and other representatives, would, in a permanent capacity, help to advise the Commissioner on all proposals for traffic regulations in the city area.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to see that Section 6 of the Bill does not make provision for such a committee.  I believe that its existence would be useful and helpful to the Commissioner, if he wished to consult them regarding any bye-laws he might intend to make.  It might help the administration of traffic.  I know that the Minister examined these proposals in very great detail.  I am quite sure that they were turned down on the very best advice.  However, the considerations that led him to his decision on this matter would be of interest to people interested in local affairs in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing that subsections (5) and (6) of Section 6 give recognition to the elected representatives in the local authority areas.  They enable them to have some official say after the notice of intention to make a bye-law has been given.  It is a reserved function of the local authority to make representations regarding any bye-law made by the Commissioner.  I think this is an extremely good thing, because the local councillors and local representatives, generally, are very familiar with the problems in their own areas. Wherever there are danger spots, <Col N="971" /> wherever traffic is too fast or wherever there are traffic jams or whatever the problems are in their own areas, the local representative is invariably approached by residents' committees, the members of his own political organisation or by individuals calling upon him at his home or at Leinster House.</P>
    <P>In fact, at times, I would be inclined to believe that if subsection (1) were to read that &ldquo;after consultation with the appropriate local authority, a bye-law may be made by the Commissioner,&rdquo; it might be a better thing. It certainly would be a better thing in one way, but at the same time, I realise it would cause delays in having these bye-laws carried out because the Commissioner might decide to introduce a bye-law and consult the local authority about it.  Eventually, it would come up at council meetings and it might even become a major political issue at a local election as to whether a certain bye-law should be made.  The Minister has done the right thing in making the Commissioner responsible and then putting the onus on the local authority to make representations regarding any bye-law made.</P>
    <P>With regard to subsection (3) of Section 8, there is just one small point which I should like to have clarified, if possible.  Is it proposed to employ additional people under this section or is it that people already being employed and paid from a different source are now to be paid from the Road Fund or is it simply a reenactment of a previous section?  We might get clarification on that point later on.</P>
    <P>With regard to Sections 9, 13, 87 and probably others, I often wonder would it be possible to indicate in the Bill itself a definite method by which moneys collected under this Bill could be disposed of?  We had experience in this House, under a Coalition Government, where not only the Road Fund was raided for other purposes but that, owing to great shortage of money and the lack of responsibility to face up to the problems which that shortage created, money was collected from <Col N="972" /> every available source even though that money might not originally have been placed for the purpose for which it was subsequently spent.</P>

I believe that that would be a protection against the unlikely possibility of another Coalition getting into office, At least it would bring such a Government into the open if they wanted to use any money collected under this Bill.  If, for instance, instead of putting it into the C.I.E. Benevolent Fund, they wished to use it to bolster their own budgetary deficiencies, they would then have to come to the House with amending legislation in order to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider trying up this matter as tightly as possible.  When I was reading Section 11, I wondered if subsection (2) was necessary.  It seems to me that subsection (1) gives all the necessary powers.  It says that the Minister may make regulations in relation to the use of vehicles in public places and it goes on to specify various heads under which regulations may be made.  This appears also in Section 18 (10), Section 42, subsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) and Sections 75, 82, 86, 88, 89, 90, 91 and 114.  It certainly gives a very clear idea of the Minister's thoughts as to the line these regulations should take, but at the same time I hope that it does not restrict the Commissioner or any person responsible in future, in the event of new circumstances or new types of traffic coming on to the roads, which is not beyond the power of imagination, in making other regulations as they may appear to become necessary.</P>
      <P>However, in relation to these subheads in subsection (2) of Section 11, where regulations can be made for the equipment of such driver or passengers, I understand that this probably refers to the possibility of making compulsory the use of safety belts in cars. If this is so, I urge the Minister to ensure that regulations are made as quickly as possible in that regard.  In these regulations, specifications regarding the approved type should be clearly laid down.  Some enterprising persons, I have been informed, in England especially, have put safety belts on the market which for all practical purposes are useless.  As far as possible, there should be protection from the enterprise of unscrupulous persons who may try to cash in on any regulations that may be made under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his address, the Minister referred to the primary loss in road accidents being the wastage of human beings and the unnecessary suffering which results.  That is at Column 398 of the Official Report.  It is quite clear that the enforcement of regulations <Col N="974" /> under this section would contribute much more to the reduction of fatalities and serious injuries on the road than any increased penalties and disqualifications might contribute.</P>
    <P>I note too in paragraph (g), and I wonder is it a misprint, that regulations may be made for the use of loudspeakers in vehicles.  I wonder if these regulations are to be in connection with a wireless in a car, or if this should have read &ldquo;the use of loudspeakers on vehicles.&rdquo;  I know there has been a lot of public agitation about and criticism of the use of loudspeakers on vehicles in public places and I wonder if that is a misprint.</P>
    <P>Again, regulations are already in force regarding the fixing of registration plates on motor cars, but in the case of commercial vehicles, the regulations require, in some circumstances, that the name and address of the owner of the vehicles be painted on it.  I often wonder if this regulation was really necessary or if it might be done away with.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (4) says:</P>
    <P>Where a person contravenes subsection (3) of this section, he and, if he is not the owner of the vehicle or combination of vehicles, such owner shall each be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I am not too clear about this.  From the explanatory memorandum, it is clear that both the driver and the owner of the vehicle can be prosecuted and found guilty of the same offence.  As I understand it, both can suffer the same penalties.  I wonder if that could be phrased in a slightly different fashion, so that if the driver is not to be found, the owner could be prosecuted and in those circumstances the guilt fixed on one person or another.</P>
    <P>In Section 13 (b), I take it that the compensation will be paid to the road authorities who are responsible for road repairs or is it intended that the compensation will go into the Road Fund from which grants are made available for the roads?  These are matters about which I was curious.</P>
    <P>In relation to weighbridges, it is provided that road authorities may, or if required by the Minister shall, provide on or adjacent to a public place, <Col N="975" /> a weighbridge to such dimensions, etc., as may be approved by the Minister. In subsection (6), the road authority may contribute, on such conditions as they think fit, to the cost of the provision, maintenance or operation of an appointed weighbridge, other than a road traffic weighbridge.  The inference I take from this section is that a road authority may not in certain circumstances contribute towards the cost.  Again, in subsection (7) the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in subsection (a) implies that a refusal can be made for its use by the Garda Síochána.  I feel that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; might be better. In relation to subsections (2) and (6), there might be some contradiction and perhaps the Minister would have another look to see if they are in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On 16th February, 1961 I addressed the following Question to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs why a registered letter from the Department of Local Government dated 23rd December, 1960, and addressed to the Chairman of Mountmellick Town Commissioners c/o Town Hall, Mountmellick, was not delivered; if this registered communication has been traced; and if he will give an explanation concerning it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave a most unsatisfactory reply.  He said that the registered letter referred to was posted at the peak of Christmas mail pressure, that it had been established that it was not amongst the registered mails which reached Mountmellick at the material time but that it had not been possible to determine the cause of this failure or to trace the missing item. For the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to give a reply of that kind to a Question asking the whereabouts of a registered letter shows incompetence <Col N="976" /> and inefficiency so far as his Department is concerned.</P>
    <P>I put it to you, Sir, that the Department of Local Government, on the instructions of the Minister for Local Government, sent to the Chairman of Mountmellick Town Commissioners by registered post on 23rd December a very important document signed by Mr. P. Maguire, Local Government Auditor and dated 22nd November, 1960.  It was an auditor's report dealing with the financial structure of the local authority over which the Chairman presided.  It dealt in particular with the presentation of accounts. While the terms of the communication contained in the registered letter are of no concern in this debate, I put it to the House that the document was an urgent and important one and was sent on the instructions of a Minister of State to the Chairman of a local authority.</P>
    <P>Why is a letter registered?  Is it not in order to ensure safe delivery? It should be all the same to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs whether a letter is registered on Christmas Eve, New Year's Day or Midsummer's Day.  A registered letter is paid for and a receipt is obtained for it.  It is stamped at the various offices of departure and arrival.  For some reason unknown to me but perhaps known to somebody outside this House, the letter did not arrive.  The Minister tells us that he received this registered letter on 23rd December at the peak of the Christmas rush but I argue that a packet is registered to ensure delivery.  Is it customary for registered letters to go astray?  If it is, why should people register letters at all?</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say in his reply on the 16th February that he had made inquiries and that he was satisfied that the letter was posted. The Department of Local Government have a receipt for it.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs got the registered letter.  While in transit between Mountmellick and Dublin the letter was lost.  Who is responsible for it?  I put it to this House that that letter was stolen while it was in the custody of the Minister for Posts and <Col N="977" /> Telegraphs.  It is the duty of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to ascertain the whereabouts of any registered communication.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if this is the only case of a registered letter going astray?  This is a case where a State Department handed in an important auditor's report that was awaited by the local authority with suspicion, that was anxiously awaited by the Chairman.  It never arrived although it was posted by the Department of Local Government.  Does it not give good grounds for grave suspicion? I say that this is a most unusual case.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that there were a number of registered letters posted by the Department of Local Government on the same day.  Is it not a fact that every other registered letter posted by the Department on that day was delivered?  This is the only one that was not delivered.  Who in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was responsible for taking this letter out of the postal service and having it destroyed, torn up, burned, and who made sure for certain reasons that it would not reach the Chairman of the local authority to whom it was addressed?</P>
    <P>There is a special bag for registered communications.  Registered communications are counted and put into the bag which is locked and sealed.  There is no excuse whatever for loss.  The only way that a registered packet can be mislaid is by being stolen.  I put it to the Minister that this registered letter was stolen.  The Minister is trying to get out of it by saying that it was the peak of the Christmas rush.  Is that any excuse for registered letter going astray? If a registered letter went astray how many unregistered packets would be liable to go astray?  This was a registered letter from one State Department to another State Department. The Department of Local Government placed it in the hands of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for safe custody, to ensure proper delivery. They got a receipt for it.  It never reached its destination.  I want <Col N="978" /> to know what inquiries the Minister has made in regard to this matter. He admits that it was not delivered, that it cannot be traced and that it is not possible to determine the cause of the failure or to trace the missing item.</P>
    <P>If all the officers of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were alerted, if they were minding their business, if they were seeing to it that registered letters reached their destination, certainly they would have ensured safe delivery of this important and urgent communication from a local government auditor sent on the instructions of a Minister.</P>
    <P>What makes me suspicious is the fact that this was the only registered packet that, to the knowledge of the Department of Local Government or of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, was missing.  I put it to the Minister that it was stolen.  I warn the Minister to be more alert in cases of this kind. He cannot tell us whether the letter arrived at Portlaoise or not.  I feel that the letter did not arrive at Portlaoise because if the letter had arrived at Portlaoise there would be a record of it and the Portlaoise stamp would be on it or at least the registered mail bag would have arrived at Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>We are quite satisfied that it was posted.  The Department of Local Government have a receipt for it.  It was only one of many registered letters sent on that day and the letter that contained serious allegations about the finances of the local authority was the only one that went astray.  It was bad work on the part of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It was failure on the part of the Minister's Department. It means that registration no longer gives a guarantee of delivery.  If the Department of Posts and Telegraphs allow registered packets to be stolen while in their custody, the Department are falling down on their job.  The Department should not have allowed themselves to be used as pawns and tools to prevent the contents of the documents in question from getting into the hands of a man to whom it was addressed and who required it.</P>
    <P>The occasion has presented itself to say that on all similar occasions <Col N="979" /> registered communications from the Department of Local Government were always received when addressed to the chairman of local authorities in the various districts.  I ask the Minister to give us a clear explanation, if there is a guarantee of safe delivery for registered communications, why this communication was not delivered safely.  People are encouraged to register parcels and other mail in the interests of safe delivery.  There is a higher fee charged for this service. The Department of Local Government have done their job in the best interests of the local authority in registering this letter on 24th December. Assuming that the Christmas pressure was there, it would not have been difficult to have it delivered on 27th or 28th December.  I put it to the Minister that because of the contents of the communication, it was deliberately stolen from the Department's offices.</P>
    <P>What guarantees has the public, if there is a reason for stealing a document within the Post Office service, that it will not be done?  I raise this matter in the proper spirit and in the hope that there will be no recurrence of this incident.  If we are to have confidence in the registration of packets and letters, there should be some guarantee given by the Minister that they will not be stolen or lost in the post.  I charge the Department of Posts and Telegraphs with grave negligence and with failing in their duty.  They undertake responsibility for safe delivery and that has not taken place in this case nor has the Minister given us a satisfactory explanation.</P>

      <P>On 16th February, this question was put to me by Deputy Flanagan.  I gave him the only answer I could give to the question he put and I feel I am not called upon to give any further answer than I have already given.  The Deputy has quoted the answer I gave him on that date and in answer to a supplementary question I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot say whether it arrived in <Col N="980" /> Portlaoise or not, but we do know it did not arrive in Mountmellick. There were 18,000 registered items in the registered enclosure in Pearse Street that day.  Seventy-nine registered items were sent from Dublin to Portlaoise.  When the number of registered items is large, there is not an individual record on the bill sent with the items.  Only the number of items is recorded on the bill.  Between Portlaoise and Mountmellick 14 items were for forwarding.  They were recorded individually on the bill, but there is no record of this item on the bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said he said it.  The Deputy is making charges of incompetence against the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and he is alleging they are pawns and tools in this game and that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as a Department assisted in the extraction of this letter which was sent in and registered on the relevant date.  I want to tell the Deputy, the House and the public that no postal service or postal authority gives a guarantee that every registered letter will get safe delivery.  No postal authority could give that guarantee. We do not give it.  There is a loss in registered packages of one in 40,000 packages and the fee itself carries with it a certain percentage to cover insurance against loss so that the Department will be able to pay when loss occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give the Deputy an outline as to how the registration system works.  A special registration number is assigned to every packet accepted in the service.  Originally, it was the practice to keep an individual record of every movement of a registered letter during its treatment in the post. A counter clerk would itemise on a bill the registration number of every packet dispatched to his sorting office; within the sorting office, registration numbers would likewise be scrupulously listed at every transfer by the clerks working in the registered enclosure; when dispatches were made up for transmission to other offices, the bills would show the registration number of each packet; and the same process would be continued <Col N="982" /> right down to the final stage of receipt at the delivery office.</P>
    <P>This procedure left little scope for loss of registered items, though in fact some losses did occur, but it was so inordinately costly that it was decided about 30 years ago to modify it in this way: (1) where the traffic is great, transfers of large numbers of registered items would be advised by showing the total number of the registered packets concerned, the individual registration particulars not being listed, but (2) where the traffic is low, the registration numbers would continue to be itemised.</P>
    <P>Under that system, the registered letters left Dublin on the day in question. Seventy-nine of them were sent from Dublin to Portlaoise.  In the dispatch from Portlaoise to Mountmellick, this particular registered item was not among the registered letters. The Department made inquiries in regard to the missing letter.</P>
    <P>The Department has an Investigation Branch and whenever it comes to notice that a letter is missing or that letters are being interfered with or any misdemeanour is taking place in any part of the service, or in any post office, the Investigation Branch proceeds to investigate.  Thank God, the incidence of these offences is very low in comparison with the number working in the Post Office service. Our Post Office service is staffed by people, the very great majority of whom, I am satisfied, are perfectly honest in all their dealings with the Post Office and the public.</P>
    <P>If a person is found guilty of interfering with the post or taking money, or committing any criminal offence of that nature, the investigation officers have such persons charged, whenever the solicitor to the Post Office says that a charge can be sustained.  These matters are of course always referred to the Minister and in cases where the Minister can dismiss the person concerned, dismissal takes place.  In cases where the Minister has not authority to dismiss&mdash;in the case of a civil servant, he must go to the Government&mdash;a submission is made to the Government for authority to dismiss such a person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> That has been the practice in the Post Office over the years and it still continues.  All I can say is that every care is taken with letters entrusted to the Post Office and to see that each letter of the millions received is delivered to the address for which the writer intended it.</P>
    <P>Our Post Office service is efficient <Col N="984" /> in comparison with any post office in the world.  It is more efficient and gives better service in delivering items entrusted to it than most postal services in the world.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 1st March, 1961.</P>
