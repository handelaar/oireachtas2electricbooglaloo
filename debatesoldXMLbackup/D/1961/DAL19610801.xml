    <P>The following Question appeared on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Briscoe:</P>
    <P>1.  To ask the Taoiseach whether since February, 1948, any person or persons, while holding the office of Attorney General, held any other office, post or appointment; and, if so, if he will state in each case the nature of the posts in question, and the remuneration attaching to each.</P>

      <P>The Attorney General who held office from the 2nd June, 1954, to the 20th March, 1957, held a Professorship in the Faculty of Law in University College, Dublin. There is no information available in my Department as to the remuneration paid to him by University College, Dublin, during that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will now reply to such portions of Questions Nos. 1 to 18 (inclusive) of the 21st June, 1961, relating to the Common Market as have not been fully replied to in the White Paper laid on the Table of the House on 30th June, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 21st June, some of the questions he had then put down and portions of others relate to matters which would be the subject of detailed negotiations in the event of Ireland's applying for membership of the European Economic Community and consequently it would not be in the national interest for me to indicate views on them at that stage.  This is still the position.  I stated at the same time that it would not be possible to discuss the implications for us of membership of the Community until the terms of accession were clarified in the course of detailed negotiations and that a White Paper covering these matters would then be published as a basis for discussion by the Dáil of the decision proposed by the Government. In the circumstances it would serve no useful purpose and might, indeed, create confusion if I were to deal now with those portions of his questions of 21st June to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>Many of the matters covered by those questions have of course been dealt with in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not appreciate that industrialists and other persons are anxious to know the situation as it exists in relation to the other six countries now constituting the Common Market and will he not therefore make the information available so that they can judge accordingly?  I particularly refer to Question No. 13 on 21st June, which is the Question relating to taxation and retooling, which are of vital interest to manufacturing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It would be a very difficult matter of investigation to get that information in a form which would be of value and under circumstances which would enable us to guarantee <Col N="2229" /> its accuracy.  I have no doubt that in time the institutions of the Community will themselves publish information dealing with these matters which will, I think, serve the needs of people in this country requiring it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not have been better, therefore, if the Taoiseach had accepted the motion put down in this House four years ago?  The information would now be available.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give the value of raw materials imported and actually used in the manufacture of margarine.  The information available relates to the value of imports classified to certain headings in the Official Import List which include raw materials imported which could be used in the manufacture of margarine, either in the state in which they are imported or after preliminary processing.  I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the value of such raw materials imported in each year 1957 to 1960.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>VALUE of raw materials imported in each of the years 1957 to 1960 which could be used in the manufacture of Margarine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The nature of the Deputy's question makes it necessary that I give once again the salient facts of this case.</P>
      <P>Three matters fell to be considered by the recent inquiry.  These were:</P>
      <P>(1)  the allegation that since court proceedings taken by a Mr. Hurley against the teacher concerned, this teacher had ignored the Hurley children;</P>
      <P>(2)  allegations by a Mrs. O'Sullivan of ill-treatment of her children;</P>
      <P>(3)  the further allegation by Mrs. O'Sullivan that since the court proceedings to which I have already referred her child had been ignored by the teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The senior of the three National School inspectors who conducted the inquiry found from the school records that none of the Hurley children enrolled in the teacher's class had attended school since the court proceedings. Accordingly, the allegation in the <Col N="2244" /> case of the Hurley children that the teacher ignored them had no substance &mdash;the teacher could not have refused to teach children who were not in his class.  That being so Mr. Hurley's allegation did not fall to be considered by the inquiry and he had no <i>locus standi</i> in relation to it.  Incidentally, Mr. Hurley has since acknowledged the fact that he did not send the children concerned to the school since the court proceedings.</P>
    <P>The evidence which the doctor was being called on to give related to matters which were the subject of the court proceedings.  These matters having been disposed of by the court and having been previously investigated by me and action in relation to the teacher having been taken by me in regard to them, there could be no question of reopening them at the inquiry.</P>
    <P>I have seen the record of the evidence given at the inquiry.  It is not true that one of the parents who signed a document asking that the teacher be retained admitted under crossexamination that his daughter had been beaten but that he signed the document because he wanted his child safe in future.</P>
    <P>There can be no question of inferring from the fact that the inquiry was a non-public inquiry that it was a secret inquiry.  Everyone who had any <i>locus standi</i> in relation to it was allowed to be present, to be legally represented and to call any witness that he desired to be called.</P>
    <P>The question of grave unrest in relation to the inquiry because of secrecy does not, therefore, arise nor does the remainder of the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I beg leave to state, for the information of the Dáil, that the Government have formally notified the Council of the European Economic Community that Ireland is an applicant for membership of the Community pursuant to Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>This application has been made in accordance with the policy of the Government as explained in previous statements and discussed in this House early in July after publication of the White Paper on the European Economic Community.  The Government believe that there is general acceptance of their view that, in the circumstances now developing, this policy is dictated by the national interest.</P>
      <P>In the communication which has been addressed to the President of the Council of the Community, the Government have stated that they fully share the ideals which inspired the parties to the Rome Treaty and that they accept the aims of the Community, as well as the action proposed to achieve those aims.</P>
      <P>It is provided in Article 237 of the Rome Treaty that the conditions of admission of a new member and the adaptations of the Treaty necessitated thereby will be the subject of an agreement between the Member States and the Applicant State.  The Government have requested the Council to arrange for discussions on the conditions and adaptations applicable to Ireland. When these discussions have taken place and the conditions on which Ireland can participate in the European Economic Community are known, a White Paper setting out the relevant facts and implications will, as the Government have already undertaken, be published before the approval of Dáil Éireann is sought for the final decision proposed by the Government.</P>

I should like to ask the Taoiseach whether he intends to lay on the Table of the House the precise terms of the communication addressed by the Government to the European Economic Community seeking membership of it.  The Taoiseach's statement spoke of &ldquo;the circumstances now developing.&rdquo;  I think it is right the House and the country should note the significance of those words &ldquo;the circumstances now developing,&rdquo; or the collapse and discredit of the whole Fianna Fáil concept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil policy of economic self-sufficiency has now given way to the realisation of the essential value of the British market to the economy of this country in consideration of its unique capacity to absorb the output of the agricultural industry of this country.  It is true that in the situation with which we are now confronted, and for which we are so ill prepared, the existence of list F in the Rome Treaty, which speaks of tariffs of 16 per cent. on cattle, 16 per cent. on pigs, 16 and 20 per cent. on meat and up to 80 per cent. on beet sugar, makes it unthinkable that we should allow a tariff wall of that character to separate us from the British market in the event of Great Britain joining the European Economic Community and our remaining outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no more true today than it was during the last quarter of a century that the British market is essential to our agricultural industry, but it is something of a surprise to me and to many others in the House and outside it that those who denied that simple <Col N="2248" /> economic proposition so trenchantly and so vigorously for the last quarter of a century have suddenly undergone this conversion within the last two months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But I think the Taoiseach should avail of the opportunity which will probably arise on the Adjournment Debate, when we come to discuss the subject matter of his Estimate with that of the Adjournment, to give the House some reassurance in respect of those whose livelihood is now called in question as a result of his high tariff policy, plus the developments associated with the emergence of the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>I refer, first of all, to those who have invested their capital in highly protected industries, the prospects of whose survival will be seriously jeopardised by the obligations of the Rome Treaty.  But I regard their problem as relatively simple of solution because our resources can be deployed to compensate them for any loss they undergo, and their loss can be measured in terms of money.  The people for whom I am more concerned are the people who have invested their lives in these industries.  I think of the man of 24 or 25 years of age who took employment in an industry 20 or 25 years ago and who will now find himself in middle age, with a skill appropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to the European Economic Community, our position is precisely what it might be expected to be, that is, that the vital interest of this country is to retain access to the British market.  In the light of Great Britain's decision to adhere to the European Economic Community, we are of opinion that this country should do likewise, just as we are satisfied, as we have always been satisfied, that free access to that market, as secured by us in the 1948 Trade Agreement, is vital to the future economic welfare of this country.  Such free access to that market can only be retained by us on the terms envisaged in the European Economic Community and, thereafter, we believe it will be necessary to adhere to that Community, but in the knowledge that in the negotiations of the protocols to provide for the special situation that exists in this country anxious negotiation will be requisite, and we trust that that negotiation will be in safe hands.</P>

      <P>I just want to ask the Taoiseach a few questions.  I wonder would he say, in respect of paragraph 2 of his statement, what the circumstances adverted to there are.  Does he mean the economic or the political circumstances or does he refer specifically to the mounting Berlin crisis?  Could the Taoiseach say if he has any idea when these negotiations or discussions as to our application will take place and can he say when they may conclude?  Would he also state whether or not our discussions will be independent of those of Britain? Will he state whether or not our discussions will coincide with the discussions between Britain and the European Economic Community?  The Taoiseach says in his statement that they, meaning the Council, have been requested to arrange for discussions on the conditions.  I may have heard him wrongly.  I am under the impression that a representative of the British Government is in either Paris or Brussels today to commence <Col N="2252" /> discussions on behalf of the British Government and I am wondering whether or not we are waiting to see how the British, first of all, get on at their discussions before we commence ours.  I should like the Taoiseach to make it clear whether or not our discussions will be independent of those of Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, as regards tabling the document, I will arrange for that in the course of a day or two.  Deputies can take it that the document is similar to the statement I have just made to the House.  With regard to the questions asked by Deputy Corish, the circumstances to which I referred in my statement are those which have brought about, or appear likely to bring about, decisions to join or associate with the Community by most of the remaining countries of Western Europe.  I cannot say when negotiations will start.  That will be a matter for the Council of the Community to decide but I think it is not likely that discussions will begin for some weeks to come and even, perhaps, for a longer period.  Our discussions will, of course, be separate to those undertaken by Great Britain. The Deputy's reference to a member of the British Government commencing negotiations today can hardly be correct.  As I understood the British Prime Minister's announcement, their application to begin negotiations with a view to membership will not be made until their parliamentary debate on the topic has concluded in a couple of days' time.</P>
      <P>It would be appropriate that this matter should be discussed in the debate on the Motion for the Adjournment and I hope, when that takes place, we shall have a more intelligent contribution from Deputy Dillon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, a worker who <Col N="2254" /> is an insured person under the Social Welfare Act, 1952 shall be deemed to be an employed person unless excluded under the next following subsection of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The intention of this amendment is to cover such workers as insurance workers who are paid on a commission basis.  I understand insurance agents paid on commission were not covered by the old Act and it is desirable they should have the same protection under this measure as other workers.  As I read the later amendments put down by the Minister I take it&mdash;I should like the Minister to tell me if I am correct&mdash;it is the intention to cover insurance workers.  If we get an assurance from the Minister that it is his intention to protect them under this Bill we shall be quite willing to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2), to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;()  Good Friday shall be a nonworking day and the provisions of this Act shall apply to that day as if it were a public holiday.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Good Friday has a particular significance for all of us and in recent years there has been an extension by employers of the practice of allowing their workers off from work on this day.  However, the situation is very confusing because in Dublin City, for instance, shops close at different times. Some will be closed for the whole day; others for part of the day.  Some industrial undertakings will be closed for the morning and others for the afternoon.  Good Friday is increasingly regarded as a day on which workers generally would like to refrain from work.</P>
      <P>The amendment is put down in this form to ensure that consideration will be on the basis that we are not seeking to have Good Friday regarded as a bank holiday in quite the same terms as in respect of Easter Monday, Whit Monday and the other bank holidays which are days of relaxation and enjoyment.  Good Friday is a particular day.  There has been a very widespread feeling among workers throughout the country that it would be only appropriate in this country that it should have special recognition and that such recognition should be given in the form mentioned in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that the entitlements proposed to be given to workers under this Bill are minimum entitlements and that in many cases statutory provision is not necessary because organised workers <Col N="2257" /> in many employments have achieved the entitlements proposed to be given in this Bill already and in some cases entitlements in excess of what is proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific amendment here, there are many workers who enjoy, by negotiation, Good Friday off as a holiday, but Good Friday is not a public holiday so declared by legislation.  The public holidays so declared are as set out in Section 8, subsection (1) of the Bill. They are Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter Monday, Whit Monday and the first Monday in August.  It is a function of the Government, under the Public Holidays Act, to designate what are, in fact, public holidays; it is not a function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. If and when the Government declare Good Friday to be a public holiday, there is provision in the Bill empowering the Minister for Industry and Commerce by regulation to declare workers entitled to Good Friday as a public holiday in the same manner as they enjoy the statutory public holidays at the present time.  In those circumstances, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister at this stage indicate whether there is a possibility of the matter being considered at a later stage by the Government in the light of his remarks?  This is obviously a question which no Deputy wishes to be a matter of controversy. Many thousands of workers do not work on Good Friday in many cases, not merely because of there being some negotiations, but in a wider number of cases because the employers close the businesses down.  In many cases that is done by agreement and in other cases by mutual decision.  I appreciate what the Minister told us. It is not a scheduled holiday under the particular Act.  We are aware of that. Perhaps, the Minister might be able to say whether it would be possible for the Government to consider this matter again in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that the Government have given it any consideration <Col N="2258" /> nor do I know that the Government intend to, but if and when there appears to be a necessity for it, no doubt the Government will give due consideration to declaring Good Friday a public holiday as is the case in respect of the other holidays.  In the meantime, I should not like to suggest to the House that it is proposed to declare Good Friday a public holiday.</P>

      <P>This is, in fact, an amendment to provide for the contingency mentioned by Deputy Larkin.  The section, as it stands, empowers the Minister to declare for the purposes of this section a public holiday which replaces an existing public holiday to be a public holiday for the purpose of the Act. The amendment now proposed intends to provide for the situation where the existing public holidays will remain and a new public holiday be added.  If and when Good Friday is added, this section empowers the Minister to declare that day to be a public holiday for the purpose of the Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to provide that where workers are called upon to work on public holidays they should be paid not on the basis of their day's pay plus the additional day's pay as proposed in the Bill but that they should get a total of three days' pay for working on the public holidays.  In moving these amendments, I should like to point out that while the old Holidays Act provided that a person who worked on a public holiday, if he did not get a day off, would be entitled to be paid on the basis of 25 per cent, in actual fact, for 30 years or more organised workers have enjoyed what is only now proposed in the Bill before the House&mdash; in other words, a double day, an additional day if they worked on a bank holiday.  In recent years many sections of organised workers have negotiated, by agreement, payments in excess of the double day when called upon to work on a bank holiday.  In this regard, I should like to point out to the Minister that our legislation provides for six bank holidays in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These bank holidays are looked forward to by every section of the community to whom they apply.  If an individual is called upon to forfeit the enjoyment of a bank holiday, whether it is Whit Monday, the August bank holiday which is now approaching, or Easter Monday, and in most cases relaxation with their family and friends, they should be entitled to <Col N="2260" /> proper compensation for such inconvenience. We feel that the provision in the present Bill is not adequate.</P>
    <P>There are people who by the nature of their employment do shift work, work at night, work at odd hours and work in broken time.  At least in the cases where people are covered by an Act which provides them with six public bank holidays, every effort should be made to ensure that they get those public holidays and, if they do not get them, they should get adequate compensation.  Does the Minister really think that when the bulk of the populace, we hope, are enjoying themselves in fine weather at race meetings and other sporting events, the seaside and other places, it is adequate compensation for a person who must work on that day to receive an additional day's pay?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a number of workers, by negotiation or otherwise, have procured compensation for themselves which is better than is provided in this Bill for having to work on a bank holiday.  There are other provisions in the section besides the proposed double pay provision.  If the worker likes, he can take a day off in lieu of the bank holiday on which he works within a month of the bank holiday or have a day added to his normal holiday period.  These are minimum statutory entitlements which workers will receive.</P>
      <P>The old provision was time and a quarter for work on a bank holiday. Double time is a pretty substantial advance on the <i>status quo</i>.  Many employers would find it very difficult to pay treble time for bank holiday work.  Organised workers can negotiate and have done so with big employers.  I do not think it would be reasonable to jump from time and a quarter to treble time for work on a bank holiday.  Many workers who are entitled to be free on the bank holiday would perhaps far prefer to have another day free instead.  On a bank holiday, it is difficult to get transport and perhaps accommodation, whereas another day might be more beneficial and certainly might be more enjoyable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2261" /> Many people put a lot of value on being free on a bank holiday but on the other hand, I think that view can be exaggerated.  The provision in the Bill is a substantial advance.  I do not think we could be expected to go as far as is proposed in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>For the overwhelming number of organised workers, the proposal in the Bill represents no advance whatever.  Any merit that is in the Bill is in respect of people who are not covered by agreement.  Double time, which is paid now by agreement in respect of bank holiday time, is paid not only by very substantial industrial undertakings but even by medium and small employers.  The people who possibly have not been getting the benefit of the situation up to date may in many cases be those employed by Government Departments, local authorities and health authorities in certain cases who have insisted on keeping strictly to the letter of the law.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not answer my point.  Is an additional day's pay for a person who is compelled to give up his relaxation on those six days in the year good and proper compensation? If the Minister thinks further about the matter, he will agree that it is not. What would be the reaction if the Taoiseach said to us to-day that the Dáil would meet next Monday? Although we represent the community, I think it will be agreed that such a suggestion would almost cause a revolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our purpose here, primarily, is to represent the community and serve the public.  Consider those engaged in transport undertakings who will take people to race meetings, to the seaside, to football games.  Consider those employed by the E.S.B., the gas company, and so on.  Consider those employed in the delivery of essential milk supplies.  Consider all those people who must work on the bank holiday on the maintenance and repair of industrial plant and machinery.  I do not believe that one per cent. of all those people would agree with the Minister and say: &ldquo;We should like to have another day in the month.&rdquo;  To say <Col N="2262" /> that for married men with families another day in the week is as good, for instance, as the August Bank Holiday is not correct.  On the bank holiday, they can go out with their family and meet their friends who will be free also.  Race meetings, excursions, sporting events, and so on, are not as likely on other days as on a bank holiday. There is a saying that misery loves company.  Undoubtedly people like to enjoy themselves in the company of other people.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to extend to people who must work on bank holidays some compensation for the holiday which none of them wishes to forgo.  A different day is poor compensation for person who must give up the bank holiday.  Not many people are deprived of being at home with their family for the morning and afternoon meal on Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day and the other holidays but surely those who must work on those days deserve consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the Bill is an improvement.  It is, but I would point out that many of those who have not enjoyed the double pay are perhaps employed by the State or public authorities who have taken advantage of the legal position.  Those workers are being protected now.  This Bill represents no advantage to the average organised industrial worker. It provides nothing more than they have been enjoying for the past 30 years&mdash;even before the Act we are amending came into operation.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Larkin.  I appreciate what the Minister says in regard to this being an improvement on the old Act, from time and a quarter to double time, for working on bank holidays.  It is also clear in the section, however, that an employer has the right to decide to give a compensatory day off if he so wishes and still get the work done at the ordinary time rate.  Surely, if anything, that is worsening the position? This compensatory holiday may be given at the discretion of the employer at any time within a month or be <Col N="2263" /> added to the annual leave, which perhaps may be given in the winter time. It is in substitution for a public holiday when other people are enjoying themselves and the workers will be required to work for a single day's pay.  The worker is to get a single day's pay, plus a compensatory day off at a time when he does not want it. That rather worsens the position.</P>
      <P>We feel that treble time should be given for working on bank holidays, not so that the workers should be given extra pay but in order to stop employers from unnecessarily working their employees on bank holidays; to prevent them without grave reason from calling back their employees on a day the State declares to be a public holiday, when ordinary workers expect to be allowed to enjoy the normal amenities with their families.  We all know that public holidays represent the most difficult days for certain classes of employees, such as those in the catering trade and those in transport. That is understandable, but for the ordinary factory or industrial worker, the bank holiday is regarded as a day of rest and we believe the penalty for employing workers on such days should be severe so that the employer will think twice about working his employees, unless he has grave reason and grave reason generally involves great interest or great profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that if we are called into work on the August Bank Holiday, we will get a normal week's pay and under this Bill compensation is given? We can forfeit everything and get only one day's pay.  As Deputy Kyne pointed out the position is worse.  Some employers may say: &ldquo;We will bring you in and we will give you a day off on Wednesday and you will get only your normal week's wages.&rdquo;  We have lost the holiday and we get a day off on a day that is not much good to us or our families and there is no addition to our wages.  The fact has been stressed by Deputy Kyne, and it is very important, that some employers could in fact call upon their workers to come in to work, because of an emergency, on <Col N="2264" /> days when the majority of their workmates are out enjoying themselves with their families and then the employers can say: &ldquo;We will give you Wednesday or Thursday off.&rdquo;  That is what the Bill provides and I think the Minister should consider these points.</P>
      <P>The man who comes in when the bulk of the workers are off will get one additional day's pay.  If a man goes in on a Sunday, he will have two days on top of his wages.  There are 52 Sundays in the year and six public holidays. If a man is called in to work on a public holiday, his compensation for working on that day is one additional day's pay, if he is paid on that basis, or alternatively, the employer may tell the employee to come in and that he can go off and enjoy himself on a Wednesday at Fairyhouse, or somewhere else, with his family.  I would ask the Minister to look into that again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to suggest to Deputies that it is not fair to take this provision in isolation.  One has to have regard to the Bill as a whole.  It provides not only for double pay for a worker who works on bank holidays, but also gives him a statutory minimum period of an extra week's holiday.  It also reduces the qualifying period the worker must work before he is entitled to a public holiday and also the qualifying period for a worker before he is entitled to annual holidays.  As well as that, it has other provisions, for example, where board and lodging are included in the worker's pay, the amount attributable per day to board and lodging is increased under the Bill.  That amount has to be paid to such a worker during his period of annual holidays, so that, not only in this provision but I suggest in the Bill as a whole, there are considerable advances.  Again, I repeat, these are minimum entitlements and as minimum entitlements, they are perfectly reasonable.  I do not think I can accept the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The purpose of this amendment is to protect the worker who may be technically out of employment on the day of a public holiday.  The words in the Bill are &ldquo;whose services are terminated&rdquo;.  It is suggested that they should be altered to &ldquo;who ceases to be in the employment&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;terminated&rdquo; connotes dismissal.  A person who qualified under every other provision might on the Saturday before a public holiday, go to work somewhere else and would lose entitlement to be paid for the public holiday.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to say whether he is prepared to consider the slight changes suggested in these amendments.  Amendment No. 12 suggests the substitution of the words &ldquo;ceases to be in the employment&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;whose services are terminated&rdquo; and the other amendments are consequential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section as it stands is to entitle a worker who has the requisite number of hours before a public holiday to qualify for that day off and be paid for the public holiday.  The aim is to ensure that an employer, by dismissing a worker a day or two before a public holiday, will not avoid the obligation of paying the worker for that public holiday.  In other words, once the worker has worked the requisite number of hours before the holiday, the employer must pay the worker for that public holiday if he dismisses that worker just before the holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of that is obvious&mdash;to avoid what might be a blatantly undesirable practice.  I suggest that Deputy Larkin's amendment, if carried, might <Col N="2267" /> operate to the detriment of a very great number of workers.  Even though a man has not at the time of a holiday worked the requisite number of hours that would qualify him for his pay on the holiday, I believe most employers in any event give the worker his entitlement in respect of the holiday even though he has not got the required hours.  If a worker voluntarily leaves that employer, I think it would be unfair to require the employer to pay that worker in respect of that holiday. That worker, having left his employer, might take up other employment and might work for his next employer on the public holiday and get paid for it and we would be giving him, under this amendment, statutory entitlement over and above what he should get in equity.</P>
    <P>The good employer who pays the worker in respect of a public holiday, even though that worker is not statutorily entitled to it, might be discouraged from continuing that practice if such a provision as that suggested in Deputy Larkin's amendment were adopted.  I think the purpose of the section as it stands is obvious &mdash;to avoid exploitation of the worker by dismissing him before the public holiday.  Secondly, the good employer usually gives the worker that benefit in any case and to oblige the employer to pay the worker who voluntarily leaves might discourage the employer from doing so.  I do not think the section as it stands will impose any hardship on the worker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Against the case made by the Minister, take the case of a builder's labourer who, in the five weeks, must have the requisite number of hours to qualify for pay on the holiday, but may be put out by the section as it stands.  His work may be almost drawing to a close and there may be only a couple of days' work for him after the holiday.  Because of the nature of his employment in ordinary times&mdash;we know builders are busy at the moment&mdash;a builder's labourer may be obliged to notify the employer he will be leaving immediately before the holiday.  He may find it necessary to leave for domestic reasons.  This man is qualified&mdash;it cannot affect a man <Col N="2268" /> who has worked only one week of the five immediately preceding the holidays &mdash;but he must comply with all the other qualifications.</P>
      <P>Surely, it is not unreasonable in those circumstances that such a worker would be given the benefit of the holiday pay provisions which he has earned?  The amendment does not suggest that anyone who leaves the employment prior to the public holiday must be paid for the public holiday; it covers only those who would qualify in all other respects under the Bill.  The number of cases arising would not be very great and I do not agree that it would discourage good employers or that it would make them feel they were prejudiced.</P>
      <P>Under the Act now in operation a worker must work out 150 hours in the five weeks immediately preceding the public holiday.  If he has only worked 149 or 148 hours, and a day or two before the holiday finds he has to leave for family or other reasons, it would be no hardship to the employer to pay him for the holiday and it would be of some small advantage to the man in the circumstances. I am aware that, under the Conditions of Employment Act, the situation was that the worker had to be in employment the day before and the day after the holiday and that certain unscrupulous employers laid off their men two days before the holiday and did not take them back until two days afterwards.  That legislation was subsequently amended.  This amendment is aimed at helping a very few people and is not to the detriment of anyone.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Larkin in this amendment.  Surely, the Minister will agree that if a man has been in employment for the past five or six months and the employer lets him go on Saturday night next, that man is entitled to the August bank holiday with pay?  A man, who has an opportunity of securing a better position and has compiled with all the other conditions, should be as entitled to a holiday with pay on Monday as the man whom the employer would be letting go.  I agree the Minister has a <Col N="2269" /> point when he says it would be wrong that one employer should pay an individual for the August Monday and that the next employer should pay the same individual if he works for him on the holiday, but I believe a small extension of the amendment, saying that a man who has got paid from a former employer for the bank holiday should not be entitled to work for another employer and get paid for the same holiday would cover that.</P>

      <P>If a man works for as long as Deputy Kyne suggests&mdash;five or six months&mdash;and leaves the employment of his own volition, he will, under Section 10 of the Bill, become entitled to cesser pay&mdash;payment for holidays but not for that day.  When legislating for matters of this kind, we must be just but we must be just to both sides.  We are being fair to the worker here.  We must be just to the employer as well.  Let us take the example given by Deputy Larkin.  A man who has been working for an employer for the requisite statutory period may see a better job and leave.  In many cases, the employer may be anxious to finish a contract by a certain date and the worker may leave him in the lurch.  In effect, that worker &mdash;I am not saying all workers&mdash;might walk out on the employer who needed his services very badly in order to finish a contract.  It would be unfair to oblige an employer to pay public holiday pay to a worker who left him in the lurch.</P>
      <P>Again, to continue that example, that employee may already be in the employment of a second employer and may either get the public holiday off, or be paid for it by the new employer. We must be just to both sides and I think we are being very just in this subsection.  When a worker leaves a couple of days before a public holiday, I do not think it is fair to oblige an employer to pay him in respect of that public holiday.</P>

      <P>This amendment is intended to clarify the existing provision.  The Bill as it stands proposes that there shall be a legal requirement to pay two days' pay for Christmas Day.  That takes into account St. Stephen's Day which is also a holiday.  I am moving the amendment to avoid any misunderstanding that a person is entitled to two days' pay for Christmas Day and another day's pay for St. Stephen's Day. The amendment spells out, as it were, that the two days are Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day.  It is clarification but there is no change in the provision.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In subsection (8) (a), lines 45 and 46, to delete &ldquo;one hundred and twenty&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one hundred.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to reduce the qualifying period from 120 hours to 100 hours.  It appears that some error has been made in the printed sheet because amendment No. 21 refers to &ldquo;fifty&rdquo; and &ldquo;twenty,&rdquo; and the subsection refers to &ldquo;one hundred and fifty.&rdquo;  It appears that some mistake has been made in the amendment submitted on behalf of my colleagues and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2271" /> Subsection (8) proposes that the qualifying periods of work in the case of a worker employed in mining shall be not less than 120 hours.  That qualifying period has existed since 1939.  At that time the working hours in the country varied between 45, 46, 47 and 48 hours, and there were quite a considerable number of workers on shift work who worked 56 hours.  Over the years, as a result of trade union negotiations and activity, the normal working hours have been coming down.  In recent months, quite a large number of agreements have been reached which provide for a 42½ hours working week.  Workers who previously worked 56 hours are now working a normal week of 44 hours. A few settlements have recently been arrived at which provide for a 40 hour week.  If the original qualification period remains, the worker will have to work many more days in order to qualify for the benefits of the Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides certain improvements but we submit those improvements are not in fact fully adequate. The suggested 100 hours period is for the purpose of trying to ensure that the workers affected by this provision who work the shorter normal working hours will at least be in a position comparable to their position when the 1939 Act was passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The general provision here is that if a person works for 150 hours in a period preceding a public holiday, he should be entitled to a day off in lieu or a double day's pay.  I propose in a later amendment to reduce that qualifying period of 150 hours to 135 hours.  That is in respect of what the Bill describes as non-domestic workers&mdash;workers in ordinary industrial employment.  That is justified on the basis that since 1939, when the figure of 150 was first introduced, there has been a reduction in the working week generally from 48 hours to 44 hours.  The 150 hours is related to a 48-hour week, and the 135 hours relates roughly to a 44-hour week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there has been a corresponding reduction in the number of hours worked by non-adult workers&mdash;<Col N="2272" /> workers under the age of 18 years.  I think the figure provided in the Bill, 120 hours, for workers under the age of 18 is reasonable.  Nevertheless, Deputies will note that under subsection (10) there is a provision by which the qualifying hours in the Bill may be reduced by regulation in respect of any class of worker.  If a case can be made ultimately for the reduction of working hours for a person under the age of 18 years, it is possible under subsection (10) to make the appropriate reduction by way of regulation.  At the moment I am not convinced a case exists for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

      <P>&ldquo;(c)  in the case of a casual worker, not less than sixty hours,&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Perhaps amendment No. 22 could be discussed with amendment No. 19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give special consideration to the case of casual workers who may work only two or three days in the week.  The position of such a worker is somewhat different from that of workers in regular employment.  The qualifying period of 135 hours for the adult industrial worker does not afford to the casual worker the protection we would wish him to have.  There are quite a large number of casual workers who work only two or three days in the week and who would hardly ever qualify for a holiday.  Under the original Act, if a person was in employment the day before or after a public holiday, he could qualify; and under the original Act a casual worker might well be in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the case of temporary workers.  Special consideration should be given to the case of temporary workers who may be taken on for two or three days a week in some industries in order to deal with a rush and who may be let go short of the qualifying period.  The amendment is designed particularly to deal with the case of <Col N="2273" /> workers who work only two or three days a week and who can never qualify for a holiday even on the Minister's basis of 135 hours.</P>
    <P>To provide that a casual worker cannot take advantage of special consideration and enjoy a public holiday at the expense of two employers simultaneously, amendment No. 22 is inserted. The purpose of that amendment is to ensure that the payment in respect of a public holiday can be made only once and by the first named employer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I suggest that that reduction I propose to make in the qualifying period in the next section is pretty generous and may indeed extend to most casual workers.  As I already said, the provision, as it stands, requires a worker to work for 150 hours in the five-week period immediately preceding a public holiday in order to qualify for payment for that public holiday.</P>
      <P>The reduction from that period of 150 hours to 135 hours, in effect, envisages about three weeks work out of the five.  That will take into account most casual workers at present. But if the Labour Deputies' amendment is accepted, it would mean that if a man worked for normal hours in the first full week of these five weeks and for half of the next week, the employer for whom he worked might never see him again and, in fact, might not have work for him.  Nevertheless, he would be obliged three and a half weeks later to pay that man holiday pay in respect of the public holiday which immediately follows that five-week period.  It would be unfair to expect that employer so to pay that casual worker.  That is my thinking at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I should like to refer Deputies to subsection (10), whereby the Minister can make regulations altering the qualifying period in which a man would be entitled to holiday pay.  I suggest, too, that to fix a minimum period of 60 hours to apply to all casual workers would, perhaps, be unwise at this stage and that it would be <Col N="2274" /> better, on a special case being made, that the Minister would examine different categories of casual workers and make regulations to cover such categories under subsection (10).  In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 19.</P>
    <P>As far as amendment No. 22 is concerned, I think the proposition&mdash;that in the event of a casual worker qualifying for holiday pay, he should be entitled to be paid that holiday pay by one employer&mdash;is a perfectly reasonable one.  On the other hand, I suggest that that provision could be taken into account on the appropriate examination of any specific case in respect of casual workers put before the Minister and in relation to which he can make regulations under subsection (10).</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it only right that the Labour Party Deputies should express appreciation of the fact that the Minister has met in some degree their request and the request of the Congress of Trade Unions in relation to this matter.  I am glad to note that the Minister will be able to deal with the question of specific cases within the framework of this Bill in regard to the special problems that may arise in dealing with casual workers.  The fact that he has reduced the number of hours is an assurance that specific cases will be dealt with justly.  Because of the Minister's approach in meeting the position, I do not think we would wish to press our amendment.</P>

      <P>Before subsection (10), to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  Each hour lost by a worker through sickness, up to a maximum of such number of hours as constitute a normal week's work, shall be deemed to be an hour worked for the purposes of this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The present position is that a worker may lose a number of days during the qualifying period of five weeks through illness and his right to qualify will be thereby affected.  The suggestion is that each hour lost up to a maximum of such number of hours as would constitute a normal week's work should be deemed to be an hour worked for the purposes of this section.  There is no question of a man leaving his employment.  It is a question solely of a man being absent for a short period, and because of no fault of his own, through illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I should like to suggest that my proposal to reduce the qualifying period from 150 to 135 hours, which the House has accepted, very adequately meets the situation envisaged by Deputy Larkin.  On the basis of working a 42½ hour week, that worker would have to work an average of only 27 hours during the qualifying period accepted by the House and he would, therefore, have a margin of over 77 hours in the five-week period to cover a contingency such as sickness.  He would have the equivalent of almost two weeks in a five week period for sick absences in order to qualify for holiday pay. Workers who work longer than a 42½ hour week would have a much longer period to play with, so to speak.  I suggest the amendment which has been accepted very adequately meets the situation envisaged by Deputy Larkin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under previous legislation, no provision was made for illness. The Minister has reduced the <Col N="2276" /> qualifying period from 150 to 135 hours.  There was a change in normal working hours in the period 1939 to 1961.  There was no provision in either the 1939 or the 1956 Acts on the lines we suggest now to meet the case of people absent through illness. We are asking the Minister to provide that in the case of a person absent through illness for a maximum period of one week during the qualifying period of five weeks, that absence will not be permitted to militate against that worker.</P>
      <P>The idea is that some consideration should be given to workers who lose time through illness.  There is no question of their getting credit for each hour for the full period of five weeks, four weeks or three weeks, but, if they are out two weeks in the five weeks immediately preceding that holiday, through illness, at the moment they do not qualify.  To ease that situation, it is suggested that a maximum of one week might be inserted in order to help in that case.  Frequently workers go ill through the circumstances of their employment.  That illness may not fall within the category in which it would be covered by workmen's compensation.  The idea in the amendment is something new.  We are asking for cover for workers in a special position, workers who lose time through illness and who, because of that loss of time, also lose the right to qualify for a public holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a case where a worker has had a long period of regular employment with his employer and then runs into a period of bad health.  Perhaps he contracts a very heavy cold or pneumonia, having worked in an isolated position on a building job.  As a result of that, he may be out sick for a fortnight or three weeks; then a bank holiday occurs and, because he cannot punch in the prescribed period of 135 hours in the five-week period, he loses pay for the bank holiday.  That seems a harsh penalty in the circumstances.  If this amendment is not accepted, that will be applied rigorously to every case no matter how long the worker's service may be.  It may be that he is actually working, as has been said, <Col N="2277" /> three weeks before a bank holiday. His illness may have started in the first two of the five weeks and he may be working for about three weeks coming up to the bank holiday.  While he is in the service of his employer he receives no pay for the bank holiday while the remaining members of the staff do.</P>
      <P>The Minister could usefully accept this amendment in principle so as to establish that where a worker is genuinely ill he will be allowed to calculate some portion of the period of illness towards the hours necessary in order to qualify for the holiday pay. When workers are obliged to report sick many of them receive sickness benefit which is a very small fraction of their take-home pay.  Nobody is encouraged to report sick and rely on social welfare benefits when his wages are substantially higher than those benefits.  Therefore the Minister has a strong argument against any suggestion that people might report sick frivolously.  That is not likely to happen in all these well-organised trades where the take-home pay is much better than the social welfare benefits.  The Minister ought to accept the principle here of allowing a proportion of the sick pay to be counted towards entitlement to the bank holiday payment in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There again I would suggest the case Deputy Norton envisages is very remote.  As I pointed out in replying originally to Deputy Larkin's statement, the period of 135 hours represents an average working week of only 27 hours over a five-week period.  Therefore the man who is absent for, perhaps, a couple of hours one week and a few hours the next week, in fact a few hours every week during the five-week qualifying period, has plenty of margin in order to qualify for his holiday pay.  The worker on a 42½ hour week would have a margin of over 77 hours to cover such contingencies as sick absence.  The provision is reasonably generous and will cover, in effect, most cases of illness.  There is no great need to accept the amendment as proposed.</P>

Assuming that the figure of eighteen hundred hours was based on a normal working week of 48 hours, I the figure I propose of sixteen hundred hours would relate to a normal working week of about 44 hours.  I suggest that is a reasonable reduction in order to qualify a person for a two weeks' holiday period.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill the Minister for Transport and Power, substituting for the Minister, indicated that perhaps such an amendment would be inserted by the Minister but that he was not to be taken as tying the Minister to do so. It was because of that statement we have inserted these amendments as a safeguard.  We appreciate the Minister has met the views of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and has carried out pretty well what he was asked to do on the Second Reading.  Therefore, we propose to withdraw our amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>Before section 19 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the winding-up of a limited company and on the bankruptcy of an individual all moneys due under this Act shall be treated as preferential claims.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very simple amendment.  Its <Col N="2281" /> purpose is to give the worker preferential rights in the case of insolvency of a limited company or a private company. In the case of a limited company, the existing preferences are set out in the Companies Act of 1908 and in the case of an individual going bankrupt, the preferences are set out in the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Act, 1889.  A worker in the case of a company going into liquidation is entitled to preferences in respect of two months' wages subject to a limit of £25.  A clerk or servant has an existing preference in respect of four months' wages to the limit of £50.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that workers will always regard the amounts standing to their credit in respect of holiday pay as something to which they have an inalienable right.  I suggest to the Minister that there is a stronger claim for making holiday pay preferences than there is for allowing the State the right to have preference in respect of one year's income tax or a local authority having the right to have preference in respect of one year's rates.</P>
    <P>I think there is a fair amount of confusion about this matter amongst the few in this country who are concerned. I can assure the Minister, in case there is any misapprehension, that the best legal opinion is that holiday pay under existing law is not preferential in case of the liquidation of a limited company or in circumstances where you may have receivers acting on behalf of debenture holders.  I think there is a very good case for this amendment.  There is ample precedent for an <i>ad hoc</i> amendment of these preferences.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I would direct the Minister's attention to the provisions of the Social Welfare Act under which the State's entitlement to national health and unemployment provisions is protected in the case of insolvency.  I have particularly in mind the Social Welfare Act of 1952, Section 58.</P>
    <P>My amendment is defective technically and if the Minister accepts the principle, I think it would be necessary to improve the wording.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot comment on whether or not the amendment is sound or defective but Deputy Byrne has suggested that there is some doubt as to whether holiday pay is synonymous with wages as used in the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Act of 1889.  I have never heard that any worker was denied preference payment in this fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I could advise the Minister of such cases.  I suggest that if the Minister makes some research into the matter in his Department, he will find there have been such cases reported to his Department quite recently, of which I have personal knowledge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible for me to say whether the amendment, as proposed by the Deputy, is defective in any way from a draftsmanship point of view.  I would suggest that in ordinary bankruptcy cases, the official assignee would have no trouble in construing entitlement under this Act for holiday payments as wages as used in the Bankruptcy Act of 1889.  I do not think it is necessary to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would differ from the Minister on that.  Indeed the best legal opinion on the matter makes it quite clear that holiday remuneration does not rank as wages for the purpose I am speaking of.  I should point out that in the British Companies Act of 1948, it was found necessary to clarify this and to amend &ldquo;preferential claims&rdquo; in previous British Companies Acts and specify that holiday remuneration should rank as preferential claims.  If the Minister would have another look at the matter between now and the time this Bill reaches the Seanad, he might see his way to accept the principle involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That for the purposes of any Act of the present session to amend and extend the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1959, it is expedient to authorise:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the payment from time to time to Bord Fáilte Éireann out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of such sums, not exceeding in the aggregate five million pounds, as the Board shall require;</P>
      <P>(2)  the advance out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of such sums as may from time to time be required by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for fulfilling guarantees given under such Act;</P>
      <P>(3)  the charge on and payment out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of the principal and interest of all securities issued for the purpose of borrowing under such Act; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  the repayment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of advances made out of the <Col N="2284" /> Central Fund or the growing produce thereof on foot of guarantees given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce which have not been duly repaid to that Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>This Bill provides only for grants, not for loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It provides for loans, as well, in this fashion.  The existing legislation limits the amount of moneys the Minister may grant for payment of interest on loans which have been guaranteed by the Minister or provided otherwise than under the Minister's guarantee to £75,000 per annum.  This resolution removes that ceiling of £75,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring to the attention of the Minister the delay in the time in which these guaranteed loans are fully completed.  It takes Bord Fáilte or whoever is responsible quite a long time to conclude all the business in connection with the guaranteeing of loans.  I think the Minister appreciates that himself.  It is useless to vote these moneys or to guarantee this amount of money for Bord Fáilte unless the moneys will be administered properly.</P>
      <P>I should like also to complain of slowness in the making of payments both of interest and reconstruction grants by the Board.  The moneys seem to have to be virtually forced out of them.  No person engaged in the building or reconstruction of a hotel can afford to wait for these loans to be completed.  Furthermore, they cannot afford to wait a long time for payment by the Board of interest on the loan or for reconstruction grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me as well that the major resort area development has made little progress.  Some major resorts have been selected for development in the past few years.  The development has not been proceeded with.  If there is difficulty in getting some local people to co-operate and avail of the financial facilities provided by Bord Fáilte, and the Minister, other places would be very anxious to co-operate <Col N="2285" /> and to avail of the assistance given by the Board.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to get Bord Fáilte, or whoever is responsible, to consider greater emphasis on the family hotel or the middle-class hotel. I do not think there should be the same emphasis on the building of a luxury type hotel that seems attractive to Americans only.  If these big hotels are built we may price ourselves out of the tourist market.  It has been well recognised in recent years that the best customers in our tourist industry are the British.  If they are called upon to pay what they might regard as fantastic weekly charges, they will of necessity have to go to some other European country for their holidays.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister or the Board may not be able to differentiate easily between this and that type of hotel.  The Minister should exhort Bord Fáilte to make an effort to concentrate on giving assistance to the middle-class or the family hotel, so that we can attract our best customer, the British tourist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that a public body in my native town made several representations to Bord Fáilte for a grant for the improvement of one of the most famous localities in Ireland, the place where St. Patrick landed the first time he came as a missionary to this country.  Notwithstanding all the appeals made by the urban council and the development association and the submission of plans over a number of years, they always received the same excuse from Bord Fáilte.  I hope that after the next election there will be a change in the whole composition of that Board, so that not only one area will be picked out for special treatment but that each area with a claim will receive impartial consideration from the officials in charge of this Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To Deputy Corish I would say that I, too, have had experience of what I thought were undue delays in dealing with applications for interest grants by Bord Fáilte. My experience is the best argument that can be made here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2286" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I had that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I brought the matter very forcibly to the attention of Bord Fáilte.  As a result, the procedure has now been speeded up.  It is inevitable in these matters that some delay will occur.  There are several parties to each of these transactions&mdash;Bord Fáilte itself, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Finance.  Any delays that occur between these three are matters over which I can exercise some control and have done so.  Other bodies are involved&mdash;the solicitors for the applicants and the applicants themselves.  It is only reasonable to assume that when, at the request of Bord Fáilte, I ask the Minister for Finance for his guarantee for a loan to a certain hotelier the title of the hotel should be in proper order.  Very often, delays are occasioned by matters outside the scope of Bord Fáilte, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Finance.  The fact is, however, that efforts have been made recently to expedite consideration of these applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment also on Deputy Corish's suggestion that Bord Fáilte should be asked to concentrate on the family-type hotels.  I think it is fair to say that the family-type hotels have been doing very well under the reconstruction grant and the bedroom grant schemes.  One need only travel around the country to see the extensive improvements that have been taking place in that type of hotel.  I should like again, as I did when replying to the Second Stage debate, to refute any suggestion&mdash;I am not saying Deputy Corish made it&mdash;that undue emphasis is placed by Bord Fáilte on the luxury-type hotels.  In fact, there have been very few luxury hotel proposals before Bord Fáilte.  There may be one or two existing at the moment, and there may be one or two in respect of which grants have been approved, but the fact remains that the same amount of grant per bedroom operates in respect of all types of hotels and the same facilities are available.  I am glad to say that apparently they are being availed of to a considerable <Col N="2287" /> extent by what Deputy Corish described as the family-type hotel.</P>
    <P>As far as the suggestion is concerned that one part of the country more than another is being favoured, as stated by Deputy Everett, I can only say that Bord Fáilte must be presumed to treat all these proposals objectively. Again I refer to what I said when replying to the Second Reading debate.  Every Deputy who spoke had perhaps some praise for Bord Fáilte but many Deputies had some complaint about the manner in which Bord Fáilte had treated their own particular areas.  Deputy Desmond complained that Crosshaven had not been treated as one of the major development resort areas.  I told Deputy Desmond that if I had the deciding of that matter, Crosshaven perhaps might get subjective treatment from me because I have some attachment to it, rather than objective treatment.  We should also realise that the moneys at the Board's disposal are limited; they cannot accede to all requests and they cannot treat every area as generously as some Deputies would like.</P>

We can see that weakness running through it which will not prevent a continuation in future of the system whereby one person, the chairman, can decide an issue.

    <P>(8)  In this Act &ldquo;public holiday&rdquo;, when used in relation to any worker, shall be construed in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>It is a strange thing that in 1961 we are still in the position that we were in in 1946 of having to discuss the right of agricultural workers to advantages which have been given to industrial workers.  In the 1946 Bill the efforts of the Labour Party were unsuccessful. Many years have elapsed.  Earlier this afternoon satisfaction was expressed because certain advantages were given to industrial workers.  We consider that agricultural workers are entitled to the same concessions as have been given to their comrades in the industrial sphere.</P>
    <P>Industrial workers enjoy three weeks' holidays, that is, two weeks' annual leave plus certain Church and State holidays.  That amount of leave has not been granted to agricultural workers and the purpose of the amendment is to make provision to give agricultural workers the public holidays which are given in the case of industrial workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister, through this Bill, is informing the public that twelve days' holidays will be given to agricultural workers.  We know that employers, <Col N="2292" /> particularly those who employ three, four or five men, can deduct the number of public holidays allowed to workers during the year from the twelve days' annual leave, thereby bringing these workers back to the stage of getting, in fact, only one week's annual leave.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason why a proposition should be carried in this House to give industrial workers the right to the public holidays set out in the amendment plus twelve days' annual leave, to which we all know they are entitled, while at the same time that right is denied to agricultural workers who should be classified as being of equal importance to the national economy.  I would ask the Minister to have regard to the importance of giving agricultural workers the holidays to which they are as entitled as their industrial comrades are.</P>

      <P>This simple Bill aims at increasing the agricultural worker's right to holidays from the period of one week provided in the 1950 and 1952 Acts, to two weeks.  It does not provide that an employer can deduct, in respect of the second week that is being given under the amending Bill, Church holidays but it does provide that where agricultural employers were in the habit of giving, in addition to the holidays provided in the 1950 and 1952 Acts, four, five, six or more days for the purpose, as I said on Second Reading, of attending race meetings or any other activity, and paying the full wage, if the employer so desires, he can deduct a number of days up to a maximum of six.  We are not suggesting that he should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not believe that in most cases employers will do so but it is felt that in the case of that type of employer, when we are making it legally obligatory to give twelve days instead of six, it would be unfair to impose upon him the legal obligation of giving 12 days in addition to those the worker might expect from him in the way of concessions that have been extended prior to the passage of this Bill.  The Bill does not give the employer the right to deduct as part of the six days in question any Church holiday that <Col N="2293" /> may arise in the period of the individual's employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must know that there is no obligation on the employer in this case to give holidays other than those provided by law. Wishful thinking in this Chamber is useless.  I have known of large employers in agriculture, men who, perhaps, did not derive their main income from agriculture, who were large industrialists, who did not give Church holidays.  The men had to work on Church holidays.  Can we compel them now to give Church holidays? Is there any provision in this Bill whereby agricultural workers are to get Church holidays?  I agree with the Minister to a certain extent.  There are certain agricultural employers on what might be termed medium-sized farms who have always considered it fair and proper to give their employees a holiday on a Church holiday. That does not cover all sections of the agricultural community.  I fail to see why it should be taken for granted that those who have been giving certain concessions to their workers in the past will continue to do so and why no provision is made whereby those who have refused to give such concessions will have to do so.  We are making no such provision.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>None whatsoever.  Is there any compulsion on employers to give the holidays provided in the amendment?  The Minister will admit that if the amendment had not been in order it would not be under discussion now.  The fact is that, in law, agricultural workers will not necessarily qualify for the benefits we are seeking in the amendment.  If the House so decides, the workers can enjoy those benefits.  There is only one way by which we can guarantee that workers will enjoy their rights in this respect and that is to provide it by law.  It is all very fine to suggest that the less compulsion there is, the better.  In many Government activities matters are considered to be of such importance <Col N="2294" /> that compulsion is necessary and Bills are enacted to guarantee benefits which we would wish people to have.</P>
      <P>In this amendment we are asking that agricultural workers should enjoy the same benefits in future as their counterparts in industry enjoy.  I do not see any reason now, any more than there was in 1946, why the Government should oppose the amendment, which is based on an amendment that was before the House in 1946.  There is no use in the Minister saying that these workers are enjoying certain benefits.  If they were enjoying these benefits, there would be no need for us at this stage to try, by amendment, to improve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The clear point that emerges is that whether they are good or bad employers, from the point of view of consideration for their workers, they will be obliged as a result of this Bill to give 12 days' holidays as against the six the law now provides. There is no gainsaying that advantage.  What will happen in relation to the matters that may arise as between worker and employer, in respect to Church holydays or any other concessions the workers may have enjoyed at the hands of their employers, will remain a matter as between worker and employer.  The concession here is that there is a legal obligation to give an employee 12 days' holidays as against six.</P>

      <P>What provision is there to ensure that a farm worker will enjoy a day off if a Christmas Day falls on a Sunday?  What provision is there to give the worker the benefit of a day off if St. Stephen's Day or St. Patrick's Day falls on a Sunday? What provision is there for giving workers a substitute day off for Easter Monday, which the Irish people have cause to remember?  Is there anything in the Bill to protect the workers and give them those benefits?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is as well aware as I am that to attempt to treat this matter of holidays for agricultural <Col N="2295" /> workers as if they were industrial workers is not a sensible approach.  Do we all not know that in the main, in addition to the 12 days that will be provided for them legally as holidays for a year's employment, there are about nine other days when a worker may have to make only an appearance at a farmer's place, when he will not be asked to give a full day's work? You cannot treat that relationship as if you were dealing with industrial workers.  It would not make sense to do so.  What we should not lose sight of is that here we are providing for 12 days' holidays in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to carry on this matter but it is strange to find the Minister making comparisons between workers in agriculture and in industrial spheres.  In this House month after month we hear of the changing pattern in agriculture. We hear Ministers drawing attention to the general move towards larger farms.  We hear them say that, if we are prepared to survive, the whole pattern of small farming must disappear <Col N="2296" /> and we see people coming in here, buying a number of holdings and amalgamating them.</P>
      <P>The Minister, therefore, must understand that new people engaging in agriculture in this country are beginning to treat it as an industry and that they will give to their workers only the concessions that the law makes it obligatory to provide &mdash; no more and no less.  I said, as a preface to my remarks earlier, that difficulties as far as workers are concerned always arise on the smaller holdings.  It is, therefore, of no use for the Minister to say that on all farms, where there are nine or ten men engaged, all they have to do is make an appearance on a Sunday morning or on a Christmas Day.  There may be flexibility and co-operation as between the employer and the worker in certain cases but the only concrete way of getting true co-operation is to give legal rights to the workers &mdash; to give them a substitute for holidays on which they work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that the Minister would be able to give us some indication of the method envisaged for the allocation of the liability for superannuation between two boards in the case where one man happened to be chairman of both boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be included in the Dublin scheme or the Cork scheme.  I take it he would be included in the Dublin scheme and the Cork Board would make its proportionate contribution at some period &mdash; say, at the end &mdash; towards the superannuation of the individual concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow that.  I take it that when the scheme was formulated you would have the rather unusual situation of a part-time servant of the Dublin Board qualifying for superannuation?  That is not a very usual feature of superannuation schemes that ordinary provide for full-time employment for the person in order to qualify for superannuation. There is in respect of this one individual servant of the two boards a peculiar situation in that he is a servant of both boards.  That applies to nobody else.  There must, therefore, be an exception made that <Col N="2298" /> this part-time servant of these Boards will receive superannuation.  I cannot see how that can be arranged except on the basis of prescribing, either by regulation or Ministerial Order, that in the light of our experience since he first started to function in this dual capacity three-fifths of his superannuation is the responsibility of the Dublin Board and two-fifths the responsibility of the Cork Board, or whatever other fraction appears to be equitable in the light of our experience of the last few years.</P>
      <P>Unless provision of that kind is made, I do not see how under any superannuation scheme you can provide that one of the boards shall pay the entire superannuation with some right of recovery against the other board, because you are dealing with two funds.  I suggest to the Minister that before a superannuation scheme for either board is approved, provision would have to be made declaring that the superannuation would be divided between the two boards.</P>
      <P>There is a further problem here.  I do not believe the remuneration of the chairman of the Dublin Milk Board is identical with that of the chairman of the Cork Milk Board.  If my recollection serves me right, his salary from the Dublin Milk Board will be somewhat greater than his salary from the Cork Milk Board.  It may be that these would be the fractions in which the liability for his total superannuation would be calculated.  But some basis of calculation ought to be incorporated in the superannuation scheme or there is bound to be trouble when the time for his superannuation comes, inasmuch as there is only one case involved and it is highly unlikely that another such will arise.</P>
      <P>The problem is not very material, and yet, if we want to avoid trouble, I think it had better be provided for. If the Minister says now that it is his intention in examining any superannuation scheme submitted to him to provide an equitable distribution of the liability of the two boards for the total pension of the chairman, that is an adequate undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as there is provision made in the scheme that the superannuation will be borne in a predetermined ratio between the two boards, I think the difficulty is removed. But that provision ought to be there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The individual in question is in this position.  His employment is wholetime and it has to be whole-time in order that he may be included in a scheme.  But while his employment is full-time employment, it is given as between the Dublin Milk Board and the Cork Milk Board.  Therefore, the scheme would have to provide that he would be included in the Dublin scheme but it would also have to provide the method by which the Dublin Board and the Cork Board would make their contributions on a proportionate basis.  As the Deputy suggested, that would have to be done by agreement and would have to be kept in mind when whatever scheme is submitted comes up for examination and approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I cannot quite follow is how this man can be a full-time employee of two separate bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  He is not an employee of the Minister.  He is an employee of the Dublin Milk Board, on the one hand, and the Cork Milk Board, on the other hand.  The fact is that he was the full-time chairman of the Dublin Milk Board.  A vacancy arose in connection with the Cork Milk Board.  I felt at the time it was not beyond the capacity of one man to be chairman of both boards, so I appointed him chairman of the Cork Milk Board.  Suitable arrangements <Col N="2300" /> were made for the payment of his salary for this dual function, but the question of full-time employment to qualify for superannuation did not then arise.  But, mark you, if you confine a superannuation scheme to full-time employees of either board, you may be in the difficulty that you cannot contend that one man is the full-time employee of two different persons, and that Cork Milk Board is a different &ldquo;person&rdquo; altogether from Dublin Milk Board.  If you can overcome that difficulty and determine that he is qualified to be superannuated by both boards, then you have got to determine the amounts.  It is something to watch, if the scheme is to be confined to wholetime employees of both boards.</P>

      <P>It is agreed between us that that man should get his superannuation. All I am concerned to ensure is that when a superannuation scheme comes to be drawn, we shall not have left in the Act an insuperable obstacle to an equitable arrangement. If the Minister is advised that his employment by two separate persons is not an insuperable obstacle, I am prepared to accept that.  But I want to emphasise that, if that preliminary obstacle is removed, it is very important that an equitable distribution of superannuation liability should be incorporated in the original scheme as between the Cork Board and the Dublin Board.  I should be glad to know how the Minister can give a pension to cover full-time employment with one board to a man who is employed by two separate boards?</P>

      <P>There does not seem to be any difficulty at all in relation to paragraph (b) of subsection (1). The difficulty arises in relation to paragraph (a) because the board can prepare a scheme for the chairman only if he is employed in a whole-time capacity.  I cannot see how anyone can say that the chairman of the Dublin Milk Board is employed in a whole-time capacity.  He is not.  He is employed by the Dublin Milk Board and by the Cork Milk Board.  He is whole-time between the two boards. The paragraph is restrictive because it says: &ldquo;A board may prepare and submit.&rdquo;  It is not the two boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see the arrangement now, what the Minister really proposes is that the Dublin Milk Board can deem the chairman to be in whole-time employment under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of Section 2, and the Dublin Board can submit a scheme of superannuation in respect of their chairman and recover from the Cork Milk Board &ldquo;such part of the cost of the allowance as may be determined by agreement between the latter board and that other board or, in default of agreement, by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  I find myself in the rather odd position of having energetically to protect the interest of a citizen who has never concealed his political allegiance <Col N="2303" /> but who is, at the same time, a citizen whom I appointed to the Cork Milk Board.  I am anxious, therefore, to ensure that the superannuation to which he is entitled shall be equitably fixed.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister creating for himself the difficulty that under a scheme, which will presumably provide a common basis of remuneration relating to salary, he may have to go out of his way to fix a different basis for the chairman?  I do not know what his remuneration is.  Say it is £750 for the Dublin Board and £500 for the Cork Board.  The Minister wants to give him superannuation on the basis of a total salary of £1,250, but under the provisions of this Bill the Dublin Milk Board must give the chairman his total superannuation and then recover from the Cork Milk Board whatever is due by that body.  Suppose the superannuation works out at half and he gets £625, on the understanding that the Dublin Milk Board will recover some part of that from the Cork Milk Board, in fact the scheme will have to provide that he gets £625 superannuation from the Dublin Milk Board on a salary of £750.</P>
      <P>It is true they will recover from Cork £275 as Cork's contribution, but the scheme will look a bit lopsided if everybody else has his superannuation based on 50 per cent. of salary and the chairman is getting six-sevenths of his salary on the date of retirement.  If that is the best the Minister can do, then that is the best the Minister can do, but it will create a problem.  The Minister would have been wiser to provide that in respect of the chairman his superannuation would be based on the salary received by him from the Dublin Milk Board and the salary received by him from the Cork Milk Board without regard to the provision relating to permanent employment, which is the normal provision in normal circumstances.  We are dealing here with an exceptional case.</P>

It should not be a difficult problem to provide as to the amount of the contribution to be made by each of the boards in question.</P>

    <P>(1)the advance out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of all moneys from time to time required by the Minister for Finance to meet payments required to be made by him to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited in respect of any <Col N="2306" /> shares taken up by him under such Act;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have some clarification of the point with which we were dealing at the end of the Second Stage of the Bill?  As I understand the position, the sole income the Shannon Free Airport will receive will be: (1)  the rent it will receive for factory buildings, and (2)  the rent it will receive for the dwellings it erects. <Col N="2307" /> I know of no other gross income it will receive.  Perhaps I am wrong in that respect but I have no doubt the Minister will be very quick to contradict me if I am.</P>
      <P>In respect of that gross income the company receives, the Minister told us the other day that the rent of the factory buildings would be sufficient to pay the economic interest that will be payable in respect of the capital cost of the buildings that were being erected.  The Minister made it clear that the rent would not amortise in any way the capital cost of these factories, that it would purely be a refund, so to speak, of the interest due on such capital cost.</P>
      <P>I do not know what is the position with regard to these various leases in relation to repairs.  Is the Airport Company in any circumstances liable for repairs or is the factory lessee always liable for them?  In relation to repairs may I know further what is the position in regard to reinstatement in case of wearing out?  Is the factory lessee liable for insurance?  In other words is the factory lessee liable for all outgoings of every nature in addition to his rent or is there any outgoing in respect of the building once it has been erected for which the Airport Company is liable?  I would like the Minister to clarify also the position in regard to rates.  Are the factory lessees liable for rates in the ordinary way as if it were a factory, say, in my unfortunate constituency of Kildare which always seems to be by-passed on these occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for the economic rent question in relation to factory buildings. As regards dwellings, I understand that one half of the cost of the dwellings is a free grant that is not recoupable in any shape or form by the occupant or by any factory or by anyone other than the general taxpayer.  In relation to the remaining moiety of the capital cost of the dwellings there is further a rent charged which the Minister said was uneconomic, but I am not clear on this&mdash;uneconomic as to what?  Does the rent for the dwelling cover only interest in respect of that moiety of the cost of the dwelling?  Does it provide to <Col N="2308" /> amortise the capital cost over any period of years and, if so, over what period of years?</P>
    <P>Who is responsible for repairs in respect of these dwellings and where is the cost of these repairs provided for? Who is responsible for the other appropriate outgoings in respect of dwellings of that nature and who provides for them?  When I say &ldquo;who provides for them&rdquo; I mean is the airport company responsible or is the tenant, and if it is the tenant is it the individual person who is living in the dwelling or does the company of which he may be an employee take the dwelling and re-let it to him?  Who covers voids in the same case?  There has been much too little explanation about the exact method of financing this and nobody can express any opinion as to whether it is good or bad until he knows the exact details.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not very easy to describe the basis of rent for the factory dwellings because we are in a period when the economic condition changes as time goes on.  The company have calculated an economic rent on the basis of recovering the capital investment over 40 years with interest at 5 per cent. and, making provision for external repairs and maintenance, they have calculated a rent which would bring that situation about.  However, some of the factories are being rented for initial periods up to five years at rents below the economic rent.  It is hoped that in the case of these companies they will be able to pay full economic rents later.  In the cases of other companies arrangements have been made that the rent rises over a specific period until it reaches the economic figure at which it would be able to do the things I have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible for me to say when that position will be reached because there are also clauses in the leases enabling the factories to purchase out their leases and there you have a fluctuating condition.  All I can say is that receipts from factory lettings will increase each year and there should come a point where they will be providing economic interest and there should further come a point later on, if all goes well, when they will be <Col N="2309" /> remunerating capital as well.  I should say that the final figure includes provision amounting to some 1 per cent. of the capital cost per annum for external repairs and maintenance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by remunerating capital as well?  I thought he said it was charged at 5½ per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It involves rents which have been calculated by the company as the amounts they hope to be able to get either by way of a definite contract or further agreements in a period of years.  That is the position so far as the factories are concerned. The factory is liable for repairs, insurance and for rates on the usual basis which, of course, involves the sliding scale of rates applicable to new buildings exactly as in any other area.  The company is responsible for the maintenance of surroundings, roads and grounds.  In regard to the housing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves the question of the factory, when he talks of returning the capital, does he mean the capital employed in the erection of the building or does he mean all the capital that is employed not merely in the erection of the building but in the purchase of the land, the development of the services and so forth?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to say &mdash; about five years at the moment.  Some of them will have to be re-negotiated. <Col N="2310" /> There are other agreements which definitely go up to the economic figure in ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know what re-negotiation means.  It is a euphemistic way of describing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the companies have been willing to pay higher rents than others.  The company was facing the difficulty of having to get started and to make progress.  In regard to the housing, the Deputy already knows what happens.  In the case of one-half of the cost of housing, the conditions are exactly the same as those in relation to the Local Loans Fund.  In regard to the other half, the position is that the rentals charged to tenants contain provision for repair, maintenance, insurance, ground rent, administration and caretaking.  There is a profit margin amounting to some ten per cent. of the total rental.  After making allowance for what has to be provided, the effect of this profit margin is to provide a form of remuneration amounting to one and three-quarters per cent. of the share capital invested.  That is in case of the half not subject to the Local Loans procedure.</P>
      <P>If all the houses and flats were occupied all the time at the rents proposed by the company, all the capital would be recovered in 35 years' time, including the share capital and the repayable advances.  The repayable advances, which amount to half the cost, would pay interest at the rate of five and a half per cent. per annum.  The other half represented by share capital would pay at the rate of one and three-quarters per cent.  That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has completely confused us by referring to the Local Loans Fund procedure. There are no free grants out of the Local Loans Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>I tried to describe to the Deputy the position in regard to the half which is raised by direct capital from the company.  There will be a deficiency on the present proposals in relation to the 250 houses to be completed by 31st March, 1964.  There will be a deficiency at the rate of £6,000 per annum on the basis of all the dwellings being occupied, but if, as is intended, on the Company's capital a rate of interest at the rate of one and three-quarter per cent. is paid, eventually the capital will be recovered.  There The principal will be recovered.  There will be a deficiency of interest, because of the fact that the full treatment, as in the case of the half of the contribution from repayable advances, is not applied.</P>

      <P>May I put a specific question in order to try to clarify the thing without getting lost in general principles?  If there is a factory costing £10,000, am I correct in believing that the economic rent of that factory is deemed to be £550, representing the interest, plus £100 representing the annual repayments in amortisation of capital, plus rates, plus internal repairs? Does that represent the economic rent, according to the Minister's calculation, of a £10,000 factory?</P>

The main thing is that, on the half of the cost of housing which is raised directly from the company's share capital, a profit margin amounting to ten per cent. of the total rent has been taken into account.  The effect of this profit margin is to provide a form of remuneration amounting to about one and three-quarter per cent. of the share capital invested.  I think that clears up the matter.</P>

      <P>Perhaps this section is as good a section as any to enable the Minister to clear up a point he was not able to clear up before <Col N="2317" /> in regard to the lost factory.  The Minister will remember that on Second Reading I referred to the report in which it is stated on page 14 that 22 factory units had been built or put into construction.  The Minister when speaking referred to only 15 existing bays, a special bay and five under construction, which makes 21.  Where is the lost factory, between the 31st March, 1960, and the time the Minister was speaking the other day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The lost one was a boilerhouse for the factory.  It was one of the bays, one house for all the factories.  That accounted for the discrepancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister really serious in saying that when the directors in their report said that, in addition to a special factory for a piano manufacturer, 22 factory units had been built or put into construction, that is not true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it changes but the Minister has lost one.  Either the report was true or the Minister's statement was wrong.  Quite obviously the Minister does not know what is happening at Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister does not communicate his information to the House.  The report of the Directors said categorically that in addition to a special factory for a piano manufacturer 22 factory units have been built.  That is on page 14, the second paragraph, if the Minister would take the trouble to read it. Twenty-two and one makes twenty-three. The Minister came into the House the other day and in his speech, I think it was in paragraph 5, said that there were 15 factory bays, a special factory bay, and one under construction. Surely, the Minister can appreciate that 15 and 5 and 1 make 21?  There <Col N="2318" /> were 23 before, fifteen months before the Minister spoke.  If there were 23 fifteen months ago, why are there only 21 now?  What has happened to the missing factories?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister look at some of the points?  He spoke of the idea of the State providing money in conjunction with the local authorities as a more democratic way of doing things and of seeing that the conditions in the various localities would be more suited to the areas concerned than the existing way in which there were inconsistencies.  The Minister also indicated that there was a testing time ahead.  He also indicated that the general idea was of providing better preparation for a testing time in the future.</P>
      <P>I shall point out later to the Minister that this is in fact proposing to restrict and damp down the proposals by various local authorities to provide higher university education.  In view of the fact that it is proposed to allocate money from the Government in order to establish a pattern, I wonder would the Minister give us some idea as to what inconsistencies he has seen in his proposal because he must have seen that there are some shortcomings in his scheme and that it will mean to local authorities the curtailment of their expenditure on scholarships if there is to be an equitable contribution as between the State and the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Here we are passing a Money Resolution for the purpose of enabling local authorities to do their work democratically whereas the proposals will actually cut across local authorities in some ways which will do little to assist some of the poorer areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy trying to make a point?  The Deputy assumes that by giving more money we are limiting the number of scholarships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  You are limiting the local effort.  Just as a sample of one of the things I have in mind, the Minister indicates that one-third of the total expenditure only will go on university scholarships and says he will give the local authorities only up to fivepence in the £ as against their expenditure.  There are two ways in which South Tipperary will be adversely affected under that proposal. South Tipperary is one of the most progressive local authorities in the matter of giving scholarships generally. In 1960-61 South Tipperary are spending £6,600 on university scholarships and £2,500 on scholarships to secondary and vocational schools. When this Bill comes into operation I understand South Tipperary will have to remodel the situation.  We can take the £9,100 they are now providing between university, secondary and vocational scholarships and the £1,530 provided by the State in the first year &mdash; £10,630 &mdash; and they will be constrained to spend only one-third of that on university education &mdash; substantially less than at the moment and perhaps even only 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>For the year 1960-61, South Tipperary are providing £9,100 for scholarships.  According to the Minister's step-up period they would get from the State in the first year £1,530 from one penny in the £ on the rates.  In the second year they would get £3,060.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the third year, on the basis of their expenditure, they would get £5,355.  In the fourth year, confined to a rate of 5d. in the £, they would get only £7,650 from the State when they are to-day spending £9,100.  From the point of view of assistance, it is <Col N="2328" /> completely distorted from the beginning of the period to the end of the fourth year.  Assuming Tipperary stayed at their present rate, they would get only £16,750 in four years' time and they would not be allowed to spend in that year as much as they are spending on university education. They would have to cut it down.  I do not think we should pass from the Money Resolution to the details of the Bill without asking if the Minister really contemplates that.</P>
    <P>Again, when he speaks of creating better conditions for one locality relative to another, that cannot adequately be done by a centralised area.  I indicated before that there are about four county council areas where in the matter of expenditure on education under the vocational scheme they had to be assisted to a more than normal extent by additional supplementary State grants.  Leitrim to-day spends £880 on university education and £1,060 on post-primary education, a total of £1,940.  They raise £609 by a penny on the rates and, in the third year, with increasing expenditure on their own part, they can hope to get £2,131, which they would not get unless they increased the amount of money they are spending.  They, too, would be constrained in relation to their university education and they might not be able to give any additional assistance to university education at all.  The Leitrim people are pinned to the measure of their own resources by this Bill.  That fact is recognised when it comes to dealing with vocational education, but it is not recognised when it comes to dealing with scholarships.  I think those are vital defects of the financial scheme and that is why I raise them on the Money Resolution.</P>

      <P>The basic problem about scholarships is that you have to plan over a four or five year period. The Deputy understands that, because the life of a scholarship will be four years, you have to provide for the first year and it must be repeated the next year, the following year and the fourth year.  In each succeeding year, new scholarships are coming in and you will not know the full amount to be provided until the fourth year.  That is where the four years comes in.  The build-up is gradual over the four years to increase the fund.  If I have the figures correctly which the Deputy gave, the first year it was £1,500&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  The House has shown this afternoon that there is a very considerable rush some place.  The Minister says I introduced the democratic question into this.  May I draw the Minister's attention to his statement on the Second Reading:</P>
      <P>On the other hand, to replace the local authorities scholarship system set up by the 1944 Act by a direct State system would seem to me to savour of a diminishing of a democratic principle, a principle which needs to be strengthened rather than perhaps weakened, and which, in such matters as this, if properly put into effect, can cater better for conditions in one locality relative to another than could an absolutely centralised administrative machine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has now indicated that when he arranged in this Bill that not more than one-third of the total fund available to local authorities would be spent on university education, he had in mind that he would regard that as a fundamental principle.  I am pointing out he is cutting across a local approach by a first-class body that is spending more money generally for education in relation to its resources than any other place.  I am saying that in South Tipperary the local body in the year 1960-61 spent £9,100 on scholarships, £6,600 under the 1908 Act for university scholarships and £2,500 for post-primary. If this Bill comes into force, South Tipperary will not be able in the first year of this scheme, or in the second or third, to add an additional university scholarship to its list.  They are already spending £6,600 as against <Col N="2332" /> £2,500.  Under the Minister's scheme, at the very peak of his contribution to them, he would give them £7,650, as against their present £9,100.  That would give them a total of £16,750, but they would be allowed to spend on university scholarships only £5,550 or £1,100 less than they are expending at present.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister really ask the Dáil to pass a Money Resolution supporting a scheme that will butt in on a pattern of things that has developed naturally and is, I am sure, making a serious contribution to the testing time, educationally, morally and scientifically, facing this country?  I do not think the Minister understood that.  But when he now says it is wrong to spend on a pattern like that, that has arisen naturally amongst a rather interested and intelligent people, I believe he is wrong.  I am sure there are Deputies here who would like to understand why the Minister should put his foot down and say South Tipperary must not give as much attention to university scholarships in the future under this great scheme as they have been giving in the past.  Let me hear any Deputy on the Fianna Fáil benches support that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been pointing out how much South Tipperary will lose by getting £7,700 from the Government.  They are losing because of a limitation of their right to give what I consider a very unbalanced distribution of their funds. But they will gain on secondary and vocational scholarships, which will go up to £11,000 from £2,500 at present. The Deputy has been seeing only the drop at university scholarship level, but they will gain on post-primary <Col N="2333" /> education.  Because of that gain they may have to reduce the amount spent on university scholarships.  That reduction will bring about a balance between the number of students going on to post-primary education and those going on to university education &mdash; a balance which, I think, is a reasonable one.  It is a matter of opinion. The Deputy seems to think we should cater only for the university people. But there is a very large number of people who can benefit from post-primary education and who otherwise could not do so if we did not have this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to replies given to questions in the House which showed that the total approximate value of the annual university scholarships given by each county council or county borough council in 1959-60 was £60,000, whereas the value of those for vocational and post-primary education was £90,000.  There you have committees working naturally throughout the country, handling their own resources and dealing with the circumstances around them.  They pay for university scholarships, say, £2 as against £3 elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I am dealing only with one facet of this.  The Minister need not put into my mind that I think more money should be spent on university education than on secondary education.  I am saying this Bill will prevent a county council, that has been dealing systematically and well with this matter, from giving the assistance to the university education they are giving today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It will enable them to give very much wider assistance to students needing post-primary education. At the same time it will add to their funds and they will, therefore, be able to give balanced aid to those deserving assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a good thing to do.  I should like to point out to the <Col N="2334" /> Deputy that there are many counties which will benefit by this legislation. We cannot legislate for just one county. There is quite a formidable list of counties which will in future be able to give both post-primary and university education to children in greater numbers than they were able to cater for in the past.  With regard to limiting the democratic principle in certain areas, surely the Deputy must realise that in the world of to-day we need reasonable direction in effort?  There must be some central direction and encouragement of effort under our educational system.  It is difficult enough to achieve a coherent effort throughout the whole system and this is one way in which we can influence the numbers following the various levels of education.  I do not think the Deputy can describe this as gratuitous interference with the democratic principle. It is a reasonable interference at a time when over-all direction is most desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does the Minister think that the present interference in relation to the amount which may be spent on university scholarships as against secondary and vocational is wise at this stage?  Is it wise to have a limitation of one-third and two-thirds? It is not a question of principle.  It is a question of the value of money.  Everybody realises that much more money is needed for university education as against secondary or vocational education.  If the aim is to provide opportunities to take students to the highest level, are we actually limiting ourselves by ensuring that a larger number will be able to avail of secondary and vocational education while, at the same time, curtailing the number who may avail of university education?  Does the Minister think that a wise limitation in present circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Jones.  The Bill is a good one but, if it is the intention to improve the position with regard to secondary and vocational education, where do we go from there if there is a limitation from a monetary point of view <Col N="2335" /> on university education?  In Limerick there is a ceiling on university scholarships of £130 per year.  I know a very clever boy, the son of a blacksmith. There are seven children in the family. That boy got a scholarship to U.C.D. With the increase in fees, the increase in the price of books and the increase in &ldquo;digs&rdquo; that boy finds life very difficult on £130 per year.  I met him the other day and he told me that he can afford only one meal a day in the &ldquo;Steaming Kettle&rdquo;, or whatever it is called.  There seems to be no point in improving the position from the point of view of secondary and vocational education while disimproving the position in regard to university education. I hold that good brains should be given every opportunity to climb to the highest rung of the ladder irrespective of class or creed.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a very practical man. I pay him the tribute of saying that I think he is the best Minister for Education we have had since Deputy Seán Moylan.  He has a common sense approach.  I stress the point that every boy and girl should have an equal opportunity of pursuing university education, the opportunity they would have if they were Deputy General Mulcahy's sons and daughters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy cites the case of a local authority which has been devoting over £6,000 out of £9,000 to university scholarships and the balance to other types of scholarship. He describes that as a natural development.  It is a most unnatural development.  It is a most useless development.  It is a most illogical development.  That development may have been all right 20 years ago when vocational schools did not exist.  To-day all the stress and emphasis is on vocational and technological education and it is only right that aid should be increased for such education.  It is only right, too, that aid should be increased for secondary education.  I thoroughly agree with what the Minister is doing. It will have the effect of more or less holding the number of university scholarships at the point at which they are now in the case cited by Deputy Mulcahy.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from the Deputy that that was a benighted outlook, spending more money on university education than on vocational and secondary education.  However, Deputy Collins has put his finger on this spot that sufficient provision is not being made on any side for scholarships. At any rate, if the Minister is introducing a pattern it ought not to choke any tendency there is on the part of public authorities to support university education.  As regards Tipperary, the scholarship fees given there are nearly as high as those of Limerick City but the students attending the university away from their homes live very difficult lives in keeping themselves in health and keeping up their morale while they are studying.  Therefore, the finances that the Minister is providing now, as indicated on the Second Stage, will only be a patch on some of the scholars' breeches.</P>
      <P>This discussion has, I take it, thrown a bit of light on what is happening and, without pillorying the Minister particularly, I would suggest he is introducing a bit of west wind, a bit of the Clare mentality into this measure.  The Clare people spent £600 in 1959-60 on university education and £3,480 on secondary and vocational education.</P>

      <P>This type of discussion appeals to me because I come from a poor area and not from the broad acres or town mansions.  I speak for the type of people I serve and love. I have studied this question for 12 years as Chairman of the Limerick County Council.  There is very little use in our giving 15 or 20 secondary scholarships to Pallaskenry, Warrenstown or any other school to brilliant boys or girls when, because they come from poor homes, they cannot avail of university education.  I welcome this Bill the Minister is introducing.  In this country we have the brainiest boys in the world and all they need is a break.</P>
      <P>I have been here since 1948.  I have no animosity towards anyone but I have great loyalty to Fianna Fáil and no one will shake me out of that.  It is my desire to serve the people who sent me here from the slumdom of Limerick, the people who are uneconomic holders, as Deputy Jones will know.  In spite of difficulties, we have produced great people.  They are first class students, both boys and girls, who are getting secondary education but who, when it comes to university education, cannot avail of it because of their poor circumstances.  I must compliment the Minister for Education on the efforts he is making to give them a chance in life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our area is supposed to be the <Col N="2338" /> Golden Vale where we have milk and honey flowing over our boots when we get up in the morning but we have many poor people whom this Bill is meant to benefit.  My only regret in connection with this Bill is that the Minister did not provide ten times more for education, both university and secondary.  If we can make university education more widely available to our children there are many opportunities for them to become scientists, engineers and so on.  We all have something in common here, no matter what we did in the Civil War or in the Black and Tan War, whether we come from Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil &mdash; that is, the desire to give our children a chance to take their place in the world of tomorrow.</P>

      <P>What side is that?  Problems crop up and one is the case of Tipperary.  I think the Deputy will now agree that a certain amount of the democratic principle has been lost, subjecting itself to a reasonable direction. The basis of our trouble in arguing this is the limitation of money. Deputies argue in this House as if they were legislating for one of the greatest and richest countries in the world.  They accept that a man cannot afford to send a child to a university and yet they cannot see why the State should not be rich and afford everything.  We would want to get down to realities, realise that we have a certain amount of money to spend and the question is how best to spend it.  I have gone to as much trouble as possible to ascertain what would be the best proportion between the numbers getting post primary education and the numbers going on to university education and fitting that in with the idea of the richest countries which have a considerable amount of money available to them.</P>
      <P>In countries which have to work to a Budget and make the best use of a Budget, I have found that the best proportion can be achieved by having one-third spent on university scholarships and two-thirds on post primary scholarships.  Anybody who suggests that we must increase university education should be honest and logical enough to say that they will increase them at the expense of the person who would get post primary education.  If you are going to take scholarships from young people in order to give added opportunities to those who can afford post primary education, you are doing something that is not just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that on a limited purse I am trying to legislate for a just distribution of the moneys available.  I do not think <Col N="2340" /> we should provide for people already supplied with post primary education because the parents can afford it.  I do not think we should provide university education for them at the expense of students who cannot afford post primary education.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now embarking on a pattern of education. We have heard a lot about the necessity for having increased scholarships for secondary and vocational schools.  According to the Minister's theory, two-thirds of the money that will be spent from the accumulated funds of the local authorities and the State will be spent on scholarships in secondary schools and vocational schools.  Would the Minister give us an outline of the object of this general provision in the scheme of things?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been waiting for the report on secondary education for quite a long time &mdash; six or seven years now.  It will soon be a year since the report was in the Minister's hands.  There was no publication of it.  At any rate, there is an outlook on what secondary education means to the country.  There is an outlook on what the developing system of vocational education means to the country.  Here we are providing scholarships.  The level at which scholarships will be granted is being made a local level within the particular local fund.  Accordingly, it would be desirable to have some understanding as to what tests will have to be gone through by children competing for scholarships at secondary and vocational level.  Generally, what is the Ministerial approach in this new pattern <Col N="2341" /> and plan as to where the secondary education scheme and the vocational scheme lead?</P>

      <P>One-fourth of the moneys provided by county councils will be available without the means test.  At the present time in local authority areas there is a means test laid down for the award of scholarships. Now the Minister under this section proposes to release one-fourth of those moneys so that they will be applicable to the State at large without <Col N="2342" /> the application of any means test. The Minister mentioned that the examination would be of 6th standard primary school level.  Will there be an age qualification?  If one-fourth is now the amount laid down, it appears we are going to provide equally for people who could afford to provide education for their children.</P>
      <P>The Minister used the argument that, having provided secondary education and having taken them so far, the students ought to be able to provide university education for themselves. We are restricting it somewhat. We are providing for one-quarter without a means test at this stage and three-quarters subject to means test. Will there be a direction in regard to the means test?  Is that left to the discretion of each local authority? Will this be a nation-wide means test or does each local authority lay down its own type of means test under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The point about one-quarter is that, no matter where you fix the upper limit of a means test, there will be, along that border, people of great merit who may be excluded by the means test but who, belonging to a big family, and so on, would not be able to afford to go on.  The extra quarter would catch those.</P>
      <P>I wanted a principle in this legislation. That is why I talked about patterns.  There were patterns there for those who could see them.  The principle is that if there are brains in the country, we should get them through the full course of education as far as we can afford to do so and that they should earn their way on merit.  This giving of a quarter is establishing the principle that merit will be rewarded, regardless of anything else.</P>
      <P>I hope that, in time to come, there can be very much greater expansion of these schemes.  In this original essay, I want to lay down principles which I think are good educational and good social principles.</P>

      <P>In Limerick, there is provision in the scheme whereby, under the means test, due regard is had to the number of children in a <Col N="2343" /> family.  An applicant in a large family is allowed certain concessions in regard to valuation.  Will this introduce a fresh principle in relation to the size of the family?</P>

      <P>A means test exists in the 1944 Act for post-primary scholarships. That will continue as an amended Act.  In this Bill, a control is introduced.  The Minister sanctions schemes by local authorities.  Part of the schemes to be sanctioned is the means test.  The Minister has the right to withhold sanction.  The Minister will have a say in the overall picture of the level which the means test should reach.  Therefore, the Minister will have more control than previously as regards the means level.  There is quite a variation from local authority to local authority.  In some cases, the levels are set in such a way as to be unjust.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister hope to get any uniformity in the value of secondary and vocational scholarships? One of the reasons for a joint scheme was that there would be disparities and discrepancies between a State and a local scheme.  I take it that anybody looking at the matter from the high seat of the Department of Education would consider the monetary value of a scholarship to a secondary school.  He might consider that the Department of Education ought to be able to come to a detached conclusion and then get agreement from the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Minister's idea of what a scholarship should be to enable a young fellow to go through four or five years in a secondary school?  There is a very considerable grievance, in relation to some scholarship schemes, that if the candidate who gets a scholarship resides within five miles of a secondary school, he or she is given a scholarship of £15 and told to attend the day <Col N="2344" /> school.  If the candidate resides at a greater distance than five miles from a day school, he or she is given a scholarship to a boarding school.  Even in the case of boarding schools, the scholarships given by most local authorities are most inadequate.  If a child, on his or her merits, is being given a full course of secondary education, the family should be relieved of a considerable amount of responsibility for the child's upkeep during such period of education.  That applies even more so to university scholarships.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister consider should be the size of a scholarship for a boy or girl under this scheme who will spend four or five years in a secondary school?  Does he not think it invidious to make a distinction between the amount of the scholarship given to a student at a day school and a student at a boarding school? Boarding school costs are very high but the costs of keeping a young person at home, looking after equipment, books and general education are quite substantially near those of a boarding school.  It is an important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of scholarships to secondary schools, I would point out that nowadays there are secondary schools within easy reach of almost all our pupils.  They can attend them and go home in the evening.  No matter how many secondary school scholarships we may create, we have made a great advance in the provision of secondary school education. Right at our doors in every part of rural Ireland, there are secondary schools which our boys and girls may attend and then go home in the evening. I see students cycling six or eight miles to school on a winter morning and coming home again at about 6 p.m.  As the Minister outlined, the giving of as many scholarships as possible will be a great help to people in poor areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jones mentioned the position in Limerick and we intend to go all out in implementing the Minister's Bill.  I should like to see the students being properly facilitated by <Col N="2345" /> being sent to either University College, Dublin, or the university in Galway or in Cork.  We do not want those boys and girls to come to Dublin with the bare minimum.  We have at the moment boys and girls in County Limerick with £130 and most of that is eaten up by fees and the cost of books.</P>
    <P>I know of boys and girls in my own county who are striving to advance themselves through university education and they can afford only one meal a day.  I try to advance the position in Limerick and to give those people more than they are getting at the moment.  This is a &ldquo;break&rdquo; for them and I hope they will survive, but I do not like to see boys or girls, whether they come from Wexford, Cork or Waterford, the best brains from homes in rural Ireland, coming up here for scholarships which will not enable them to live in comfort.  I know that that is so and I have evidence that it is so.</P>
    <P>I know of boys and girls from my county living in this city on one meal a day.  Where are we going to end in the local authorities in trying to get our boys and girls to fit into the lives they would like, as scientists, chemists, engineers or whatever it may be?  We should step up the emoluments we can give them.  I congratulate the Minister in bringing forward this Bill and making&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this question of the allocation of scholarships, is there any reason, now that secondary education is spreading in the rural areas, why the local scholarships should be less for the person attending a day school than for the person attending a boarding school?  After all, the cost is somewhat the same.  The <Col N="2346" /> parents have to maintain the child at home just as the child has to be maintained in a boarding school.  The fees charged for secondary education are very modest.  Why there should be a limitation on the amount provided for a day school as against a boarding school, I cannot understand.  A child awarded a scholarship should get the benefit of the scholarship as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear this matter being aired by such knowledgeable people with such emphasis. I referred to it on the Second Stage and unfortunately I was not present when the Minister was replying.  I have since scanned the reports and I do not think I am wrong when I say that the Minister did not deal with it then.  I hope he will deal with it now so that some guidance may be given to local authorities and to those who allocate scholarships, to ensure that the grossly unfair difference between the amounts paid to boarding school and day school students will be abolished. As Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Jones have pointed out, the cost of maintaining a child at a day school while the child is at home is only marginally less, if at all, than the cost of maintaining a child at a boarding school.</P>
      <P>In a boarding school, the child will enjoy certain facilities at a fairly reasonable charge.  I understand that boarding schools have their own libraries; they have their halls of study; they have their playing fields.  Many of them have their own cinemas and other forms of entertainment.  The students are living in and it costs them nothing to go to many of those things, but a day student may well have to have bus fares provided not only to and from the school but to the playing field and all the other places where boys go when they have spare time. Many books which are available to students in boarding schools have to be purchased by parents of children who are not in boarding schools and the daily burden of the bus and train fares, particularly in places like Dubline City, can be quite considerable and not infrequently will far exceed the amount charged by school authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are particularly fortunate to have the Irish Christian Brothers to <Col N="2347" /> provide a first-class education for many of our students at a nominal rate.  I know that in my day there were many students paying more in bus and train fares than had to be paid in fees to the school itself.  If those boys had been attending boarding school, there would have been a vastly greater scholarship given to them, but the parents for various reasons decided they should attend day school.  We should allow parents to exercise their choice of school independently of financial considerations and you are putting a bait before them if you give scholarships which are three or four or even five times greater for attending at a boarding school.</P>
    <P>There may be those who feel that a boarding school education is better than a day school education and they should get it on the same terms as those who decide to send their children to day school.  There are many families in which, for domestic reasons, the parents, as much as they would like to send their children to boarding school, do not do so.  The head of the family may be in indifferent health and the child may be wanted for various chores about the house or on the farm, all activities which form part of the education and the bringing up of the child.  They are not things which interfere with studies, as long as they are not engaged in to excess.  These are very practical domestic considerations and parents who send their children to a day school should not be regarded as deserving of less assistance than those who send their children to boarding school.</P>
    <P>There is great wear and tear on the clothes of children who have to travel a long distance to school.  Parents may feel that the lack of a hot meal during a long school day will be injurious to health and have to make costly arrangements to provide a child with a hot meal whereas a child attending a boarding school will get regular meals and will not get a few duckings a day in rainy weather.  The child who attends a day school is exposed to these hardships and additional cost is imposed on parents in safe-guarding children against them.  The <Col N="2348" /> gap which has unfairly existed between students attending boarding schools and students attending day schools should be closed.  I hope the Minister will be in agreement with us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what section we are on now as we seem to have travelled over many.  The question of the value of scholarships has not been put into the Bill.  It will be a matter for local authorities to submit schemes for sanction but I hope it will be possible to have realistic values and to relate the scholarships to actual needs.  At present many scholarships are awarded which are of so low a value as to be of absolutely no use to people most in need of scholarships. In fact, they are useful only to people who could otherwise go on for post primary, secondary or university education. I intend that every considertion such as those put up by the Deputies will be borne in mind when schemes come to me for sanction and that in sanctioning a scheme all relevant factors will be taken into account. I sincerely hope to see the end of the £10 scholarships of which we see so many now.</P>
      <P>On the question of boarding school versus day school, I think it necessary to point out that a boarding school for one boy may be the day-school of the boy living near it.  They are not necessarily separate types of institution. Sometimes they are but most of them are both boarding and day schools. They are day schools for those living near and boarding schools for those not living near enough to a school to attend daily and who are boarded at or near the school at their own expense. The schooling given is the same in both cases.  The question of a differentiation will arise only in cases where students win scholarships and have not a school near them which they could attend as day pupils.  It will then arise that a scholarship, not alone to the school, but to board in or near the school, will be necessary and there will have to be a differentiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be possible for local authorities to submit schemes allowing such students the extra money necessary to permit them to board at a school and to receive their schooling while boarding <Col N="2349" /> there, but I visualise that nobody will get a special type of scholarship to take him away to a boarding school if there is a day school, say, within five miles of his home.</P>

      <P>In most mature countries, recognition has long since been given to competent bodies of students who are heard by the appropriate Department of Education and by the university colleges in the States in question.

      <P>I am not accepting the Minister's ruling.  He has not the <Col N="2353" /> function to rule on it.  We have the sorry plight of being the only country in the world who will not give students the responsibility of consulting with the Department of Education, and while we may all feel that students at large are irresponsible, there is one way of making them responsible, that is, by giving them some responsibility and I think the courtesy ought to be extended to the Union of Students of Ireland of at least acknowledging their communication.  They should be heard at least once a year on the multitudinous problems which affect them and which are jeopardising their health and their education.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the Deputy's admonition in respect of university students who go abroad.  I do not want to blow my trumpet but my son is president of the Students' Union of University College, Dublin, and he knows that many students here in Dublin go abroad to work during their recess and that they are a credit to this country.  Some of them work in the hop fields of Kent, others in the Channel Islands and in the Isle of Man.  They have never let their country down.  Therefore, I cannot understand Deputy Ryan, being a Dublin man, complaining about their going abroad.</P>
      <P>Of course Deputy Ryan, being a Dublin man, is well found and well fed but I can take him down to Kerry or West Limerick where so many students come from humble homes. They like to go abroad and, to my mind, it is much better for them to do so than to spend their holidays at home living like wasters.  Those who have gone to Britain and elsewhere have brought nothing but credit on their country and have come back independent and not as burdens on their parents.  Accordingly, I think we should be very proud of the students we send abroad.</P>

I would be the last in the world to restrict students of this country to the green fields of Ireland but I reiterate that it is wrong for the Department to refuse to meet them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to correct Deputy Collins's interpretation of Deputy Ryan's statement.  I just want on the section, to reiterate my complete objection to what the Minister is doing under it.  We are dealing with the Act of 1908 under which the county councils and the county boroughs of this country were given power to assist university education in Ireland from the local rates and they have done it in a very valiant but very struggling way.  The Minister will understand that I am not making any personal reflection on County Clare when I say that Clare, where a penny in the pound produces approximately the same as in South Tipperary, compares very unfavourably with it.  Clare spends only £600 a year on university scholarships while South Tipperary spends £6,600.  While secondary education is valuable and while scholarships to secondary schools may be an incentive to get our young people to go to them, the fact that scholarships are available to universities is a strong inducement to young fellows of talent since it helps them to bear the cost and the strain of higher education.  Here the Minister is definitely reducing that inducement.</P>

      <P>This will give £7,000 more money from the State which they will not have to raise from the rates. It will allow them to spend £11,000 on post-primary scholarships, as against the £2,500 they are allowed at the moment.  It will change the proportion between the post-primary and the university scholarships.  This is not done on an unconsidered whim but after a study of the proportion of the students taking post-primary and university education over each part of the country.  It will reduce it to a reasonable proportion.  If the Deputy says he does not want this interference with what is granted to South Tipperary, if he is honest and says that, I will be satisfied, but when he tries to prove that they will have less money when I am giving them more, it is very hard to be patient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me try to be honest.  I told the Minister that according to the information he gave here on 11th July last, South Tipperary spent in 1960-61, £6,600 on university scholarships, and £2,500 on post-primary scholarships.  They spent <Col N="2357" /> £9,100.  Assuming they raise money at the same rate next year, they will get £9,100 and the Minister will give them under this Bill the sum of £1,530. They will therefore have £10,630 to spend.  The Minister says in Section 3 of this Bill that statutorily they will not be allowed to spend on university scholarships more than one-third of that amount.  One-third of £10,630 is £3,540 and they are spending £6,600 on university education today.  Is there anything dishonest in my asking the Minister to look at these figures?</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to look at Section 3 and tell us does he not consider that the provisions of Section 3 would prevent the South Tipperary people from spending as much money on university scholarships next year and the year after as they are spending at the moment.  That is the circumscribed question I am putting to the Minister; it is the circumscribed point I have been making.  It is one clear point to show that this Bill will create serious difficulty for any county council which has been generous or progressive in dealing with university scholarships.  I would say again to the Minister that the university scholarship scheme is a great attraction and enables people to get secondary education.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is very impatient.  Next year, they will get from the State the amount of money which has to be raised locally by a rate of 1d. in the £.  The new scholarships provided out of the new money will be subject to regulations under this Bill, but the carry-over of their other scholarship scheme will not be governed by them.  Is that the difficulty? <Col N="2358" /> That is for next year.  In four years' time, we will have the new fund and the whole scheme will be governed by the regulations, but next year new scholarships will be provided in the proportion of one to two.</P>

Is it the Minister's intention to have serious consultations with people who have looked after students, and know what students have to go through in attending the university, with a view to seeing that new scholarships are fixed at a level which will enable them and their parents to have quiet minds?  It is one thing to have young engineers going into an engineering firm and widening their experience or to have university students going to work in France or elsewhere to work up a language; but it is a different thing altogether having them doing drudgery work in order to get a few pence to buy books or something of that kind.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The State is not throwing itself into the educational impulse on a £ for £ basis. <Col N="2362" /> In the case of Leitrim, the State is throwing itself in on a £ for £ basis for scholarships&mdash;free for those who are particularly brilliant and assisted for those not so brilliant.  The Minister knows that in respect of the other schemes for education for which Leitrim and other western counties are responsible, the Department of Education has had to recognise that the Leitrim ratepayers were unable from their own resources to provide the assistance to education on the vocational and technical side thought to be adequate and desirable for the people in order to bring them up to some kind of a reasonable standard compared with outside counties.  There is no provision here that will enable the Minister to give the poorest of the counties and the weakest of the rate-paying section of our people anything more than a £ for a £.  In fact, some of them will be waiting until the end of four years before they even get a £ for a £.  The Minister has only to look at the answers he gave on 11th July.  At one glance at a comparison of the tables there, he will see what the position is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might not have noticed it is not a £ for a £ all the way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, well I know it.  People will be surprised when they find it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>They will never find it out if the Deputy has an opportunity. It is a £ for a £ for the first penny on the rates and a £ for a £ for the next penny, but it is 30/- in the £ for the third penny.  The Deputy said the people of Leitrim will have to wait four years.  In three years' time, for the produce of a penny in the £ on the rates, they will get a sum equal to the produce of 3½d. in the £.  The first point the Deputy made was that South Tipperary, who are striking a fairly high rate for education, will not get more than they are raising from the rates.  The Deputy's worry was that I would get credit for giving them £ for £.  It should have been clear from the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did   out to give the <Col N="2363" /> impression that there would be £ for £.  I set a ceiling and I said that, at the end of four years, the full scheme would be working and we would be carrying the scholarship holders of four separate examinations.  In the first year it would be £ for £; in the second year £ for £; in the third year 30/- for every £, and in the fourth year 30/-for every £ on condition that the rates were raised one penny each year.  The amount the State would be giving would be equal to the produce of 5d. in regard to a county which was itself raising 4d.  If a county raised more than that, all credit to the county.</P>
    <P>I am not claiming credit for a scheme which has no ceiling.  There is a ceiling.  I hope the position will be improved in time but, at the moment, there is a ceiling.  The Deputy said he was instancing a county which would not benefit equally with the benefit it gives itself.  It will benefit in exactly the same way as if it raised its rates another 5d. and without putting another penny on the rates.  The Deputy thinks only of South Tipperary.  I do not know why.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The average on the rates at the moment is about 3d.  For an extra penny over the next four years, all these counties will be able to get an amount equal to the produce of 5d. in their rates without imposing one penny extra.  As well as that, there is the added inducement to raise the rate for education by having 1½ for 1, 30/- for each £ they raise, and that will be on the third and fourth penny levied. There is a good deal more to it than the Deputy is prepared to admit.  If a county raises more in the rates, then the State contribution will likewise improve. It is to their advantage to raise more but they are not obliged under the Bill to raise more.</P>

      <P>I must be asleep still.  In a kind of half wakefulness, may I ask the Minister again, if he does not mind my mentioning South Tipperary once more, if the amount they raise at the moment is 6d., do I <Col N="2364" /> understand from the Minister that, unless they raise 7d. this year, they will not get the penny the Minister talks about?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid this has got out of hand altogether.  A county that raises 6d. will next year, I hope, raise 6d. in order to benefit by a contribution from the Department equal to 1d. on the rates.  They will have, therefore, the produce of 7d. on the rates for their 6d.  The year after, still raising 6d., they will get a total amount equal to 8d. on the rates&mdash;2d. worth of that amount coming from the Department. The third year they will get 3½d. bringing them to 9½d. on the rates without changing the rate struck at all.  In the fourth year they will get 11d. without raising their rates one penny.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently I was fully awake at that level and that encourages me to think I am awake at this level.  Leitrim spent £1,880 on university scholarships and £1,060 on post-primary scholarships.  Last year they spent £1,940 and they raised £609 by 1d. on the rates.  If they never raise any more money this year, they will get £609 from the Minister.  The following year they will get twice that £1,218. The year after that, if they do not raise more than £1,940, they will not get the 3½d.  They will only get £1,940 whereas the 3½d. would entitle them to £3,231.</P>

      <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity <Col N="2366" /> to deal with a point which Deputy Booth raised on the Report Stage and with which I was not able to deal at that time.  Section 50 of the Bill provides that in assessing damages in a fatal case account shall not be taken of any sum payable under any contract of insurance or any pension, gratuity or other like benefit payable under statute or otherwise in consequence of the death of the deceased.  There is an exactly similar provision in Section 5 of the Fatal Injuries Act, 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is Section 49?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1956 Act.  It is repeated in Section 52 of this Bill. The law in regard to sums payable on death under insurance contracts was first enacted in the Fatal Accidents (Damages) Act, 1908.  Prior to that Act, money received under any insurance policy had to be taken into account in assessing damages in a fatal case.  This was the effect of the Fatal Accidents Act, 1846, according to a case decided by the British House of Lords in 1888.  In the case of non-fatal injuries, on the other hand, sums payable under an accident insurance policy are not deducted or taken into account in assessing damages.  The reason for this was given in a leading case in 1874.  The insurance payment was held to be something completely collateral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision in the 1956 Fatal Injuries Act which was a general provision put pensions, gratuities and similar benefits in the same position as insurance benefits in fatal cases.  There were a number of precedents for this. Under Section 60 (1) of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, account was not to be taken of any pension or child's allowance payable under the Act when damages were being assessed under the Fatal Accidents Acts.  There is a similar provision in regard to a children's allowance, not to be confused with a child's allowance in Section 14 (1) of the Children's Allowances Act, 1944.  Also a widow's (contributory) pension and an orphan's (contributory) allowance are excluded from account under Section 34 (1) of the <Col N="2367" /> Social Welfare Act, 1952.  It is interesting to note that the change made by Section 5 of our 1956 Act was subsequently followed in Britain in the Fatal Accidents Act, 1959, and in a similar Act in the North passed in the same year.</P>
    <P>As in the case of insurance payments, the law as to pensions was different in fatal cases from what it was in non-fatal cases.  There were in fact two leading cases on the matter in recent years.  The first was <i>Payne v. Railway Executive</i> decided by the English Court of Appeal in 1951.  In that case, the plaintiff, while serving in the British Navy, was seriously injured by the defendant's negligence.  He was invalided out and awarded a disability pension. The defendant appealed on the ground that the value of the pension, assessed at the trial at £2,250 should be deducted from the award of £3,000.  It was held that there should be no deduction, Lord Justice Cohen saying&mdash;</P>
    <P>The accident in this case was not the <i>causa causans</i> of the receipt by the plaintiff of the disability pension, but the <i>causa sine qua non</i>.  The <i>causa causans</i> was his service in the Royal Navy.</P>
    <P>The principle followed in the case was the same as that laid down in the earlier case on insurance sums decided in 1874, to which I referred earlier. One of the appeal judges in <i>Payne's Case</i> pointed out that the pension was a factor that entered into a question of pay and that it was reasonable to presume that pay would be higher without pension rights.  <i>Payne's Case</i> was applied in another English case reported last year.  This was <i>Judd v. Hammersmith Hospitals</i>, where it was held that in assessing damages for loss of earnings no deduction should be made for a pension which becomes payable on a plaintiff's ceasing to work because of his injuries.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that there is no necessity to provide in this Bill that pensions are not to be taken into account in non-fatal cases as that is the existing law.  If there were any doubt about it I should have no hesitation in inserting a specific provision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in asking the House to agree to the insertion of a specific provision, but I do not think there is any necessity for such a provision. I considered this matter most carefully and I believe that the decided cases leave no room for doubt.  Indeed it is natural that, as happened with Deputy Booth, the first question that springs to mind when one looks at Section 50 of this Bill is: How about non-fatal cases?  The answer is that the ordinary law covers the matter adequately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo; and I should just like to say that it is very gratifying that this measure of law reform should now be passing through the House.  The Bill was introduced by the Minister for Justice and has been guided through the Committee Stage by his Parliamentary Secretary.  Of course, the Bill has a parentage which is not entirely represented by the present membership of the House.</P>
      <P>This measure of law reform has been under consideration for a number of years and the work that has gone into it is not confined to the last year or two years.  This proposal to amend the law affecting civil liability has been on the stocks for a great number of years.  In fact I think that I and some of my colleagues can claim to have given impetus to this matter from time to time.  I introduced a Private Member's Bill twice with the title &ldquo;Civil Liability Bill&rdquo; and I feel at least I have given the title to this measure.  I certainly welcome the Bill as a major measure of law reform.  I think it is a major measure of law reform.  It is due in large measure to the thought and ideas of a very eminent jurist and I think acknowledgment has already been made of the work he has done.  I can only hope that the work that has gone into the drafting of the Bill and the discussions that took place in Committee on the Bill have borne fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite necessarily, a number of new terms and phrases are introduced in the Bill itself which may appear strange but I have little doubt that the <Col N="2369" /> Bill, when it comes to be construed and operated in the courts, will prove to be a valuable measure.  I certainly welcome the passing of the Bill now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a question which occurs to me as a layman not versed, as some of my colleagues are, in the law of tort.  This is a Bill which substantially eliminates from our legal system the old concept of contributory negligence, and substitutes therefor a new concept whereby if a person suffers damage as a result of negligence, the proportion of the loss sustained is commensurate with the degree of negligence shown by the parties to the suit.</P>
      <P>I think of the considerable reform that was achieved by the city of London with the institution of the commercial court in 1906 or thereabouts, when a system of law based on the custom of the city of London was transferred to what was described as the commercial court.  A very much simpler method of procedure was inaugurated in order to reduce the costs of litigation.  It is true to say that, since the inauguration of the procedure of the commercial court in London, the merchants of London have been saved probably by this time millions of pounds in legal costs which they would have been required to meet had their litigation passed through the ordinary King's Bench or whatever it passed through before the commercial court was established.</P>
      <P>Now with the disappearance of the old concept of contributory negligence in our law of tort and the reduction of these matters to a simple process of ascertaining the amount of the damage done and the proportion of responsibility resident in each of the parties to the suit, it appears to the simple and untutored mind that a very much abbreviated arbitration procedure might well be substituted for the procedures of litigation at present associated with such actions for tort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is natural that those married to the law and with a profound reverence for all its procedures should regard such a departure as being somewhat revolutionary.  It is natural that those <Col N="2370" /> accustomed to the ordinary procedures associated with the law of tort under our legal system should feel that nothing short of what they would describe as the due process of law is adequate for the determination of such matters but to the untutored mind, it certainly <i>prima facie</i> appears that only two matters fall to be determined: first, the value of the damage done; and secondly, the measure of the parties' responsibilities; and that these matters could be very expeditiously disposed of by a stipendiary arbitrator or by an arbitrator chosen in the customary way with the consent of both parties and that thereby a very large sum might be saved in litigant's costs.</P>
    <P>I mention this because I feel that with the emergence of this legislation, the next step becomes sooner or later inevitable. If it does, then the sooner we turn our mind to determining the most satisfactory machinery, the better.  I imagine that some day, when we make up our mind to advance in that direction, the correct preliminary step would be to provide access for both parties to either procedure, leaving it open to either party to prefer the existing methods of litigation but admitting both parties, if they should elect for it, to the more or less elaborate procedure of an arbitration.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as Deputy O'Higgins said, is the fruit of many years' consideration, like the Courts Establishment Bill and the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, which have been in draft for quite a while and have now been brought before the House.  I am not at all sure they received fully adequate discussion. We are now in the first week of August and this Bill is merely one of many which the House has sought to rush through in the course of the past three or four weeks.</P>
    <P>I deplore that method of moving legislation through the House and I want to avail of this occasion to say that where legislation of this kind is ready prepared, the Government ought to be able to bring it before Dáil Éireann in that period of the legislative year when the House is not preoccupied with the essential financial business that has to be disposed of before the end of July. These are matters, of course, which <Col N="2371" /> may not be fully comprehensible to the public at large but they ought to be matters of great concern to the Deputies of this House.</P>
    <P>No greater disaster could overtake Parliament than that it should acquire the reputation in the minds of the people of being no more than a rubber stamp for the wishes of the Executive.  If we are to avoid that indictment, it is the duty of the Government to ensure that the legislation they desire to have enacted will be brought before the House at a time when it is possible for the House to give it due consideration.</P>
    <P>It is illusory to imagine that this Bill has received the detailed consideration to which it was entitled.  We have not had time to do that.  The same is true of more than one Bill for which the Parliamentary Secretary has to be responsible.  I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary.  On the contary I compliment him on the skill with which he has had recourse to his brief.  He has read out to the House learned discourses on various aspects of this legislation which, I have no doubt, will be quoted from the Official Reports hereafter as evidence of his exceptional and outstanding ability. That is a perfectly legitimate procedure but I cannot help admiring the bland &mdash;&ldquo;self-satisfaction&rdquo; is a word I use with no desire to be rude&mdash;exterior with which he breathes forth these carefully-prepared briefs and the strange prescience with which he looks forward to the debates in the printed records of Dáil Éireann as monuments of his extraordinary erudition.</P>
    <P>This is a useful Bill not only for itself but for the possibilities that ensue therefrom.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on having adhered so strictly to his brief.  It read beautifully. The reference to <i>causa causans</i> I thought beautifully impressive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>I hope it will not sound ungracious of me if I do not share Deputy Dillon's last expressed wish.  First of all, I should like to say that I am fully conscious of the fact that Deputy O'Higgins was very anxious for a long time to have this Bill.  I should like to pay a tribute to him for the persistence with which he advocated in this House that the Bill should be introduced without delay.  I want to go a bit further than that.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was referred to a Special Committee, Deputy O'Higgins, and indeed all the members of that Special Committee, were more than helpful in their attitude.  Dealing with the Bill in that Special Committee, I received complete co-operation and assistance from all the members.  I am very grateful for that.  I know all the members of that Special Committee were as anxious as I was to secure the best possible Bill.  I have the report of the Special Committee before me.  I said, as the Committee was concluding its business, that I was very grateful indeed to the members of the Committee for the way in which they dealt with the Bill and that the object of us all had been to get as good a Bill as possible.</P>
      <P>In reply to the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition that he feels this Bill did not get adequate discussion may I say that though that might appear to be so it is not in fact so. We went through this Bill meticulously and carefully in the Special Committee.  I feel that special care was brought to bear on it&mdash;indeed, a care which is not brought to bear on every Bill which comes before this House.  I think most of the members of the Opposition who participated in the discussion will share my view that never at any stage was the Bill being rushed or adequate care and attention not given to it.  We prepared and issued with the Bill a full and detailed explanatory memorandum.</P>

      <P>I already admitted and acknowledged in this House our debt to Dr. Glanville Williams.  However, the Bill now before us is not his original Bill.  It is a more comprehensive Bill.  With the background of Dr. Williams's excellent textbook, with the fully detailed explanatory memorandum, with the fact that the Bill was referred to a Special Committee where it received most careful and assiduous attention from the members&mdash;and I want to pay a tribute to the distinguished practitioners on that Special Committee who gave of their very best in that Committee&mdash;I think it cannot be suggested that the Bill has been rushed or carelessly dealt with by the House.</P>
      <P>As regards the criticism by the Leader of the Opposition of my expositions of certain aspects of the law, may I say that my motives were not quite as base as they might appear to the Leader of the Opposition to be.</P>

      <P>If I have given out here what would appear to be pompous treatises on the law, it was with a very specific purpose.  The House will realise that we in this country unfortunately have a dearth of good textbooks. Where possible, I have availed of either the explanatory memorandum, the explanatory sidenotes in a Bill or the Official Reports to try to bridge that gap and to place on record for students and others the principles which inspired the various changes in the law.  I think that was an objective worth while striving after.  In so far as I did appear to elaborate unnecessarily the principles behind what we were doing, there was a reason for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2374" /> The Leader of the Opposition also mentioned a hope that this Bill would encourage resort to arbitration.  I would hope that the Bill will very definitely lead to a reduction in the amount of litigation in this sphere of the law.  The experience in other jurisdictions where apportionment has been introduced has been that there is a lessening of litigation and a considerable increase in settlements.  I earnestly hope that the same result will eventuate here.</P>
    <P>The position about arbitration is straightforward.  We have the Arbitration Act of 1954 under the provisions of which it is open to the parties to an action to have recourse to arbitration, although I want to say that from time to time it has been suggested that arbitration can be just as expensive as litigation.  Indeed, a former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, I think, is on record in this House to that effect.  Whether that is so or not, the simple answer to Deputy Dillon's remarks is that it is open to litigants to resort to arbitration in any case.  We have a modern Arbitration Act in the 1954 Act and its provisions are there for those who wish to avail themselves of them.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to say on the Bill except, again, to express my gratitude to and appreciation of the members of the House who took such a constructive and helpful interest in the Bill.  I think I should also reiterate my gratitude to Dr. Glanville Williams who has been unsparing in his assistance to us throughout the preparation of the Bill and its passage through the Dáil.  Finally, I want to say that I feel that all of us in the House have honestly done our best with the Bill and I hope that, when it goes through the Seanad and is enacted, we will have given the people and the practitioners a valuable and useful piece of legislation.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Cork Gas Order, 1961&mdash;Motion of Approval.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Cork Gas Order, 1961, proposed to be made by the Minister <Col N="2375" /> for Transport and Power and laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on the 17th day of June, 1961, under subsection (4) of section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>
    <P>The Cork Gas Consumers' Company is a statutory body set up under a private Act of 1868 and is not subject to the ordinary provisions of company law.  Any alterations in the statutory provisions relating to the company have to be effected by means of a Special Order under Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, which enables me to grant additional powers to the company.  Before the Order is made, it has to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas may by resolution approve the draft Order in the form submitted or approve it with modifications or additions.  When such approval is given I may make the Order in the form in which it has been approved.</P>
    <P>Before I may make such an Order, it must be publicised in order to give an opportunity to all concerned to make objections.  If objections made are not either accepted or withdrawn by the objectors I may direct the holding of a Public Inquiry before making the Order.</P>
    <P>Notice of the proposed Order was published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in the newspapers and copies were sent to the local authorities in Cork and to other public bodies who might be concerned. Two objections were made by the Cork Workers' Council.  One was withdrawn and by agreement the draft Order was amended to meet the other objection.  In the absence of any other objections and as there was nothing repugnant to the public interest in the Order, I recommend it to the House for approval.  The Order has already been approved by Resolution of the Seanad.  In the debate in that House, I was surprised to find objections raised to the reasonable provisions of the Order on grounds of what I can only describe as doctrinaire socialism.  It may, perhaps, be helpful to the Dáil if I deal in some detail with the main objections raised in the Seanad.  Objection was taken to the increase of the company's capital from £150,000 to <Col N="2376" /> £750,000; to the issue of bonus shares and to the building up of reserves which make that possible.  The assets of the Cork Gas Company are now valued at £574,000 and some £176,000 further capital additions are planned for the near future to enable the company to give better service and to complete on better terms with electricity and other forms of fuel.</P>
    <P>The £150,000 share capital was fixed in 1868 and is now entirely unreal.  The reserve built up reflects very little more than the change in the value since then of real property generally.  The extent to which the increased share capital will be met by new subscriptions or by bonus shares is entirely a matter for the company.  I can see nothing wrong in the issue of bonus shares in respect of the accumulated capital assets which are the property of the existing shareholders. It is largely a book transaction. Unless the earnings of the company are increased there can in the long run be no increase in dividends.  If by any chance the law was amended to provide for no-par shares as has been recommended by many authorities these objections would cease to have any meaning at all.</P>
    <P>The limitation of £10,000 on the amount of reserve funds also dates from 1847 and is now unreal.  Moreover, the accumulation of reserves in our situation is a useful and desirable form of saving.  In present circumstances, the provision of a ceiling on the reserves which may be accumulated by the company serves no useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also to the need for controlling the charges and profits of the company.  In present circumstances, there is no likelihood that the Cork Gas Company would be able to make excessive profits.  The days when it enjoyed a real monopoly are gone and it must now face intense competition with electricity as well as with solid fuel and oil appliances.  In any case I have power under the Gas Regulation Act, 1957, to fix maximum charges by Order following consideration by an advisory committee.  If ever the circumstances warranted that course I should have no hesitation about establishing the necessary advisory committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2377" /> The normal existing provisions whereby consumers are responsible for meters are clarified in the Order.  I know that in some circumstances rifling of gas meters has caused hardship but human nature being what it is, it would be impracticable to shift the responsibility from the consumers. The company have assured me that they will deal with genuine hardship in such cases with generosity and discretion.  They find it pays to be kind in this context.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must say that the changes which are being made by this Order are similar to the changes which, if the company were a private one, a wise board would seek to have made in their Articles and Memorandum under the Companies Acts.  They are aimed at the prudent and useful deployment and expansion of the company's resources in the interests of the shareholders and public alike and no one could take serious exception to them who does not hold the now out of date view that all profits are immoral.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are advised that there is no serious objection to this Order but I should be interested to hear from the Minister for Transport and Power why it is still thought desirable to maintain in respect of the Dublin Gas Company the strict link between the dividends permitted and the price charged for gas, or has that proviso been removed?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly when I was young in this town, the Dublin Gas Company could not increase their dividends if they did not provide the consumers with a corresponding reduction in the price of gas.  On the whole I think it is true to say that what may have been a monopoly in the old days is no longer so, particularly with the introduction of electricity.  Gas now competes with it and other varieties of heating and of course it is no longer a significant source of illumination.  Still, if the power were not there, which it is, I <Col N="2378" /> understand, to control the price of gas, if the necessity did arise, I would be uneasy.  I think I am right in saying that the Minister has power which can be invoked to control the price of power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on the advice of the advisory committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We must not close our eyes to the fact that gas is very largely the cooking fuel of the poor.  While, in theory, it is true that there is effective competition between gas and electricity, if people in modest circumstances have equipped themselves to cook with gas, it is not much use telling them to throw out their gas cooker and put in an electric cooker when they cannot afford to make the change. Therefore, it is necessary to have power, if the attempt is made to exploit the essential needs of poor people, for profit, to intervene on behalf of the community in order to redress the situation.</P>
      <P>I did not read the debate that took place in the Seanad but I am not a doctrinaire socialist and yet I would be prepared to maintain that sources of power ought to be in the control of the community.  Does anyone suggest that the E.S.B. ought to become a private company?  If anyone did suggest that to us, we would think it pretty odd. This controversy has raged long and loudly in the United States of America, and that is not a citadel of doctrinaire socialism, but I should say that almost every liberal-minded man and woman in the United States of America now would be prepared to say that power ought to be in the control of the community which uses it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the canvassing of the possibility of gas and electricity and other sources of power being under public control is doctrinaire socialism.</P>

    <Col N="2380" />
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not what was the matter of discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I followed the Minister's statement as clearly as I could. What I want to say is&mdash;wherever I heard that issue canvassed, it was the most liberal elements in the society who were in favour of public control of light and power and it was the conservative, reactionary element who did not give a damn about anybody who took up the doctrinaire position that it was contrary to public morality that there should be public control of light and power.</P>
      <P>I do not think public control of light and power represents doctrinaire socialism.  I believe it represents sound liberal principles for which we have the support of diverse persons. But for the fact that I believe that circumstances obtaining in Cork and circumstances obtaining in Dublin effectively prevented the gas company either in Dublin or Cork from having an effective monopoly, I would be in favour of the public control of both, but I think it is true to say that in the modern conditions in which we live, there is competition and where there is competition, I believe you will get the best value for the consumer.</P>
      <P>That is the only yardstick by which I measure the merits of this matter.  I have no doctrinaire convictions in respect of it, but, even believing that, I feel, for the reasons already stated, that it is wise to retain an overriding power to inaugurate control, if that should prove necessary for the protection of the poor.  So long as that safe-guard has been incorporated in the Order, we see no objection to its general terms.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby confirms the Transport Act, 1950 (Additional Powers) Order, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2381" /> The Order will not come into operation unless and until it has been confirmed by Resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Order is to confer on C.I.E. the power necessary to establish a subsidiary company to take over, operate and develop the Board's Great Southern hotels and catering services. The new company will be a private company set up under the Companies Acts and will have a share capital of £100,000 divided into 100,000 shares of £1 each.  All of this capital will be taken up by C.I.E.  The number of directors will be not more than six and the remuneration will be subject to my approval and the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The Board of C.I.E may appoint not more than three of themselves to be directors of the new company as well as the Chairman; the appointment of the remaining directors will be subject to my approval.  The Chairman of C.I.E. for the time being, will be Chairman of the company.</P>
    <P>The Memorandum and Articles of Association of the new company and any alterations therein will be subject to my approval, but they cannot be finalised or the new company set up until the Oireachtas has approved this Order.  The name of the new company, which will be in Irish, has not been finally settled, but the Board intend to continue the use of the name Great Southern Hotels to which very valuable goodwill attaches.  The report and accounts of the company will be presented annually to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The new company will take over the seven Great Southern hotels by way of conveyance or lease.  It will also take over the Board's Hotels' Department Headquarters at 141 Thomas Street, Dublin.  In addition the company will operate the various catering services at present provided by the Board on dining cars, at station refreshment rooms, at Busarus, on the Aran steamer and Shannon pleasure boats.</P>
    <P>The extent of the business undertaken by these hotels and services can be judged from the figures quoted in the Board's financial accounts for recent <Col N="2382" /> years.  For the year ended 31st March, 1960, receipts from the hotels and refreshment services totalled £885,000 whereas expenditure, including provision for superannuation, amounted to £824,000 in the same year. In the year ended 31st March, 1961, receipts amounted to £991,000 approximately and expenditure, again including provision for superannuation, to about £915,000.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention that the company will receive any direct or indirect financial subsidy from the Exchequer apart from whatever grants or other assistance it may be entitled to receive in common with other hotel companies, for example through Bord Fáilte. To the extent that such grants will not be sufficient to finance future development it is the intention that the company will finance development through capital raised on the security of its own assets or alternatively through borrowing guaranteed by C.I.E.</P>
    <P>The number of staff involved varies from about 550 in the Winter season to 900 in the Summer season.  There has been full consultation between the Board and the unions involved in regard to the transfer of staff to the new company.  Transferred staff will retain their existing rights to superannuation benefits and redundancy compensation and I have given an undertaking that amending legislation in order to provide for retention of such rights by the staff concerned, will be introduced.</P>
    <P>The proposal to establish a separate company for the Board's hotels and catering services represents a welcome decentralisation of management and control.  The operation of hotels has little in common with transport problems and it is desirable that the higher management of C.I.E. should be able to concentrate on the difficult transport problems they still have to face. Conversely, the hotels and catering services can have the undivided attention of specialised management staff and this will be all the more important as a major scheme of improvement and extension of the hotels is now under way.  There will be room on the new Board for new blood with specialised qualifications.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the House should <Col N="2383" /> confirm this Order and I am sure that the House will join with me in wishing the new company every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a proposal to create new jobs.  The Minister says the Board of C.I.E. may appoint not more than three of themselves to be directors of the new company as well as the chairman.  The appointment of the remaining directors will be subject to his approval.  There are to be six directors.  The Minister calls this justified, since it will be a welcome decentralisation of management and control.  Surely all the trend in modern management is for diversification. Messrs.  Guinness are now making toffee and Thomas Tilling has so diversified himself that he has not a horse and cart left.  He is in everything but transport and glories in the fact.</P>
      <P>It is a poor administration that cannot provide adequate managerial capacity for refreshment in transport.  I remember when I first went to America, if you travelled on the Santa Fe rail-road, you dined in a Harvey restaurant. Now every company does its own catering. The Santa Fe and the Canadian Pacific and the Southern Pacific all do. There is no railway company which does not do its own catering.  All this is a great deal of trouble to create three jobs.</P>

      <P>I do not think an exchange of compliments on that basis between the Deputy and myself would be seemly.  Let us talk about Coras Iompair Éireann, and the board, and the six directors, three of whom are to be approved by the Minister.  This is an order to make jobs and I deplore it.  I know of nothing that cannot be done without the creation of the new board.  We have set up a body to inquire into the Companies Act in order to prevent this type of abuse in which one company begins to hive off a whole series of subsidiary companies. That practice is largely rooted in the direction of duplication of directorships, and duplication of fees.  I am <Col N="2386" /> proceeding on the assumption that in so far as the directorships here are duplicated, they will not involve duplication of fees.</P>
      <P>Will anyone tell me what on earth is the purpose in setting up a new board of directors, of whom the majority are existing directors of Coras Iompair Éireann?  Could not a committee of the Board of C.I.E. act as the board of the catering division of the company's activities, with full authority to hire any administrative assistance they require, technical or otherwise?  Of course they could.  This is put forward in order to create three jobs.  I wish the Minister and his colleagues joy of their patronage but it is not edifying and it is not seemly.  It is time to root that kind of unsavoury patronage out of the ordinary public life of this country.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether when people in Deputy Davern's constituency, Deputy MacCarthy's, and mine, on a journey to Limerick last Sunday, were charged 11d. per bottle for minerals by C.I.E., it was the intention to meet some of the additional charges involved in the appointment of this new company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify one or two points.  He said in his speech that:</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Order is to confer on C.I.E. the power necessary to establish a subsidiary company to take over, operate and develop the Board's Great Southern hotels and catering services.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister is it the intention of the board to establish new hotels.  He specifically refers to the take-over of seven hotels, so I should like him to say whether or not this company will be concerned with the seven hotels only, or is it their intention to engage in the establishment of new hotels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess I am somewhat in agreement with Deputy Dillon when he queries the necessity for the establishment of this company.  The Minister has done himself an injustice in <Col N="2387" /> that he has given us the minimum information about this proposal.  He said:</P>
    <P>The operation of hotels has little in common with transport problems and it is desirable that the higher management of C.I.E. should be able to concentrate on the difficult transport problems they still have to face.</P>
    <P>It seems peculiar to me, too, that the three members and the Chairman, who are at present members of the Board of C.I.E., will be concerned with the running of these hotels.  On the other hand, the Minister says that these people should be much more concerned about the great transport problems which still confront us.  If this constitutes the great problem the Minister says it does, there should be a brand-new board, and we should not have the Chairman of C.I.E. and three existing directors concerning themselves with what the Minister describes as problems which should not concern them at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister also says:</P>
    <P>It is not the intention that the company will receive any direct or indirect financial subsidy from the Exchequer apart from whatever grants or other assistance it may be entitled to receive in common with other hotel companies, for example, through Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and the Government want to nationalise hotels, that is another kettle of fish, but this dabbling in the hotel business does not satisfy me.  For that reason, I think the Minister should state specifically whether or not it is the intention that the proposed company will concern itself with the seven hotels exclusively, or will go more fully into the hotel business.</P>
    <P>However, no matter what the outcome of this proposal is, we are all concerned&mdash;at least, I know I am&mdash; with the type of service provided by C.I.E. in their dining cars.  Certainly there is much room for improvement and if this company insists on a proper catering service by C.I.E., and a clean catering service by C.I.E., they will indeed have done some good for the country and <Col N="2388" /> they certainly will have done the tourist industry a great amount of good.  I do not have occasion very often to travel by train but I did some years ago, and I was appalled at the type of meal which was served, and the manner in which it was served.  In fact, I made a complaint to an official of the then Department of Industry and Commerce. It was not only an impression I got, because I had evidence that the teapot was just dumped in an urn and taken out.  They did not even take the trouble to wipe the teapot with a cloth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.  I must confess that was two or three years ago but it was filthy at that time.  If there has been an improvement, I welcome it, but if it is operating in the same manner as it was the last time I travelled by train, it must be very bad indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether or not to keep to the humorous vein which Deputy Dillon tapped.  The idea that jobs are being created through the establishment of a separate hotel company is really too ludicrous for words.  This is the result of an examination by the Chairman of C.I.E. in connection with the whole reorganisation of the company.  I and the officers of my Department have been thinking along similar lines.  I would imagine that we thought almost coincidentally&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not surprise me very greatly.  You have been thinking coincidentally now for about thirty years</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in regard to this matter.  I do not know to whom the ultimate credit goes of believing there should be a separate company managing the hotels manned by a board of people who, when they come to a directors' meeting, have nothing to do but think about hotels and catering and who do not have to consider the whole examination of the monthly agenda of the C.I.E. organisation in all its aspects. They come prepared to discuss and debate hotels and catering matters. <Col N="2389" /> Under them, there will be a specialist management staff who will equally concern themselves only with hotels and catering matters.</P>
      <P>Having watched the success of Bord na Mona and the growing success of C.I.E. and the increase of £1,000,000 in their revenue last year, I respect the judgment of the Chairman, which, incidentally, concurs with my own, that is would be good for the hotels and good for tourism to have a company specialising in the management of hotels and the catering services.  The Deputy ought to believe my statement is made sincerely.</P>
      <P>Secondly, as far as the directors to be appointed from outside are concerned, those who are not already directors of C.I.E. the Chairman of C.I.E. will make proposals to me in regard to appointments.  I can assure the Deputy he will choose persons who are qualified either in the hotel business as a specialist business or in business administration or have a knowledge of catering&mdash;persons with particular administrative skill.  I can assure the Deputy that the persons appointed will be of high calibre and will be able to perform their functions well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I could nearly name them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to reject the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon that recent appointments to State companies over which I have control have included only those persons whom the Deputy described as people who need some kind of political reward. Quite a number of young men who have proved themselves to be excellent managers of other companies have been appointed to State companies recently, or perhaps older men with very great experience either of other jobs they were asked to undertake or jobs similar to the jobs we ask them to undertake.  If the Deputy will examine some of the new directorships in the State companies, he will be unable to disagree with my view that they are people of ability and not the type of person described by the Deputy as <Col N="2390" /> appointed solely because of some political reward they thought they required or the Government thought they needed.  It was a very unfair observation on his part.  Some of the recent individuals we have appointed to State companies&mdash;I shall not mention them by name&mdash;are able men of the younger generation.</P>
      <P>As far as the fees of the Hotel Board are concerned, they will be given the usual fees applicable to their work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained it is a very different matter being able to approach the problems of running a hotel at a board meeting where nothing else is concerned, where the whole of the problem of hotel <Col N="2391" /> management and of expanding the hotel services can be considered by itself.  If the Deputy has any experience of business, which I daresay he has, he would know the value of that.  Any person in a business of any kind will know it is very valuable to come to a meeting and to have nothing else to examine save a particular activity such as hotel administration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish asked whether the new hotel company will have the power to construct new hotels.  I shall certainly be asking the Chairman of C.I.E. to consider that matter.  As I indicated in the course of the debate on the Estimate for Transport and Power, one of the duties of the Minister is to ensure that the companies relate their activities to the needs of the national economy.  When the hotel company is set up I shall certainly, as I think anybody else in my position on any side of the House would, recommend the new board to consider the establishment of hotels in areas where hotels are required and to consider what changes are needed or what new facilities should be provided in respect of the catering services.  I hope this new company will show the same dynamic character as other State companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is no reason to suspect there is some fell plot in the establishment of this hotel company.  It is done with the same objective of getting more work done, more imaginative thinking, speeding up whatever plans they have and of helping the tourist industry.  That is the purpose of it, exactly the same object as when we decided to form a company for the production of machine-won turf.  There is no difference in our attitude towards this company or the concept of this company.  The same thing would apply to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company carrying out the new idea of establishing factories on an estate close to an airport.</P>

      <P>It is a curious thing, but it is one of the places I had in mind to recommend to the company.  I have very frequently been to Castletownbere. The Deputy may not know I have walked most of the mountains there and I have noted, for example, the absence of sufficient hotel accommodation in the Castletownbere Peninsula. That is the kind of problem I hope the new hotel company will tackle.  If there appears to be no private enterprise, then they will assess the tourist potential from the standpoint <Col N="2393" /> of hotel accommodation.  There are other areas in a similar position.  In North Leitrim there are very beautiful lakes and mountains and there is no hotel accommodation of any kind.</P>

      <P>The new company expects to be able to raise capital on the security of its own assets and on the basis of its financial success.  If they cannot raise capital, C.I.E. will be able to guarantee their borrowing. It is not intended that the State will enter into the picture at all.  I hope the company will have no difficulty in getting capital.  They have had a fairly good financial record for a number of years.  If the Deputy reads the report, he will see that they have been expanding and making sufficient <Col N="2394" /> profit to cover depreciation, superannuation and interest on what can be judged to be the capital of the company plus sufficient profit to cover the share of the general administration applicable to the hotel section of the C.I.E.</P>

      <P>Is it not a recognised abuse of existing company law for existing directors of a company to hive off their activities into subsidiaries and constitute themselves paid directors of their own subsidiaries?  Will the Minister not consider providing that the directors of C.I.E., who are already doing this work in consideration of the fees they are receiving, will follow the example of the Chairman and, so far as the law is applicable to the new company, act for the same remuneration as they are receiving at the moment for doing the work, a matter which was taken into consideration when their fees were originally fixed? If the Chairman recognised it would be an abuse for him to seek to get special fees as chairman of the new company, surely the other directors should accept the same self-denying ordinance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not wish to complicate the discussion but one of the facts in relation to the fees Order is the fact that C.I.E. at the moment are ceasing the operation of one of their subsidiaries related to advertising. Some of the directors have been receiving a very small fee for that and the fee they will get, as a result of becoming directors of the new company, need not worry the Deputy at all.  The directors' fees are so modest that no question of the kind the Deputy raises could arise at all.</P>
