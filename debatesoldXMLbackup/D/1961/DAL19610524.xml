      <P>No adequate current statistics are available of the total number of persons engaged in the building industry.  However, with certain exceptions, manual workers 16 years of age and over in the building industry and, since 1955, in certain specified employments in civil engineering and the painting trade, are compulsorily insured against interruption of employment due to bad weather.  On the basis of the number of stamps sold in each year in respect of such insurance it is possible to estimate the average weekly number employed in these activities during the year.  I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the estimated average weekly number of persons employed in the building industry in the years ended 31 March, 1954 to 31 March, 1961, as derived from the sales of the relevant insurance stamps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is yet in a position to state his decision on the future of Macroom, Millstreet and Skibbereen Hospitals; and, if so, what is the nature of the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are district hospitals at Macroom, Millstreet and Skibbereen.  The question of the future of these hospitals has not been raised with me and, consequently, I presume these are not the hospitals to which the question refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the district hospital there is, at each of these centres, a small hospital originally provided as a fever hospital but more recently used <Col N="736" /> to accommodate tuberculosis patients. They have been closed for the past few years and are not now required for fever hospital, sanatorium or district hospital purposes, but the hospital at Millstreet has been designated for use in the event of an outbreak of smallpox.</P>
    <P>The Cork Health Authority have proposed that the hospitals at Macroom and Skibbereen, formerly used for tuberculosis patients, with bed capacities of 20 and 24 respectively, be used to accommodate persons normally accommodated in county homes.</P>
    <P>I have previously indicated the reasons for my reluctance to approve such a use for small hospital units.</P>
    <P>The whole question of hospital facilities for the city and county of Cork is one of considerable complexity. The position is affected by the changing pattern of health needs exemplified by the decline in bed needs for the treatment of fevers and tuberculosis. Already a certain degree of rationalisation has been achieved.  The hospital at Gurranebraher, which was planned as a fever hospital, has been brought into use as an Orthopaedic Hospital with about 200 beds.  The former sanatorium at Heatherside is used to accommodate about 180 suitable patients discharged from the Mental Hospital.  Mount Desert Hospital, also formerly used for tuberculosis patients, is now a hospital for nearly 70 chronic sick.  I look to the newly established Health Authority, which is now responsible for health services in Cork City and County, to evolve a well-considered hospital plan to cover effectively and economically the needs of the entire area.</P>
    <P>The future of the hospital buildings not now in the use in the three centres mentioned in the question is one of the matters to be taken into account in a comprehensive review of the needs of the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he has considered providing contributory and non-contributory old age pensions for single women over the age of sixty; <Col N="737" /> and whether he intends to introduce legislation to this end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The qualifying age for non-contributory old age pension has been seventy years since the commencement of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908.</P>
      <P>In the course of the examination of the proposals which led to the introduction of old age (contributory) pensions under the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960, the question of the appropriate qualifying age for both contributory and non-contributory old age pension for men and women, whether married or single, was fully considered.  It was then decided, that having regard to all the circumstances the existing pensionable age of seventy years should be adhered to for both types of pension, and for all persons. Nothing has since occurred to warrant a departure from that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the cost of investigating incomes under the Old Age Pensions Acts; and if he has considered the abolition of the means test for non-contributory pensions, as no such test now applies to cases of contributory old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Old Age Pensions are administered integrally with other Social Assistance Services and it would not be practicable to keep a separate record of the cost of investigating means under the Old Age Pensions Acts.  The yearly cost is, however, estimated to be of the order of £25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer to the second part of the question is in the negative.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to the reply given on 13th April last to a similar question.  In that reply it was indicated that the abolition of the means test for non-contributory old age pension would not bring any advantage to the vast majority of non-contributory old age pensioners, over 90 per cent. of whom already qualify for the maximum rate of pension under the existing means test.  The purpose of <Col N="738" /> the means test is to ensure that such money as can be made available for social assistance goes to those whose need is greatest.  Its abolition would benefit only the small minority of non-contributory pensioners receiving payment at reduced rates because they have some means and those whose means are sufficient to exclude them altogether from entitlement to non-contributory old age pension.  Many of the last mentioned category would, of course, be people well able to maintain themselves and, therefore, not in need of assistance from the State.  It was pointed out finally in the reply that, having regard to the limited resources of our community, which in turn limit the amount of the national product available for social assistance, it was felt that it would be appreciated that payment of non-contributory old age pensions without a means test to all such persons could only be made at the expense of those who are truly in need of the maximum pension the community can afford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Minister's reply that the number of people who might benefit if such means test were abolished is very small but would the Minister agree that that small number is totally dissatisfied with the manner in which the investigation officers assess their means?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the £15 bonus is a special arrangement for this area where there are special problems including a larger percentage of cows to the population of the farms and, as I informed the Deputy, where you have a farm clearance scheme in operation if the farmers hold on to their in-calf heifers until they calf down they will qualify.  The matter is being kept continually under review.  I understand the Minister for Agriculture has had a number of meetings down there recently with a number of people concerned in the trade and I have no doubt that he is thoroughly familiar with the problem, but the percentage of in-calf heifers in the area that, as suggested by the Deputy, have failed the test, would not be more than 10 per cent, according to the information before him.</P>

This figure refers to the overall effect of the recent increase but does not mean that each tariff was increased by exactly the same percentage.

      <P>The number of temporary labourers required varies from time to time and is increased or reduced according to the nature of the work to be done and to the deployment of technical staff.  Arrangements were made some time ago to adjust the number of temporary labourers employed so as to conform to the current year's programme which provides for an increase of over 240 in the permanent engineering staff.  Temporary labourers are recruited for particular works and it is normal to release them when the work for which they were recruited is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="768" /> I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Nurses Act, 1950, replaced earlier legislation dealing with the training and registration of nurses and midwives and established a new body, An Bord Altranais, to take over the functions of the former General Nursing Council and the Central Midwives Board.  The object of the present Bill is merely to make some changes in the 1950 Act which time has shown to be necessary or desirable.</P>
      <P>The Bill, made up as it is of a number of miscellaneous provisions, is essentially one to receive greater attention at the Committee Stages than at this stage.  I think it will be adequate at present if I refer briefly to the provisions of the Bill and indicate the reasons why each of them has been included.</P>
      <P>As stated in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the text, Section 2 is designed merely to clear up a doubt.  When An Bord Altranais, in exercise of its powers under the 1950 Act, proceeded to draw up rules for the election of nurses to the Board, it did so on the basis of separate electorates for the different types of nurses.  Thus, the draft rules provided that the midwives would elect the midwife members of the Board, the mental nurses would elect the mental nurse members and the general nurses the general nurse members, an arrangement which, I think the House will agree, was a perfectly reasonable one. The draft rules incorporating this system of separate electorates were approved by the Minister in 1953 and have operated since.  However, doubts have been expressed as to whether a division of the electorate in the manner provided for in the Nurses Rules was covered by the 1950 Act.  What we are doing now is to put the matter beyond doubt and so make it clear that the Nurses Rules of 1953 are in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill will extend the Board's power to pay travelling expenses to its members so as to cover instances where they travel, on the Board's business, otherwise than to meetings of the Board and its Committees. Members of the Board, for <Col N="769" /> instance, may have to visit hospitals which have applied for recognition as training institutions.  It is, of course, proper that travelling and subsistence expenses should be payable on such occasions.  The Section will remedy the oversight in the 1950 Act.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill are complementary.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the audited accounts of the Board for any year, the Minister is required by Section 59 of the Act to pay over to the Board the ascertained revenue deficit for that year.  Having paid over this sum, he collects back from health authorities under Section 60 half the amount.  In practice, what happens is that the deficit in respect of a particular year is not recouped to the Board until twelve months after the end of that year, the Board working on overdraft in the meantime.  The health authorities' share of that amount is not apportioned, collected and brought to account until the next financial year. There is, thus, a three-year cycle in respect of each year's accounts of the Board.</P>
    <P>These arrangements, I think, are unsatisfactory in two respects&mdash;the Board has to wait for its money for over a year after the deficit has occurred and the final completion of the transaction is unnecessarily long drawn out.  The existing provisions, however, are unsatisfactory in a much more important respect.  They impose on the Exchequer and on health authorities an obligation to meet the deficits without giving the Minister an adequate say in the management of the Board's financial affairs.</P>
    <P>The existing Act gives the Minister a certain measure of control in this respect.  Section 61 requires the Board to submit to the Minister estimates of expenditure which may not be exceeded without his consent. Other sections require his approval to the number and remuneration of staff, the fees to be paid to examiners for their services, the travelling expenses to be paid to members and so on. All these controls, such as they are, are on the expenditure side of the account; there are no controls on the revenue side of the account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> The new procedure will provide for an annual grant to be fixed each year in consultation between the Board, the Minister and the Minister for Finance and when the grant has been fixed it will be a matter for the Board to keep its revenue accounts in balance in much the same way as the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, for instance, which gets no State grant, is required to keep its account in balance.  So far as the cost to the Exchequer and to the health authorities is concerned, the new procedure will make no significant difference. This is not a device to save money for either.  What will be achieved is that there will be an end to a procedure, highly objectionable in principle, under which a body created by the Oireachtas and not subject to the normal financial controls is in a position to decide for itself the size of the bill it will present, through the Minister, to the House and the local authorities for automatic payment.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill, as explained in the explanatory memorandum, is introduced as a logical carollary of a provision in the 1950 Act.  That Act made specific provision for the contingency that the Board might fail to perform any of its functions.  In such an eventuality, Section 23 of the Act empowers the Minister, by order, to require the Board to perform that function.  It goes further however and authorises the Minister, if the Board persisted in its failure, to remove the members from office and, further, to appoint a person or persons to discharge the functions of the Board.  By a curious oversight, however, while the Act gave the Minister these rather drastic powers, it did not provide him with the means of satisfying himself whether, in fact, the Board is performing its functions.  The obligation now being placed on the Board by Section 6 of the Bill to supply the Minister with information, on request, is a usual one in the case of bodies established by statute for special purposes. While I think it essential that the Board should be under a statutory obligation to furnish the Minister with such information as he requires, it is only right to say that at <Col N="771" /> no time has the Board refused to give or been dilatory in giving information when required.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill relates to the method of appointment and term of office of the President.  Under the 1950 Act, the members of the Board each year elect one of themselves to act as President.  The Oireachtas has by legislation created a considerable number of special bodies to which I have already referred for special purposes, industrial, commercial or, like An Bord Altranais, regulatory of a particular branch of the national life.  In some cases the chairman or president is appointed by the Government or by the appropriate Minister.  In other cases he is elected by the members of the body.  I have been unable to trace any logical pattern in the whole procedure. I feel that, having regard to the purpose for which An Bord Altranais was established by the Oireachtas, its responsibility to the Minister for the performance of its functions and the manner in which it is financed, the appointment should be made by the Minister.  I feel, too, that it is a bad principle to rotate the office of President during the five year lifetime of any particular Board and that, on the contrary, there is considerable advantage in appointing a particular person to be President each time a new Board takes office and in his continuing in office until the next Board takes over.  In fact, this is what already happens under the 1950 Act in relation to the Chairmanship of the statutory Midwives Committee of the, Board.  Section 33 provides that the Chairman during the entire lifetime of the Committee shall be the person appointed to the Board by the Minister under a particular head.  In more recent times, the Opticians Act, 1956, and the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957, provide that the President of Bord na Radharcmhastóirí and the Chairman of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board shall be appointed by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, under Section 7 of the Bill, that future Presidents of the Board will be appointed by the Minister and that the President's <Col N="772" /> term of office will normally coincide with that of the Board itself. The present President of the Board, whose term of office would normally end next January, will, by virtue of subsection (6) of the section, continue to hold the office for the term unexpired of the life of the present Board&mdash;the balance of the five-year term.</P>
    <P>Section 8 merely removes an obligation on the part of An Bord Altranais to provide for the issue of special badges to all midwives.  Most midwives are now general trained nurses who are already provided with a badge.  As stated in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill, under the new dispensation the Board, while relieved of the statutory obligation, will be in a position to provide such badges as they consider necessary for practising midwives in addition to the nurses' badge which they now issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister correctly said when introducing this Bill that it was a measure in respect of which detailed discussion might better take place at a later stage of the Bill.  Certainly it would not be our intention to go into the Bill in any great detail at this stage but there are certain general observations which I think should be made. The Bill seeks to amend the Nurses Act of 1950.  That Act passed through this House some eleven or twelve years ago.  It was an Act which established in a regular way the education, training, and organisation of Irish nurses.</P>
      <P>I think that generally speaking the Board that was established under the Nurses Act of 1950, An Bord Altranais, has done very excellent work over the last decade.  It certainly set out to raise the standard of training for nurses and I think achieved a considerable measure of success towards attaining that object. Due to its efforts, in recent years girls going into the nursing profession now have available to them a much larger scope for training and education than otherwise they would have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for the House to realise that over the last ten years <Col N="773" /> An Bord Altranais has operated with a large measure of freedom from Departmental control and I think it was that measure of freedom which enabled the Board in its activities to achieve the measure of success it undoubtedly has achieved.  It is because of that that I look with some measure of suspicion on the amendments proposed in this Bill which, whatever may be the motive for them, undoubtedly will bring the Nurses Board more under Departmental control than it has been up to this and I feel the House should have more solid reasons for suggesting a change than are contained in the Second Reading speech of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The first major amendment, which may appear as a trivial one, is nevertheless a significant one.  It is proposed in this Bill, if passed in its present form, that in future the President of An Bord Altranais will be appointed by the Minister.  I do not understand the reason for this proposed change. I am well aware that the person who for many years was President of that Board was a man of independence and tremendous character and it was due to his initiative and enthusiasm that much of the success which attended the Nurses Board's activities was due. I know that the man concerned has had differences from time to time with different Ministers for Health.  I have little doubt that from time to time the present Minister may have felt it desirable to have somebody else as President of An Bord Altranais.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well <Col N="774" /> aware he is not President now.  It is because of that suspicion that I have in relation to the person to whom I have been referring, to the fact that it certainly would have been desired some twelve months ago that he would no longer continue to be President of An Bord Altranais, that I cannot help feeling this is an amendment to meet a particular case.  I cannot understand the logic behind it.  Why should this House change a situation which has obtained for the last twelve years, under which An Bord Altranais itself elects his President?  The Minister mentions the Opticians' Board&mdash;Bord na Radarc Mhastoiri &mdash; established under the Opticians Act.  There it is true to say the Chairman or President is appointed by the Minister, but that Board had quite a definite problem to face and the Minister surely will agree that the decision for the Minister to appoint that Board was because it was obviously undesirable that any person who had a partisan view in relation to the activities of the Board should be in the Chair.  Certainly when I introduced the Opticians Act to this House I had in mind, in relation to the power of appointment of the president or chairman, that a neutral person would be appointed and I am glad to note that the Minister has continued the same policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned also the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. Again while the Chairman of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board is appointed by the Minister, it is correct also to say that the entire board is appointed by the Minister.  It is not an elected board and it is not intended, nor could it be, representative of any particular profession or occupation.  It is a board appointed under the terms of the Voluntary Insurance Act to carry out a particular designated purpose and it is quite different.  Perhaps a fair parallel might be the National Health Council, which is a large body concerned merely with the function of advising the Minister on matters of health.  The National Health Council appoints its own Chairman and I cannot see that that has worked hardship or difficulty, in any way, either <Col N="775" /> for the National Health Council or for the Minister.  When the National Health Council, which is the primary advisory body available to the Minister, in electing its own Chairman causes no disadvantage either to the Minister or to the Council itself, why should in the case of a much less important body, An Bord Altranais, this change be proposed?  I do not like it.  I feel it is an effort to extend Departmental control to a body which has worked perfectly well, a board which has been signally successful in its activities and I am certainly against it.</P>
    <P>The next point I should like to make at this stage is in relation to another change proposed in the Bill which concerns the financial assistance given to An Bord Altranais.  I can understand what the Minister has said and I can understand that difficulties will possibly arise if there is no proper means of compelling An Bord Altranais to disclose its accounts and to give the Minister all relevant information with regard to its expenditure and revenue. Obviously an omission of that kind should be cured and I agree with the Minister in that respect.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, however, with the further step which the Minister proposes here and that is that henceforth there is going to be a definite announced grant made available by the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  That means that on the Bill becoming law in each year the Minister will inform An Bord Altranais that they will have available as a grant from central funds so much in that particular year.  Then Section 5 will come into operation.  That provides, in effect, that henceforth the Board, knowing the amount of money it will get from the Minister will have to meet any deficit between that grant and whatever other revenue it has, and its expenditure, by the fees charged to nurses.</P>
    <P>I think that that is imposing a very serious hardship on what is after all one of the most lowly paid professions in the country.  If the policy behind An Bord Altranais is successful, there <Col N="776" /> obviously should be a greater scope for education and training of Irish nurses. That possibly is going on at the moment, and it should expand.  If, as a result of this change, the cost of that policy has to fall to some extent on the registration fees, it may be very difficult to carry it out as it should be carried out.  I do not know of any other profession where a step of this kind has been taken.  It seems quite wrong to me that girls who go into the nursing profession and who qualify should be asked to pay to some extent for the cost of nursing policy as enshrined in these Acts.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, has the information; I am speaking only from very vague recollection, but I certainly cannot recollect that at any stage while I was Minister it was felt that An Bord Altranais in relation to its expenditure or the manner in which it carried out its policy was acting in any way inadvisedly or imprudently; indeed we have not heard it suggested that the call that it had to make on local authority expenditure or on State expenditure was in any way excessive.  I fear now, with the introduction of the Minister for Finance into this legislation with the power to give a stated grant each year, that inevitably more and more of the expenditure of the Board carrying out nursing policy will have to be paid from the purses of the Irish nurses themselves.  I think that is bad and I think it is wrong.  I certainly would urge on the Minister to reconsider that proposal.</P>
    <P>That is as much as I want to say at this stage.  It follows, I think, that so far as the amendments are concerned obviously the Minister must get his Bill to the extent that the Nursing Act requires amendment, but, at a later stage, we would propose to question two of the amendments proposed in the Bill in relation to the appointment of the President and this proposed charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the amendments proposed in this Bill are indeed welcome but it seems to me that it is another example of the reluctance of several Governments down through the years to bring in desirable amendments to an Act which they may have <Col N="777" /> found wanting.  Here we are 11 years afterwards and it is found that there are some defects, in some cases minor, in the Nursing Act of 1950.  It surely demonstrates the reluctance to make necessary changes.  It seems to me that the view has always been: &ldquo;O.K., if there is a defect or a want in any particular Act of Parliament we shall wait until we have a dozen or so.&rdquo;  We have done that in legislation down through the years.  I think we should engage more in the practice of changing an Act of Parliament as we think it should be changed and immediately we believe it should be changed.</P>
      <P>This sort of behaviour is not peculiar to the present Minister for Health. It has been the practice down through the years.  It is a good thing, in any case, to take the Bill more or less as one reads it; it is a good thing to clear up the position with regard to the method of election of the various nurses on to this Board.  Again, it is a position that has obtained for the last 10 or 11 years.  I assume that nobody has challenged the practice whereby each section will elect its own representatives, but this does make the position much more clear.</P>
      <P>It seems to me also that it must have been pretty difficult for An Bord Altranais to function over the past 10 years in view of the fact that they could not be paid travelling expenses for visits, as the Minister has said, to hospitals or to any other medical establishments.  Up to the present, the practice has been&mdash;rather the law has been&mdash;that they could be paid only in respect of travelling expenses.  I assume the Minister and his predecessor were satisfied that the Board would carry out their duties in a reasonable manner.  Could I ask the Minister a question on Section 4, the section relating to the yearly grant to be made by the Government&mdash;is that a fixed grant?</P>

      <P>I assume that the Minister will safeguard the interests of the nursing profession in that respect because it would indeed be a very bad thing if we were to appear to tax what has been described as one of the most lowly-paid and hardest working professions in the whole country.</P>
      <P>The only other comment I have to make is in respect of Section 7.  I do not think it is a good principle for the Minister or any Minister to nominate a President of a board that has been elected by various other bodies.  I am not concerned with analogies, with what happened in the Voluntary Insurance Scheme or the Opticians' Board or anything like that.  I do not think it is good practice where you have say 10 or 11 sections of nurses electing their representatives to a board and different other branches of the medical profession electing or nominating their representatives, for the Minister to step in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know what system is employed to nominate the members of the Board but here we have a situation where nearly half the members of the Board are elected by various sections of the nursing profession and the Minister for Health says that this particular person is to be president.  I think it is a very bad thing and that the Minister should stick to the principle whereby those who are elected, nominated or selected for <Col N="779" /> membership of the Board should have the right to select their own chairman or president.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very amused listening to Deputy O'Higgins, in his opposition to sections of this Bill, to note that practically everything he uttered was a repetition of what was uttered by a certain individual&mdash;and practically by that individual only&mdash;at a board meeting held to consider this Bill.  Deputy Corish has put his finger on one particular point which is of proved interest.  This is a board of some 27 members.  I am a member of it, but there are only 10 elected members on that board representing the nursing profession.  When this Bill was being considered by the Board, I suggested if there was great suspicion about the Minister, whoever he might be, nominating the President, I would be prepared to put down an amendment to the Bill in the House to the effect that the chairman should be chosen from one of the elected members and no other and there was an outcry that doctors would not sit under the chairmanship of a nurse.  I should like the Labour members to know how much attached to principle are those who are attempting to oppose the Bill because of that point.</P>
      <P>This is a measure primarily and almost solely designed in the interests of the nurses and their profession. There are two interests concerned, the nursing profession and the medical profession. As a member of that Board I feel that, if it could not be arranged either that the nurses provide the Chairman or President of the Board or the Minister select from them, at least there should be a President who would be a neutral as between the nursing and medical professions.  It is true that one member of the medical profession has, or had been, President for some 10 years and I make a present to Deputy O'Higgins of the brief he got from the gentleman who made the reference to my one sole attendance at that board which was incorrect&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy took great exception to the section which proposes to regulate the annual grant from Government funds or local authorities to this Board and he made his case on wrong grounds.  Deputy Corish has the right approach to it.  The position is that there is to be consultation between representatives&mdash;possibly the President&mdash;of the board, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and it is quite obvious that the consultation will arise from an estimate as to the coming year's requirements. Those of us who are on the Board know that the present position in regard to finance is bad, as the Minister has pointed out, and we have had to indulge in substantial overdrafts for long periods which cost us all the more. If we can, at the beginning or shortly before or after the beginning of each year, arrange that the Minister for Health shall be furnished with an estimate of our approximate requirements and the Minister agrees to give us that grant, we will be functioning on that grant plus the estimated revenues by way of examination fees, registration fees, and so forth, and we know the approximate expenditures with regard to the holding of examinations and so on.  There can be no real objection to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that there was a danger if the grants were not reasonable.  He is out of touch, if you like, with the estimated requirements. He said the deficit would have to be made up by an increase of fees.  Does the Deputy not know that one of the <Col N="782" /> great problems in the last ten years has been that the fees have been constantly increased and have reached a very high level and that the situation now being created will prevent that happening?  I imagine that when the annual talk takes place and when things are examined the Minister will ensure that there is protection against the arbitrary raising of fees by the Board.</P>

      <P>I am trying to point out to the Deputy, who is so concerned about the welfare of the nurses, that the nurses are in a minority on that Board.  They are the only elected members. It is quite clear to me that if the position is left as it is the President will always be a member of the medical profession and never a member of the nursing profession, because that is the pattern that has been worked out.</P>

      <P>I feel that if the Minister sticks to this section of the Bill, gets it passed through the House and appoints the President he will appoint somebody who will be neutral as between the two interests.  One must not forget that the nursing profession and the medical profession operate together right through and there are <Col N="784" /> conflicts on many occasions between them and there are grievances on the part of the nursing profession against, if you like, the requirements of the medical profession, and so forth.  Therefore, they who know their own profession should be in a position to be able to speak quite openly and frankly and to know that there is this neutral position and not what is inherent in the present set-up, a carry over of &ldquo;the doctor and the nurse,&rdquo; the doctor always being the boss of the situation.</P>
      <P>I have attended a meeting&mdash;not the first meeting, by the way&mdash;of the Board which considered this Bill in detail and I heard the various views expressed and I can say that there will not be a shock; there will not be a terrible upset, if the Bill goes through in the form in which it is now before the House.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I am not very enamoured of this Bill.  I do not think the Minister made a very good case in favour of it.  He specifically stated that An Bord Altranais was satisfactory.  He also said that although he was giving himself these authorities, the Board had never failed to give him any information that he had sought from them.</P>
      <P>Looking at it from an unbiased point of view, it does seem to me that An Bord Altranais is one of the most necessary organisations in the country. We have a particular problem here with regard to nurses in that we are unable to pay them in many cases salaries commensurate with the skill they command.  We have also got to face the fact that many of our nurses are induced to emigrate because they can secure from our wealthier neighbour much better conditions.  Therefore, it seems to me that when any Board is functioning well, as this Board is, one should be very slow to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe got up to defend this Bill.  I do not think he had read the Bill properly.  I am certain he had not read the White Paper.  He told us several times that there were twenty-seven members on the Board until he was corrected by two or three Deputies on this side.  Secondly, he <Col N="785" /> said that the nurses were in a minority on the Board.  For the purpose of clarification, if for nothing else, let us have the facts.  There are twenty-three members on this Board. There are ten nurses elected by the representative nurses' organisations and there are two other nurses nominated by the Minister.  Ten and two make twelve.  Twelve from twenty-three leaves eleven.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>I am discussing at the moment the statements made by Deputy Briscoe who got up here to defend the Bill as an expert who is a member of the Board and he did not know that the nurses were in a majority.  I say that they are in a majority.  Admittedly, they are not all elected by the nurses' organisations but they are nurses at the same time.</P>
      <P>I cannot help feeling that the only function this Bill will serve is to clarify the position, if that is necessary, that the nurses should be elected by their own organisations.  The Minister himself said, and the White Paper also indicates, that the purpose of Section 2 or one of the earlier sections is to ensure that each representative nurse will be elected by the particular organisation concerned.</P>
      <P>Beyond that, I cannot really see that this Bill has any function.  I have indicated often enough in this House my view that private enterprise and ordinary bodies, provided they are functioning properly, can do better if left to themselves, without ministerial or State control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>To safeguard the taxpayer, if the Minister prefers it. He has a majority already.  He nominates more than half the Board.  Am I not right in that?  There are ten elected representatives on this Board.  Deputy Sherwin asked who elected the rest of them.  I hasten to inform him it is the Minister who nominates every one of them.  He nominates thirteen people altogether, two of whom are nurses. For that reason I cannot see why the Minister should intervene in respect of a board which has given such satisfaction as this Board has given.  It is one of the most successful Boards we have in the country so far.  I said at the outset they are facing considerable difficulties.  They are trying to get the best conditions for people in the profession with regard to remuneration, working and living conditions particularly for those living in remote parts of Ireland.  It has done excellent work. I very much regret that the Minister has seen fit to introduce that section at all whereby he should nominate the president of the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A parallel organisation, although it has quite different functions, is one of which I have the honour to be a member myself, the National Health Council. I am on that Council as a nominee of the Minister, but we always elect our own Chairman.  We have elected the same chairman ever since I have been on it.  He was originally put on <Col N="787" /> the Council six years ago by Deputy Thomas O'Higgins when he was Minister for Health and we elected a Chairman then.  On five occasions on which we have elected a Chairman we have elected the same man since.  This Council serves a useful function and we carry out our work, which is purely in an advisory capacity, as efficiently as we possibly can and very much better than if we had a Chairman imposed upon us by a Ministerial decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to finance just now.  This is an important board.  It is a successful board which has done good work and given satisfaction to everyone.  Even Deputy Briscoe admitted that in his statement a moment ago.  The State should be generous in its financial assistance.  A Board like this would probably cost a great deal more than, say, the National Health Council or perhaps even the Opticians' Board.  It is necessary, for a Board like this if it is to function properly, to visit other places.  Other places cannot be visited without expense.  Deputy O'Higgins made a very fair point which perhaps the Minister had not noticed himself before&mdash;it is something to which he should give consideration&mdash;that these nurses will have to pay more if more money is to be found.  That money, if it is provided by the State, will have to be found somewhere and it can only be found out of the pockets of the nurses themselves in registration fees.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure&mdash;perhaps the Minister will tell us when he is replying&mdash;but I think there is an annual registration fee for nurses and that means that the registration fee will have to be raised.  It might be very well argued that it is for the good of the organisation.  At the same time a body such as this which is doing useful work and helping to keep a profession in existence here and at full strength should not have extra charges such as that imposed on them. We hear repeatedly about the happy financial condition of the country. Ministers tell us we never had it so good and surely the few thousand pounds that are necessary out of this <Col N="788" /> enormous budget which is presented to the country each year could be found for the purpose of financing An Bord Altranais.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that mental nurses are in very short supply. A mental nurse cannot be created overnight.  Mental nurses must be trained if we are to deal with the mental defectives or the mental health situation with which we are faced and which is not peculiar to this country but is unfortunately a problem in every country in the world to-day.  The other day at a meeting in my own constituency an expert told us that in Europe to-day there are two million people under mental treatment.  If we are to deal with our problems here we must have nurses trained and I doubt very much if we can train such personnel here.  It may be necessary to send nurses elsewhere to get certain kinds of training and to get it as quickly as possible so that the State or the Department of Health may meet its obligations.  For that purpose I would ask the Minister to give an open ear to that question.  That again brings me to the question of finance.  You cannot get people properly trained here for dealing with matters like that because we lag behind other countries through no fault of our own, but you cannot send people for training without paying for it.  Therefore, the Minister should take another look at the financial side of this question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There would appear to be some necessity for a change in the present situation in view of the fact that the Minister tells us in his opening remarks that there are some doubts as to the legality of the election of nurses to the board.  If there is any doubt in this regard something has to be done to protect the situation.  There is also the question of providing for the expenses of those who travel on the Board's business.  If the Board is to do its job properly and if it is to organise the training and education of nurses some members will have to do something other than attend meetings.  Provision is made at the moment for them to be paid expenses and subsistence allowances for attending meetings.  If the Board is to function properly there <Col N="789" /> are obviously other functions which will have to be engaged in and the provision for expenses where these other duties are concerned is, of course, welcome.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced with the Minister's case for making the proposed change in relation to the appointment of the President.  From what the Minister has told the House the Board has functioned well since 1950.  It was a good Board.  It was an active Board and there has been no complaint in relation to the manner in which it carried out its duties.  If that is correct, then the Chairman during that particular period must have demonstrated his ability not only to do the job but also his willingness and his desire, as Chairman of the Board, to serve the interests of the Board and of the nurses whom the Board looks after.</P>
      <P>There does not seem to be any particularly good reason for the Minister's desire to make a change in the method of election and in the appointment of the President or Chairman.  If there is such a good reason I should be glad if the Minister would give the House the reason.  The fact that the chairmen of other boards are appointed by the Minister is no justification for holding that it is the Minister who should appoint the Chairman or President of An Bord Altranais.  If there have been difficulties in the past and if the method of selecting the Chairman in the past ten years has hindered the proper development of the Board, its extension and its activities, then the Minister should take the House into his confidence and tell us that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the finances of the Board, the House appreciates the point made by the Minister that there may be difficulties under the present arrangements. Local authorities meet a considerable part of the Board's financial expenditure through the medium of making good a deficit.  Whether that is a good or bad approach is open possibly to two viewpoints.  If it has resulted in unnecessary extravagance or interfered with the proper functioning of the Board there is a case for a change.  The proposed change is by way of grant.  Section 5 provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> Where fees referred to in section 24 of the Principal Act are chargeable, the Board shall from time to time by rules so fix their amount that, taking one year with another, the revenue from them is sufficient to meet the Board's expenditure (other than such part of that expenditure as may be determined by the Minister).</P>
    <P>That provision could leave the Board in a somewhat invidious position.  While there may be no difficulty with the present Minister for Health and the present Minister for Finance, it is possible that at some future date the Minister for Finance might decide for some particular purpose, financial stringency perhaps, to cut the grant tightly and in such circumstances there would appear to be no alternative open to the Board except to impose heavier fees on nurses.</P>
    <P>It is not relevant to discuss the conditions of the nursing profession under this measure and I do not propose to do so, but I should like to make the comment that this is the one profession in which there is complete justification for the charging of minimum fees.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that. If the Minister can assure the House that there will be definite control of and definite protection for all nurses in this regard, we could look at it in another way.  The Board has the function not alone of training nurses professionally but of post-training those already successfully equipped as nurses.  It is a very serious responsibility.  The section provides that a grant shall be made each year.  Any deficit resulting from an inadequate grant plus the inadequacy of the contribution from local authorities might quite easily place an added burden on the shoulders of nurses and, from that point of view, the section would need very careful consideration by this House.</P>
    <P>The necessity for the introduction of this measure is to make the system of election absolutely legal.  As Deputy Corish said earlier, it is strange that it should take ten years to discover that <Col N="791" /> there was a drafting error in the original Bill or some mistake in the statutory provisions of and obligations under the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to do two things when he comes to reply.  First of all, will he take the House into his confidence as to the need, if there is a need, for the change in the method of electing the Chairman or President?  Secondly, will he assure the House, if he can, that the position of our nurses will be protected with regard to the charging of higher fees for registration and examination?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with this Bill but I am concerned about this power the Minister proposes to take on himself of appointing a President.  Up to now there was an annual election. While the Minister may make the case that it is better not to have too much rotation in the five-year period but rather to have the one person all the time, he has not made any real case for this particular appointment to come from his Department.  Surely the Minister has confidence in the 13 whom he can appoint?  He will appoint 13 as against ten who will be elected.  Having a majority nominated by himself surely he has confidence as to whom the Board will elect as President.  The present suggestion seems to me most undemocratic. It is, indeed, Fuehrer-like, and it may be resented.</P>
      <P>I do not like this business of the Minister having the right to appoint because such a right is open to abuse. It stands to reason there will be a good deal of lobbying by people of a certain political complexion so that so-and-so will be appointed.  If there were a change of Government the same practice would, of course, continue.  It means that a person without certain political affiliations might never be appointed. The Minister for Justice admitted that there was patronage in the appointment of peace commissioners and even of judges.  What is to prevent patronage being always a factor in the making of these appointments?  Why should a person have to be of a certain kind to have a chance of appointment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> It is a bad principle that the Minister should appoint the majority, 13 as against 10.  I should like to know how the Board can get rid of a chairman who is not competent.  Can a majority ask for a new chairman, or can they pass a vote of no confidence?  I should like to comment on the statement made by Deputy Briscoe that the medical profession would resent a nurse being present.  That certainly implies snobbery on the part of the medical profession.  I thought we were all alike in this world and that a worker or an egghead can be anything once he is elected by the majority.  But now we are told the medical profession might object if a nurse were present.  That is an insult to the nursing profession.  The nurses are hardworking and are not half well enough paid.  I agree with Deputy Larkin that we should be careful about the amount of fee, in view of the fact it is money they want, and more money should not be taken from them.  I want to protest against this policy of appointment.  Human nature is human nature, and you may bet that the person appointed is always someone of the same politics as the Minister then in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise one point which I think has been lost sight of throughout this debate.  An Bord Altranais has been established in order to improve the standard of Irish nursing and the status of the nursing profession.  That has not been done just to confer benefits upon certain individuals.  It has been done in the public interest in order that the great general public, who maintain the nursing profession as well as the medical profession, should be properly served.  I approach the whole question of the composition of the Board, the method of financing of the Board and the Presidency of the Board from that point of view&mdash;from the point of view of the common people of Ireland who want, if they happen to be ill, to be properly nursed and have skilled nursing attention.   For that reason this Board has been given certain functions under the 1950 Act as agents of the Minister.  The Act in fact provides that the Minister may remove any or all of the members of the Board; and, further, <Col N="793" /> if he is satisfied that the Board is not functioning properly, he can abolish the Board or can have its functions carried out by some person or persons appointed by him.</P>
      <P>The reason why the Minister is given that power is because, as I have said, in setting up the Board as a statutory body, Parliament had one primary objective in mind.  That was to ensure that the people who have to avail of the services of the nursing profession will secure skilled and devoted&mdash;as indeed it is&mdash;attendance. As a secondary concern it was necessary, in order to attain that objective, that the standard of education for the nursing profession should be raised and that the status of nursing as a profession should similarly be exalted. It is for that reason that this Board is given certain functions in relation to the management of the examinations necessary in order to enter the nursing profession and in relation to the institution of educational <i>curricula</i> for the various sections of the profession. It is because this special duty has been allotted to the Board that the Dáil votes certain moneys to assist the Board in that connection.</P>
      <P>My purpose is to put this Board in exactly the same position as every other body I know of that receives a grant from Parliament.  Some of these Boards have to account in detail to the Comptroller and Auditor General for the expenditure of the moneys which are voted.  Some others of them get a bloc vote and are given a great deal of freedom as to the manner in which they will expend it.  But all of them except this Board, as the law stands, have to work within a figure which is predetermined before Dáil Éireann votes the money.  We even apply that principle to the University Colleges.  No constituent college of the National University of Ireland can come here and do what this Board is entitled to do under the existing Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was a fatal defect in the drafting of the Act because, quite candidly, it led last year to this situation: that if the Board had persisted in its defiance of the ordinary <Col N="794" /> principles governing the expenditure of Government money, I should have had to abolish the Board and appoint somebody else to carry on its functions. That is a situation which should not have been allowed to arise, but it did arise.  Ultimately, however, it was possible to avoid that final sanction, but I made up my mind that such a situation was not going to arise again. Quite obviously, it would not have arisen if the same sort of financial control had been applied to the operation of this Board as applies to every other body I know of financed in the performance of a public duty by the State.  As I mentioned, you have the constituent colleges of the National University.  Surely it is not unreasonable to impose on An Bord Altranais the same sort of financial control which the constituent colleges accept?</P>
    <P>Therefore, what we are asking here is that, in order that the Minister for Health, the Minister for Finance and the local authorities may know what their financial obligations are towards this Board, those obligations will be determined in advance and that we will not be coerced, as was attempted last year, into giving a blank cheque, that we will not give to the Board a blank cheque to be filled in for any amount the Board may care to fix upon.  It was not that the amount was very great&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount involved in the proposal would have been about £517.  The point is that it is a matter of principle that this Board should be placed in exactly the same position in matters of finance as any other statutory board whose expenses in whole or in part are paid by the State.  This particular Board, moreover, has a statutory duty to act as agent for the Government of the day acting through the Minister for Health.  Let me say <Col N="795" /> to Deputy T.F. O'Higgins that his speech was quite helpful but it is possible for us to have different views as to the manner in which the President of the Board should be appointed.</P>
      <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins pointed out that the reason he had decided that the President of the Opticians' Board should be appointed by him was that he took the view a person who had partisan views should not be in the chair.  I take the same view.  This Board consists of persons who represent very definite sectional interests&mdash; twelve out of the twenty-three are members of the nursing profession. Others are members of the medical profession.  There are only four or five laymen on the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be only two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible there may be only two.  I take the view that the primary obligation of the Board is to raise the standard of the profession, not primarily from the point of view of its sectional interest but in order to provide a better service for the people of the country as a whole&mdash;the people who will have to avail of the services, and since it is fairly clear that both the nurses and the medical profession are liable to be subjective in their approach, my successor may find some advantage in appointing a person as President of the Board who will not be biased in favour of either the medical or nursing professions on the one hand or the other, but will be mindful of the requirements of the public at large which, after all, is a much more numerous body of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that on the whole it is very much better that the President should be appointed by the Minister.  I believe for a start that it would make for far smoother working.  This incident which occurred last year indicated the dangers which are inherent in the position where you have a person elected to direct the Board as its President who represents purely a professional interest.  I am quite convinced that if there had been any person other than the person who happened to be in the chair when this financial issue <Col N="796" /> arose the whole thing would have been smoothed out very much more rapidly than it was.  As it happened it took a whole year from March the 18th, 1959, when the proposal was made to increase the fees paid to examiners.  At the time that the request for increased fees for examiners was made I agreed to the request but on condition that some increase was made in the fees paid by examinees.  The Board led by its then Chairman refused to accept that condition, and in consequence of that we had a correspondence going backwards and forwards for over a year.</P>
    <P>In the end the whole thing amounted to an increase in the entrance fees for examinations of 5/-.  You may say that was not a great matter but the point was you had a refusal by the Board, through its leadership, to face up to the fact that it has obligations to this House and, through the Minister for Health, to the people of the country. That was the issue which was involved and I believe that if there had been a person appointed by the Minister who could go to the Minister to consult with him and ascertain the Minister's viewpoint and who was disposed to be receptive to the Minister's arguments, that situation would not have arisen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is surely fair minded enough to imagine other circumstances as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in this situation: the present President of the Board has been elected by the Board. My successor will have the option of either finding a better President if he can, or, if he is satisfied with the existing President, to continue him in office.  However, I think it is very important for the future relationship between the Board and the Minister that the Minister in this case should have the same power of appointment as he exercises in relation to other boards, some of which have no statutory foundation&mdash;like the Cancer Association.  There is not any analogy between this Board and the National Health Council.  As Deputy Esmonde pointed out, the National Health Council is an advisory body only.  The only thing it can do is comment and <Col N="797" /> tender observations on matters which are referred to the Council by the Minister.  Therefore, the matter of appointment to the Chair of the Council does not arise in the same way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin raised the question of fees for examinations.  The position there is as I pointed out to Deputy Corish earlier.  The amount of grant will be determined by the Minister for Finance in consultation with the Minister for Health and An Bord Altranais, and of course this question of fees to be paid for examinations will naturally arise.  It is one of the things that will certainly arise.  The interest of the Minister for Health is to attract suitable candidates to the nursing profession and it may be taken as certain that no Minister for Health, by imposing unduly high charges and fees for examinations, will debar suitable candidates from the nursing profession. Deputy Larkin's idea is that it should be made easier for suitable candidates to come in.  In all these cases there must be reasonable concern for the other side of the story as well&mdash; for the taxpayers and the ratepayers who foot the bill.  I do not think there is any undue hardship occasioned when the fees for the examinations were increased by 5/-.  I do not think, having regard to the fact that the last occasion on which the fees for the nursing examination were fixed was in 1953, that an increase of 5/- over eight years can be regarded as exorbitant.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin seemed to be under the impression that in asking the Dáil to approve of the proposal to appoint the President that I was seeking to secure the power of patronage in my own hands or in the hands of my successor.</P>

      <P>There is no power of patronage in it whatsoever and while some people might like to be appointed as President and no doubt people will be recommended for the post, nevertheless the primary consideration which the Minister for Health of the day will have in mind when he is making that appointment will be: &ldquo;Is this man likely to be good enough to carry the Board and to steer the Board with discretion and wisdom?&rdquo;  That is what he wants.  No Minister making an appointment of this sort is going to appoint any man he does not think is going to be able to carry the responsibility of the post.  He does not want to be worried by complaints which will arise if the man is inefficient and therefore he will make certain that whoever he appoints will be able to conduct the affairs of the Board in a rational and intelligent way and maintain the best possible relations with the Minister for Health and his Department.</P>
      <P>If he fails to do that of course there will be no difficulty about removing him because that is provided for under the existing Act.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,996,500 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and of certain other Services administered by that Office, and for payment of grants in aid&mdash; (Minister for Posts and Telegraphs).</P>

      <P>In recent years the telephone has come to be regarded as an essential public service and in the towns people have plenty of facilities so far as the telephone is concerned.  In all our towns we have erected kiosks for the convenience of people who have not the service in their own homes and of course the number of telephones in private homes and business houses has increased enormously.  For some time past demands for the telephone in rural areas have been increasing.  We know that many things have been done to bring to the rural areas some of the amenities which have been available to people living in centres of population. For instance, in recent years we have had the electric light; now they have been provided with piped water supplies and before the end of the year they will have, I believe, television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that there is difficulty in erecting kiosks in remote rural areas but it is in these areas that the need for the telephone service is greatest. <Col N="801" /> I have in mind a part of County Tipperary on the slopes of Slievenamon, which is thickly populated and which is no less than five or six miles from any telephone.  If a person in that area is in need of a doctor or a vet, or if there is a fire in the locality he has to travel several miles before he gets to a telephone and even when he gets to that place, if it is night time, he may find he cannot get to that telephone and would have to travel several more miles.</P>
    <P>It would seem a bit stiff I suppose to ask that kiosks should be erected in such areas.  We know they are likely to be damaged by people destroying the telephone register or even by people interfering with the machinery or equipment of such kiosks.  But I think that the difficulty could be obviated by the co-operation of either the cottiers in the district or the farmers if they would allow these kiosks to be erected on their property.  I would like to press on the Minister that it is a service which would be very much appreciated in rural Ireland.  People suffer great hardships because the service is not available.  I have known people to suffer great loss because they could not get in touch with a veterinary surgeon quickly because of the distance they had to travel either to the vet, or to the nearest telephone.  Sometimes when a person is sick it is a very important thing that the priest or doctor should be quickly available and if there did happen to be a kiosk in some of the districts that I have mentioned it would be very much appreciated. It would provide people with service which would be greatly appreciated and, in present circumstances, most desirable.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that amenity for the people of rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>This Estimate has now been very fully debated.  That is well because the Post Office and everything connected with it are more closely associated with the people than perhaps any other Department.  Very little criticism can be made of the Minister's statement and it is good to know that the six-day delivery is now general and areas which heretofore <Col N="802" /> had only three- or four-day deliveries now have six-day deliveries.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his Department on the fact that the Irish Army in the Congo have regular delivery of letters and parcels.  We know the difficulties that arose there at first and we are glad they have been overcome.</P>
      <P>We notice a reduction in the number of telegrams.  I presume that is because of increased costs.  There is great demand for telephones and a big waiting list but let us hope that the Minister, by increasing his staff for such work and by getting more of the necessary equipment, will be able to provide telephones for all those on that waiting list.  Day after day and week after week there are new calls for the installation of telephones and that is welcome.  I agree entirely with Deputy Loughman when he says that even in very remote areas telephones should be installed.  I have in mind&mdash;and I have frequently raised the matter&mdash;a place called The Valley in Beaufort district where local people require a telephone.  In addition, tourists having gone through the gap of Dunloe often ask if they may use the telephone in the toll house at the head of the lake before they take boats for Killarney.</P>
      <P>There is also an area in Caherdaniel in which I have asked the Minister to provide a 24-hour telephone service. He says that until there are 20 people with telephones installed the regulations will not allow the service requested. It would be well to alter the regulations for the benefit of people in those remote areas and I ask him to consider the matter again and to give The Valley, Castlecove, and Caherdaniel districts the telephone services they require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nearly all speakers referred to auxiliary postmen and their conditions of service and pay.  About a year ago, I understand, provision was made whereby they were to get a gratuity on retirement after having given certain service but some provision should be made by which they will receive a pension on reaching the retiring age&mdash; a gratuity and a pension.  There is the difficulty that we have established <Col N="803" /> postmen who are entitled to a pension. Perhaps the whole question of the appointment of postmen should be investigated because they are really political appointments.  The Government have patronage, whatever Government are in office.  I think there should be some system of examination for postmen before appointment.  It need not be a very difficult examination. It often happens that a person with a very poor education is appointed and that is not right.</P>
    <P>Previously I think I referred to uniforms and, while some improvements have taken place, the material and the style of the post office uniform are not satisfactory.  Anybody wearing uniform should be correct in walking or in whatever they are doing and it might be of advantage if postmen were given lectures or something of that kind.  Rural postmen must travel long journeys on bicycles and some, I believe, must walk.  Perhaps they should at least get autocycles or some allowance to enable them to purchase autocycles.</P>
    <P>As regards subpostmasters, there is a long-deferred application from them for arbitration.  They are appointed by the Minister.  They must supply accommodation, lighting and heating and no provision is made for cleaning the offices or payment of attendants.  There is no way by which they can have a holiday or sick leave.  Conditions of service are very poor and there is great dissatisfaction among subpostmasters. In 1956 there was, I think, great uneasiness and dissatisfaction and the then Minister for Post and Telegraphs, the late Deputy Keyes, set up some sort of a council&mdash;the Subpostmasters Consultative Council, I think it was called &mdash;but this has proved unsatisfactory.  I believe the chairman of that council in all cases is the assistant Secretary of the Department.  Such a council is very far removed from the arbitration requested by the subpostmasters' union. In fact, it has become useless and no satisfaction has been derived by the subpostmasters from its deliberations.</P>
    <P>Arbitration machinery is provided for the Garda Síochána, civil servants, <Col N="804" /> teachers, and so forth.  Why should it not be provided also for subpostmasters? I understand that subpostmasters in Northern Ireland have had arbitration since 1935 and surely we could be just as good as they are in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Last year a conference of subpostmasters in Cork was addressed by the Bishop of Cork and Ross, Dr. Lucey.  His Lordship said that surely the State does not expect to be judge and jury on the claims of its own servants.  He was referring there to the council set up in 1956.  In all cases of unions it is well to have arbitration but that is especially the case in connection with State Departments.  Subpostmasters are not unreasonable in their demands and let us hope that the Minister before he leaves office will meet the demand of the subpostmasters for arbitration, with good results.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been brought to the notice of every Deputy is the question of increasing the interest rate on post office savings deposits The people who put their money in post office savings are small investors. There may not be a bank in the area in which they live.  They are very slow to invest in National Loans or savings certificates.  They like to put their money in a post office, where they consider that it is very safe and from which they can make withdrawals at any time.  While it may impose an extra cost on the State, my view is that the interest on post office savings should be increased to at least 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the Minister who has been most courteous since his appointment as Minister, and also to all the members of his staff and the officials of the Department, including postmen and sub-postmasters. Whatever grievance they may have, I am sure they are continuing to be courteous and to give good service to the State.</P>

      <P>The Minister and his Department are to be complimented on their excellent work during the past year.  Few Government Departments are as close to the people in their day-to-day affairs as this one is and few <Col N="805" /> give as much satisfaction.  The fact that a single error made by the Post Office is regarded as news proves that the officials make very few errors.  When the many and varied aspects of the work of the Post Office and the large number of people employed by it are taken into consideration, its record is one of which we may be proud.</P>
      <P>I should like to support the Deputies who pleaded for some kind of pension scheme for auxilliary postmen.  The Minister might give that matter consideration so that some suitable type of pension could be worked out.</P>
      <P>In the debate on this Estimate there has been the usual spate of criticism of Radio Éireann.  Far be it from me to pose as a defender of Radio Éireann or to suggest that it is a perfect organisation, or even nearly perfect but, in dealing with this matter, we should at least try to be fair and take into consideration the various difficulties which Radio Éireann has to face.  If we have criticism to offer we should see to it that it is constructive. If we feel that Radio Éireann is not doing its job as it should our objective should be to improve the service.  Constant destructive criticism will not help and the fact that the criticism is made year after year would seem to show that is is not helping to improve the position.</P>
      <P>If we compare Radio Éireann with other radio services such as the B.B.C. we should be prepared to compare other aspects, for example, the budget available to the B.B.C. and the budget available to Radio Éireann, or would it be correct to say that the difference between them is so vast that they do not bear comparison?  We should also be prepared to compare the good programmes of Radio Éireann with the good programmes of other services and not the good programmes of other services with what are considered the bad programmes of Radio Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is such a wide variety of taste with regard to radio programmes that what would be an excellent programme in the opinion of one person would be regarded as an awful programme by another.  It is impossible to satisfy all of the people all of the time.  During the debate, B.B.C. programmes <Col N="806" /> were cited as excellent from the cultural and production point of view.  If we are to pick and choose from Radio Éireann programmes we could cite programmes which are excellent from every point of view. It must be recognised that, bearing in mind the variety of taste in this matter, the programmes mentioned above, excellent though they may be, would find very little favour with people who would prefer, for example, programmes from Radio Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>I would not have spoken on this matter at all were it not for the fact that, having listened to the debates on the Estimates for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for a number of years, I am inclined to the view that these destructive attacks, if I may put it that way, are made, not necessarily because they are justified but for a number of other reasons.  It appears to be a popular attitude to adopt and it is a relatively safe target from a political point of view.  One can always be sure of support for these attacks from people outside, not because our people generally are opposed to Radio Éireann as a whole but because many people think there are, for example, too many concert programmes on Radio Éireann and, on the other hand, many people think there are not enough.</P>
    <P>Some people believe there are too many programmes in the Irish language while others feel there are not enough.  Young people would like to have popular hits played all day while older people would feel that they could get too much of them.  If we take, for example, Radio Luxembourg, it does not face the same type of criticism because all its programmes are of a similar level and one knows before one switches on to that station exactly what to expect.  On the other hand, Radio Éireann, being a national station, must try to cater for all tastes.</P>
    <P>Attacks are made on Radio Éireann because some of us would like to pose as cultural experts, if there is such a thing, as people who know about and appreciate the finer things of life.  We discuss direction and presentation <Col N="807" /> of the subject matter of programmes in a learned manner and also in a relatively safe manner because while we may not know very much about it we are secure in the knowledge that those who listen to us do not know very much about it either.  As a general rule when the people who adopt this attitude hear mention of Gaelic culture they immediately surround it by inverted commas and term it definitely <i>non-U.</i></P>
    <P>These attacks are made because unfortunately we still have among us people who believe that anything produced in this country cannot be of good quality.  We have had this same criticism over the years in connection with various Irish products such as Irish shoes, Irish clothing, Irish-made machinery, and so on.  That is not now the case because we have tangible evidence of their quality from the fact that we can export these goods and compete in foreign markets.  However, some of us still feel the need for a whipping pole and what better and safer whipping pole than Radio Éireann?</P>
    <P>For a number of years we have had a man of first grade qualifications and exceptional capabilities as Director of Radio Eireann in the person of Mr. Gorham.  He was a man of international repute and if he was not able to satisfy the critics with regard to programmes there must have been reasons for it.  Was it shortage of money?  If it was, are we willing to supply the deficiency?  Are we willing to vote money?  Do we agree with Mr. Roth when he states that as a result of a survey a substantial proportion of the 90% who tune in to Radio Eireann in this country are tuned in to it all the time?  If we do not agree with that are we prepared to state that these surveys are a waste of time or that they are deliberately rigged?</P>
    <P>Some Deputies who criticise Radio Eireann are not prepared to accept the veracity of these surveys but they themselves have admitted here that they turn off &ldquo;that thing&rdquo; as they call Radio Eireann, after the news.  If they <Col N="808" /> turn it off after the news they cannot have heard the remaining programmes; yet they come in here and ask us to accept their judgment on Radio Eireann, a judgment which can have no basis at all if they do not listen to the programmes.</P>
    <P>I agree that there are many flaws in Radio Eireann, that there are many flaws in various programmes broadcast by Radio Eireann but if we are going to criticise Radio Eireann&mdash;and I am very much in favour of criticism if it is directed towards improving our programmes&mdash;we should criticise it constructively. The type of carping criticism which we are used to hearing over the past number of years with regard to our own Station should be left aside.</P>
    <P>As I stated when speaking on the Irish Television Bill, this service cannot open too soon.  In the northern part of the country where there are numerous television sets there is considerable anxiety regarding the effects of the programmes on our children. Parents do their best to restrict the viewing to what is suitable but they find it very difficult to do this because it is impossible to know what the content of a programme is from its name. Very often we find that in programmes which appear to be safe there is much which is at variance with our moral code and with our way of life.</P>
    <P>Mr. Roth has announced that a code of advertising policy has been worked out.  I am very glad to hear that.  We should be extremely careful not to allow our people to be exploited as they appear to be exploited in television programmes at present available to us in which outrageous claims are being made for certain products.  It may be said that nobody will believe these things but the very fact that this type of material is consistently being put across and this type of claim made makes it obvious that there are enough gullible people to believe them.</P>
    <P>In the course of a speech here, Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde mentioned that all our television sets were being imported.  Apparently he did not realise sets are being made in this <Col N="809" /> country.  I am particularly anxious to correct the impression that may have been created that television sets are not being made here; in fact they are being made in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In keeping with every Estimate that has been put to this House there is an increase in this Estimate.  However, one thing in favour of this Vote is that it is an investment. It is in good hands in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, a Department which has been charged with making itself pay so we cannot hold an increased demand against them.</P>
      <P>With telephone traffic on the increase, the Minister should examine the possibility of giving a living wage to that group of workers known as Sunday and week night telephone attendants. It is scandalous that they have not been offered an increase on their 2/- an hour.  Is it because they are not an organised group that they are being exploited?  It is either accepted or they are told to get out.  There are not so many involved and the Minister should take the charitable view.</P>
      <P>There is one matter I am sorry I must raise in view of the fact that we have a decent man as Minister, a man who has always been most courteous. It is the question of the appointment of an auxiliary postman in Carna, County Galway.  Last week I asked a question here.  I asked the Minister for Social Welfare if the name of Martin Creane, Culleen, Carna, County Galway, was recommended for the post of auxiliary postman in the Carna post office in the local employment exchange.  The Minister in his reply dealt with a temporary auxiliary postman in Carna. I did not ask him about a temporary postman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man to whom I have referred was turned down.  He has an excellent record in the F.C.A.  He is a young man.  He is the father of five children. He was turned down in favour of a single man. The answer I was given last week was that Martin Creane was not available.  It was said he was <Col N="810" /> physically unfit.  That was for the temporary post, but that was not the question I asked.  I intend to probe this matter until I get a satisfactory reply.</P>
    <P>It is believed locally&mdash;I do not suggest that the Minister was a party to it&mdash;that there was political pull in the appointment that was made.  I do not know at what part of the line the pull occurred, but I should like the Minister to examine the matter to see if he can discover what happened along the line.  This man was submitted for the post.  It is rather strange that a certain politician and a certain relationship have been coupled with this appointment. I know the Minister is a decent man.  I shall raise this question again.  I have before me a letter in reference to an appointment about which I was inquiring on 16th July, 1960.  It was not an appointment of a temporary nature, as the Minister for Social Welfare suggests.</P>
    <P>I shall tune in now to Radio Éireann. On a previous occasion on this Estimate I asked the Minister if he would consider giving more frequent news by way of news flashes.  The reply I got was that there was no public demand. I do not know if the demand grew since, but we now have a news flash at 10 a.m.  Would the Minister give us a few more news flashes at 8.30 a.m. and 9 p.m.?</P>
    <P>Now that television is a &ldquo;must&rdquo;, will the Minister let us know what the licence fee will be.  A man who knows his stuff has been appointed to a key position.  Equally, a man who knows his stuff has been put in charge of drama.  There is a possibility that the Director may bring with him a United States mentality in favour of sponsored programmes.  I do not know if Deputies are familiar with the American programmes on television.  In the midst of a very interesting programme one is suddenly told what kind of soap he should use, or the ladies are told what kind of powder they should use.  The programme is interrupted every two or three minutes for advertising.  Sponsored programmes carry all the expenses in America and there is no licence fee.  I hope we will not have <Col N="811" /> programmes here in which we will be told what soap to use, what tobacco to smoke, what powder the ladies should use to powder their noses.  We should avoid that type of programme. We should encourage amateur dramatic societies on television.  We have excellent dramatic competitions all over the country.  There is some very good material and it is about time both radio and television helped these groups.</P>
    <P>We in the West may find ourselves hampered from the point of view of choice of programme.  But we will still have to pay our licence fee.  We will not have the advantage, as they have on the East coast, of tuning in to some other station as we can do with wireless at the moment.  As one Deputy said, it is bad enough to have to listen without having to look.  The standard will have to be high.  The project is in good hands.  The only danger is that the American mentality might be introduced. I sincerely hope it will not.</P>
    <P>There is one matter to which the Minister might bend his energies.  Very often people suffer embarrassment in post offices because of the lack of privacy.  Those behind in the queue are aware of the amount of help being sent home by a husband or a daughter in England or how much is being put into post office savings.  Such business is private and the Minister should do something to remedy the present position. It is not the fault of the officials. I suggest the erection of a few cubicles.</P>
    <P>Every day we hear demands for a five-day week.  I do not ask for a five-day week for postal workers but I think they are entitled to at least one half day in the week.  It is overdue. There is hardly a group in the country not entitled to a weekly half day, but the postal authorities are not prepared to grant it.  Of course, it may not be easy to do so.  When I raised this question two years ago I was told the matter was under active consideration. I do not know what that means, since we have not got anywhere in two years. I should like the Minister to look into that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> Before I conclude, I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for his courtesy on any occasion I had reason to approach him.  I should also like to pay a similar tribute to his efficient officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I should like to mention has been dealt with by a number of Deputies, and I shall not delay the House very long on it.  I support the claim made by the subpostmasters for proper arbitration. The Minister is familiar with the position.  There seems to be a clash of views between his Department and the subpostmasters with regard to the conciliation available at present.  My information is that the subpostmasters believe that the consultative council which is functioning is a complete failure as a negotiating body.  They wish to get the same type of arbitration facilities as are available to the Garda, the Civil Service and so on.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the subpostmasters and their employees are doing such excellent work, we should not try to run this branch of the service &ldquo;on the cheap.&rdquo;  It is very unfair to the people concerned.  I know there are contrasts.  You will find some postmasters with a substantial income from a shop or some other source, but you will also find the opposite&mdash;that very little business is done apart from the post office work.  It is absolutely unchristian to expect people to live on the income they have from some of these appointments.  I know that every Minister&mdash;not this Minister alone&mdash;has taken the view that the Post Office is a commercial concern and must pay its way.  I am not denying that but I am on a point of much greater importance&mdash;that everybody is entitled to a decent wage.  It is a very bad example for the State to set.  Subpostmasters and subpostmistresses cannot afford to pay reasonable wages to their staffs.  Young staff, immediately they receive a certain amount of training, leave the country to obtain a just reward for their services elsewhere. That is another source of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important thing I wish to raise concerns the telephone service. <Col N="813" /> The telephone service is absolutely scandalous, and a great deal of the blame can be attached to the Department for their failure to pay the night operators in the various exchanges.  I know of exchanges in the West of Ireland where it is not a surprise to any individual making a night call to have to wait for three-quarters of an hour to get an answer from the exchange.</P>
    <P>That is not good enough.  On the one hand, the cost of evening calls is reduced in the hope that more people will use the phone at that time, but on the other hand, the people operating the phone service during that period are underpaid.  We cannot expect service from night operators who are badly paid.  They have long hours, and night service is never pleasant.  In spite of that, their remuneration is scandalous. My criticism is in respect of the service after six o'clock.  I have made inquiries in the various counties in the West and I have found that this situation obtains in Roscommon, Galway, parts of Mayo, and in Sligo and Leitrim.  It is time the public got a proper night telephone service.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to raise in connection with the telephone service is the long delay in dealing with applications.  I had a specific example. It was the case of a man in my constituency engaged in the building industry who gives employment to 23 people.  His men were engaged in building contracts within a radius of 20 miles of where he lives.  It was essential for him to have a telephone in his office, and he made application for one.  In spite of the fact he was giving that amount of employment, it was no less than eight months before he got a phone.  I had to take the matter up with the Department on a couple of occasions.  I was informed that all telephone applications have to be dealt with strictly in order of the application list.</P>
    <P>I should like to put this to the Minister. Surely there should be some form of priority for a person needing a phone for his business over people who require one for domestic or pleasure purposes?  I know there are many <Col N="814" /> housewives who like to have the telephone to order meat and provisions.  I think it is very desirable that that service be available to them; but, when there is such a delay, they should not get priority over those who need a phone for their business.  I gather that this delay also applies to professional people.  To use an expression used by his own Party in the last election, I would urge the Minister to &ldquo;get cracking&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I hope the Minister will get cracking successfully on this issue of speeding up the installation of telephones.  The demand is there now and it should be met.  What puzzles me about the telephone system is this.  In spite of the fact that there is a big increase in the number of subscribers and in the number of people who make calls, the cost of calls is going up all the time instead of being reduced.  The cost of a long-distance call from Dublin to such places as Sligo, Cork, Roscommon, Galway and Ballina is far too high.  It takes about 3s. 9d. to make a three-minute call from Dublin to Galway.  To my mind that is an exorbitant charge.  With the increase in the use of the public telephone it should be possible to reduce these charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of post offices and subpostmasters and subpostmistresses, I should like to point out that there is considerable difficulty at times in post offices outside the urban areas with regard to the availability of revenue stamps.  This Government can take credit&mdash;I feel sure they will not like it &mdash;for the fact that stamp duties have increased considerably during their terms of office.  Stamps which used to be a shilling or two shillings have now gone up to £3, £4 or £5.  It is bad enough to have had these increases with regard to these stamps but it is worse when it is impossible to get the stamps at certain times of the day.  In small post offices in rural areas they are not available at all.  In the bigger towns it is the practice, as far as I can establish, to have these stamps available only at certain hours of the day. If a solicitor goes in and wants £100 <Col N="815" /> worth of Revenue stamps at 10.30 in the morning he is told they will not be available until 12 o'clock because the official who keeps the key to where the stamps are held is not available.  I suggest that whenever an official is away arrangements should be made whereby some other member of the staff can issue these stamps.  I have been asked by several people to bring this matter to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>On Monday morning last it struck me as rather peculiar on the bank holiday to turn on Radio Éireann and find it silent.  I thought Radio Éireann had grown up, that they were no longer in swaddling clothes.  I turned to the B.B.C. and the services were there available, including news and musical programmes.  The practice apparently is in Radio Éireann that if there is a bank holiday for the rest of the country, they take one too.  I see no reason in the world why Radio Éireann should not work from 8 o'clock on the morning of a bank holiday the same as any other day.  I can appreciate their closing down on the morning of Good Friday but they should not treat other bank holidays in the same way.  It is not that I am enamoured of Radio Éireann programmes in general but sometimes a programme, good or bad, will lull one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is much worse to find there is no noise good, bad or indifferent, even if it does annoy one as Deputy Moher says.  It is definitely annoying to find that an organisation which has been given so much help and so much cushioning cannot make programmes available on a bank holiday morning.  Despite the advent of television I think there will always be a great demand for the radio end of the thing.  A large section of the community will not take any interest in television and consequently we should ensure that the programmes on Radio Éireann are of the highest order. As far as the House is concerned, opinions vary very much as to what we could describe as a good type of programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> In any investigations I have made from putting questions to people I have found it is generally to the sponsored programmes on Radio Éireann people listen.  Some years ago a check was made by the Minister of the listening public.  I met a girl in O'Connell Street who asked me a few questions about what programmes I listened to.  I have never heard what the results of that enquiry were.  As far as I know they were never published. There were certain statements that Radio Éireann topped the list as far as the listening public was concerned. I suppose that was perfectly true.  Radio Luxembourg came a close second.  I am of the opinion that the reason why Radio Éireann came first was because of the sponsored programmes alone.  If that is the case the reason Radio Éireann headed the list was because the sponsored programmes on it were the same as those on Radio Luxembourg.  I think, therefore, a lot more attention must be given to the Radio Éireann programmes from 5 p.m. onwards.</P>
    <P>I will not make any suggestion about it but I think the public are dissatisfied in the main with the other programmes on Radio Éireann.  I shall mention particularly the Farmers' Forum.  I doubt very much if that programmes has any bearing on real conditions that obtain in parts of rural Ireland.  I know a considerable number of small farmers who turn off the wireless in irritation when that programme comes on the air.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on the news programmes from Radio Éireann.  Deputy Coogan is anxious that Radio Éireann should have news flashes.  I agree with that, provided we do not get stale news.  I listened on occasions to the news from Radio Éireann at 8 o'clock in the morning, at 9 o'clock, at 10 o'clock, 1.30 p.m., 6.30 p.m. and the late night bulletin and the very same items have been thrown up perhaps for a day and a half.  I have seen items of news on the daily newspapers on a Wednesday morning.  On a Thursday morning I have heard Radio Éireann announce the very same items as news.  One <Col N="817" /> would feel like tearing the wireless asunder.  Apart from the staleness, the selection of what is news is also a cause for complaint.  I do not know what type of individual is responsible or on what basis he selects the items but the general public could not be less interested in some of the news broadcast by Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>For instance, if there is a promotion in the Army from the rank of captain to commandant or from some other rank to lieutenant-colonel, that is given as a serious news item.  On that basis, if a man is promoted from one rank to another in the Civil Service he is as much entitled to have his name mentioned by Radio Éireann.  The same applies, even in greater measure, to a staff officer in a county council who is promoted to a County Secretary.  But there is some kink about it when it comes to military title.  That is news straight away on Radio Éireann.  I suppose these people think it is the fighting Irish business all over again&mdash; that the public will have to hear a few more chaps have been promoted.</P>
    <P>I feel that Radio Éireann news is badly presented.  I have often felt that even if it were a little ambitious, the Minister should consider providing something like the B.B.C. have in their news roundup at 7 p.m.  I think that the production and the timing of that cannot be touched and we would not expect under any circumstances Radio Éireann to compete.  But something on those lines which would lighten up the news I think would be desirable, and then bring in what Deputy Coogan has suggested, the news flashes at more frequent intervals.  But for goodness sake, do not bring in news flashes if we are to have repetition hour after hour of what has taken place three or four days ago.</P>
    <P>There is no question of criticism of the Minister in his personal capacity. I think he should give immediate attention to the question of speeding up the installation of telephones for people who depend on the use of the telephone for their livelihood.  I would ask him to have that gone into straight away.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith <Col N="818" /> liom comhgáirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa as ucht an dul chun cinn a rinneadh i rith na bliana.  Ba mhaith liom fosta comhgáirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Roinn mar gheall ar an dtacaíocht a tugadh don Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with just a few points, the first being the installation of telephones.  This is the business of the Department.  It is a paying business but it also helps the business of the community and, for that reason, every effort should be made to speed up the installation so that the backlog which is growing daily can be got rid of as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I understand that one of the problems, perhaps the greatest problem, is not the availability of funds but the recruiting of construction gangs for this work.  We have enough people available to form these gangs and a further all-out effort should be made because not alone would the increased revenue from increased telephones augment the finances of the Department, but it would increase the business of the community and make it easier for people to do business without delay thereby helping the economic life of the country.</P>
      <P>There is an outstanding demand, since the rearrangement of the telephone areas which increased the three-penny call area, for more lines.  Certain areas have been improved, but many business firms are now seeking to have two or three lines where previously they had only one because it is irritating for customers to find the line engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Radio Éireann should provide more information services for the general public.  The discussion centres on what the music programmes are like and what the news programmes are like, but I feel that not enough information is given by Radio Éireann.  By that I mean that there should be certain half hours per week where the details of, for instance, housing grants should be explained.  The method of making application, the size of the grant and the conditions, etc., should be given over the radio so that people, who are very much interested in these <Col N="819" /> things, would be familiar with them. That is one example.  That would be repeated in regard to other Departments, such as the Department of Agriculture, etc.  That would be something useful to the people.</P>
    <P>When we take up the papers we see that such things as angling festivals and such functions are being held all over the country.  I think Radio Éireann should do more of that.  They do very little in comparison with the daily press.  I think a special quarter of an hour or ten minutes each day should be devoted, especially during the summer, to telling people what is on, where it is on and when it is on.</P>
    <P>Another speaker mentioned that television services were available in the north and eastern counties.  That is quite true.  We in Donegal are wondering whether the new television service will leave areas of Donegal without good reception even when the service is fully developed.  At the moment, in the Inishowen area we have excellent reception from both Ulster television and the B.B.C.  The quality of the programmes is another matter.  Many people who can have good service from those two stations have not and will not install television because they do not want the programmes to enter their house where children and even grownup people are.</P>
    <P>I myself live less than half a mile from a B.B.C. television boosting station, and I have not got a television and will not have one.  I think it is proposed that one of the boosting stations for Irish television will be somewhere in County Leitrim or County Sligo.  I am just wondering how far north in Donegal that will give reception and what the reception will be in the Innishowen area, where, as I indicated, there is excellent reception from the two existing stations.  It will, I take it, be some time before that is known.  There will be some time lag from the setting up of the main Kippure station until the stations are set up in the provinces.  What will the position be in regard to the fees payable? Will television fees be payable by way of licences in areas where there is no reception?  Immediately Irish <Col N="820" /> television comes on the air must licence fees be paid throughout the twenty-six counties?  I do not think it would be fair if that were so; I suggest that only when reasonably good reception becomes available should fees be imposed.</P>
    <P>I am sure other speakers asked to have the pay of subpostmasters increased.  Many of them are very poorly paid.  They are supposed to live by other means.  I think that should not be the position.  In a small town, or a town, the subpostmaster's pay should be sufficient to keep himself and his family in decency.  There are rural post offices where the subpostmaster receives as little as £135 per annum. What could anybody be expected to do for that money?  Yet the subpostmaster is expected to check money going in and going out, look after telephones and letters and look after two postmen in the area, sell stamps and so on.  There is room for vast improvement in wages or salaries and it is an improvement I should like to see carried out.</P>
    <P>The position of auxiliary postmen causes a great deal of annoyance to Deputies and a great deal of hardship to the men themselves.  Any man who has given eight or nine or ten years' service as an auxiliary postman should be established.  What happens in some cases where auxiliary postmen have given even longer service than ten years, is that when there is an increase in business in the area and a consequent increase takes place in postal work making the district eligible for an established postman, the auxiliary postman is set aside and an established man taken on.  That should not be and it is doing no good to the postal service to have these things happening all over the country.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with many of those who have had nothing but criticism to make like the previous speaker.  I should prefer to see some of that criticism backed up by concrete examples. I do not find any criticism of our radio programmes.  Most people, while they may not be very enthusiastic about some of the programmes, are satisfied that these programmes are as good as, and in some cases a great deal better <Col N="821" /> than, programmes from outside stations such as the B.B.C.</P>
    <P>The main criticism I find is that reception in all parts of the country is not good and if something could be done about that it would eliminate much criticism.  I hear very little criticism and I am sure there are others in the same boat and prepared to admit that is true.  We have, however, criticism about interference, crackling when some interesting programme is on the air.  Efforts have been, and are being, made to check that and to get users of electrical machinery to use suppressors. That effort has not met with the success it deserves and possibly, when concluding, the Minister could let us know what progress has been made during the year in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. S. Brady Mr. S. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. I should like to compliment the Minister on the efficient manner in which he has managed his Department.  I refer especially to the improvements we have observed in recent years. Delivery of mail has considerably improved and there is also the very efficient way in which the Christmas mail is handled, particularly efficient in the case of last Christmas inasmuch as no mis-deliveries were complained of as in former years.  There was less confusion although there was such a very big post.</P>
      <P>The telephone service has improved very considerably especially since the new dialling system was introduced. One now makes immediate contact with the party one wants to speak to.  I want to pay particular tribute to the extraordinarily efficient service on Cross-Channel calls.  Contact is so prompt that it is astonishing.  I congratulate the Minister on the increased number of public kiosks which provide a service that is greatly appreciated.  As far as my observation goes that service is more respected now than formerly&mdash;I hope I am correct in that.  There is less interference with kiosks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the commemoration stamps that have been recently issued.  I am not certain if these stamps are produced in this country.  I know that some years ago there was a complaint about the fact <Col N="822" /> that some of the commemoration stamps were not produced in Ireland. They were surface-printed and were not at all as attractive as stamps that can be manufactured here.  There is, in this country, as I am sure the Minister is well aware, a most up-to-date and efficient method of producing these recess stamps that are so attractive. There are in Dublin, to my knowledge, very skilled technicians in this form of printing.  I hope that the stamps that will be issued in the near future will be produced in this country because the work done is certainly a great credit to those in the trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The complaints that have been made about bad reception in certain parts of the country arise from the short-sighted policy adopted some years ago, with the help at times of some of those who made the complaints, of squashing the establishment of the shortwave station. Developments in recent times stress the importance of what would have been a great service to our people on missionary work throughout the world and to those who have taken part in many lands in various phases of international activity.  A shortwave station would have kept them in touch with their homeland and some of the complaints now being made would not have been necessary.</P>
      <P>I should like to join with those who have spoken about auxiliary postmen. Up to recently their service was part-time service.  Their principal complaint was that when any changes were made they were the first to suffer and after long service received no pension.  I presume they will now qualify for the contributory old age pension because generally the Minister and the Post Office officials were lenient towards auxiliary postmen and kept them on until they were 70 years of age in all cases where that was possible.  They had no pension to look forward to after their years of work carrying on an essential national service in all kinds of weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subpostmasters have been complaining for many years.  Undoubtedly, they provide facilities in their premises for many branches of the work of the <Col N="823" /> Post Office.  Their hours are long and under recent developments will be still longer.  The Minister has shown consideration and has been making improvements in the postal services and will, no doubt, in due time give consideration to any good case that is made.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that in recent times advertising of Irish Products is done through Irish song and music to a much greater extent than has been the case.  That development should continue.  Episodes from our history through the dramatic art of our people are receiving a fair space now in presentations. Rural Ireland particularly is tuning in to a great extent to Radio Éireann to listen to the very informative lectures and other programmes which are of help to them from day to day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that I am very pleased on behalf of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, from the top ranking officers to the people who man the lower grades, for the generous tributes that have been paid, in full measure, to their courtesy, ability, diligence and integrity, by the Deputies from all sides of the House during this debate.  I should like to add my own tribute to them for the work they do in providing at all times, day and night, and in all areas, remote and otherwise, the services which the Department provides for the people as a whole.</P>
      <P>I should like now to deal with some of the points made in the debate.  In opening the debate for the Opposition, Deputy McGilligan complained that I did not give sufficient information about the proposed television service. He said that I had devoted only 2½ pages of my opening speech to that service and he asked for particulars of the advances made by the new Broadcasting Authority since its establishment. Apparently, he wanted to get in greater detail the decisions that have already been taken by that authority and the progress that they have made towards providing a nationwide television service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say here and now that I <Col N="824" /> deliberately refrained from commenting on such matters because they are entirely for the Broadcasting Authority. The Authority has been set up, among other things, to establish and run the service on a self-supporting basis and in my view we must give them a reasonable time to do the job.  What they pay for programmes and what they charge for advertisements will be their responsibility.  The figures may or may not approximate to the tentative figures mentioned when the Broadcasting Bill was before the House.  That, to my mind, is quite unimportant if, as I believe, the Authority can make the service pay its way within a number of years.  As I pointed out before, the majority of the Television Commission were satisfied on this point and so were the private interests that were anxious to provide a television service for us.</P>
    <P>The number of live programmes must necessarily be modest at the outset and I am not going to interfere with the Authority on this score because I am quite sure that they will do their utmost to provide the maximum proportion of live programmes within their resources.  They must be allowed, as I have already stated, to go about their job in their own way and they will not be tied to any of the tentative estimates of programme costs made before they were set up.  To the extent that they may decide to spend more on programmes they will no doubt be guided by what revenue they expect to get from advertising.</P>
    <P>The service is being established in the belief that it can be made to pay its way and we have still no reason to doubt that this can be done but, of course, only time will tell.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies speaking in the debate gave a good deal of their time to discussing the affairs of the Broadcasting Authority.  Some of them dealt with the television service and others with the sound broadcasting service. Some Deputies seemed to think the new Director General was concerned solely with television and also that the staff of the Authority were still members of the Civil Service attached to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. If any of them are at the <Col N="825" /> moment, they will not always be.  The transfer has not fully taken place but in a very short space of time all the staff of the broadcasting service will be the staff of the new Authority and will not be under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The Director General and his staff are concerned with the organisation and the transmission of programmes of both services, sound broadcasting and television.  It would be too early to give any indication as to what the programmes from the television station will be but it is a matter entirely for the Authority.  During the course of the passage of the Broadcasting Authority Bill through the Oireachtas many Deputies complained bitterly that the Minister was written all over the Bill, that he had authority to interfere in many matters concerning the administration of the new Broadcasting Authority.  I pointed out in the discussion on the various sections of the Bill that the Minister's powers to interfere or intervene were restricted by the Bill itself and that, as far as I was concerned personally, I would endeavour in the establishment of this Authority to give full freedom of action in the matter of decisions in regard to the administration of the services that would be placed under its control.</P>
    <P>The same applies to censorship of programmes.  We should trust the Authority and the House itself agreed, as a principle, that we should trust the Authority and allow it to handle censorship in consultation with the Film Censor.  I have tried to give the House an indication of my attitude on all these matters and what I propose to do in the future in regard to the Authority.  I have no power whatsoever to intervene in the day-to-day administration of the Broadcasting Service.</P>
    <P>The question was raised of the non-reception of sound broadcasting programmes in certain parts of the country, especially in Wexford and southern areas.  The statement I made last year in this regard was quoted, and all I can add now is that I have impressed upon the new Authority the necessity for dealing with this matter. <Col N="826" /> This is also a matter solely for them. However, it is no easy problem with which to deal.  There are technical reasons for this non-reception of programmes and in order to overcome the difficulty the Authority would have to spend a considerable amount of money. One Deputy asked during the debate whether the question of money was involved.  It is a question of money and a question of deciding what means should be adopted to make certain that sound broadcasting programmes will be received all over the country.</P>
    <P>In my opening speech I referred to the fact that the new sites we were acquiring for the television transmitters would be used in an attempt to solve this problem.  If the Authority decided on the V.H.F. method of solving this problem, the booster stations, or whatever you care to call them, in the sound broadcasting service could be located on those sites.  It is a fact, however, that the provision of the V.H.F. transmitters or boosters would cost a considerable amount of money.</P>
    <P>Deputies from all sides of the House made reference to the telephone service. Many Deputies from rural areas impressed upon me the necessity for increasing the installation of telephones in farmers' houses in isolated rural areas and put up good arguments as to why that activity should be continued. Last year the Department of Posts and Telegraphs connected over 15,000 new telephone subscribers, which in itself was a record.  When I came to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs a waiting list obtained and that waiting list had been in existence over a number of years.  The Post Office authorities over the years had been making serious efforts to wipe out the arrears in applications for new telephones but the rate at which the applications came in was greater than that anticipated.  That necessitated an increase in personnel attached to the Engineering Branch of the Department.  They made every effort to catch up on the arrears but when the Post Office increased their efforts to catch up on the arrears in connections to new telephone subscribers <Col N="827" /> it was found that the demand for new telephones increased also and the increase was much above the rate of installation.  However, last year an all-out effort was made and the record number of over 15,000 new subscribers were connected.</P>
    <P>That in itself creates a problem for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and for myself.  Last year on this Estimate many Deputies raised the question of the long delay in handling trunk calls particularly at the Central Telephone Exchange in Dublin.  I took note of the statements that were made then and had a consultation with the officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on this question.  I found there were arrears of work on both long and short trunk circuit and that it was imperative, if we were to maintain an efficient telephone service, that much of the capital devoted to telephone development should now be expended on the micro-wave connecting links, on long trunks and on the short circuits, and that the energies of the Engineering Branch of the Department should be directed towards that end.</P>
    <P>That is the policy the Department will follow in the immediate future. This year we are spending the extra £500,000 I have received from the Minister for Finance mainly on that kind of work.  It will go mainly on the payment for new equipment to enable the Department to maintain an efficient telephone service for the people who are already connected.  That means the Department will not be able for some short time to continue at an accelerated pace the connecting up of new subscribers. The House and every right thinking person will agree that it is essential that we should have an efficient telephone service for the business community and for social purposes.  To cater for the business community, in particular, one must have a network to carry the traffic.  Over the last two years the increase in traffic has been such that the present network is barely capable of carrying the business.  In the next month or two the increase in traffic will be felt and we may not be <Col N="828" /> able to provide an absolutely efficient service.  However, in a short time, we will get ahead on that.  It is absolutely essential that we should.  We must plan to provide not alone an efficient network for present subscribers but also for future new subscribers.</P>
    <P>I have been asked many questions in connection with the telephone service. It was suggested that the three minute minimum for trunk calls should be abolished and that we should have a four minute minimum.  The three minute minimum is the internationally accepted unit for settling international accounts.  It is of long standing and I do not intend to interfere with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry raised the question of nuisance calls.  In all cases that are reported the Department and Garda do everything possible to trace the callers. Where the callers are identified they are prosecuted.  A number of such prosecutions takes place every year.  It is very difficult to catch these people but every effort is made to find them and hold them responsible for their actions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister do about people who dial wrong numbers in the early hours of the morning?  My number is next to that of a Garda and, at least, once a week I am pulled out of bed at 3 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must accept the apologies of the caller for that.  We expect a further decline in telegram traffic.  It would appear as if the decline will be mostly in internal traffic.  The Post Office keep the telex service under review all the time.  Its growth is being watched and whatever steps are necessary in order to keep the service up to date will be taken at the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of sub-postmasters was raised by several Deputies and many of them pressed for arbitration for sub-postmasters. Deputy Blowick made a very strong plea.  So did Deputy O.J. Flanagan.  Deputy Blowick asked me if I thought sub-postmasters were living in the lap of luxury?  Of course I do not, any more than any other section of the community is living in the lap of luxury.  Most sections have to work and they get a reasonable <Col N="829" /> return for their labours.  Very few in our community live in the lap of luxury.  Does Deputy Blowick think that, because other sections have got arbitration, they are living in the lap of luxury?  There are many sections that have not got arbitration.  Farmers complain bitterly that they have no method by which their income can be assessed.  Small traders, artisans and tradesmen provide a useful service for the community, but they have not got arbitration.</P>
    <P>There is a history attached to this matter of arbitration for sub-postmasters. In 1949, the then Government, of which Deputy Blowick was a member and Deputy O.J. Flanagan was a supporter, ruled out sub-postmasters from participation in arbitration and conciliation.  They ruled them out because they were not regarded as civil servants.  Apparently the sub-postmasters union did not press the matter until 1952 and 1953.  Further correspondence on this question of arbitration took place in 1956.  Through the good offices of the Minister at the time the sub-postmasters consultative council was set up.  But they did not get arbitration or conciliation.  Indeed, the then Government went to great pains at the time to take conciliation out and put in the word &ldquo;consultative&rdquo; in the descriptive title of the council set up.</P>
    <P>The same reasons were advanced then as were advanced in 1949 for the refusal to admit subpostmasters into the arbitration scheme.  It was contended subpostmasters were not civil servants.  They are appointed by answering advertisements which appear in local sub-offices.  They make application by filling in a form and they contract to perform certain work for the Department of Post and Telegraphs. They contract to do that work under a certain system.  They offer the premises.  They must offer the premises as otherwise they would not be considered at all.  They promise to conform to the rules and regulations applicable to the office.  They offer to provide the service the Post Office demands of them.  All that is written in in the agreement.  They agree to accept the payment under the system laid down <Col N="830" /> by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. One would need to be very well versed in Civil Service practice to have a clear picture of how the salary a subpostmaster receives is arrived at. Last year the subpostmasters union did not like my description of subpostmasters as contractors.  I used the term &ldquo;contractor&rdquo; in the sense I have now explained to the House.  They enter into a contractual arrangement with the Department to perform certain work.</P>
    <P>The subpostmasters union asked again for arbitration in 1959.  They were refused for the same reasons as they were refused in 1949 and 1956. But that refusal does not imply they are living in the lap of luxury.  All it means is that, as far as the Government and the Minister of the day are concerned, the subpostmasters claim to arbitration is not being acceded to.  The position at the moment is that this question is not under consideration.</P>
    <P>Other matters, such as conditions and pay, are the subject of a claim by the subpostmasters union before the consultative council.  Some Deputies complained about the length of time it took to decide some claims.  It takes a long time to deal with some aspects of the claims made by civil servants and other people.  Even if the subpostmasters had arbitration, matters would not, in my opinion, be accelerated.  The consultative council is still in existence; these matters can be discussed there and, if agreement is reached, I believe sanction is automatic.  A decision has recently been made on a claim by the subpostmasters for an increase in the minimum rate of payment for small offices.</P>
    <P>I am precluded from making any comment on the proceedings of the council since they are treated as confidential. It is not a fact, as alleged by Deputy Oliver Flanagan, that the sequence of council meetings was interfered with in any way by the Department. There was only one occasion on which a meeting was not held.  It arose out of a dispute between the sub-postmasters and the Department.  The matter was resolved and explained to the union at the council meeting.  The meeting was deferred on another <Col N="831" /> occasion because the subpostmasters union asked that it be deferred.  Those were the only occasions on which there was any disagreement about the holding of a meeting.  The regulations under which the Council was set up in 1956 provide for three-monthly meetings.  You would have to have business for each meeting.  It would be senseless having a meeting if there was nothing to discuss.  I do not think there is anything further to say on subpostmasters.</P>
    <P>The question of postmen was raised. The established postman has a pension scheme, and gratuities are payable to other postmen.  Deputies know the changes that have been made reducing the qualifying period from 15 years to seven for the unestablished and auxiliary postmen.  To initiate a contributory pension scheme for every postman would present many difficulties. First, we must consider the manner in which auxiliary postmen enter the service.  They come in on a list supplied by the labour exchange. The person appointed can be of any age from 18 to 50, and over 50 in certain excepted cases.  For a long time the Department has been trying to get uniformity of hours for auxiliary postmen generally.  They try to fit that in with the reorganisation of postal services which has been going on over the years with the object of providing a six day delivery in all posts.  I have not gone into this question of providing a contributory pension scheme for auxiliary postmen, but I can see the difficulty in providing any scheme that would be of material benefit.</P>
    <P>Other minor matters were raised concerning postmen in rural areas.  I do not think I am called upon to deal with the question of providing motor scooter transport for postmen.  There is no change in the regulations in that regard.  The local postman, if he wishes, can use motorised transport.  There are many difficulties facing a postman in that regard.  There is the provision of the transport itself, the delivery of letters down long, narrow lanes and <Col N="832" /> so on.  There is also the question of replacements for the holiday season. I would rather see more men employed than have fewer men using mechanically propelled vehicles.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked me about the grants payable out of funds and gratuities under the Superannuation Acts.  Part-time officers whose grants are payable from the Minister's Special Fund are already being given the benefit of the reduction in the qualifying period from 15 to seven years.  Fulltime unestablished officers whose grants are paid under the Superannuation Acts cannot receive the benefit of the reduction in qualifying service until the passage of legislation. This is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  The Deputy also asked me if I would break down the figure of 258 increase in staff in the Department. The break-down is: engineering staff, 179; telephonists 80.  These are the main figures.  There are some other minor increases and decreases.  Deputy Norton also asked me about the building programme of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  In my opening speech I gave some indication of our building programme in the year under review and the very near future.  I do not think it would be wise now to take up the time of the House giving a long lists of all the places in which the Post Office plans to develop existing buildings or to erect new ones.  I would point out that the Department plans ahead for two or three years at a time but the Office of Public Works actually prepares the drawings and arranges for the building.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made on many occasions in the past and during this debate concerning delays in the erection of particular buildings for the postal authorities.  Some Deputies have complained as well that certain commencement dates have been behind schedule.  We accept the information we get from the Office of Public Works as to commencement dates.  In some cases plans have to be altered because of late decisions to have bigger buildings or in order to provide Post Office engineering staffs with additional facilities and equipment.  On other occasions <Col N="833" /> delays are due to extra work in the Office of Public Works in connection with the State's general building programme.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the State had to set out to improve the housing facilities of our people.  Long years of arrears in that work had to be overtaken.  The building of national schools also had high priority and the State was vitally interested in improved school facilities.  It is commendable to see that successive Governments not alone interested themselves in providing decent housing and schools but that they also tackled the problem of public building throughout the country.  But of course private housing and schools always had prior claims on the capital available year by year.  I can assure the House that insofar as my Department is concerned our aim is, as far as possible, to provide the country with offices that would meet the requirements of the public and that will add to the attractiveness of our local towns.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked me about the Central Sorting Office and quoted me as saying last year that I hoped the pile foundations would go down this year.  Since then a decision has been taken that pile foundations will not be necessary and the question has now resolved itself as to when a start can be made on the erection of the office on a foundation without piles.  I would not venture an opinion as to the commencement date but it is hoped to have the tenders for the erection of the steel frame work issued in the near future.  The tender for the erection of the main building will then be decided upon without undue delay.</P>
    <P>I was pressed by many Deputies to provide certain areas throughout the country with telephone kiosks and new sub-post offices.  In that connection I should like to point out that my aim is to see the Post Office pays its way one year with another.  Down through the years the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has refused to erect kiosks or to establish new sub-post offices in areas where it has been obvious the Department would be unlikely to get a fair return for the capital expended in the provision of such buildings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> That policy may appear to be hard on the rural community but as I have already explained, it is expected of the Department that it should pay its way.  I would point out that the surplus which accrued each year to the credit of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is very modest if we compare it with the amount of capital invested and the amount of service given to the public, so that even the slightest variation in income would upset the balance at the end of any given year.  As a matter of fact, in 1956 the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, said: &ldquo;Indeed it would not be inappropriate that the Department should make some contribution by way of profit to the general Exchequer revenue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The policy of the Department is, and I thoroughly agree with it myself, that so far as telephone kiosks are concerned, the Department will see to it that a kiosk will be erected wherever there is a prospect of its paying its way and the same applies to sub-post offices.  You could not conduct the business of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on any other system; otherwise you would have to look for a subvention from the Exchequer to subsidise the working of the Post Office and I think that would be a very bad principle upon which to conduct the affairs of an important Department such as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>In that connection, it would be just as well for us to realise that this country is already provided with post offices on a more generous scale than in the great majority of postal administrations throughout the world.  We have a post office on the average for every 1,250 persons.</P>
    <P>There is an important matter which was raised here by Deputy Oliver Flanagan in connection with overcharging in telephone accounts.  I should like to deal with that.  I answered a question earlier in the year in connection with it and when one answers a question the information contained may not be sufficient to give a full picture of the situation that obtained.  I should like first of all to put the matter in its proper perspective. <Col N="835" /> Every quarter the Accounts Branch of my Department makes out accounts for some 33,000,000 local calls, three and a quarter million trunk calls, plus charges for phonograms, removals, etc.  About 105,000 accounts are sent out and collected. Only in a tiny minority of cases are the accounts disputed.</P>
    <P>The policy has been, and is, to consider carefully and sympathetically every inquiry or complaint and in cases, where there is a doubt, to give the subscriber the benefit of it.  In this regard I believe that the Post Office can stand comparison with any other large organisation in regard to the manner in which it deals with such complaints.  As regards faults in or affecting telephone meters, it appears that it has come as a surprise to many people that not only do such faults occur but that their existence is actually admitted by the Post Office. Of course, faults affecting meters do occur not only in the telephone service here but in every country that uses them.</P>
    <P>Moreover, practically every other service which uses meters finds that they are subject to faults of some kind.  One cannot achieve perfection in this field &mdash;at least not without prohibitive cost. The system has not been designed which will give 100 per cent. accuracy at all times.  Meanwhile, the most we can do is to use the best equipment obtainable and to try to keep faults and errors to a minimum.  I have already stated that we use equipment of the best quality and standard of accuracy obtainable and everything reasonably possible is done in the way of checks, proper maintenance, etc., to keep the number of faults to the lowest possible level.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed that it is not possible to say how many cases of faulty meters have occurred. I have already given the number of actual and suspected cases in which refunds were made and pointed out that the number is only a small fraction of the total number of accounts issued during the quarter in question. One of the difficulties in determining <Col N="836" /> the precise number is that faults occur in equipment associated with the meters which may or may not affect the meter. It is difficult, therefore, to segregate and prove the probable from the doubtful case.  I do not accept that the number of overcharging cases is serious or abnormal or that subscribers are likely to be overcharged unless they keep a record.  Some people do keep records, but most are satisfied to compare their bills from one quarter to another.</P>
    <P>The average quarterly bill for the ordinary household is not as big as some people imagine.  In Dublin where the local calling rate is highest over 70 per cent. make less than three calls per day.  Our experience is that any marked discrepancy from quarter to quarter in such accounts is quickly challenged.  The Accounts Branch also keeps a watch on any abnormal changes which may suggest an error in the meter reading or recording apparatus. There are standing instructions that service must not be normally withdrawn when subscribers will not pay a disputed account.  This cannot be adhered to in all cases.  Finally, while I can give no guarantee that faults of the kind in question will or can be eliminated, I can assure the House that everything possible will be done to keep the number to a minimum to ensure as far as practicable that no subscriber will be overcharged.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch made a suggestion in connection with telephone directories, that he wished to have established a system whereby a local trader or local group of people could have a local telephone directory of its own. I had the matter examined because I thought myself that it might be a commendable thing and I wanted to see whether there was any merit in it.  It is very doubtful whether there is any demand for a local telephone directory at the present.  The exclusive rights of publishing advertisements are vested in the agents appointed for the purpose and while that arrangement exists the publication of local directories is not permitted.  If it were permitted, there would be a danger that they would continue to be used long after changes had been made in the numbers shown <Col N="837" /> in such directories.  On the whole I think that the present arrangement of having numbers shown in the official Post Office Directory is the best one.</P>

      <P>Before I conclude I would like to deal with the complaint raised by Deputy Coogan of Galway. Apparently, he had a question down recently to the Minister for Social Welfare in connection with an application for an auxiliary postman's job at Carna in County Galway.  Of course he complained about the answer the Minister gave to his question.  I could not go into the merits or otherwise of what occurred between the Deputy and the Minister for Social Welfare. The Minister answered the question that was put to him, in my view.  A vacancy occurred in Carna for a fulltime postman on the 7th February, 1960.  The vacancy was covered by upgrading, temporarily, the auxiliary postman and his post was covered by a temporary officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coogan alleges that the person appointed was appointed because of some political pull and that he did not get the post on merit.  He cited the family circumstances of the person in whom he himself was interested.  I am prevented from referring to the domestic circumstances of any of the applicants that applied for this post because the information was supplied to me in confidence by the Department of Social Welfare. Deputy Coogan's citation of the man in whom he was interested is quite correct and it is quite correct that the man who was appointed to the post by me is a single man.  I stand over that, but he was the son of the auxiliary postman who was there for a long number of years and he was in <Col N="838" /> fact the temporary officer in the post since the 30th November, 1959.</P>
    <P>He is living in the house with his father and, as far as I am concerned, whenever a vacancy of such a nature occurs and the auxiliary postman has long service, I will do as much as I possibly can to appoint his son.  That is not in strict conformity with Government direction in the matter.  The Government direction is that normally the person in the greatest need and put forward by the labour exchange should get the appointment.  For any exception to that I will accept full responsibility. I think I did what was right and proper in appointing this single man to this particular post and if Deputy Coogan consults his own supporters he will find that they are in agreement with the arrangement.</P>

      <Col N="839" /> Seacht milliún déag, ceithre chéad is sé mhíle, dhá chéad is deich bpúnt atá ins na naoí Vótaí go bhfuilim-se freagrach iontu.  Tá an méid sin £632,210 níos mó ná mar a solthraíodh sa bhliain airgeadais seo caite.</P>

Dá bhrí sin, tá ar fad £19,006,210 dhá sholáthar le haghaidh na seirbhísí oideachais i mbliana.  Is ionann san is 14.4% den iomlán atá dá chur ar fáil le haghaidh na Seirbhísí Soláthair ar fad.</P>
    <P>Nuair a fhéachaimid ar shuim atá os cionn £19,000,000, tá seans ann go rithfeadh sé linn gur mór an glam airgid é agus gan dá chlúdach aige ach sraith amháin seirbhísí.  Ach ansan nuair a chuimhnímid ar cé chomh tábhachtach agus ar cé chomh bunúsach is atá na seirbhísí sin don tír, tá mé cinnte nach leasc le haoinne againn an méid atá á chaitheamh orthu.  Sé an intinn atá agam féin faoi ná go mbeidh orainn leanúint fós de bheith ag cur leis an soláthar i gcomhair oideachais sul a mbeimid i riocht a rá go bhfuil córas oideachais againn atá gar do bheith lán-sásúil.</P>

    <P>Deich milliún, seacht gcéad is seachtó míle, sé chéad is caoga púnt an méid glan atá sa Vóta so.  Is mó de £221,810 é sin ná suim na bliana 1960/61, agus £50,000 de mheastachán breise a thógaint san áireamh.  Furmhór an mhéadú sin baineann sé le soláthar breise i gcomhair tuarastail <Col N="840" /> múinteoirí a shíolraigh ó mhéadú ar líon na múinteoirí agus ó shocruithe i leith tuarastail a deineadh fén chóras idirréitigh.  Sa scoil-bhliain a chríochnaigh ar an 30ú Meitheamh, 1960, bhí 13,866 ar fostú ins na scoileanna i gcomparáid le 13,684 sa bhliain roimhe sin.  Bhí méadú freisin ar líon na ndaltaí ins na scoileanna náisiúnta: is 506,208 daltaí a bhí ar na rollaí ar an 30ú Meitheamh, 1960, i gcomparáid le 505,363 daltaí ar chothrom an lae sin sa bhliain 1959.</P>
    <P>Fé mar a léiríonn na figiúirí atá tugtha agam anois díreach, tá isteach is amach le cúig chéad míle dalta ins na scoileanna náisiúnta.  Má thógaimid gur céad bliain saol-ré foirgneamh scoile bheadh orainn cóiríocht do chúig mhíle dalta do chur ar fáil gach bliain chun an <i>status quo</i> do choimeád.  Mar sin nuair adeirim libh gur soláthraíodh cóiríocht nua do 12,133 de dhaltaí sa bhliain darbh chríoch an 31ú Márta seo caite, tuigfidh sibh cé chomh tapaidh is atáimid ag glanadh na riaráistí a fágadh mar oidhreacht againn.

    <P>Maidir leis an mbliain atá romhainn ar an 31ú Márta, 1961, bhí céad dachad is a haon de mhór-scéimeanna tógála ar siúl.  Soláthrófar leis na scéimeanna san cóiríocht do 17,666 daltaí.</P>
    <P>Ó thárla mé caint ar chúrsaí tógála agus an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh ba mhaith liom tagairt go speisialta don tábhacht a bhaineann leis na scoileanna do choimeád i dtreo mar is ceart.  Ní haon mhaith bheith ag cur foirgintí nua ar fáil muna gcoimeádtar i gceart ina dhiaidh sin iad.  Bhítheas ag súil leis i gcónaí, agus is réasúnta an ní é, measaim, bheith ag súil leis, gur ar an mbainisteoir a bheadh an fhreagraíocht i leith chóiriú na scoile.  Tá a lán bainisteoirí ann a dhéanann an-chúram do bheith ag breathnú i ndiaidh a gcuid scoileanna, ach tá an iomad ann fós nach ndéanann.  Sé an bheart atá le déanamh, dá réir sin, teacht ar sheift chun uchtach a thabhairt do na dea-bhainisteoirí úd agus chun an bainisteoir faillíoch a ghríosú le tabhairt faoina chuid dualgas sa ghnó.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> Ba léir tar éis an scéal a scrúdú, gurbí an phéinteáil an chuid is riachtanaí, agus fós an chuid is costasaí den obair sin.  Chun teacht ar leigheas an scéil, tá beartaithe agam scéim a thabhairt isteach féna dtuitfidh cuid de chostas na péinteála ar an Stát, an chéad uair riamh ó bunaíodh córas an oideachais náisiúnta, ar tháinig an Stát i gcabhair ar an slí sin.  Níl mion-seoraí an scéime socair fós, ach thig liom a rá ag an bpointe seo gurbe an cion a thógfaidh an Stát air féin dhá dtrian den chostas.  Ag an am céanna, ba mhaith liom a fhógairt do gach aon lena mbaineann nach n-íocfar an deontas ach amháin sa chás ina mbeidh foirgneamh agus clós na scoile á gcoimeád go sásúil.</P>
    <P>Tógáil agus cóiriú scoileanna is mó a bhí i gceist agam go dtí seo, ach tá roinnt nithe eile go mba mhaith liom tagairt speisialta a dhéanamh dóibh anois.  Ceann de na nithe sin, ceann a bhaineann go dlúth le tógáil agus cóiriú, isea ceist na foirne.</P>
    <P>Anuraidh is athrú anuraidh deineadh scéal na fóirne ins na scoileanna náisiúnta d'fheabhsú trí huaire ar leith trén choibhneas idir scoláirí agus múinteoirí do laghdú.  Is maith liom é do bheith le hinsint agam go bhfuil beartaithe a thuilleadh feabhais do chur ar an scéal i mbliana. Chuala sibh go léir trácht ar na ranganna móra.  Is ins na scoileanna a íoctar ar bhun caipitíochta is mó a thárla na ranganna san, scoileanna nach raibh an coibhneas idir múinteoirí is daltaí comh fábharach iontu is atá ins na gnáth-scoileanna aicmíochta.  Tá socair go gceadófar le héifeacht ón lú lúil, 1961, an fhoireann chéanna ins na scoileanna san is atá á ceadú ins na gnáth-scoileanna aicmíochta.  Na baill bhreise foirne a fhostófar dá réir sí an Roinn a íocfaidh a dtuarastal ar fad.  Ba chóir go dtiocfadh as sin go laghdófar go maith ar na ranganna móra ins na scoileanna sin.</P>
    <P>Tá beartas eile i leith na scoileanna a íoctar ar bhun caipitíochta go mba mhaith liom tagairt dó.  Fé mar a fógraíodh tamall ó shoin tá an Roinn i gcomhairle le lucht ceannais na scoileanna sin ó thaobh postanna speisialta do chruthú do na tuath-oidí atá fostaithe iontu.  Fé réir an bheartais <Col N="842" /> sin cruthófar post speisialta amháin in aghaidh gach ceathrair tuath-oidí-oidí atá fostaithe in aon scoil dá leithéid agus íocfar le sealbhóir an phoist liúntas is ionann agus liúntas leas-phríomhoide ins na gnáth-scoileanna, sé sin, £60 sa bhliain d'fhear singil agus do mhnaoí agus £75 sa bhliain d'fhear pósta.  An Roinn a sheasódh costas na bpostanna speisialta san freisin.</P>
    <P>Beart mhaith eile a tháinig i gcrích le déanaí is ea gur ardaíodh na liúntais do phríomh-oidí agus do leasphríomhoidí ón lú Aibreán fé réir aontú a rinneadh fán Chóras Idirréitigh. Is do na príomhoidí ins na scoileanna beaga fén dtuaith a tugadh an t-ardú ba mhó.  Ceann de na fáthanna a bhí leis sin ná gur fíorthábhachtach gan na príomh-oidi bheith ag aistriú ó na scoileanna beaga sin go minic agus gur fíorthábhachtach, leis, oidí óga a mhealladh chun na scoileanna sin.</P>
    <P>Ó thárla mé ag caint ar an gcóras idir-reitigh tá aontu eile a rinneadh fén chóras san agus b'fhéidir nár mhiste tagairt a dhéanamh dó. Baineann an t-aontú san le múinteoirí náisiúnta ga raibh seirbhís acu mar tuath-oidí i scoileanna caipitíochta roimh 1934.  Go dtí seo níor áiríodh ach dhá dtrian den tseirbhís úd chun críche pinsin, rud a bhí ina abhar mór gearáin ag na múinteoirí a bhí i gceist.  Fé réir an aontú atá déanta anois ní bheidh an t-abhar gearáin sin ann a thuilleadh.</P>
    <P>Tá gné eile fós den bhun-oideachas go bhfuil an-chur síos déanta air le roint bhlian anuas.  Sé gné atá i gceist agam ná oideachas do sholáthar do pháistí go bhfuil máchail coirp nó máchail intinne orthu.  Tá dul ar aghaidh ana-mhaith déanta le roint bhlian anuas le bunú scoileanna speisialta do pháistí dá leithéid.  I láthair na huaire tá ós cionn 30 scoileanna den chineál san ann.  Fadhbh amháin atá ag baint leo ná foireann atá cáilithe go h-oiriúnach a fháil dóibh.  Chun an fhadhbh sin a réiteach tá socair tús a chur i mbliana le cúrsa speisialta sé mhí do mhúinteoirí gur mhaith leo bheith ag obair ins na scoileanna san. Rinne mé tagairt don scéal san sa Tigh seo nuair a bhí meastachán breise á thabhairt isteach agam tamall ó shoin <Col N="843" /> agus b'fhéidir gur tuigeadh as an méid a dubhras an tráth san nach mbeadh ag freastal ar an gcúrsa speisialta sin ach fir.  Is amhlaidh a ghlacfar le fir agus mná ar an gcúrsa.</P>
    <P>Beidh cuimhne ag na Teachtaí gur chuireas in iúl sa Tigh seo anuraidh go raibh socair deireadh a chur leis na Coláistí Ullmhúcháin mar chuid de chóras earcaíochta na múinteoirí náisiúnta. Bhí daoine ann, b'fhéidir, san am a bhí ag ceapadh gur céim siar é sin ó thaobh múinteoirí d'fháil a mbeadh eolas an mhaith acu ar an nGaeilge.  Éinne a bhí ag ceapadh a leithéid, is baol go ndearna sé dearmad go raibh dhá dtrian de na múinteoirí i gcónaí nár thainig riamh tré Choláiste Ullmhúcháin, agus mar sin de in aon mhachtnamh a dhéanfaí i dtaobh an scéil go gcaithfí staid na múinteoirí ar fad do thógaint san áireamh.  Rinneadh é sin, agus táim sásta go bhfaghann na mic-léinn cúrsa an-mhaith sa Ghaeilge ins na Coláistí Oiliúna.</P>
    <P>Ag an am chéana, áfach, measaim go bhfónódh sé go mór do na múinteoirí óga nach cainteoirí ó dhúchas iad tréimhsí a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht. D'fhonn é sin do thabhairt chun críche tá socair agam athrú do dhéanamh ins na rialacha a bhaineann le cáilíochta Gaeilge le haghaidh múinteoirí náisiúnta.  Go dtí seo bhí ar mhúinteoirí caighdeán an Teastais Dhá-Theangaigh do shroisint ag deireadh an chúrsa oiliúna chun láncháilíocht do bhaint amach.  I gcássanna áirithe ina dteipeadh orthú é sin a dhéanamh tugtaí seansanna eile dóibh an caighdeán do shroisint le linn a tréimhse profa.</P>
    <P>Tá beartaithe agam anois deireadh a chur leis an dTeastas Dhá-Theangach agus ina áit sin an gnáth-scrúdú cinn cúrsa sa Ghaeilge a bheith ann i dteannta le triail inniúlachta i labhairt na Gaeilge go gcaithfeadh an múinteoir óg pas d'fháil ann laistigh de chúig bhliain tar éis dó an Coláiste Oiliúna d'fhágaint.  Tá ar intinn go mbeadh caighdeán an-ard sa triail sin, caighdeán nach sroisfí, de ghnáth, ach ag an gcainteoir ó dhúchas nó ag an té go raibh tréimhsí caite sa Ghaeltacht <Col N="844" /> aige.  Chun cabhrú leis na múinteoirí a bheadh i gceist tréimhsí do chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht tá socair go n-íocfar £15 de liúntas leo i leith tréimhse míosa a bheadh caite acu sa Ghaeltacht i ngach ceann de thrí bhliain laistigh den am a mbeidís á n-ullmhú féin don triail inniúlachta.  Táim sásta go ndéanfaidh an scéim nua so a lán chun caighdeán labhairt na Gaeilge i measc na múinteoirí d'ardú agus go dtiocfaidh as sin go mbeadh feabhas mór ar theagasc labhairt na Gaeilge ins na scoileanna.</P>
    <P Just="Center">MEÁN-OIDEACHAS.</P>
    <P>Dhá mhilliún, ocht gcéad seasca is trí mhíle, ceithre chéad is caoga púnt an t-iomlán atá dhá sholáthar le haghaidh Meán-Oideachais.  Is £147,960 de mhéadú é sin ar sholáthar na bliana airgeadais 1960-61.  Síolraíonn an méadú san ón bhfás atá ar líon na scoileanna, líon na múinteoirí agus líon na scoláirí.  Le go léireofaí cé chomh tapaidh is atá an mheán-scolaíocht ag leathnú bhéarfaidh mé roint figiúirí do bhaill an Tí.  San scoil-bhliain 1929/30 bhí 294 de mheánscoileanna ann agus 27,645 dalta iontu.  Fiche bliain ina dhiaidh sin .i. sa scoil-bhliain 1949/50 bhí líon na scoileanna méadaithe go dtí 416 agus líon na ndaltaí méadaithe go 47,065.  Sa scoil-bhliain reatha siad na comh-fhigiúirí ná 526 agus 76,843, fé seach.</P>
    <P>Cloisimid oiread san trácht na laetheanta so i dtaobh tuarastal múinteoirí go mb'fhéidir nár mhiste roint fíoraí do thabhairt.  Tá dhá chuid i dtuarastal meán-mhúinteora .i. an bun-thuarastal&mdash;minimum £200 sa bhliain&mdash;a íocann an scoil, agus an breis-thuarastal a íocann an Roinn. Nuair a cuireadh tús leis na scálaí breis-thuarastail a bhliain 1924-25 sé an scála a bhí ann d'fhear ó £12 go dtí £210 sa bhliain, agus ó £10 go dtí £120 sa bhliain do mhnaoi.  Ní bhíodh aon bhreis-thuarastal iníoctha go dtí go mbíodh trí bhliain de thaithí curtha isteach ag an múinteoir.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain 1946 deineadh athrú sa scéal i dtreo go raibh breis-thuarastal iníoctha tar éis bliana de thaithí a chur isteach.  Téann na scálaí breis-thuarastail atá i bhfeidhm fé láthair ó £260 go dtí £645 i gcás fir singil nó mná, agus ó <Col N="845" /> £335 go dtí £870 i gcás fir phósta.  Fé mar a dubhras cheana, minimum de £200 an tuarastal scoile, agus mar sin de, sé an scála minimum iomlán atá ag fear singil nó bean anois ná £460 go dtí £845 agus d'fhear pósta £535 go dtí £1,070.</P>
    <P>Le cois an ghnáth-bhreis-thuarastail íocann an Roinn breiseanna speisialta ar son céim le h-onóracha&mdash;£48 sa bhliain&mdash;agus ar son teagaisc tré Ghaeilge&mdash;suas go dtí £37 16 sa bhliain&mdash;chomh maith le liúntas cíosa &mdash;ó £10 10 go dtí £42&mdash;agus liúntaisí leanaí&mdash;£28 an leanbh&mdash;le fir phósta agus baintreabhacha.  Léiríonn na figiúirí sin cé chomh mór is feabhsaíodh na tuarastail ó 1924.  Tá sé ina abhar casaoide, áfach, ag na múinteoirí óga nach bhfaigheann siad díolaíocht ón Stát sa chéad bhliain dá seirbhís. Tar éis dom gach gné den cheist san do mheas, táim sásta, má táimíd chun daoine óga a bhfuil abhar maith iontu a mhealladh chugainn, go bhfuil an t-am tagaithe chun an scéal sin a leigheas.  Dá réir sin tá beartaithe agam scéim do cheapadh fén a mbeidh meánmhúinteoirí i riocht díolaíocht ón Stát ón lú Lúnasa seo chugainn i leith na céad bhliana dá seirbhís.  Sé an tsuim airgid a bheadh i gceist ón Stát ná £200, ar na coinníollacha céanna ó thaobh cuóta is atá ann do na múinteoirí cláraithe aithinte.  An díolaíocht sin ón Stát, i dteannta an tuarastail ón scoil, táthar ag súil go dtabhairfidh sé thar anás na céad-bhliana úd iad.</P>
    <P>Níl fúm aon mhion-tagairt a dhéanamh do chlár na meán-scol.  An fáth atá agam leis sin ná nach bhfuil breithniú déanta fós ar thuairisc na Comhairle Oideachais a cuireadh fá mo bhráid tamall o shoin.  Tá an tuairisc sin ag na clódóirí fé láthair agus measaim nach fada eile go dtí go mbeidh sé foilsithe.  Lorgófar tuairimí ina leith ansin ó na Cumainn Scoileanna agus ó dhreamanna eile go mbaineann an scéal leo.</P>
    <P>Tá gné amháin d'obair na Meánscoileanna, áfach, go mba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh di.  Sí an ghné sin ná teagasc na hEolaíochta.  Tá an teagasc san ar siúl anois i 440 scoil agus i 3,356 rang.  Na figiúirí don bhliain roimhe sin ná 420 agus 3,076, fé seach.  Léiríonn na figiúirí sin gur <Col N="846" /> fóirleithne teagasc na hEolaíochta ná mar a chuirtear in iúl don phobal i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Mar sin féin, cé gur fíor go dtugann an Roinn timpeall £40,000 de dheontas gach bliain do na scoileanna chun fearaistí eolaíochta a cheannach, ní féidir gan cuimhneamh air go ngabhann cuid mhór costais le saotharlainn eolaíochta do ghléasadh mar is cóir agus go mb'fhéidir go bhfuil ag dul dian ar chuid de na scoileanna ach go háirithe teacht ar an airgead chuige sin.  Dá réir sin shocraigh mé i Mí Meán Fómhair seo caite imlitir agus ceistneoir a chur go dtí Bainisteoirí na Meán-Scoileanna ag lorg mion-eolais uathu i dtaobh theagasc na hEolaíochta. Ba mhór an chabhair na freagraí a fuarthas chun an scéal ar fad d'aithbhreithniú.  De thoradh an aithbhreithnithe sin, tá beartaithe agam scéim a bheith ann fé n-a bhféadfaí, i gcúrsaí áirithe, cabhair mhaith airgid a thabhairt do scoil chun troscán saotharlainne chomh maith le gléasanna eolaíochta do cheannach.  Tá mionseorthaí na scéime á ndéanamh amach fá láthair ag an Roinn, agus tá súil nach fada go mbeifear in ann gach uile eolas ina thaobh a chur chun na scoileanna.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CÉARD-OIDEACHAS</P>
    <P>Milliún, sé chéad, seasca is trí mhíle, ocht gcéad agus seasca púnt an méid atá á iarraidh san bhliain airgeadais seo le haghaidh seirbhísí céard-oideachais. Is £156,840 de mhéadú é sin ar an méid a soláthraíodh anuraidh, agus an Meastachán Breise a ritheadh i ndeireadh na bliana airgeadais seo caite a chur i dteannta an bhun-mheastacháin.</P>
    <P>Léiríonn táibhle na bhfó-mhírcheann i Leabhar na Meastachán an chaoi a bhfuil an t-airgead seo le caitheamh; i bhfoirm deontas do na coistí gairmoideachais, ár ndóigh, a caithfear an mhórchuid ar fad do.  Os cionn £184,000 de mhéadú atá ar na deontais sin do réir mar atá léirithe san Mheastachán, ach nuair a áirítear an tsuim a bhí sa Mheastachán Breise úd a luaigh mé, isé breis ghlan atá á hiarraidh i leith na ndeontas seo, thar mar a soláthraíodh anuraidh, £151,416.</P>
    <P>Is léir do gach éinne gur seirbhís é <Col N="847" /> an céard-oideachas atá ag leathnú i gcónaí agus sílim go bhfuil gach éinne ar aon tuairim gur mór is inmhianta é sin.  Sa bhliain 1959/60 bhí 279 ag soláthar teagaisc&mdash;isé sin, seacht scoileanna níos mó ná mar bhí ann bliain roimhe sin&mdash;agus bhí cúrsaí agus ranganna ar siúl, freisin, i bheagnach 500 ionad eile.  Tháinig breis is 1,700 de mhéadú ar an líon daltaí a bhí ag freastal ar chúrsaí lán-aimsire lae in oideachas leanúna agus i gcéard-oideachas: 26,322 an líon a bhí ann don tseiseon atá caite.  Mar an gcéanna, do méadaíodh ar líon na múinteoirí, idir mhúinteoirí lán-aimsire agus múinteoirí páirt-aimsire. Is mó de 32 an líon múinteoirí lán-aimsire a bhí ann sa tseiseon atá caite ná mar bhí sa tseiseon roimhe sin, agus is mó 218 an líon de mhúinteoirí páirt-aimsire.  Is iad iomlán a bhí ann sa tseiseon dár chríoch Lúnasa, 1960, don dá aicme sin múinteoirí: 1,606 de mhúinteoirí lán-aimsireacha, agus 1,446 de mhúinteoirí páirt-aimsire.</P>
    <P>Ach ní le statistic amháin a léirítear iomlán na forbairte sa tseirbhís ghairmoideachais agus chéardoideachais. Tá dlúthbhaint ag obair na ngairmscol le beagnach gach uile fhorbairt agus gné fhorais sa tsaol náisiúnta.  Thrácht mé anseo anuraidh ar na Feirm-Scoileanna Geimhridh a bunaíodh tré chomhoibriú mo Roinne féin, na Roinne Talmhaíochta, na gcoistí talmhaíochta agus na gcoistí gairmoideachais.  Leanadh dena scoileanna sin i rith an gheimhridh seo caite, agus is ábhar mór sástachta a fheabhas is d'éirigh leo.  Níl aon amhras ann, i mo thuairim, ach gur tábhachtach ar fad iad na cúrsaí seo don tionscal talmhaíochta.  An spéis a cuireadh iontu ó thús agus an t-éileamh a bhí agus atá orthu, léiriu is ea é ar cheann de na rudaí is luachmhaire dá bhfuil againn sa tír seo: isé sin, an fonn mór&mdash;an cíocras, d'fhéadfaí a rá &mdash;atá ar mhuintir na hÉireann chun glacadh le haon ghléas oiliúna nó oideachais a sholáthraítear dóibh, agus leas a bhaint as.</P>
    <P>Tá oiread sin gnéithe den ghairmoideachas ann nach féidir dhom ar ócáid mar seo cur síos a dhéanamh orthu uilig&mdash;ná fiú iad a ríomh, ach tá <Col N="848" /> gné amháin ach go háirithe de ar mhaith é a lua go speisialta i mbliana. Is é gné é ná an scéim chun muintir na tuaithe a oiliúint chun a gcuid tithe cónaithe a fheabhsú agus a chóiriú. Deich mbliana ó shoin, do cuireadh tús leis an scéim seo i gCondae Mhuigheo. Is amhlaidh a bhí ar intinn ag Coiste Gairmoideachais Chontae Mhuigheo cúrsa samhraidh Gaeilge a chur ar bun i nGaeltacht Acla, ach nuair a rinneadh breithniú ar na háiseanna lóistín a bheadh ann do dhaoine a thiocfadh ar an gcúrsa, fuarthas nár leor ar chor ar bith iad.  Ba léir, mar sin, nár mhiste a gcéadóir na daoine a spreagadh agus cabhrú leo chun cúrsaí títhíoctha sa cheanntar a fheabhsú. Chuathas i gcionn oibre.  Bunaíodh rang speisialta sa ghairm-scoil, agus sa rang sin do thug múinteoir adhmadóireachta de chuid an Choiste teagasc agus treoir agus comhairle do mhuintir na háite ar an gcaoi lena gcuid tithe cónaithe d'fheabhsú.  Leagadh amach pleananna chun tithe a mhéadú agus chun atógáil a dhéanamh fé mar ba ghá; tugadh comhairle i dtaobh córais uisce agus folláineachta a chur sna tithe; tugadh teagasc agus bunoiliúint sna céardanna foirgníochta&mdash;siúinéireacht agus mar sin de.  Chuaigh lucht na dtithe ag obair, agus chuaigh an múinteoir thart ag féachaint ar an dul chun cinn a bhí á dhéanamh agus ag comhairliú.  D'éirigh go rí-mhaith leis an scéim&mdash;chomh mhaith sin go raibh cúrsaí den chineál céanna in Acaill gach bliain ó 1952 i leith.  Sa tréimhse sin, tógadh ceithre cinn déag de thithe nua sa cheantar, deisíodh agus leathnaíodh ag tarraingt ar chéad teach, agus cuireadh seomraí folcadáin agus leithris uisce isteach i seachtó teach. Aithneofar gur mór an éacht é sin in aon cheanntar tuaithe amháin.</P>
    <P>As an ngluaiseacht seo a tionscnaíodh in Acaill thainig fás. Chonnacthas go bhféadfaí leas mór ar an dul céanna a dhéanamh ar fud Éireann uile tré dhaoine a oiliúint agus a threorú le deiseanna cónaithe níos fearr a chur ar fáil dóibh féin. Cinneadh ar aicme speisialta múinteoirí a oiliúint don obair seo.  Sa bhliain 1954, hoileadh an chéad dream de mhúinteoirí foirgníochta le dul ag obair faoi choistí gairmoideachais. Ghlac na coistí ina <Col N="849" /> bhfostaíocht iad láithreach.  Ritheadh an dara cúrsa trí bhliain ina dhiaidh sin chun tuilleadh múinteoirí a sholáthar le freastal ar éileamh na gcoistí.  Ocht nduine agus triocha de na múinteoirí seo atá ag obair faoi choistí anois, agus ní leor an méid sin.  Tá cúrsa oiliúna eile ar siúl faoi láthair agus beidh ceithre dhuine dhéag eile de na múinteoirí seo ann do thús an tseiseoin seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Is beag condae sa tír nach bhfuil múinteoir foirgníochta amháin, ar a laghad, ag obair ann anois: i gcontaethe áirithe&mdash;luaim, mar shomplaí Contae na Gaillimhe agus Contae Dhún na nGall&mdash;tá triúr, agus éileamh ar tuilleadh.  I dteannta an taoibh phraicticiúil den obair thógála a theagasc agus a léiriú, tugann na múinteoirí seo eolas agus treoir maidir leis na deontais atá le fáil ó Ranna Stáit agus ó údaráis áitiúla i leith tógáil agus feabhsú tithe cónaithe. Teachta ar bith nach bhfuil eolas aige ar a bhfuil de mhaitheas á dhéanamh faoin scéim seo ar fud na tíre, b'fhiú dhó dul ag breathnú cuid den obair dó féin.  Ba ghealadh croí agus ardú meanman dó é.</P>
    <P>Dá mhéid an toradh atá ar an scéim seo, ó thaoibh chompóirt agus glaine agus sláinte, ní lú ná sin a thoradh ó thaobh tréithe caractair agus meoin an duine féin.  An duine a fhoghlamaíonn dó féin an tslí chun meabhair a chinn agus achmire a lámh a chur ag obair lena leas féin agus le leas a theaghlaigh agus a mhuintire, is crediúint é dá mhuintir agus dá thír.  Agus aon teagasc nó oiliúint a chothaíonn spiorad an nea-spleachais agus a spreagann an duine le meas a bheith aige air féin agus ar a shaothar féin, is deaoideachas é.</P>
    <P>Tá mórán gnéithe eile den obair atá ionmholta go mór a bhfuil freastal á dhéanamh orthu faoi na scéimeanna gairmoideachais ar fud na tíre.  Gan na gairmscoileanna ní fada a raghadh an tionsclaíocht agus na monarchana atá á mbunú thall is i bhfus, thíos agus thuas, ar fud na tíre, sé sin dá mba ann dóibh ar chor ar bith gan na gairmscoileanna.  Is ag méadú i gcónaí a bheidh cúram na gcoistí.  Ag féachaint siar dúinn ar a fheabhas is chruthaigh na coistí, an lucht riaracháin <Col N="850" /> agus na múinteoirí i gcomhlíonadh a ndualgais do mhuintir na hÉireann go dtí seo, ní gá dhúinn bheith faoi imní ina leith sin faoin am atá le teacht. Tá an dubhshraith leagtha go daingean; ba mhór é an t-ualach a bheadh ró-throm le hiompar ag an dubhshraith chéanna sin.</P>

Dá gceapfainn go raibh aon mhaitheas inti do bhéinn ag cuir cuid de na ceisteanna céanna sin arís i mbliana.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anuraidh bhí ar mo chumas moladh do thabhairt don Aire&mdash;bíodh is go raibh morán clamhsán laistigh&mdash;<Col N="853" /> go raibh an obair ag dul ar aghaidh go maith, go raibh chomh-oibriú ceart idir é féin agus bainisteóiri agus daoine eile go raibh cumhacht agus taithí acu in obair oideachais.  Molaim an tAire i mbliana as ucht feabhsú ins na liúntaisí do mhúinteoirí áirithe.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh maith ar an Teastas Dhátheangach, agus mar sin de.  Bíodh sin mar atá, tá an tAire ag cuir roinnt &ldquo;paint&rdquo; ar na scoileanna. Is docha go bhfuil áiteanna eile ins an scéal agus gur gá mórán &ldquo;paint&rdquo; do chur orthu freisin.</P>
    <P>Tá mórán rudaí ag déanamh buartha dúinn inniu maidir le rudaí nár cuireadh i gceart tráth fadó. Deireann morán daoine go bhfuil lochta le fáil i ngnéithe eacnamaíochta, agus eile, toisc nár cuireadh obair áirithe ar siúl 20 nó 30 nó 40 bliain ó shoin agus is fíor é sin.  Pé rud atá ar siúl go mhaith anois, de thoradh na tuisceana atá againn ar chomh tábhachtach agus chomh riachtanach is atá sé, is dócha go bhfuil locht mór ar ár cúrsaí oideacais anois agus gur cóir dúinn aire a thabhairt don ghné sin den Roinn.</P>
    <P>Is fíor, mar a deireann an tAire, go bhfuil mórán ceisteanna gur féidir linn tagairt a dhéanamh dóibh go speisialta anseo.  Tugaim fé ndeara nach gcuirtear mórán ceisteanna ar an Aire Oideachais i rith na bliana. Luíonn sé go daingean orm go bhfuil mórán ceisteanna gur cóir aire a thabhairt dóibh ó mhí go mí gur cóir ceisteanna do chur futha ins an Dáil agus nach féidir feabhas a chur ar an scéal go dtí go ndéantar é sin.</P>
    <P>Do chuir mé ceist ar an Aire an lá fé dheireadh faoi cad a bhí beartaithe againn chun an chlár léinn do pháistí ó 12 bliana d'aois agus ós a chionn sin ins na scoileanna náisiúnta a ath-bhreithniú.</P>
    <P>D'fhiafraíos den Aire Oideachais an inseoidh sé an bhfuil beartaithe aige an clár teagaisc i gcóir páistí ó dhá bhliain déag suas sna scoileanna náisiúnta a bhreithniú agus, má tá, cé a dhéanfaidh an bhreithniú sin: cathain a thosófar air: agus cathain is dóigh leis a bheidh an tuarascáil ar fáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> Is é an freagra a fuaireas ná:</P>
    <P>Tá na cláir léinn ar fad do na ranganna go léir agus do na habhair go léir ins na bun-scoileanna fé bhreithniú ag an Roinn do reir a chéile.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, nílim tagaithe ar aon chomhairle chinnte fós fén rud ar fad.</P>
    <P>Do thuigfimis an t-Aire dá bhfreagródh sé i mBéarla: &ldquo;I did not come to any conclusion with regard to the general matter.&rdquo;  Taisbeánann sin gur maith an rud é a bheith dhá-theangach nuair a cuireann sé an &ldquo;general matter&rdquo; síos leis an rud ar fad.  Níl mé an deimhnitheach go dtuigim in aon cor cad é an rud é &ldquo;an rud ar fad.&rdquo; Is é seo an rud a thuigim. Cuireadh an Chomhairle Oideachais ar bun chun cúrsaí oideachais ins na bun scoileanna a bhreithniú suas go dtí 1922.  Deineadh é sin mar go raibh sé soléir go raibh tréimhse áirithe cúrsaí oideachais i gceist.  Ní raibh ann ach an tosach.  Tá an-mhoill ar fad maidir le tabhairt amach na tuarascála.  Annsan sar a raibh aon tuairim againn faoi cad a bhí le déanamh i dtaobh na tuarascála sin, h'iarradh ar an gComhairle Oideachais scéimeanna meán-oideachais agus clár na scoil sin a scrúdú; h-iarradh orthu é sin a dhéanamh san mbliain 1954.  Níl an tuarascáil againn fós.  Do ceapadh nach raibh ann ach cuid bheag den choras oideachais agus nuair a bheadh sin déanta go mbeadh an scéal réidh chun na ceisteanna fíorthábhachtacha a phlé.  Ach cad a bheadh ar siúl ins na scoileanna náisiúnta go ceann dhá bhliain déag?  Cad a bheadh dhá dhéanamh ins na ceard-scoileanna?  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil an-dhíobháil dhá déanamh toisc nach bhfuil an méad sin socair.  Ní féidir liom a rá go bhfuil an scéal chomh-fhábharach anois.  Is ceart ár n-aigne a dhíriú air sin.</P>
    <P>D'fhiafraíos den Aire le déanai maidir le litir a chuir an Cheard-Chomhairle amach:</P>
    <P>an inseoidh sé an ndeachaigh an Cheard-Chomhairle agus an Roinn Tionscail agus Tráchtála i gcomhairle leis sular cuireadh amach an litir i mí Márta, 1961, i dtaobh na buncháilíochta oideachais a bheidh <Col N="855" /> riachtanach, de réir chinneadh na Comhairle, d'ógánaigh a rachaidh le printíseacht céirde tar éis an chéad lá de Mheán Fómhair, 1963; agus an inseoidh sé cad ina thaobh go ndearnadh sa ghnó seo neamhshuim d'obair na scoileanna náisiúnta agus de scoláirí na scoileanna sin.</P>
    <P>Duirt an t-Aire nárbh eol dó go ndearnadh sa gnó sin neamhshuim d'obair na scoileanna náisiúnta ná de scoláirí na scoileanna sin.  Más fíor é sin, tá ceist mhór eile le freagairt againn.  Ní fheadar conus a thuigfeadh éinne cad é an saghas córais oideachais atá againn nó cad é an leanúnachas atá ann mar cuireadh litir amach i mí na Márta.  Ar aon chuma cuireadh amach i le h-aghaidh tuismitheoirí. Deirtear inti:</P>
    <P>Is é seo an rud atá tábhachtach faoi láthair.  Má tá páistí leat chun an séú rang sa bhunscoil a chríochniú an samhradh seo chugainn agus go bhfuil fút fostaíocht mar phrintísigh le ceirdeanna a lorg dóibh, ba chóir duit a dheimhniú go gcuirfear ar an rolla iad in am tráth le h-aghaidh na scoil-chúrsaí oiriúnacha i Meán Fómhair, 1961, ionas go mbeidh deis acu an bhuncháilíocht oideachais a ghnóthú atá ordaithe ag an gComhairle.</P>
    <P>Is iomdha rud atá sa litir de thuismitheoirí. Má tá páisti ag freastal ar na scoileanna náisiúnta ní mór dóibh na scoileanna sin a fhágaint nuair a bheidh siad san séú rang agus dul go dti an ceard-scoil nó an scoil idirmheánach&mdash;direach agus an séú rang dhá fhágaint acu.  Má deir an t-Aire nach bhfuil sé ag déanamh neamhshuim de scoileanna náisiúnta ní thuigim i mBéarla nó i nGaeilge é.</P>
    <P>Deir sé:</P>
    <P>...gur chéim fhíorthábhachtach a bheadh ann chun cúrsaí printíseachta a fheabhsú buncháilíocht oideachais mar a leanas a bheith riachtanach d'ógánaigh a bheidh ag dul le printíseacht i gceirdeanna tar éis an lú lá de Mheán Fómhair, 1963:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Pas in ábhair léinn áirithe sa Scrúdú Teastais do Ghairm-Chúrsaí <Col N="856" /> Lae (An Roinn Oideachais, Brainse an Ghairmoideachais) nó</P>
    <P>(b)  pás in ábhair áirithe sa Scrúdú don Mheanteistiméireacht (An Roinn Oideachais, Brainse an Mheánoideachais) nó</P>
    <P>(c)  cáilíocht oideachais éigin a mheasfaidh an Chomhairle a bheith ar aon dul le (a) nó (b).</P>
    <P>Chuireas ceist ar an Aire Tionscail agus Tráchtála i dtaobh an ruda agus dúirt sé nach raibh aon eolas ná cumhacht aige i dtaobh an scéil agus gur cheart scríobhadh chuig Cathaoirleach na Ceard-Chomhairle.  D'fhiafraíos de cén limistéir den tír ar bhain an litir leis.  Scriobh sé chugam agus dúirt gur bhain an litir leis an Stát ina iomláine agus le buachaillí atá chun an séu rang san bhunscoil a chríochnú an samhradh seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Deireann sé go gcaithfidh buachaill bheith ós cionn 15 bliana d'aois chun dul isteach mar phrintíseach.  Caithfidh tú dul siar go dtí Tuarascáil na Roinne Oideachais le haghaidh 1956-57 chun an t-eolas atá ag teastáil uait a fháil amach ós rud é gurab í sin an tuarascáil is déanaí atá againn agus a bhfuil na nithe seo cláraithe ann.</P>
    <P>When I look at page 79 of the Report of the Department of Education for the year 1956-57 I find that boys and girls are arranged according to each section.  We find when we turn to the sixth standard&mdash;the importance of this is that it gives us the figures for boys and girls&mdash;there were a certain number of boys, some of them under 11 years, some under 12, some under 13.  Of the boys over 13 but under 14 there were 9,500.  There were 17,242 boys in the sixth standard under 14 years of age and over 14 but under 15 there were only 2,152.  Over 15 but under 16 there were only 185 so that the boys the Ceard Comhairle are dealing with in this circular are normally in the sixth standard when they are under 14 years of age.  Then we see a circular sent out to parents warning them that in the future if their boys want to enter any of the principal trades they must get into a particular class in a technical school or a secondary school as soon as they have finished in the sixth standard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> There we are up against the question of what is the outlook on the work in the national schools in respect of boys over 12 years of age and particularly we are up against the question of what effect it is likely to have on the national schools when boys at 14 years of age are told they have to get out of the national schools if they are to have any chance of going in for apprenticeship courses.  That strikes me in relation to what the function of the national school is and I wonder if I would be committing a serious blunder if I asked the Council of Education to report on what the educational scheme should be for boys after the age of 12 and whether the effect of the situation on the national schools now is a depression in importance and outlook of the national schools.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that it was all a question of time.  Because of lack of proper timing all kinds of frustrations have been brought about in this country in the economic as well as the educational field.  I am talking about delays in facing up to things in the Department of Education and suggesting that these delays cause a very considerable amount of frustration not only in the educational scheme but for successive Ministers and for staffs of the Department.  A lot of the delays are not the fault of the Minister or of Departmental staffs.  They are brought about by a lack of a sense of tempo which undermines the outlook and consequently grants of financial assistance which are necessary are not available.</P>
    <P>I think we should not try to paint over the situation in so far as our people are concerned because they do not know at the moment, because of confusion, where the national school is leading to and where the various schemes of education come in.  This confusion has very serious effects on a number of people.  There must be a feeling among them that there is some kind of a gap in understanding of what is being done and what ought to be done and what will be done systematically in the national schools for boys and girls of 13, 14 and 15 years of age.  A number of people would be very irritated if they thought <Col N="858" /> that at 15 years of age a boy must leave the national school.  That situation is not clarified in the plan the Minister suggests&mdash;the plan he says they are considering in the Department. This is an important question which can only be discussed in the open.</P>
    <P>It involves various classes of teachers.  I should like to know whether the Minister proposes that the Council of Education or some other body&mdash;it might easily be a body that would take the place of the Council of Education&mdash;would examine the dovetailing of the higher standards of the national school with the lower classes in the secondary school and whatever is being done in the vocational schools by way of continuing education.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of it which is also very important.  In this morning's newspapers we had the first rattle of an inter-teachers' organisation row where representatives of the Vocational Teachers' Organisation come out into the open with all kinds of inflammatory reactions to something that was said by the I.N.T.O. in relation to what is implied in this circular.  Are we to have the whole system of education disturbed by a fight between the technical teachers on the one hand and the national teachers on the other as to whom the children belong?  I should like to know from the Minister what solution he has by way of clearing the air for the prevention of disputes and disagreements of this kind arising between vital sections of the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a very bad thing that it should appear at all and particularly that it should develop and I suggest that the reason for this is that there has been no systematic statement from the Ministry as to what exactly is finally and completely decided on the course up to 12 years of age in the national schools and on what course of instruction based on that it is intended to continue in the national schools.  Therefore I would ask the Minister what his plans are for outlining, in the same way as was outlined by the Council of Education, a scheme of instruction for national <Col N="859" /> schools up to 12 years.  I expect that the Council of Education has outlined a scheme of instruction for secondary schools and I would ask what is going to be done about a scheme of instruction in national schools.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether he accepts and fully approves of the circular issued by An Cheard-Chomhairle. Does he consider, looking at the personnel of An Cheard-Chomhairle, that it is a mistake that the only teaching represented on it is the technical side?  It has always been a tradition that the technical education side of things, from the way in which it was started and continued, was a kingdom in itself.  Particularly with the favourable position of the tecnical side in having public representatives associated with it in every part of the country and local rates behind it as financial strength, the tendency is for the emphasis on development and control to be on the technical side.  They have extended somewhat widely into the continuation side of education implying that the children coming to their classes required a brushing up in the courses they had got in the national schools.</P>
    <P>I think a situation where it is possible for a circular of this kind to be issued, without representatives of education bodies or teacher bodies other than the technical people on the council, is a great mistake because, the more there is general understanding of the reasons why decisions are taken, the easier it is to take correct decisions and to have those decisions understood.  I would ask the Minister to recognise that the Ceard-Chomhairle, the circumstances in which the circular was issued and the terms of the circular are things which require his attention as Minister for Education if his surrounds generally, which include managers, teachers and the parents of the country, are not to be considerably upset and destroyed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making certain changes which he feels will improve facilities for teachers to equip themselves <Col N="860" /> with a greater and better knowledge of the Irish language.  The Minister, I think, may be on the right lines, but I should like to ask him about the preparatory colleges which were closed down.  The college in Dingle, I understand, was handed over to the religious order that was managing the school already and in Galway I do not know to whom the college was transferred.  Do I understand it has been transferred also?</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister the conditions under which the schools were transferred.  Is it a condition that these schools will be carried on as A secondary schools? Are there any conditions as to whether both day pupils and boarders will be catered for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the transfer of these schools put specifically in those areas for language purposes there was a condition that they should be carried on as A schools?  Was there any condition that day pupils would be admitted?  I would ask the Minister whether he proposes to make an offer on travelling facilities or travelling allowances to be paid to day pupils <Col N="861" /> attending these schools who come from Irish speaking homes in the neighbourhood. He will appreciate that in most of the rural technical schools the practice has developed of paying travelling expenses for pupils under certain conditions while secondary schools have no such facilities or encouragement and there is a lack of equity in certain cases.  I would ask him whether with a view to encouraging children of the Irish speaking districts in which these schools are situated, he will offer a scheme of travelling allowances.  I suggest it would be an appropriate thing to do and would considerably help to encourage children in those areas to take advantage of secondary education there.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister, as I asked last year, to tell us, in so far as he is up against the working of schools, where is the Gaeltacht?  The Minister will be aware that when the last census was taken and the Gaeltacht Ministry was being set up, a special enumeration was made regarding the condition of the language in homes in these areas.  As the director of the Central Statistics Office made public in a paper recently, when the results of this census, taken in the normal way by the Garda, was checked in sample areas by inspectors of the Department of Education, the discrepancies were so great that the Central Statistics Office could not have its reputation tarnished by publishing the figures.  There may be something to be said for that but there is nothing to be said for a Minister for Education not knowing what kind of a district he is dealing with and not knowing where in the country those schools are that are really carrying out the work of education effectively through the medium of Irish and thus serving the districts that are Irish speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the general necessity for commonsense people interested in the continuance of the Irish language as a vernacular in the districts where it is traditionally preserved, there is every reason why the Minister for Education would be able to say: &ldquo;As far as we are concerned we can advise anybody who wants to know that the Irish language is living in this area.&rdquo;  I think <Col N="862" /> the Minister will have to be asked what the position is with regard to that and I feel he will understand that it is not merely inquiring in a general kind of way but that it is the constructive carrying out of a systematic inquiry in relation to a very important thing.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what has happened with regard to the research body which I understood was being set up on the advice of the Council of Education to see what was to be done to deal with the use of Irish in schools in the most effective way.  I would like to know on what lines that body has been looking into the matter and when we will have a report.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to ask the Minister what is the position in the city of Dublin in relation to parents who wish to have their children educated in the primary school through the medium of Irish.  The problem of parents of that kind is a very serious one and the story is a very long one.  The story is one that has been surrounded with frustrations from the very start when Scoil Colmcille and Scoil Mhuire were set up.  The parents, who were giving their children Irish at the fireside and who were sending their children to school with pre-school Irish, sought to get a pirmary school where they could be assured that children with pre-school Irish would get their education through the medium of Irish.  They were told that one school was as good as another and that there was nothing that could be done in any school in Irish that could not be done in another. There was not an acceptance of the position that children without Irish ought not to come to a school set up to give education through that medium. It was only when things got bad that it was agreed that a preparatory school be set up and that the children who had no Irish should go there.</P>
    <P>There were always serious difficulties and if anybody deserved a monument in the city of Dublin it was the parents who brought up their children speaking Irish at home and wished that they should get their education through the medium of Irish.  I have a feeling that the only monument of that kind they could get is being gradually bulldozed <Col N="863" /> out of the way.  I think it is only seven or eight years ago since there was some kind of a dream that a new school would be built to replace Scoil Mhuire.  There were all kinds of difficulties. The Department of Education wanted more room and wanted to remove the children from one part of the school to another.  I gather from some parents now that, far from anything being done to provide a suitable school to continue the work that has been so magnificently done in Scoil Mhuire, the situation is getting worse and worse.  The growth of the Department of Education, in order to deal with all the additional work it has to do, has resulted in these people being treated with a certain amount of Departmental misunderstanding and neglect.</P>
    <P>The Minister has seen what parents can do, even in recent years, in relation to the attempt to get an Irish speaking school in Rathfarnham. Something is being done to see that Miss Gavan Duffy's school will not be bulldozed out of the way.  Will the Minister take a personal interest in Scoil Mhuire, a school that has done remarkable work in facilitating parents who wished to have their children educated through the medium of Irish? Will he see that the work that was done in Scoil Mhuire since it was established will as well merit any reverence that might be given to the work done in Scoil Eanna, Scoil Íde or Cullenswood House?  If there is not an understanding of what has been done by these parents in Dublin and if there is not an understanding of what Scoil Mhuire means to the parents of today there is no use in hoping that a committee such as the committee considering what should be done for Irish will do anything or advise anybody.</P>
    <P>What can they do or know that has anything of the example in it of what has been done by these parents and the teachers in these schools?  There are something over 200 children in Scoil Mhuire at the moment.  I do not know the position in Scoil Colmcille and I would like to know what the position is there.  The main question is whether the Minister realises the intensity with <Col N="864" /> which large numbers of parents in the city of Dublin want their children to get their primary education through the medium of Irish and whether he will see that the example set by these people will be maintained in a building worthy of it.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there was a site in Marlborough Street on which it was thought that an appropriate school could be established.  There was also the thought that somewhere else on the North side such a school might be provided but it would be a very poor thing for some of us, looking back, to see a Garden of Remembrance established at the corner of Parnell Square if Scoil Mhuire not only continued but continued in a way that will make it shine as a monument to what parents, teachers and children were able to do in difficult days when it might be said we had more hope than many people now have.  The hope that establishes these things may flicker but it is not dying.  I ask the Minister to face up to the question of what new roads are going to be opened to the people in the city of Dublin who want to educate their children through the medium of Irish and for that purpose give them Irish by the fireside in their own homes.</P>
    <P>There are other problems in the educational world at present but I think the solution of many of them lies in the ordering and streamlining of mind in the Ministry of Education on the broad grounds of educational policy.  The Minister has been able to get a little more money than was available in the past.  I note that he gives a percentage&mdash;14 per cent. or something like that&mdash;as to what education costs out of the national income.  I do not think it would be profitable to make comparisons in regard to percentages but if some of the obscurities could be cleared up in the educational pathways that we want to set out for our people&mdash;it was thought that work of the Council of Education might lead to that result&mdash; it would be easy to get all the other things, any of those problems of finance or otherwise settled.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have some anxiety in regard to some of the questions <Col N="865" /> raised by the recent report arising on the question of payments, but I suggest that a very considerable amount of work has been done by the committees of conciliation and arbitration and that a further very considerable amount can be done on that basis &mdash;getting clear about the realities of teachers' work and qualifications and what is a reasonable plan of payment for them&mdash;but even that cannot be fully undertaken as you will not have sound grounds on which to discuss those things as long as we are in the obscure position that we do not know who is moulding the future or the work of the national schools.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should not simply say that he sees nothing that is being done by the Ceard Comhairle that ignores either the problems of the national teachers or the national schools themselves.  I do not think he can shut his eyes to the fact that they are bound to be affected by it, perhaps properly, but it would be disastrous if, while the schools are affected in some way, there is no clear mind as to what the function of the national school is for children from the age of 12 upwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard of any country is judged by the standard of education acquired by the people of that country.  Ireland was always famous for the standard of its education down the centuries.  It was widely known throughout the world as the Island of Saints and Scholars.  We have continued, to a great extent, to uphold that status and our representatives abroad have indeed upheld that very high tradition in the councils of the world.  In U.N.O. or wherever they go, they show that they are able to hold their own, that they are highly educated and that they represent an intellectual and intelligent race&mdash;the Irish people.</P>

    <P>That high standard has been acquired largely in the universities and the secondary schools.  In recent times, the technical schools have come a long way also in providing good training for their pupils but I think the weakest link in our educational system is the national school and that is where the <Col N="866" /> system should be strongest.  That weak link, I believe, is due to cramming Irish down the throats of little children who have no knowledge of the language in the home.  Unfortunately for those children, they are not accustomed to hearing Irish from their own parents and their first years at school are completely hampered by compulsory Irish which is, if you like, foreign to them.  It is a pity that is so but I believe those first years in school are largely wasted through the teaching not alone of the Irish language itself but through the teaching of other subjects through the medium of Irish also.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the Irish language I appreciate it and I should like to see it revived but I can see children leaving the national schools practically illiterate as a result of compulsory Irish in their tender years.  Too much of it at that age is very bad for the children.  They should get their first lessons in learning their tables in the English language.  They should get a good foundation in the English language because that is the language of 95 per cent. of the homes of this country.  We are only codding ourselves and ruining the education of the children and hampering them in the first six years of their school period. If children received a good foundation in the English language in the first few years of their school period they could be switched over to the Irish language. It is not too much for a young person to learn two languages provided it is taught at the proper time.  The proper time to teach a second language is when the child is of an age to appreciate the importance of that language which, in my view, would be at the age of 12 years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement in connection with a grant for the painting and decorating of schools.  It is essential that the schools be brightened up and made attractive for the children.  A nicely decorated school gives the children a good impression. They are happier in school when the place is neatly kept, clean and painted. Every encouragement should be given in that matter.</P>
    <P>We read a great deal in the Sunday papers recently about this flare up.  It <Col N="867" /> is a pity that such a very important organisation as the I.N.T.O. should be showing such rebellion.  It is not a good example for the children.  The teachers should give good example to the children.  Too many strikes will be the ruination of this country.  We cannot afford them.  The sooner commonsense prevails, the better.  We expect great commonsense from teachers who carry out the entire system of education. Teachers make a great impression on young minds and it is very important that that impression should be a good one.</P>
    <P>I understand that the school in Ballyvourney is being transferred to the Brothers of the De La Salle Order. I wish them the best of luck.  I hope the area will not be any the poorer as a result.</P>
    <P>There was an industrial school in my area that was closed down.  Mushrooms are now growing there.  I hope the same thing will not happen in the Ballyvourney school but that the good work will continue of training boys. Undoubtedly, education is very important.</P>
    <P>Vocational education is next in importance to primary education for the majority of people who remain in this country and seek a living here.  It is not necessary for a boy to be a brilliant student to be a good tradesman. I have known lads who were not so good at school who became excellent tradesmen and craftsmen.  I would not like that anything would be done to prevent that type of boy from developing his skill as a tradesman.  Technical education is of very great importance. When technical education was first started in this country, it was primarily for the purpose of helping pupils to make better use of their hands, to make them better tradesmen, to teach them to carry out handiwork at home, on their holdings, farms or shops.  In the course of time there has been a big swing away from that and we are leading to a form of education which will fit people for office jobs and emigration. The whole system of education is designed for the passing of examinations.  When the certificate <Col N="868" /> has been secured it is a question of a job or emigration.  Boys and girls must be educated if they are to get jobs and it is a good thing that they should be educated before they emigrate but we must not lose sight of the fact that the majority of the boys and girls who remain in the country require to be trained in the technical school in the art of making things by hand for the household, or in cookery and housewifery, which was the primary purpose of vocational education when it was started.  I should not like to see too great a departure from that purpose.</P>
    <P>The secondary schools and the universities can do their part in providing higher education for those who go into the Civil Service and the professions.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the way he has presented his Estimate and for the manner in which he has received the few complaints we have made to him.  He is an admirable Minister, very courteous and obliging.  He should make a good job of his position as Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>Sé an rud is mó a thaitn liom sa mhéid a dúirt an tAire ná an rud a dúirt sé nuair a bhí sé ag cur síos ar an méid airgid atá le caitheamh i mbliana, sé sin, gurb é an intinn atá aige féin faoi ná go mbeidh orainn leanúint fós de bheith ag cur leis an soláthar i gcomhair oideachais sula mbeimid i riocht a rá go bhfuil córas oideachais againn atá gar do bheith lán-sásúil.  Bhí a lán rudaí maithe a ndearna sé tagairt doibh, ach bhí rudaí eile nach ndúirt sé faic fúthu, cur i gcás an tuarascáil ar phá na múinteoirí de gach saghas. Bhíomar go léir ag súil go n-abródh sé rud éigin faoi sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is maith an rud é go bhfuil níos mó múinteoirí ann anois agus go bhfuil méadú freisin ar líon na bpáistí sna scoileanna.  Is maith liom a chloisteáil chomh maith ón Aire go bhfuil ar intinn aige an coibhneas idir scoláirí agus múinteoirí a laghdú.  Tá rud eigin á dhéanamh aige sna scoileanna a íoctar ar bhonn caipitíochta, 's é sin na scoileanna móra, ach ba cheart go ndéanfaí é i leith na scoileanna tuaithe. I dTuaisceart na hEireann 35 an líon <Col N="869" /> in aghaidh gach ranga sna bunscoileanna, 25 sna ceardscoileanna agus 20 sna meánscoileanna.  Ba mhaith liom dá mbeadh riail ann nach mbeadh níos mó ná 30 ag aon mhúinteoir ní i rang amháin ach ar fad; i scoileanna dhá oide b'fhéidir nach mbeadh ach 10 nó 12 i rang amháin ach dá mbeadh ceithre rang an duine acu b'fhéidir go mbeadh 50 páiste faoi mhúinteoir amháin.  Ba cheart laghdú ar an gcoibhneas sa chás sin.</P>
    <P>Speaking on this Estimate in other years I have always expressed the hope that I would see a common body of teachers but I am afraid that the report of those who dealt with the parity question struck a blow at that.  It is one of the worst things that has happened in a long time.  I thought the Minister would make some reference to that in his statement but he did not.  Primary teachers feel they are no longer regarded as teachers, that they have been belittled in that report; not alone that, but that the children whom they teach have been belittled and that neither they nor the children they teach are regarded as being in the same class as the teachers and children of vocational or secondary schools.  The acceptance of that report is something we very much regret and we hope it will not be acted upon.</P>
    <P>Instead of teachers discussing at their meetings problems of education they are back where they were years ago talking about salaries.  I do not want to go any further on that except to tell the Minister that never have the primary teachers felt so humiliated as when that report was accepted.  It takes from many of the good things which have been done over the past few years.  We hoped that a solution had been found for the problems about which we have been fighting for so many years but now we are back again almost where we started.</P>
    <P>I had expected, too, some reference by the Minister to scholarships, to the scheme which he said was being prepared to give more scholarships and more opportunities to the children of parents who cannot afford secondary education.  Unless I misread the <Col N="870" /> Minister's speech or did not hear him correctly, I do not think he made reference to that.  We had hoped he would have given us the scheme he had in mind.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I have spoken before on this Estimate is the integration of the various educational systems.  On a previous occasion the Minister said he considered there was integration.  I may not have made myself clear in what I said but I think there is not.  There is a gap between primary, vocational and secondary education, certainly between primary and vocational education.  To take an example, not mentioning the school where it occurred, out of a class of 18 in a vocational schools eight were successful in the certificate examination.  Of those eight, seven had gone as far as second year in the secondary school. It may seem that eight successes out of eighteen is a very poor result but the fault lies not with the teacher but in the fact that that teacher was dealing with children who had come from a primary school, perhaps having finished at 12 years of age.</P>
    <P>In my own county the rule is that a child who finishes sixth standard in the primary school at the age of 12 or 13, even without having done a primary certificate examination, is eligible for the vocational school. Along with those children from the primary school there may be children who have done perhaps two or three years at a secondary school.  The teacher is set the impossible task of trying to teach a class in which some children have completed only sixth standard in the primary school and in which others have done maybe two, three or four years in a secondary school.  There is a loss somewhere there.</P>
    <P>There should be some system whereby the child, after finishing his primary course, can do a couple of further years before going into the vocational school.  Then the classes would be more on a level with his educational standard and the teacher would have the opportunity of giving instruction which the children <Col N="871" /> would be able to absorb.  He would not be held back by those who are too far behind and he would not have to go too far ahead with those who are advanced.  The gap for the 12-year old finishing sixth standard and the child in the secondary school is too big for the teacher.  Until there is some solution of that problem, full advantage cannot be taken of vocational education by younger children.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the grant in respect of children of Irish-speaking families &mdash;I think Deputy Mulcahy mentioned something about that&mdash;I would ask the Minister to consider a county such as my county where groups of migrants in Land Commission holdings speak the Irish language as the language of the family.  They are entitled to that grant just the same as families in Gaeltacht areas.  We have several large colonies in my constituency.  I think they also are entitled to that grant.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that an arrangement has now been reached where posts of responsibility have been created in capitation schools.  Teachers in those schools can now become principal and will get an allowance of £60 for a single man and £75 for a married man.  It is a matter of one post out of four.  Certainly it is a move in the right direction.  All of the four teachers may have a lot of service but only one can be appointed to the post of responsibility.  I would ask the Minister to consider the grant of a long service increment to those teachers who will not attain the post of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The body of teachers to which I belong would also like to see inaugurated a scheme of vocational guidance to assist pupils in the selection of careers suited to their ability.  There is far too much aimless drifting of children when they leave school.  They have no idea of what they are fitted for or what they want to do.  Such a scheme would help them and could lessen such aimless drifting of children into occupations in which after a time they find they have no interest and in which they can make no progress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> I want the Minister to consider amending the regulation governing the payment of a death gratuity to the widow of a teacher so as to give the widow the option of accepting, instead of the gratuity, a pension calculated at some rate such as the rate for the serving teacher&mdash;one-eightieth of the salary of the deceased person multiplied by the number of years during which he taught.  It would not be an expensive thing.  The experience of the ills and mortality of members of our organisation shows that an average of 18 male teachers die each year leaving widows.  The maximum number of widows in any one year is about 350. The scheme would apply only to those of the future because existing widows would already have drawn their gratuity. I appeal to the Minister to give that point favourable consideration. I would ask the Minister, even if a report on the question of parity for teachers has been accepted, to act upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I came in here having sat in this House for about four hours during the discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Therefore I was not present when the Minister made his opening statement.  I have been glancing through it to see what the Estimate contains and I regret very much that I must speak impromptu, without any preparation whatsoever.  However, I think I can state as a preliminary to whatever I have to say that during his period of office the Minister has done some good in primary, secondary, vocational and university education.  Very many things still remain to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point in relation to primary education concerns the training of national teachers.  For the past 40 years almost the position was that trainees were put into a college or a school and cut off entirely from the public.  It was always a policy of the I.N.T.O.&mdash;the organisation to which I belonged before my retirement&mdash;that teachers should, after their secondary education, proceed to the university or at least be trained from among those who had graduated at the university.  I think <Col N="873" /> that is now more or less the policy of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>No matter what anyone says the foundation of education in this country is laid in the national schools. If it is not well laid there, secondary, vocational or university education cannot be a great success.  Therefore, it is very important that the primary teachers should be trained in such a way that they can develop the educational standard required for pupils in the primary school, develop their character and give them that broad outlook on life that can be given to young people to a certain extent and train them as good citizens of the State.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that because of the School Attendance Act the great majority of pupils leave the primary schools at the age of 14 years.  I would say that about 80 per cent. of the children of this country receive their education only in the national schools.  They cannot proceed further even though facilities for secondary and vocational education are now available in many towns and villages. It is, therefore, of the greatest importance that the national teachers should receive first of all, their education at a university.  Later on they should spend a couple of years at a training college where they will get experience of actual teaching.</P>
    <P>Children should not leave the national school until at least the age of 15 years or 16 years.  I suppose the Minister has no time to do that now but after the next general election I hope that whatever Government or Minister is in power will raise the school-leaving age to at least 16 years. It is most unfortunate that when our children leave school at 14 years they never make any attempt to study even though they would have vocational and secondary school education available in the towns and villages.  They do not even undertake self-instruction or study.  They could study history, geography and various other subjects that might be useful to them in life. If they were to read only newspapers and magazines that would be useful <Col N="874" /> to them, it would broaden their outlook on life and give them a knowledge of national and world affairs.</P>
    <P>The education of those people depends upon the prosperity of the State.  At an earlier period the people of this country were so fond of learning that our island became known as the island of saints and scholars.  That was the period of Ireland's Golden Age.  I do not know about the scholars or the saints but I am sure there are fewer saints now than then.  We cannot now call this the Golden Age although nearly everything you can think of in the form of facilities are available.</P>
    <P>If children were compulsorily required to attend the national schools until they were 15 or 16, they could then go to the vocational school in cases where they were unable to get secondary education.  The ideal solution for children who could not go on to the university would be for them to leave the national school at the age of 14, have secondary education for at least two years and vocational education for two further years until the age of 18.  But what is happening? When the majority of our children leave the national school, they go no further.  Their intentions then are to emigrate but whether our children remain in this country or emigrate they require education both secular and religious. During the time they would be in primary, vocational and secondary schools, not only should they be taught the secular subjects but they should also be given religious education.</P>
    <P>Many of our schools are in a bad condition.  I will admit that during all the time since native Government was established the various Governments have done their best to build new schools and reconstruct old ones.  It was a difficult task because when national schools were built during the English régime they were very primitive. The sites were unsuitable.  There were no sanitary arrangements whatever but now all the schools that have been built, whether primary or vocational, can compare very favourably with the schools in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>The school building programme is <Col N="875" /> making great headway.  We must admit this is a small, divided country but even with the resources at the disposal of the various Governments much good has been done.  We have been able to build new, up to date primary schools and certainly the vocational schools are far in advance of anything we have built by way of national schools.  I often wonder why the vocational schools are such expensive, modern structures by comparison with the national schools.  It also makes me wonder why it is that there is no financial provision made by the Department of Education for the erection of secondary schools throughout the country.</P>
    <P>That is why many of our secondary schools in towns and villages are more or less run by private enterprise.  A number of teachers with secondary education qualifications come together in those towns and villages, take over some old building and start up a school.  Surely if primary education can qualify for building grants, grants should also be made available for the erection of secondary schools.  I know the task is difficult.</P>
    <P>Our list of priority in education should be primary schools first, secondary schools second and then vocational schools and universities where the parents can afford them or where scholarships are available.  In a country like this, there should be a system of scholarships under which children of even the poorest parents would be enabled to proceed from the primary schools to secondary and university education whether their future permits them to live in this country or not.  So long as children and young men and women are well educated they will be a credit to Ireland wherever they go and they will be able to make a good living anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>In our primary schools we have what might be regarded as retarded children.  It is very difficult to make the necessary arrangements for the proper training of those children so that they can live useful lives later.  There is the really retarded child and what one <Col N="876" /> might call the backward child.  It is a problem that has often been discussed at teachers' congresses and meetings.  Some people have put forward the suggestion that retarded children in a school should be put together to form a class of their own. That is not so easy to do because it might require a special teacher.  Furthermore, unless a child is really mentally deficient it would not be well to put him aside like that because it would only cause mental embarrassment.</P>
    <P>On the other hand when you have to try to bring the mentally retarded children in a class along with the rest of the class you will find them falling behind the ordinary intelligent children and it becomes necessary to hold them in classes for a second or third year.  That also has a bad effect on the child's mind and so the problem becomes more difficult of solution.  I have found that many children, retarded intellectually, are very useful with their hands and that, if given a good vocational training, they become quite useful, indeed sometimes brilliant tradesmen.  Some of them become a credit to the schools from which they came.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset I was glad the Minister had decided to close down the preparatory colleges and that in future teachers will graduate from universities and will not be segregated from their fellows and from those with whom they will have contact later in their work.  This brings me to the question of the teaching of Irish.  It is rather remarkable that after forty years of native Government this question has not been properly solved.  Various excuses have been given in that connection.  In 1923 or 1924 a Primary Schools Programme Commission was set up, representative of primary, secondary and university teachers and professors and various other people like industrialists and agriculturists. Their job was to establish a programme for primary schools and they dealt particularly with this subject of the teaching of Irish in the national schools.</P>
    <P>Then when children, even from Galltacht areas where parents had no <Col N="877" /> knowledge of Irish, came into schools for the first time they were taught their subjects through the medium of Irish. One can easily understand the mental effect this had on the children.  Many of them had never a word of Irish till they came to school to hear the teacher speaking only in Irish.  Young children who had gone to school full of hope, though perhaps with a little reluctance, had the frustrating experience so young in life of being asked to learn everything through the medium of a language they did not understand.</P>
    <P>My references in this respect are to children coming from homes where no Irish is spoken.  Accordingly, while it could not be said that Irish was compulsory, still if teachers did not carry out the programme in the manner laid down, their reports would not be such as to enable them to advance to a standard of teaching regarded as sufficiently proficient to qualify them for such awards as the Carlisle and Blake premium.  However, there were many inspectors who in their wisdom understood the position and were rather lenient in their reports.  There were other inspectors at that time who certainly gave bad reports to the teacher unless he taught through the medium of Irish, in fact right up through the classes, even though the programme stated that this should be so only in the case where teachers had a thorough knowledge of Irish and the children could imbibe teaching through Irish.  Of course it was strictly carried out so many teachers suffered in increments and so forth.</P>
    <P>The position eased as time went on but still, so far as I know, that is the present programme.  I do know that the present Minister set up a commission to see what could be done to improve the teaching of Irish and by what system it could best be taught in primary, secondary and vocational schools and even in the university.  It is still a problem.  It has been always the policy of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation that children should be taught when they come to school through the medium of the language they best understand.  I am talking about the children in the Galltacht because of course in Fíor-Gaeltacht <Col N="878" /> areas where the home language is only Irish, children should be taught through Irish and teachers should be appointed who are native speakers of Irish to teach them.</P>
    <P>I do not think that very much advance has been made over the past 40 years to spread the Irish language. In fact, so far as I know&mdash;and I come from a Gaeltacht area or a BreacGhaeltacht&mdash;the language has certainly gone back during those 40 years and areas which were Fíor-Ghaeltacht 40 years ago are not now even Gaeltacht or Breac-Ghaeltacht, so there must be something wrong about the teaching of Irish.  I do know, of course, that emigration, and perhaps the advance of tourism into those areas which are really holiday resorts, have had an effect on the people.  They see people coming along well-dressed, with plenty of money to spend, with big motor cars touring around and they say: &ldquo;What are we doing?  What good has Irish done to us?&rdquo;  In spite of that there is no place as pleasant, no people as grand and as loving, as the real people of the Gaeltacht, the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, but I am afraid it is being wiped out.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Irish language can be improved and advanced and this made an Irish speaking country. That is the wish of all Irish people, real Irish people.  That is our hope but how can it be attained? Teachers in national schools have always done their best to advance Irish, but once the children leave school with whatever knowledge of Irish they have they never speak another word of it and they do not hear it at home.  It is taught in certain secondary schools and perhaps in the university to a certain extent, and after the passage of 750 years Irish is still the language in various parts of the country, but if you can restore it in 100 or in 200 years it will be good for the country.</P>
    <P>Some fanatics, some enthusiasts, think it should be restored in 20, 30, or 50 years, but that can never be.  The only way it could be restored is to teach it in the primary schools to the best of the teachers' ability and the best of the children's capacity to imbibe <Col N="879" /> it and then to have such a system that all our children could have some secondary education, even for two years, and teach Irish as a subject, the vocational schools the same and also the university.  That is the only way Irish could be restored within the next century.</P>
    <P>I did not mean to speak tonight after having been here all the evening and anything I have said has been impromptu, but after 43 years' experience as a national teacher with fairly good or excellent reports, doing my best to teach Irish and all subjects, I think I can say that compulsory attendance at national schools should be raised to 15 or 16 years where there is no opportunity of children attending secondary or vocational schools.  At the present time vocational schools are very far distant from many rural children.  There is a system by which transport could be subsidised by the Department, and it is done in certain cases, but you must have so many pupils from a particular <Col N="880" /> area in order that that subsidy should be granted.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether at this stage I should refer to the trouble in Ballina. I would prefer not to because I may regard it as <i>sub judice</i>, but I do hope that, for the sake of harmony between the Department and the teachers and the present system of school management, somebody will arbitrate and bring the parties together so that a satisfactory solution may be obtained. We teachers and all members of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation have always been quite satisfied with the system of management of the schools in this country.</P>
