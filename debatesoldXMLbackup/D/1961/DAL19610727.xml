    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I shall be allowed to discuss the section with Section 36.  As between the two of them, I pointed out last night that <Col N="2044" /> there seemed to be a tremendous concentration on the district court.  You have a situation in which the Chief Justice can interview a justice and can form an opinion that the conduct of the district justice was or was not such as to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  In addition, we have power under the Act of 1946 for the Minister to ask the Chief Justice to appoint a judge to inquire into the conduct of a district justice.</P>
      <P>In Section 36 we are appointing a new officer, the President of the District Court who is entitled to inquire into the matter, that is where anything prejudicial to the efficient discharge of the business of the court comes to his notice, the President of the District Court conducts an investigation. In addition, he can convene meetings to discuss matters in relation to the discharge of the business of the court, including, in particular, uniformity of jurisdiction in the general level of fines, and so on.  With all that, you have the District Court Rules Committee who are obliged under the Act to meet during the year to consider practical procedure of administration of the court and to advise the Minister as to what changes should be made in the law either in the practice of the administration of the court or in the law as administered by the courts.</P>
      <P>Is it necessary to have all this concentration of authority that may be brought to bear on a district justice? Up to date, there are only two methods of investigation in relation to district justices.  The whole court system could be brought under review by the Rules Committee established in 1936.  In addition to that, the Minister could ask the Chief Justice to appoint a member of the Bench to investigate the conduct or the capacity of a district justice.  Those two safeguarded the whole position.  When the judge was asked by the Chief Justice to report he made a report eventually to the Minister.  That was obviously a preliminary to having a resolution brought in or not brought in to dismiss a district justice for stated misbehaviour or incapacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole procedure could be regulated by the Rules Committee.  It was <Col N="2045" /> a very good Committee.  It included members of the district court, practising barristers and a certain number of practising solicitors.  The chief clerk for the Dublin district was <i>ex officio</i> secretary.  Therefore, prior to the proposal in this piece of legislation, one had power to investigate the conduct of a district justice, such conduct as might be thought likely to lead to his dismissal by vote of the two Houses. The whole practice of the administration of the court was brought under review under the 1936 Act by a good committee.  It seems to me we are overloading, going to excess of caution with regard to the District Court and the circumstances in which they find themselves cannot but lead to the view that they are being brought more and more under the control of the Executive and that is, of course, a matter that the whole system of administration of justice in this country has sought to avoid.</P>
    <P>We should not give these powers to the President of the District Court.  Or, if that officer is going to be appointed, build him into the Rules Committee, make him the controller of the Rules Committee, a person who will convene meetings and put upon him the obligation to report to the Minister for Justice from time to time as to what changes in the law are required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to outline, first of all, exactly what is being done with regard to district justices.  In the first instance, there is in existence, and we are not interfering with, the provisions of Section 21 of the 1946 Act by which the Chief Justice can appoint a judge to investigate the conduct of a particular district justice and to report to the Minister.  On the basis of that report the Minister would decide whether or not to come to the Oireachtas and move to have the district justice removed from office. That machinery is absolutely necessary. However, it is a procedure that would be invoked only in a very serious case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, it was felt there would be occasions when the Chief Justice, as head of the judiciary, could with advantage send for a district <Col N="2046" /> justice, point out to him some particular matter in which he was not acting as people thought he should&mdash;no more than that&mdash;merely explain to him that he was not exactly misbehaving but, perhaps, indulging in some form of conduct which did not, strictly speaking, amount to misbehaviour but was tending to bring the process of justice into disrepute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does that derive from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That derives by virtue, in this Bill, of Section 10 as amended by amendment 30.  Section 10 subsection (4) set out that the President of the High Court would have this function but on reflection it was decided that it was more appropriate to vest this function in the Chief Justice because he, traditionally, had it and we merely give it a statutory basis in Section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do you say he had it traditionally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it was traditionally implicit in the office of the Chief Justice that he could send for a member of the Judiciary and speak to him about his behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise by a statute, then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not by statute.  I said it could be regarded as being inherent in his office.  That is the new provision and, I think, a valuable one. It enables the Chief Justice to step in in a case where he might think things were going wrong and probably remedy them without a great deal of trouble or complications of any sort.</P>
      <P>The full statutory procedure envisaged under the 1946 Act is a very serious and formidable business and might not always be appropriate.  So, we have now provided this new way of dealing with that sort of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over and above all that, we are creating this office of President of the District Court.  The establishment of that office is clearly justified and the need for it can be very easily demonstrated. Indeed, my recollection of the <Col N="2047" /> debate on the Second Reading of this Bill is that the House generally welcomed the proposal to establish such an office.  The proposal arises from dissatisfaction which has been expressed from time to time regarding the way in which the business of the district court has been discharged in certain areas.  We hope the appointment of a President will enable disparties in decisions to be reduced, that, generally speaking, the level of fines and penalties will be co-ordinated and that the efficient running of the courts will be promoted generally.</P>
    <P>It is not criticising anybody to say that it is possible for the level of fines and penalties to get out of alignment in different parts of the country and the proposals we have here, which involve, as it were, discussions among district justices as to the circumstances and the sort of penalties which would be appropriate to particular types of offences, cannot, in my opinion, do anything but good.</P>
    <P>Numerous complaints have been made both inside this House and outside it that some district justices&mdash;I had better speak very carefully and very cautiously here because it is important that I should not ruffle anybody's feelings&mdash;but some district justices, unfortunately, are unpunctual in starting their courts, adjourn courts or cancel courts without sufficient reason.  This sort of thing inconveniences everybody.  It inconveniences people about whom we must mainly be worried, the litigants.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was quite adamant here last night that we must do what we can to protect the interests of people coming before the district court in a certain way.  Indeed, I think we should do that generally.  Solicitors who are busy men and have a very full programme to get through every day and barristers&mdash;all these people are seriously inconvenienced by this practice of either last-minute cancellations of sittings of courts or, alternatively, courts being started unpunctually.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett, who, incidentally, is from Cork and must be assumed to <Col N="2048" /> know the situation as it obtains in Cork, made a very reasonable contribution in this regard on the Second Stage when he said:</P>
    <P>I am very glad that at last the Minister is taking a strong hand in the matter of the behaviour of district justices.  More than one district justice in this country has shown complete disregard and disrespect for the people whom they are obliged to serve.  I can honestly say that these men brought the district court which is, generally speaking, of a high standard, into absolute disrepute....</P>
    <P>There is no attempt to persecute or to hound district justices in any way. We just want to ensure, so far as we can do so, that courts will be everything they should be and held at the time and in the places they should be held.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Parliamentary Secretary that it is customary to give the reference when he quotes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the reference.  I want to say also at this point that there are a number of district justices&mdash;and it is only right that this should be said&mdash;who have not missed a single court during the last few years.  Not one single sitting of their court did they miss, not one was adjourned and not one started unpunctually.  The general position is that the district court functions well and satisfactorily but we want to try to eliminate so far as we can discrepancies which arise and to which Deputies generally on both sides of the House have drawn attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Rule Making Committees would not be appropriate to do this job.  They have clearly defined functions to perform and they have nothing to do with the times of court sittings or the administration of justice in that way. Deputy McGilligan pointed out that these Rule Making Committees do not do the job that the statute set out for them.  Surely it is rather weak to argue that if they did not do the particular job they were given, we should ask them to do this job as well, a job <Col N="2049" /> for which they are not fitted at all and for which their very constitution would render them inappropriate? There is no question of cluttering up the situation with unnecessary institutions and provisions.</P>
    <P>We have three clear lines of action, all of them necessary and all of them will prove to be valuable.  We have the first case as I mentioned, the full scale procedure of removing the district justice, or any other judge for misbehaviour.  On a completely different level, we have this new provision of the Chief Justice speaking to a district justice, and then we have this proposal now to establish a President of the District Court on whom we will place the obligation to see that the machinery of the district court works as well as it possibly can, that the business is allocated properly and that the courts sit when they should, at the times and in the places stipulated, and that there will be a minimum of inconvenience for litigants, solicitors, barristers and all others who have access to these district courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point made by Deputy McGilligan is a good one. that you can excessively multiply safeguards up to the point where a body of responsible men begin to feel a policy of harassment has been embarked upon.  We have at present the rare power of the Chief Justice to appoint a judge to inquire into the conduct of a district justice and, if the report be adverse and sufficiently grave, the Government can through the Oireachtas remove the district justice.  We have then what we describe as the procedure whereby the Chief Justice is now given statutory power to admonish a justice on the grounds that he is forgetting himself in court and will have to pull up his socks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have agreed to the appointment of a President of the District Court and it is proposed that he will have power to inquire into any case where he feels that the district justice is guilty of conduct prejudicial to the prompt and efficient discharge of the court's business. That covers the case where a district justice is not holding his court regularly and properly.  Now we are <Col N="2050" /> creating by statute two new proceedings. The Parliamentary Secretary maintains that one of them existed inherently in the office of the Chief Justice all the time.  I suppose that is a matter about which there could be argument.  In any case, we now give statutory effect to two new procedures and appoint a judicial person for the purpose of administration.</P>
    <P>Is it necessary, in addition to that, to take the very grave step of conferring upon the new judicial person, the President of the district court, power to summon all the district justices of the country together twice a year under the conditions set out in paragraph (c) of subsection (2) for the purpose of securing that all the district justices will agree to a standardisation of fines and other penalties to be imposed in their several courts?  I think that in that we are probably going too far.  We are going to a point of suggesting to the district justices that the Oireachtas looks upon them as an inferior type of judge.  I think we are allowing ourselves to be influenced by some analogous procedure that obtains in Great Britain in respect of justices of the peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but are we discussing Section 35 and Section 36 together, because there are amendments to Section 36?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was proposed and accepted that we would discuss the framework of the sections before going on to the amendments but reference to the amendments could be brought in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would anything be lost if we decided on Section 35 and discussed the matter on Section 36?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was suggested that Section 35 dealt with the appointment of a particular official and and Section 36 dealt with his power and that naturally one would have a different view on the appointment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is to bring the President of the District Court into the Rules Committee so that he will become the convener of the meetings but my objection to the President's appointment is weakened to a large extent if that happens.  If the President is to have the power in Section 36, I should like to tackle this radically and to object to the appointment of any such person.  That is on Section 35.  It was understood we were having a debate on Section 35 and Section 36 in order that the matter can be unravelled afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point in regard to the fourth safeguard, that we are apparently allowing ourselves to be influenced by some kind of parallel in Great Britain in respect of justices of the peace.  I think there is a fundamental distinction.  We had the system of justices of the peace in this country who were all public-spirited citizens who consented to sit on the bench but who were largely persons with no legal training at all. One can readily understand that a situation could arise that where you had a large number of justices and people administering justice, wide discrepancies might creep in.  In Great Britain the fact was notorious that in certain areas where there were game rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I give the Deputy the reference he was seeking? It is Volume 187, No. 8, column 1100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much obliged.  It was notorious that in this situation you might get in a countryside carefully preserved for game, the most extravagant penalties being imposed in insignificant breaches of game laws where, under exactly similar conditions in another area in Great Britain, there might be purely nominal penalties.  I am only giving that as one instance of many wide divergencies that arose where you had a lay person administering <Col N="2052" /> the law.  We have not that system in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Every district justice here is a barrister of ten years standing, or a practising solicitor, and in that sense, they are much more truly judges than lay justices of the peace.  I think it is inherent in our legal system that you must leave the imposition of the penalty to the discretion of the presiding judge.  We provide by statute what the maximum penalty attaching to every offence shall be, and it is open to the judge, whether it be in accord with a summary jurisdiction or in a High Court action, to hear the evidence, and when a factual decision is taken on whether the man is guilty or innocent, then to impose the penalty within the maximum fixed by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Every person who is sentenced has the right of appeal.  He has the right of appeal against his sentence, apart from his right of appeal on the issue of guilt or innocence.  If there is any extravagant abuse, or if there is any grave aberration of judgment, there is the superior court to set that right.  That is true not only of the district court, but of the Central Criminal Court and the circuit criminal court.  Any man can go to the Court of Criminal Appeal and ask to have his sentence reduced, even if a judge of a superior court has sentenced him.</P>
      <P>I do not feel that we have here any problem in regard to this matter, certainly not one of sufficient gravity to require legislative interference.  I can fully understand a situation in which the penalties in a case of summary jurisdiction can, with perfect propriety, vary very widely.  I can imagine that in one area in Ireland assaults on the Garda might become so serious a problem that severe sentences would be necessary in order to arrest that tendency in an area where it had become a grave abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down the country there might be a fellow who would get drunk and become so mad that he would misbehave to the extent of hitting a Garda.  He would possibly be taken to the Garda station under heavy <Col N="2053" /> escort because his judgment was hopelessly deranged by drink.  It would be most unsatisfactory if, subsequent to a meeting of the kind envisaged here, a justice felt compelled to provide in such a case a sentence uniform with the kind of sentence imposed for that offence in another area.  I can well imagine the Garda superintendent rising to give evidence on his behalf and saying that he was a most respectable person but that he was made so insane by drink that he misbehaved very badly, hit the Garda and had to be charged.</P>
    <P>I would not be a bit shocked in that case if he got a suspensory sentence and a fine of £10, but I would be gravely shocked if a Garda were assaulted in the city of Dublin, Cork or Limerick and the district justice did not send him, on conviction, to jail. I feel that in the cities those cases are a serious menace, whereas the case in the country is isolated.  Does anyone here feel that disparity of penalty between one district court and another in Ireland constitutes a serious public evil?  I use the words &ldquo;serious public evil&rdquo; deliberately.  I have heard no suggestion that that is so.  I have heard on occasion that a certain district justice has an edge on people who do not have lamps on their bicycles and imposes what seem to be unreasonable penalties.  That is simply a matter of a fine of £1 or a fine of 1/-.</P>
    <P>I was exasperated on occasion when I was Minister in charge of the Fisheries Branch.  I would successfully prosecute some fellow and I would find that the district justice fined him a half-crown.  You are the Executive at the moment, and you are beginning to think you have the right not only to convict the offender but to prescribe the penalty.  That is a traditional temptation of an Executive. My earnest desire was to protect our fisheries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>All power corrupts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And you have to watch that carefully.  As I say, it is very exasperating when the Executive knows how difficult it is to prove a certain <Col N="2054" /> offence of that kind, and when you have succeeded in proving it, the courts do not seem to act effectively. If that becomes a sufficiently grave abuse&mdash;and it would want to become a terribly grave abuse&mdash;you can come to the Oireachtas and seek a mandatory penalty.  That is a course from which I recoil with the utmost horror, but I used it myself once.  I came to the Oireachtas and got a mandatory penalty in respect of foreign trawlers fishing in our waters.  I knew I could satisfy the Oireachtas that the only way of deterring them was to seize their gear.  It was a mandatory power which did not involve any interference with the freedom of the subject.  It was power simply to seize their catch and their gear.  There were district justices who were always prepared to listen to a sad story and give back the catch and the gear to the fishermen who had fished in our territorial waters; whereas it was perfectly clear that you could never stop them at all if you did not take their catch and their gear because the value is so high.</P>
      <P>I mention that because I thought it had become so formidable a problem for the Executive in the enforcement of the law that I was justified in coming to the Oireachtas, explaining the difficulty and saying: &ldquo;I want the mandatory penalty that the gear and the catch will be taken.&rdquo;  I do not think it would be suitable for the Executive to approach the President of the District Court and say: &ldquo;Would you kindly tell all the district justices that they must confiscate the gear and the catch of any trawler owner who is convicted before them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that this proposal to convene these meetings bi-annually, which every justice shall attend unless he is unable to do so, owing to illness or other unavoidable cause, might well be dropped.  I think it is a provision which is grossly offensive to the district justices who are on the bench.  I do not believe in the long run, even after these meetings are held, that it would be possible to secure, through this device, absolute uniformity under this Bill which states that after the meetings have been held, after all the district <Col N="2055" /> justices have attended, and after they have consulted, they must conform to the general level of the penalties with which presumably they will be expected to agree.</P>
    <P>We are asked to take away the essential discretion which a judge ought to have.  Surely the House does not propose to withdraw from a justice his duty and obligations to deal with each case that comes before him on its merits?  If we are resolved that the right and duty of a justice should not be abridged, what is the purpose of subsection (3) of Section 36?  I think if that proposal were dropped, we are then left with the major procedure of the Chief Justice appointing a judge to inquire, leading up to subsequent action by the Oireachtas; the second in which the Chief Justice can admonish; and the third in which the new officer can admonish a district justice if his conduct is prejudicial to the prompt and efficient discharge of the business of the court.  In the last case, the President of the District Court may, if he gets a dusty answer, report the matter to the Minister for future action.</P>
    <P>By the same token, I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary could tell me what is envisaged consequent to action under subsection (2) paragraph (a).  It says that the President of the District Court shall inquire into the matter and may report the result of that inquiry to the Minister.  What happens then?  Is there any provision for what is supposed to happen?  If there is, I cannot find it.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if we leave these three remedies to the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, then the annual conference is unnecessary and calculated to affront the body of the district justices and to cause irritation and dissatisfaction amongst the very best of the district justices, whereas it is, in fact, ineffective to secure from the less experienced men that degree of uniformity which it is thought desirable to evoke but which, in my judgment, is not as essential under our system as it could well be argued that it is under a system of summary jurisdiction administered <Col N="2056" /> by lay justices such as Justices of the Peace in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon asked <Col N="2057" /> if we could visualise a situation where there would be a disparity between the level of penalties throughout the country. Of course, we can.  I fully agree that in certain circumstances penalties in a particular area at a certain time would be different, and that is exactly why we use the word &ldquo;undue&rdquo; in the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing here about &ldquo;unduly&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 64 which will be proposed mentions &ldquo;the avoidance of undue divergences&rdquo;.  It is exactly for that reason that we now propose to use that form of wording, for exactly the sort of situation Deputy Dillon envisages.  There is nothing inconsistent in what we propose and what Deputy Dillon says in that regard.  Indeed, I could visualise a situation being exactly the opposite to what Deputy Dillon suggests.</P>
      <P>The present position might lead to difficulties.  You might have an area in the south of Ireland, for example, where a particularly serious situation obtained and where a district justice was endeavouring to deal with it in a certain way.  A fellow district justice in some other part of the country, reading of the penalties that this district justice was awarding and not knowing the reason why his colleague was consistently imposing these penalties, might say that he would have to follow suit.  He would feel inclined to follow suit, whereas the conditions in his part of the country might be completely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conference would do a great deal to improve that situation.  The two district justices will be meeting informally. The second district justice will approach his colleague and say: &ldquo;I notice that in such and such a type of case, you are imposing a certain type of penalty.  It seems to me to be a bit unwarranted.  Perhaps there is some reason for doing it.&rdquo;  They would discuss the situation and find out what the truth of the situation was.  Nothing but good could come out of that situation.  I do not at all envisage that these proposals would do any more than avoid undue disparities, with a <Col N="2058" /> very real emphasis on the word &ldquo;undue&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also asked if any Deputies thought there could be a serious public evil resulting from the disparity of penalties in different parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be going a bit too far to say there is, but there could be.  We know it is important that not alone should justice be done, but that it should appear to be done.  If the general public read and hear that in one part of the country a certain penalty is being consistently imposed for a certain offence and in another part of the country a different penalty is consistently imposed and somewhere else a different penalty again, surely that can have a very serious effect on the respect in which the law should be held in the eyes of the public?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is happening in certain instances.  I maintain it has happened and we must guard against any increase in that regard.  It could tend to bring the whole process of the law into disrespect in the eyes of the public.  That is something we must carefully guard against and see to it, as far as we possibly can, that the people have confidence in the courts, have respect for the process of justice and sincerely believe that everybody is equal before the law and that justice is administered in the different parts of the country in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not feel there is an obligation on him to give us, without mentioning names, some instances of this widespread disparity that has caused public malaise?  I must say I have never heard of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could give a number of examples, but one of the clearest examples in recent times was the situation that arose in respect of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, where you had in certain parts of the country district justices imposing, shall we say, adequate penalties for breaches of the <Col N="2059" /> licensing laws and in other parts of the country district justices imposing nominal and ridiculous fines of a shilling, a penny and so on.  The one thing everybody in this House agreed on when the Bill was going through the Oireachtas, as far as I remember, was that when it became law, it should be enforced and should become a reality. Then we had that sort of situation developing.  However, I do not say that is in any way the basis of what we are doing here, but when the Leader of the Opposition asked me to give an example, that is what came most readily to mind.</P>
      <P>There is absolutely no question, suggestion or hint of any sort that we are removing from a district justice or from any judge in this country his capacity to take his individual judicial decision on any case that comes before him.  I would be horrified to think that anybody from this side of the House should make such a proposal.  No such proposal is intended or contemplated in any way.  The whole basis of the courts is that such individual jurisdiction is made mandatory on a district justice. We are only concerned to see that district justices get an opportunity of meeting each other, comparing notes and comparing experiences.  We hope there will emerge a general uniformity in the administration of justice throughout the country.  That is a laudable objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, it is absolutely and abundantly clear that any district justice, even after participating in a conference, talking to his colleagues and coming to the conclusion that it was appropriate that a certain level of penalty should be imposed in a certain type of case, can go back to his home district, find that the first case to come before him is a case of that sort but that there are very mitigating circumstances.  Even though he has more or less come to a decision that in present social circumstances such and such a level of penalty would be appropriate, nevertheless he will exercise his individual jurisdiction and in any particular case may consider reducing the penalty or, <Col N="2060" /> indeed, even increasing it, depending on the particular circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that these discussions he will have with his colleagues will not be of the utmost value. A district justice doing his job well, or indeed any justice doing his job well, will be reading text books and law journals and keeping in touch with what is happening throughout the country and, indeed, in other countries. I know they do.  This is merely an extension of that same practice.  Just as he would read a law journal, where he would get the views of his fellow justices and practitioners on various current topics, in the same way in these conferences he will get the informal views of his fellow district justices on the current situation.</P>
    <P>We have been concerned in an earlier part of this Bill with the inconvenience that arises to practitioners and litigants because cases are suddenly and at the last moment transferred from the circuit criminal court to the Central Criminal Court.  I think we are all agreed that we should do something about that situation.  If that is so, surely the case for doing something in respect of the district court is even more overwhelming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot remember being concerned at all about the inconvenience of transferring people from the circuit criminal court.  My plea was that the right of the defendant to be transferred should be safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt at one time that there was unanimity on that point. Deputy Dillon may have been absent. I felt that the consensus of opinion was that it was very undesirable to have counsel, solicitors and witnesses brought along to the circuit court for a particular trial and to suddenly find that it was transferred to the Central Criminal Court.  I admit Deputy Dillon was concerned with the other aspect.  I think we are all agreed that if we could do anything to avoid it, we should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can we contemplate with equanimity a situation where one particular district justice over a period <Col N="2061" />&mdash;and of this we have had an example &mdash;failed to hold 32 per cent. of the appointed sittings in his district?  We are here concerned with the district court.  These are the courts to which our people in the main have recourse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it is part of the function of the new President of the District Court to watch that sort of situation and to endeavour to see to it that courts are held when they should be held, that the sittings are on time, and so on.  If there is a consistent refusal by a district justice to do that, then we have the appropriate measures to be taken.  As I say, the district court is the court of the utmost importance to our people.  It is for that reason we are making these provisions, not because we regard district justices to be inferior in any way to anybody. In fact, our view is exactly the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill we are clearly defining the members on the bench of the district court as judges&mdash;&ldquo;such number of other judges&rdquo;.  That is full recognition of the fact that they are judges in every sense of the word.  But because their courts deal with this vast volume of business&mdash;25,000 cases a year&mdash;we <Col N="2062" /> feel that, in the case of their courts, and without any regard to their personalities or individual competence, but purely from the point of view of the machinery of the courts, it is appropriate that we should establish this piece of machinery to ensure that due regard is had to the difficulties that confront a great number of people in the district courts.  There is no question, as I say, of reflecting in any way on their competence, but merely a genuine desire to ensure that the courts function efficiently and well and, secondly, that justice, as far as it can be humanly administered, is administered in consistent fashion all over the country.</P>
    <P>I was asked under subsection (2) (a) what happens when the President of the District Court reports to the Minister. The following may happen: first of all, the Minister may have had a complaint from somebody.  Complaints are all the time coming into the Department of Justice; under this machinery he will now have the facts on which to decide; he may decide to ignore the complaint as having no substance, or he can decide on the basis of the report submitted to him by the President of the District Court that the situation is serious enough for him to ask the Chief Justice to interview the district justice concerned under the admonitory provisions of Section 10. The report may disclose that the case is a serious one calling for the full statutory procedure under the 1946 Act.  The foundation for the provision is that the Minister will in future have the facts judicially ascertained and there will be no question of hearsay, no question of vague accusation, or anything of that nature.  He will have clear-cut and precise machinery for ascertaining the validity of complaints and he will then be in a position to decide what course of action he should pursue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say one last word on my own behalf?  Whatever provisions are brought in to secure the more efficient administration of these courts of summary jurisdiction, I think it is very important to secure the goodwill of the officers of these courts.  I think <Col N="2063" /> the provisions contained in subsection (3) are gravely offensive to many of the most responsible justices of these courts.  I do not think we will get any benefit proportionate to the resentment this subsection will create.  I believe the prospects of the office of President of the District Court functioning smoothly would be vastly improved if subsection (3) were dropped.  I think subsection (3) is itself inherently unsound and I would urge strongly on the Parliamentary Secretary that subsection (3) be dropped.</P>
      <P>If it should prove at any future time that a grave public abuse exists arising from the disparity of sentences, the Minister for Justice can always come back and look for powers to deal with that specific situation.  I want to say quite deliberately&mdash;I have not been behindhand in informing the Minister for Justice where I thought there was anything amiss&mdash;that I have no knowledge of any grave public evil in our society arising from disparity of sentences.  I think it is a dangerous thing casually to interfere with the discretion of justices as, I am bound to say, I think subsection (3) undoubtedly does.  I am convinced this will create a great deal of difficulty and resentment in quarters for which we ought all of us to have respect, and I urge most strenuously on the Parliamentary Secretary, in the cause of better administration in our courts of summary jurisdiction, to drop subsection (3).  If that is done, then I would be prepared to take a chance on the remaining provisions in the Bill.</P>

      <P>If these meetings are to have any value they must be made to function properly.  I am offering this machinery to the district court justices in the hope that it will be of use and value and help to them.  If we set it up we must do the job properly and make sure the President of the District Court will have the necessary authority to bring the conference together and see it is as fully attended as possible, giving a right of absence to those district justices who are unable to attend the meeting for some unavoidable reason, such as illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making was that the President of the District Court is not directed to convene meetings. We merely give him permission. Subsection (3) says the President may convene meetings, and then subsection <Col N="2065" /> (b) says that meetings shall not be convened more frequently than twice a year.  It remains open to the President not to convene any meeting if he does not think it is necessary.  For that reason I feel the whole provision is not strictly speaking mandatory at all, but simply gives a statutory right to the President of the District Court to convene such a meeting if he feels it necessary to do so.  Having given him the right to do so, I think we are right in restricting the number of times at which he may convene meetings.</P>
      <P>Further, in the interests of general co-operation, it is right that we should say that, if the President of the District Court does convene such a meeting, every justice shall attend it if he can.  We do not want to make these meetings purely voluntary and unofficial and something which would attract no respect amongst the justices of the district court itself.  I think we are dealing with it in a very reasonable way and I would hope that the members of the Opposition who have expressed some doubt would re-read subparagraph (3) with particular reference to the first line in which it is very clearly stated that the President of the District Court &ldquo;may&rdquo; convene. It is not &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>

I do not see why they should not be allowed to continue as they are.  We should get away from this school-master approach of saying that if the President requires it each district justice must attend unless he can produce an excuse.  That is reducing mature people who have experience of a particular line of work to schoolboy level.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, this is mandatory as far as the district justice is concerned when the President moves in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> I wish to refer to the Second Reading speech made by the Minister for Justice.  First, he said he was concerned at the failure of some justices to preserve reasonable standards of time-keeping and regularity in holding their courts.  Secondly, he referred to the question of uniformity, how to secure uniformity in respect of the practice of justices in the administration of justice and the standards to be adopted in fixing penalties.</P>
    <P>At Column 1062 of the Dáil Debates of 22nd March, 1961, the Minister for Justice is reported as having said:</P>
    <P>I have confirmed that over the past few years there were particular justices who showed an unusually high proportioon of courts not held. In one case the proportion was as high as 32%.  I consider I would be failing in my duty to the public and to all the justices whose conduct in this respect is beyond reproach if I did not bring to the notice of justices my concern at the failure of some of them to observe reasonable standards of timekeeping and regularity in holding their courts.</P>
    <P>I have in fact done this.</P>
    <P>He approached the justice concerned. He continued:</P>
    <P>but I would have preferred to have been able to utilise the machinery now being provided&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say, he would bring the facts to the notice of the President of the District Court.  It would then be a matter for the President to take the necessary action either informally or in the manner provided for in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of Section 36.  The situation is no so rigid as people here represent. I know in my own time there was an approach made to a certain district justice and it had good results.  The Minister for Justice says here it was done in a certain case, and what was done once can be done again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying others could not do it.</P>
      <P>.... the President of the District Court who is being charged with the duty of ensuring the prompt and efficient discharge of the business of the court.  It would be a matter for the President then to take the necessary action, either informally&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>or as provided in Section 36.  The Minister then goes on to say:</P>
      <P>.... it is in relation to only a small minority of justices that complaints about unpunctuality and cancellations of the appointed courts are made, but, of course, the actions of that minority do disproportionate damage to the good reputation of justices as a body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2069" /> As regards the small number of people not attending to their duties, there has been established a precedent, lasting over a number of years, that the Minister for Justice has approached the justice and drawn his attention to the fact that he is not holding the courts in the proper manner.  That was the single point, as far as my reading of the debates goes, on which Deputy Barrett from this side of the House accepted the provisions of the Bill.  The general tenure of the debate on that point seemed to be that the district justices would not bother their heads what the President said or what their colleagues would say.</P>
    <P>The next point the Minister made at Column 1062 was:</P>
    <P>Equally as important as the President's powers of inquiry will be those for securing as far as practicable general uniformity of practice and procedure in the administration of justice and the standards to be adopted in fixing the amount of penalties.  The Bill authorises him to convene meetings of justices periodically to discuss matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to meet the point put by Deputy Dillon in a question across the House today in regard to serious public disquiet in connection with these matters such as lack of uniformity in regard to fixing the amount of penalties.  The answer given today and the example given was the penalties under the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  I have some experience of this matter over quite a number of years.  I do not remember any cases being brought to my notice in respect of a divergence in the amount of fines in respect of the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  There was a general attitude among justices that being found on a licensed premises after hours was not a very serious offence and they did not impose any serious penalties.  It was not that there were one or two justices who fined heavily or alternatively, one or two who fined lightly.  There is a uniformity of practice that makes these penalties very light.  I do not know, and I doubt if any examples can be given, of this <Col N="2070" /> great disparity in connection with the provisions of the Intoxicating liquor code.  The Minister gave completely different examples.  Again, I am quoting from Column 1062:</P>
    <P>Some time ago, there was evidence of public disquiet&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is the height of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;at what appeared to be a serious lack of uniformity between district justices in dealing with habitual offenders, notably in what seemed to be the over-use of the Probation of Offenders Act.</P>
    <P>That is the precise phrase.  That is a point I myself did take up&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Court of Criminal Appeal also drew attention to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is referring here entirely to district justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Court of Criminal Appeal drew attention in December, 1959, to the over-use of the Probation Act by district justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they did, they followed my footsteps a bit earlier.  It was in the district court with regard to the Probation of Offenders Act.  There was undoubtedly in a particular court an over-use of the Probation of Offenders Act.  That, again, was dealt with.  It was not a question of making a report to any of the higher judges. The matter cropped up in a rather casual conversational way.</P>
      <P>The next thing I knew was that I was advised there would probably be an improvement in the attitude in our district courts in this matter and so there was.  The Minister spoke about the over-use of the Probation of Offenders Act.  That was the one point on which he said there was evidence of public disquiet at what appeared to be a serious lack of uniformity in dealing with habitual offenders.  Why that phrase was brought in, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The over-use of the Probation of Offenders Act, to which my notice was drawn, certainly was not in connection <Col N="2071" /> with habitual offenders any more than with others.  That is the only basis on which it is put.  Still at Column 1062, we read:</P>
    <P>When I investigated the matter I was made very conscious of the difficulties of bringing to the notice of justices generally the bad effect of the standing of the court brought about by lack of uniformity.  I found that there was no machinery available. Now, under the provisions of subsection (3) of Section 36 the justices will be able to discuss these matters among themselves.</P>
    <P>Then, at Column 1063, we read:</P>
    <P>There is no question of interfering with the freedom of individual justices to award the penalties they consider appropriate to the particular circumstances of each case; but the justices will have the benefit of the views and experience of other justices at these discussions and can, if they wish, take them into account when exercising their jurisdiction subsequently.</P>
    <P>The Minister then said he had been advised the section was not in any way contrary to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>With regard to &ldquo;machinery,&rdquo; I do not understand the phrase &ldquo;machinery to bring to the notice of the justices the bad effect created by lack of uniformity.&rdquo; There is the District Court Rules Committee.  It is a committee of seven people.  There are two <i>ex officio</i> members.  One is a justice of the district court here in Dublin, or else particularly defined, and the other is the district court clerk for the county borough of Dublin.  There are two <i>ex officio</i> members here and the President of the District Court could easily take over the chairmanship.  With him, there are five other people, two <i>ex officio</i> and seven nominated.</P>
    <P>Of the seven nominated people, four are district justices nominated by the Minister.  One other nominated member shall be a practising barrister nominated by the Council of the Bar of Saorstát Éireann and two others shall be practising solicitors nominated by the Council of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.  That is a good <Col N="2072" /> committee&mdash;five Justices, one district court clerk, two members of the solicitors' profession and one member of the Bar.  The Secretary of each of the several committees is told to summon a meeting of such committee once at least in every year on such day as may be fixed by the chairman.  The purpose is the general consideration by such committee of the practice, procedure and administration of the court in relation to which such committee is constituted and the law affecting or administered by such court.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of Section 75 provides that the committee is to report to the Minister whether any, and if so what, amendments or alterations should, in the opinion of such committee, be made in the practice, procedure or administration of the court in relation to which such committee is constituted or in the law affecting or administered by such court with a view to the improvement of the administration of justice.  Great power is given there.  The Minister, remember, has four nominees on that committee, all members of the district court group.  The committee are to meet any time the secretary summons them.  He must summon them at least once a year and he is supposed to report at least once a year.  There is the suggestion that built into that should be a provision that the President of the District Court, if he is to be appointed, should have the obligation to report.</P>
    <P>I have frequently called attention to the fact that these statutory obligations imposed by the Act of 1936 have not been carried out.  I think that is a scandal.  I first called attention to it in the Estimate for the Department of Justice in 1958 and thereafter in successive years and by questions sought to get some indication of what reports had been made.  I have not the replies to my own questions but there are one or two.  I think the Local Registration of Title Rules Committee reported once or twice but the rest did not.  Now, it is put as an urgent objection against me that I am asking a committee which has not fulfilled its duty to take on other duties.  I am.  I think the duties should be enforced.</P>
    <P>Recently, I asked here whether the <Col N="2073" /> attention of the various judges concerned had been drawn to the fact that they were in dereliction of their statutory duties.  I asked that either the statute be enforced or else that the provision be removed.  The provision is good but it should be enforced. Surely it is possible to ensure that judges, who frequently admonish people who come before them in their various courts for breaches of statutory duties imposed on members of the public, will comply with a statute?  They have to enforce statutory obligations upon other people.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a revival of these Rules Committees.  However, if it is not going to act then we would have to get something else.  The President is now given the power to convene meetings.  A great picture has been painted here of the district justices meeting, reading law journals, discussing the advances in the administration or the changes or improvements in the administration of law in other countries. The suggestion appears to be that there would be a sort of debating society mood on these people.  The discussion will be with regard to the discharge of the business of the court, fines, penalties and the avoidance of undue divergencies in penalties.  Just think of 40 district justices to be brought together, save such of them as have a legitimate excuse for not attending.</P>
    <P>The President, having convened the 40 of them&mdash;he cannot convene them oftener than twice a year&mdash;each justice is bound to attend unless he has an excuse.  Then they are supposed to discuss not merely this matter of fines and all the rest but scientific law journals and foreign publications.  The thing is ludicrous.  It would be much better to confine the justices' attention to the general terms of the practice, procedure and administration of their courts and that their attention should be directed to the law of the court and whether or not there is any improvement required in that law.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered in all this, of course, that the phrase was used that the district justices are judges in every sense of the term.  They are, <Col N="2074" /> except in the way they are styled and the way in which they are going to be addressed if the English version is used.  It also must be remembered that under the Constitution the district justices have no constitutional protection in their position&mdash;none whatever.  They have been given by law the protection the Constitution gives to the judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court.  That law, of course, is subject to repeal at any moment.  Their position is a rather weak, a delicate one.</P>
    <P>When the Act of 1946 gave them legally this constitutional tenure given to the High Court and the Supreme Court it went on then to prescribe the method of judicial inquiry.  There is a method of judicial inquiry laid down. It is, of course, only to be used in very special circumstances.  It is in cases of either misbehaviour or incapacity of a type that possibly might lead to the dismissal or retirement of a judge if the machinery that is there were put into gear.  The machinery is there and could be used in the district courts in a lesser way.  Apart from that, there is the judicially accepted way of the Minister himself making inquiries and having a chat with a particular justice.</P>
    <P>At column 1064 of the Second Reading debate the Minister came to the point of the new kind of jurisdiction over justices which is being vested in the President of the High Court by subsection (4) of Section 10 of the Bill.  That has been changed now to the Chief Justice.  The situation there was that the President of the High Court was to be empowered&mdash;and this is the time the President was first thought of although I am told this morning that it is traditionally the Chief Justice who has control of the whole administration of the courts. The first thought was to give it to the President of the High Court.  Anyway, that only changed the personnel.  The new jurisdiction was designed for the case where the formal inquiry by a High Court or a Supreme Court Judge provided for in Section 21 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946 would not be called for or would not be the best or most appropriate procedure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2075" /> The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The view has always been taken&mdash; and I think rightly taken&mdash;that the elaborate machinery of the 1946 Act should not be set in motion by the Minister for Justice unless the allegations against the justice, if proved, would make it necessary for the Minister to move in the Oireachtas for the justice's removal from office.</P>
    <P>The Minister then considered leaving it to the jurisdiction of the President of the High Court and it is now transferred to the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>The result has been that there is no redress available to the public or their representatives in less serious cases where, for example, offensive statements are made gratuitously by justices in regard to individuals or organisations or in relation to the legislation passed by the Oireachtas. All that is needed, the Government the necessary standing to advise the feels, is for some judicial person of justice or justices concerned to conform to the standards of behaviour followed by their colleagues in the execution of their office.  I have little doubt that the friction which has been created from time to time&mdash;fortunately not very often&mdash; between justices and the public will be reduced, if not entirely eliminated, by the influence which the President will exercise on the conduct of justices generally.</P>
    <P>Instead of the Minister finding it possible to approach an erring justice on his own, to bring about a better position, we have the two types of machinery, one where it is proposed that the President of the High Court should have this power, the second where that is now transferred to the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Barrett said in this connection has been referred to.  I want to refer to more of what he said. He was picked out because he is the only person on this side of the House <Col N="2076" /> who said anything favourable at all to these proposals with regard to district justices.  The Deputies beside me and Deputy Lindsay and myself all objected in very strong terms to the introduction of this officer at all.  Deputy Barrett did say that he was glad the Minister was, so to speak, taking a hand in the game.  That is not all of what he said.</P>
    <P>At column 1100 he said:</P>
    <P>I am not at all distressed by the provisions of Section 36 as some of my colleagues in these benches would appear to be.  I am very glad that at last the Minister is taking a strong hand in the matter of the behaviour of district justices.</P>
    <P>That is behaviour.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>More than one district justice in this country has shown complete disregard and disrespect for the people whom they are obliged to serve.  I can honestly say that these men brought the district court, which is, generally speaking, of a high standard, into absolute disrepute by their contempt through lack of punctuality.</P>
    <P>Now it is behaviour and it is mainly lack of punctuality.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>I myself sat for an hour and a quarter waiting for a district justice to arrive to hold a court.  I am accordingly glad to see that the Minister has at last become sensitive to such a problem.  It is not before time that this is being done; it has been going on for years, and I am glad that justices are being put on notice that they will have to do their job for which they are being well paid.</P>
    <P>That is the matter of behaviour and we know that could be dealt with in a completely different way and without this peculiar machinery being thrown in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett continued, and this was not quoted:</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need to be apprehensive about subsection <Col N="2077" /> (3) (a) of Section 36.  It does not mean the justices, when they come to talk with the President of the District Court, have to bow the knee or even pay any attention to what the learned President of that court may say.</P>
    <P>Then he quotes the subsection and comments upon that:</P>
    <P>It does not impose upon any district justice any obligation to pay the slightest attention to what the President of the District Court says. As far as I can see, the section simply envisages getting the district justices together under the learned President of the District Court in the hope that somebody will say something of use to his colleagues during the course of the meetings. They can go home as they came up.</P>
    <P>A later comment was:</P>
    <P>I do not think the meetings envisaged in this Bill will be as useful as the Minister seems to hope because any ordinary district justice should be able to keep himself up to date and should be able to know what jurisdiction he has.  Apart from the ordinary mistake any judicial personage may make, from the Chief Justice down to a district justice, the ordinary justice of the district court knows the jurisdiction he holds and the administration should not alter very much from district to district.</P>
    <P>At the bottom of column 1101 he said:</P>
    <P>One thing I feel some anxiety about is the reference to the general level of fines and other penalties. Whilst it is true in practice that district justices need not pay any attention to what the President of the District Court says about the level of fines or other penalties, we should be practical in our approach and we should realise that in any human society the personal outlook of any person who is appointed to any position whatever, be it Minister, district justice, Ceann Comhairle or anything else, is bound to be coloured by the human failings or the human attributes of the person concerned. <Col N="2078" /> It is a bad thing to try to effect uniformity in a matter of that nature where it is so pre-eminently a matter for the individual conscience of every district justice.</P>
    <P>The rest of his speech was about the use of the Irish terms.</P>
    <P>People on this side of the House may have said various things about the appointments being made but when it came to functions and powers, with the exception of Deputy Barrett, there was no commendation of the proposal in the legislation saving only with regard to the matter of behaviour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Behaviour of the district justices was certainly commented upon.  Everybody agrees in regard to the behaviour matter that the complaint could be made only against a few of the district justices.  Nobody ever said there was a lot of erring in this way.  If there had been, there would be an easy way to attend to it.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the district justice who was missing so many of his courts.  That position was adverted to some time ago and the Minister for Justice said that he had found it possible to approach the district justice in that matter.  If it is still the case, having been approached by the Minister for Justice, that the district justice is failing in that regard, there should be much more serious action taken.  It is not a question of getting the President of the District Court to speak to him, or of having the Chief Justice say that in his opinion he is acting in a prejudicial way.  If the district justice is still misbehaving after being approached by the Minister for Justice it is not just a matter for casual mention here in this House.  There should be an application made under the Act of 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the various amendments, I have suggested that the President of the District Court, as he is to be called, should be built into the framework of the District Court Rules Committee, and that he should be made chairman of the committee. There are four district justices on the <Col N="2079" /> committee nominated by the Minister for Justice.  Sections 39, 40 and 41 deal with the number of justices in the Dublin Metropolitan District, the places in which the business of the courts shall be transacted and the days of the week on which the courts shall sit.  Section 43 is not too clear to me. Whatever powers the President is given, certainly the committee should be brought into this matter and whatever is done in connection with the number of justices in the Dublin Metropolitan District, the places where business is transacted and the number of sittings, should be arrived at after consultation and agreement with the District Court Rules Committee.</P>
    <P>It seems to be foolish when we have a District Court Rules Committee, the chairman at the moment being one of the Dublin justices, and the secretary being one of the district court clerks, to have a move away from it.  If ever there was a case for the District Court Rules Committee it was for this type of thing.  The President, if we are to have such a person&mdash;and one does not object to a person of that title if his powers are rationalised&mdash;should be made act in conjunction with the Committee.  The alternative is to wipe out the Committee and let the President advise the Minister in every way. There have been individual amendments put down to other points.</P>

      <P>I often thought we lost a good chairman in the Deputy, but unfortunately we have not elected him yet.  The subsection says that the President &ldquo;may report the result of the inquiry to the Minister.&rdquo;  It is important to know what is intended by this.  The Minister for Justice said that the President could act informally without any inquiry, or there might be an inquiry, and the rest was left rather in the air.  In regard to subsection (3) (a) we are told that this is not mandatory and that the President may convene meetings.  The matters to be discussed are the discharge of the business of the court&mdash;that is very general&mdash;but in particular we are to have uniformity.  There is an amendment to delete &ldquo;uniformity&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the avoidance of undue divergencies,&rdquo; and then there is the general level of fines and other penalties.</P>

It is a very serious matter since it would come under the District Court Rules Committee at the moment.</P>

      <P>It would be a matter for the Rules Committee inquiring into the administration of justice, to make recommendations as to how improvements could be made. They could refer to fines and penalties. They could, for instance, advise minimum penalties, which of course would be a matter of argument here. That has been tried before.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I think they could but I do not know whether they should be asked, when we have an established committee and a most representative body.  If 40 people are brought into a room, at the most twice a year, what headway will be made? They will be just as wise leaving the room as they were going into it.  They need not pay any attention.  It is merely a matter of listening to a discussion.  It would be much better to have five district justices, a district court clerk and perhaps members of the legal profession in its two branches, discussing such things as fines and penalties than the whole body of district justices all coming together.  The Rules Committee might put something on their agenda and send recommendations to the Minister&mdash;which they are entitled to do under Section 75&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They can send recommendations to the Minister of course.  I shall read it:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as conveniently may be after every meeting of any such committee in pursuance of this section, such committee shall report to the Minister whether any and if so what amendments or alterations should, in the opinion of such committee, be made in the practice, procedure, or administration of the court in relation to which such committee is <Col N="2082" /> constituted or in the law affecting or administered by such court with a view to the improvement of the administration of justice...</P>
    <P>Is it suggested that there would be no power in the Court Rules Committee to make a recommendation covering the minimum penalty?  The functioning of the Rules Committee would be very much disimproved if any impediment were put in their way.  They have very full terms of reference.</P>
    <P>It does seem to me that to summon 40 justices together to meet not oftener than twice a year to discuss the general level of fines and penalties is ludicrous. There is also Deputy Dillon's objection to the mandatory way in which it is being expressed.  Every justice must attend twice a year unless he has some legitimate excuse for not attending.</P>
    <P>Again I go back to the old point that there is an excess, so to speak, of administrative control.  The administration is now breaking in and encroaching on their office.  One would not mind if the district justices were running riot and causing anxiety amongst the public.  They are not. There are one or two black sheep and something should be done about certain people if they are still persisting in what has brought them under unfavourable notice.</P>
    <P>It is rather alarming to find the Parliamentary Secretary referring to the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  I have never heard any mention before of disparity between justices in the matter of the misuse or the over-use of the Probation of Offenders Act.  In my experience only one person was informally approached and the matter did not retain any significance.</P>
    <P>There is no case to be made for the building up of all this machinery from the point of view of discipline or the teaching of district justices.  In connection with sentences and penalties there is quite as much disparity between the members of the circuit court, and indeed even the higher courts, and the district justices.  There is a maximum in connection with the penalties but there is no minimum.  Of course the maximum is hardly ever <Col N="2083" /> imposed but whatever the maximum may be there is a widespread disparity in the sentences imposed by judges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is bad enough, and liable to prevent satisfactory discussion on this Bill, for Deputy McGilligan to misrepresent my point of view and those of Deputy Booth on various matters, but when he misrepresents the views of a senior colleague of his own, sitting on the front bench beside him, I think it is very serious and more reprehensible still.  I refer of course to what he had to say about the views of his colleagues generally on the proposal to appoint the President of the District Court. Of course he is quite wrong in what he had to say about that and if necessary, I can give the reference.</P>
      <P>I feel we have discussed this whole matter fairly fully.  I made my case and I advanced sound and cogent reasons for the proposal.  I think it is a well-meant proposal, one that will be of value, one that will be welcomed generally.  I do not think there is any value at this stage in my following Deputy McGilligan around on the various points he raised.  He just persists in refusing to see the value of the proposal.  There is nothing I can do about that.</P>
      <P>I know Deputy Dillon would be the first man to rise up and tell me I was daft if I were to make the ridiculous suggestion that the Rule Making Committee is a more appropriate body to discuss the general level of fines and penalties than the district justices themselves.  That is really farcical.  The more we discuss this, the more value emerges from the proposal.  Deputy McGilligan said no case has been made for the building up of administrative machinery and then proceeded to outline a number of things which justify the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the case has been adequately made.  We all agree there is scope for increasing the efficiency of district court sittings.  There is general agreement that there is disparity in the general level of the fines and penalties and even Deputy McGilligan himself is now prepared to admit there would be some value in someone discussing the general level of fines and penalties. <Col N="2084" /> Of course he would not be constructive enough for one moment to agree that the district justices would be the right people, but at least he admits now that someone should discuss the general level of fines and penalties.</P>
    <P>As I say, the more the debate has gone on the more I am convinced that this proposal is well-founded and will be of considerable value.  I do not think there is any real substance in the various objections put forward. Deputy McGilligan attempts to confuse the issue by saying the Minister will have to take the initiative in the proposed investigations by the President of the District Court.  Of course subsection (2) (a) covers that.  Subsection (2) (a) states: &ldquo;Where it appears to the President of the District Court....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anyone can approach the President of the District Court.  For instance, the Southern Law Association might take the initiative with regard to district court sittings.  I could visualise even a member of the public or the Incorporated Law Society doing so&mdash; anyone can bring a matter to the attention of the President of the District Court.  It is absurd to suggest it is only the Minister who can initiate these proceedings.  Again, Deputy McGilligan has pointed out that the Minister on occasion has done this very thing.  From what I gather from his remarks he approves of the Minister doing that.  Therefore, he admits there is cause for someone to take this sort of action.  Surely, the Opposition will be the first to agree that if somebody must do this, it is better that a judicial person should do it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan spoke about the importance of differentiating between the Executive and the judiciary.  He talked about keeping them apart so as to avoid any question of the usurpation of functions.  That establishes the fact, as Deputy McGilligan admits, that somebody must do this business and it is best somebody vested with judicial office should do it.</P>
    <P>To deal with the remainder of what Deputy McGilligan said would be to go over the same ground again.  I do not intend to delay the House any <Col N="2085" /> further except to say that I feel I have made a very adequate case for these proposals and I feel sure the House will accept them.</P>

      <P>I can understand the Parliamentary Secretary resting on the advice he received but it does not add anything to the debate for the Parliamentary Secretary to make impudent references to an ex-Attorney-General and a Deputy whose contributions to the debate are invaluable to any rational person listening to him.</P>
      <P>I have said throughout the debate that my primary concern is with subsection (3).  I believe that subsection is calculated to arouse bitter resentment&mdash;and in my considered judgment, justifiable resentment&mdash;in the judges of the district court who are, in my judgment, some of the more important judges in the State because they come into closest contact with the daily lives of the people.</P>
      <P>I detect in the contributions made by Deputy Booth and the Parliamentary Secretary the very kind of tendency that I resent.  They appear to think that there is nothing untoward in authorising the President of the High Court to issue a command twice a year to district justices to assemble and discuss certain matters.  I would ask these Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is for the discharge of their functions as judges.  I ask those Deputies to reflect on this.  Suppose a proposal were brought forward in Great Britain that the Lord Chief Justice had the right to command the attendance of the Lords of Appeal and the High Court judges of Great Britain not more than twice a year and that the judges and Lords of Appeal failed to answer that summons at their peril.  If the purpose of the summons was to discuss the administration of their courts and the penalties and fines they habitually impose, I think every judge of the High Court in Great Britain would indignantly refuse to come and would regard it as a grave infringement of his office to submit his judgment.</P>

      <P>That is exactly what I am coming to.  That is the very undesirable&mdash;I am using moderate language&mdash;mentality which characterises this discussion.  Deputy Booth asks how that affects the district court here because instinctively he regards the district court here as something inferior to the High Court.  It is true that in the scope of its jurisdiction, it can be technically described as an inferior court because from it there is a right of appeal to the High Court.  In my judgment, any court which has in its custody the freedom of persons, especially the right to commit a man to jail, ought to be treated with great respect and everything ought to be done to establish it in the eyes of the people as an honourable and powerful institution.</P>
      <P>I myself mentioned in this House how urgently necessary, in my judgment, it was to ensure that the district justices or circuit court judges would not fall by custom into the practice of even speaking to the State solicitor or any officer of the Garda Síochána until the criminal business of the court had been disposed of because you want to create the impression that the judge disposing of criminal business is in an exalted position and as ready to resist the Executive to whatever limits are requisite as he is to impose penalties on the individual.</P>

Under our system of law, one judge may take a more severe view than another of a particular crime.  It is for that reason that 50 or 60 years ago the Court of Criminal Appeal was instituted because situations did arise in which what appeared to the generality to be savage sentences were doled out in the circuit court as compared with the average sentences in other courts.</P>

      <P>I consider that Deputy Dillon is in earnest in trying to get the best Bill we can, as we all are.  In all these provisions we are not directing our efforts towards the quality of the justices as such but merely towards the administrative machinery of the courts.  We have got a vast volume of business going through the courts and we want to channel that business as quickly and as effectively as possible.  There is no reflection on the capacity or quality of the justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am pressing on the Parliamentary Secretary is that this procedure of summoning justices to the kind of assembly envisaged in subsection (3) is bitterly resented by certain of the justices as an infringement on their discretion, which they regard themselves as bound by their oath to exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the kind of exasperating observation that evokes acrimony.  I beg of Deputy Booth to intervene if he wants to, but not to interrupt me.  If we want the new departure under Sections 35 and 36 to get a fair chance of success and to work&mdash;and I am prepared to say that some authority is necessary to ensure the courts will be regularly and properly held and other matters attended to&mdash;we ought to refrain from doing something which I certainly <Col N="2089" /> think leaves real ground for complaint. The fact that we drop subsection (3) does not bind us for all time.  If it subsequently emerged that a widespread abuse existed, we could legislate <i>ad hoc</i> to meet that abuse, but there must be evidence that there is a widespread abuse in existence.  Nobody has alleged that there is a public scandal we have not been able to master without recourse to this procedure. This is put in, apparently, with the desire to ensure that if a widespread scandal should arise, this machinery will operate to stop it.</P>
      <P>One of the most offensive things we could do in this Oireachtas in respect of any judicial body is to say: &ldquo;We apprehend your conduct is going to amount to a public scandal and we are going to take precautions in advance to prevent that public scandal arising, if and when it does.&rdquo;  We ought to proceed on the assumption that the men whom we have appointed to the district court bench are of the character and quality which make the possibility of such a public scandal envisaged in subsection (3) arising extremely remote.  That does not say that if it did, we should not be quite prepared to replace it and deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I differentiate between the situation that subsection (2) is designed to deal with and the situation that Section 35 and subsections (1) and (2) of Section 36 are designed to deal with.  I am convinced that if you stick to subsection (3), you are going to create a whole lot of difficulties that need not be created; whereas, if you drop it, I think you give a signal that you have respect for the feelings of the judicial persons, that you recognise their quality and that you are prepared to say: &ldquo;We have come to the conclusion that your voluntary meetings, which have been proceeding and which doubtless will continue, will meet any requirement that exists, and that the fact that you are already meeting voluntarily makes it quite clear you are aware of the desirability of exchanging views amongst men actively engaged in the work with which you are charged and that you are not confining yourselves to reading textbooks and journals and cutting yourselves off <Col N="2090" /> from the normal life of the community in which you function.  Recognising your judicial dignity, we have full confidence that you will go on having these conferences, in so far as they may be necessary, and that any desirable purpose that can be served by these conferences will be so served.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When you do this the Parliamentary Secretary is wholly mistaken in believing that the body of the district justices will accept subsection (3) as merely official approbation of an unofficial practice which we all applaud.  I think their reaction to subsection (3) will be to say: &ldquo;What was necessary was being done in a dignified and decent way. What is now sought to be done is to turn us into a kind of inferior body with the mark upon us that the Oireachtas do not trust us and feel that our administration of justice has become notorious and that it is necessary to bring us together once or twice a year under the chairmanship of the new officer of the court, the President of the District Court, in order to make sure we are toeing the line.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think you are doing a very imprudent thing.  I think you are going to make the working of this new office unnecessarily difficult.  I think you are going to offend excellent public servants, who are, in my judgment, justifiably offended by this proposal. It is for that reason I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to drop it.  I am inclined to agree we have argued this as far as we can.  We propose to put down an amendment on Report Stage. I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary most strenuously, in the interest of the smooth working of what is a new departure of which not everybody will approve, that we drop subsection (3) and give the remainder a chance of functioning.</P>

I would hope to make it clear that we recognise the value of <Col N="2091" /> these meetings that are being held and doing nothing more than attempting to put them on a proper basis and to facilitate them.  I would hope that the district justices would see in this the Oireachtas offering them something which we would hope would be of value and of assistance to them.  I do not want to say any more.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 72:</P>
      <P>Before section 45, but in Part V, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>Justice may be administered otherwise than in public in any of the following cases:</P>
      <P>(a)  applications of an urgent nature for relief by way of habeas corpus, bail, prohibition or injunction;</P>
      <P>(b)  matrimonial causes and matters;</P>

    <P>(f)  any case prescribed by or under an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <P>Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution, and, save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law, shall be administered in public.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree the cases set out in the proposed new section are reasonably comprehensive and represent a satisfactory balance between the desirability of having justice appear to be done and the impossibility or undesirability in the general interest of having hearings in open court.</P>

The exceptions are a minority. There is a very big number of exceptions brought in here.  Such matters as those at (c), lunacy and minor matters, are generally conducted in camera, because of the circumstances of the case.

There are certain matters where indecency arises and the court would be cleared but, generally speaking, the ordinary case of a person looking for a separation is not heard in camera at all.

      <P>What I say is that the Article of the Constitution that starts the series of articles dealing with justice is:</P>
      <P>Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution, and, save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law, shall be administered in public.</P>
      <P>Now we are going to make the law and the law is that &ldquo;justice may be administered otherwise than in public in any of the following cases&rdquo; and then we bring in quite a number of matters.</P>
      <P>I asked about income tax matters and I was told that that is covered by clause (f), that is where it is prescribed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  I am not sure if that is so but it is either (f) or (b).  I am told that as long as the law says the case must be heard in camera then it cannot be moved into open court but when I asked about matrimonial causes I am told the judge will determine that; he will say whether it ought to be heard in camera or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not, I suggest, except in the case of some indecent matters coming in.  In the ordinary straight type of matrimonial matters, say, of a person looking for a separation on grounds of cruelty, it is heard in open court.  I am told that that may be heard in camera.  I want to know who is to decide and I am told the judge.  I think that is wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the Deputy suggest?  Let me explain what we are concerned with here.  There <Col N="2102" /> may be a case where there are some delicate issues involved, such as there may very well be in matrimonial causes, and a judge might feel in that particular case that he would not get the true facts or the full information if the case were heard in open court because of the embarrassment to the parties or something of that nature. We want to ensure that justice will be given full effect to and that if cases arise where the judge thinks the case should be heard in camera, he will have the constitutional permission, as it were, to hold it in camera.  If we are being too sweeping, if Deputy McGilligan objects to that as being too wide, I am certainly prepared to consider an alternative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at the moment and, indeed, for as long as one can remember, is that there is no bar or prohibition or practice whereby an ordinary matrimonial cause is not disposed of and heard in public court, the same as any other case or matter.  There is a particular provision under the Married Women's Property Act&mdash;Section 12&mdash;of a few years ago whereby in relation to the settlement of disputes between husband and wife in relation to that particular matter the proceedings must be heard in camera.  That was a repetition of the similar provision that had been in the earlier Married Women's Property Act but that is the only cause, that I am aware of, of a matrimonial nature where the practice has been up to this to hold proceedings in camera.  The ordinary petition for a divorce <i>a mensa et tora</i> is heard in public court.  I do not think it is desirable that that should be changed and I think clause (b) is too general and too sweeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we not following here, subconsciously, a false precedent? There is a precedent in the British statute law dealing with divorce matters which precludes a newspaper from reporting more than the plea and the decision of the court and which prohibits the detailed reporting of evidence taken in divorce proceedings.  That is a restriction on newspapers.  So far as I know, there <Col N="2103" /> is no restriction on the public hearing of the matter.</P>
      <P>The trouble about all this is that I suppose if the truth were told one party to nearly every form of litigation would prefer the proceedings to be <i>in camera</i> but it is generally accepted, and I think rightly accepted, that it is a very necessary protection for the public that all litigation, as a general rule, should be heard in public because usually the man who wants the litigation to proceed in private is hoping to get away with something that he does not want his neighbours to know about.  It may be the details of his previous conduct or the form of his demand.  The tradition of hearing cases in public is well-founded on the conviction that the law administered in public is the most effective way of getting justice for all.  That is a principle we should be very slow to bridge in any particular.  The Parliamentary Secretary accepts that general principle, I understand, and concedes that if this is too general it can be amended.</P>
      <P>I am not sufficiently familiar with the practice of the courts to say in how far this goes beyond what is the present situation but I think it is a reasonable attitude to say that whatever the position is at the present moment has been ordained for good and sufficient reason.  The Oireachtas has been satisfied in respect of the matters referred to by Deputy O'Higgins either to adopt what was the practice in Great Britain or to enact special legislation itself. In so far as this section goes beyond what is the practice, the Parliamentary Secretary has an obligation to argue for it so that we may hear what the arguments are and unless he has a powerful argument for extending the area where litigation <i>in camera</i> can be conducted, our instinct ought to be not to extend the area.  I should like to know on what ground is it sought to provide trial <i>in camera</i> for matrimonial causes.  Is it related to the practice in England that proceedings in the divorce courts there may not be public, because it is quite different from holding them <i>in camera</i> and restraining the newspapers from publishing them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to deal with the constitutional provision in relation to administering justice in the open court.  The Constitution provides that this shall be done &ldquo;save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law&rdquo;.  They have already been prescribed by law, in relation to income tax, patent cases and certain matrimonial issues.  They are already laid down in the appropriate statutes and the case for their exception was made when that statue was being passed. Paragraph (a), &ldquo;applications of an urgent nature for relief by way of habeas corpus, bail, prohibition or injunction&rdquo; has not been dealt with by statue because, generally speaking, there are sound common law remedies. Obviously it is desirable that the intention of Article 34 should be extended now in this Bill to provide for urgent applications in relation to habeas corpus and so on.</P>
      <P>The same position probably arises in relation to paragraph (c) &ldquo;lunacy and minor matters&rdquo;.  There may be no statutory provision for paragraph (c) but I would imagine that if the Minister's amendment dealt merely with paragraphs (a) and (c) the case would be made because the other matters are already prescribed by law and are already envisaged under the appropriate Article of the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make the case for paragraph (c) in any event.  It has been represented to us from the most responsible possible source that in certain types of matrimonial cases the nature of the case is such, and the intimate details which may have to be disclosed are such, that if the case were held in open court justice would not be done, and the full facts would not be made available to the judge because, human nature being what it is, embarrassment or some reason or motive would prevent one of the parties from disclosing the full facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House must recognise that that is a very real danger.  I certainly accept and I think the House should accept that view as expressed by an official person who is in the best position to know and whose advice we got on this very serious matter.  The <Col N="2105" /> Constitution specifically lays an obligation on us to provide by statue that some cases would be held <i>in camera</i>.  If we did not write down &ldquo;matrimonial causes and matters&rdquo; as we have done and left those matters at large as it were, it would be open to the Court from time to time to have cases held <i>in camera</i> which need not be held <i>in camera</i>, and cases that the general principle of the Bill intends should not be held <i>in camera</i>.  I am prepared to leave it to the discretion of the judges and I think we would be perfectly safe in doing that.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins suggested that we should say &ldquo;where the judge is satisfied that certain things occur&rdquo;.

      <P>While no single measure can be regarded as a wholly appropriate indicator of &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;, as a rough index the volume of output in either manufacturing <Col N="2108" /> or in transportable goods industries covered by the Census of Industrial Production may be related to the numbers of persons engaged.  Similarly the expenditure on gross national product at constant prices may be related to the estimated total number of persons at work.</P>
      <P>In the case of manufacturing industry the volume of output per person engaged in 1960 was 119.5 to base 1950=100 and 111.5 to base 1955 =100.  For transportable goods industries the corresponding figures were, respectively, 120.5 and 111.8.

      <P>Under the Opticians Act, 1956, registered ophthalmic opticians may prescribe spectacles and I have agreed to permit them to sight-test insured persons for the purpose of the Optical Benefit Scheme.  Insured persons now have a choice in selecting either ophthalmic surgeons or ophthalmic opticians for sight-testing.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Opticians Act, 1956, an ophthalmic optician is precluded from treating any disease of the eye or administering drugs for that purpose.  He is permitted, however, to carry out orthoptic treatment for any person provided that the treatment is directed in writing by a registered medical practitioner who has examined such person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision in the Opticians Act, 1956, requiring a prior recommendation by a registered medical practitioner in the case of a person attending an ophthalmic optician for sight-test and I see no <Col N="2110" /> reason to introduce such a condition in respect of insured persons only.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs what action the United Nations take against defaulting members over arrears of annual subscriptions; if, in assessing member countries' subscriptions, account is taken of the arrears before apportioning the sum due from each member <Col N="2112" /> country; and if Ireland has taken any steps in conjunction with other states whose subscriptions are paid up to have the question of defaulters considered by the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Article 19 of the United Nations Charter a member in arrears shall have no vote in the General Assembly if the amount of arrears equals or exceeds the amount of contributions due from it for the preceding two years.  From this it will be seen that the Organisation has a self-enforcing penal regulation to deal with defaulters once their arrears attain a certain magnitude.  There is, however, an escape clause inasmuch that such a member may be allowed vote if the General Assembly is satisfied that failure to pay is due to conditions beyond the member's control.</P>
      <P>Account is not taken of arrears before apportioning the sum due from each member country.  This is calculated by a special Committee on Contributions that bases itself roughly speaking on a comparison of national incomes and population in the member countries.</P>
      <P>In the present financial crisis of the Organisation the arrears have not yet reached a level where Article 19 of the Charter can be invoked.  Nonetheless Ireland and other members of the United Nations have consistently called upon those in arrears to pay their just debts to the Organisation.  The question of examining the administrative and budgetary procedures of the United Nations especially with regard to covering the cost of peace-keeping operations has been put on the Agenda of the next session and the Irish Delegation will cooperate with any move from like-minded States to deal with this problem of arrears in particular.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Workers (Holidays) (Amendment) Bill, 1961&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware the Minister for Industry and Commerce is sponsoring a Bill to provide for increased holidays for non-agricultural workers. An improvement in the holiday conditions of agricultural workers appears to be equally warranted.  To enable this improvement to be effected an amendment to the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Act, 1950, is necessary.  This is the purpose of the Bill now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Act, 1950, an agricultural worker is entitled to 6 holidays in each year of continuous employment or to one holiday for every two months of continuous employment. Where a worker is entitled to three or more holidays in any year he is <Col N="2123" /> entitled to take them on consecutive days.  Sundays and such half-holidays, Church holidays and public holidays as are allowed to the worker by arrangement with his employer are not reckoned as holidays under that Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for an increase in the number of holidays to which an agricultural worker is entitled in each year of continuous employment from six holidays to 12 holidays or one holiday for each month of continuous employment, in place of one holiday for every two months of continuous employment.  At present, a worker, who is continuously employed for the year, is entitled to take up to 6 holidays consecutively.  Under this Bill he will be entitled to take 12 holidays in two separate periods of 6 days each.  However, the worker and employer could, as before, make whatever arrangements they wished in regard to the way the holidays should be taken.</P>
    <P>It is intended under the provisions of the Bill that holidays would accrue to a worker in the current year at the old rate of one day for every two months of continuous employment up to the date of commencement of the new Act and, thereafter, at the rate of one day per month of continuous employment.</P>
    <P>Where it is the practice of an employer to grant his employee a free day or days on full wages to attend sporting or other events&mdash;such as race meetings and agricultural shows&mdash;held on a day other than a Sunday, Church holiday or public holiday, such special free day or days may be regarded by the employer as an offset against the workers' holidays subject, however, to such offset being limited to six holidays in each year.  This provision ensures that the increased holidays would not bear unduly on those employers who had been generous enough in the way of granting free days with pay to their employees.  At the same time, it would in effect mean that those workers who previously did not have the advantage of such privileged days and who had to rely on what the law provided, would in future be placed in a better position <Col N="2124" /> than they were in relation to their more fortunate fellow workers.</P>
    <P>These, in broad outline, are the provisions of this Bill and the principles underlying them.  I think the House will agree that this is a desirable measure which will improve the lot of the agricultural worker without being unfair to the interests of the employer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should imagine this Bill in fact recognises what is the practice over most of the country, and as such is clearly unobjectionable.  So far as I know, in most places agricultural workers enjoy twelve holidays in the year and if any workers in the country are entitled to that certainly they are.  I do not know whether by statute it is wise to go into all the details such as: &ldquo;Where it is the practice of an employer to grant an employee a free day or days on full wages to attend sporting or other events, such as race meetings and agricultural shows, held on a day other than a Sunday, Church holiday or public holiday&rdquo;.  I think these arrangements are often best left to the farmer and the man who works for him.  If we content ourselves with providing by statute that the farmer shall provide twelve holidays in the year where a man works for twelve months, that is as far as we need go. However, if the Minister thinks there is a very serious necessity for the qualification he has down here in this Bill, I have no objection to it.  It is very generally accepted that a minimum of twelve days holidays in a year for agricultural workers is not extravagant and substantially reproduces the situation which operates generally in the country at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very desirable Bill and marks an effort by the Legislature to keep agricultural workers, so far as holidays are concerned, somewhat in line with industrial workers.  We have passed the Second Reading of a Bill to provide for a minimum of twelve days' holidays for industrial workers and this Bill is now doing the same thing on the agricultural front.  It is desirable because if there is one thing that cannot be defended it is the very much lower standard of living which is <Col N="2125" /> allocated, if I might so describe it, to our agricultural workers as compared with our industrial workers.  The main impetus for the emigration of agricultural workers is that their standards of wages and conditions generally are so low that they leave the land and move into the cities where they can get something approaching the conditions of industrial workers with the trade unions backing them to ensure they get these conditions, or they emigrate to Britain where they can get wages substantially higher by more than 50 per cent. than the wages paid to agricultural workers in this country.</P>
      <P>Our minimum rate of wages for agricultural workers is appallingly low compared with living costs and while I do not want to develop that on a Bill of this kind I do want to say that unless there is an improvement not only on the holiday front but on the wages front as well and in regard to the decasualisation of employment, there will continue to be an exodus from the land on the part of the agricultural worker.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is a first-class industry but many people engaging in activities less desirable nationally and socially than agricultural workers would describe them as agricultural labourers, as if they knew nothing and were just hewers of wood and drawers of water. There is no such thing as an agricultural labourer in any economic sense.  There is the agricultural worker who has to deal with the land and the vagaries of the Irish climate, who can produce crops and who has a considerable reservoir of skill and knowledge at his disposal.  Not only in the field of holidays but in the field of wages and conditions generally, it should be our aim to improve the conditions of the agricultural workers. If we cannot do that the cities of this country will claim them and, when the cities become overcrowded, they will look for employment with the higher wages and better holidays which are available within sixty miles of the shores of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally we support this Bill and assure the Minister of our utmost co-operation in dealing with it.  We wish to table some amendments <Col N="2126" /> to it which can be discussed at the appropriate time.  This Bill uses the term &ldquo;employer&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee&rdquo;. There are certain persons who under the terms of this Bill, and under the terms of previous Acts, may not be considered as persons whose main interest is in, or whose main earnings are derived from agriculture.  That being so, in the past these people have been able to evade their responsibilities to the workers and enjoy advantages which should not be there.  We would ask the Minister to consider this aspect of the matter because, while the majority of farmers will be committed to this measure, other people running businesses here in the city of Dublin or maybe getting dividends from large companies abroad can act in the capacity of gentlemen farmers and, because they may be able to show their main earnings do not come from agriculture, can evade the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I take it, on reading the Bill, this point seems quite clear but I would ask the Minister to make certain that it is clear.  The Bill mentions that the worker and employer could, as before, make whatever arrangements they wish in regard to the way the holiday should be taken.  I am not questioning it except to clarify it.  The Bill, right through Section 3, makes it quite clear as far as I can see, that of the twelve days, the worker must get six days consecutively; the others can be broken up, as far as I understand from the Bill.  Such being the case, if a farmer and worker by agreement between them decide on having an odd day during different months of the year, that can be taken from the other six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my reading of the Bill it seems &mdash;and I am very much in favour of it &mdash;that the worker must get six consecutive days.  All I am asking is that the Minister will have it clarified instead of saying that the worker and employer could, as before, make whatever arrangements they wish.  Ultimately this point may be of great importance to all concerned.  Beyond that I have nothing to say except that this Bill is getting our full co-operation while, of course, we are making it quite clear that we believe it is essential that <Col N="2127" /> there should be certain amendments to try to improve what we consider is a fairly good Bill.  If we can make it better, all the better for the people concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The position as the law stands is that the worker is entitled to get six holidays in respect of 12 months of continuous employment.  This Bill which proposes to amend the existing legislation provides that workers should get on the same conditions, 12 days, and that they can take these 12 days in periods of six and six.  If the employer and the employee agree as between themselves on any other basis of distribution there is nothing to prevent their doing so, but the worker has the right here to insist on getting his 12 holidays in the way that I have described.

      <P>The point made by Deputy Dillon appears to be concerned with the position of the employer who in the past gave six days as provided for by law and, in addition to that, may have been giving six or more days, that is excluding Sundays, half-holidays, Church holidays and public holidays.  If we were to clamp down on an employer who was giving six days to his employee and paying him the usual wage, for the purpose, as I have stated in my opening remarks, of attending functions of one kind or another&mdash;maybe a show or race meeting or something of that kind&mdash;and say he would have to give twelve days, irrespective of what he was doing in that voluntary way, it would be a hardship I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2128" /> We are not providing that he cannot do that in future but we are providing that if he decides to regard six of these days for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this Bill before the House he can do so.  We are not obliging him to do that.  For my part I should like to give the greatest possible degree of freedom consistent with having these rights provided by law.</P>

    <Title>Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) (Amendment) Bill, 1961&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to authorise each District Milk Board, that is the Dublin District Milk Board and the Cork District Milk Board, to provide a superannuation scheme for its chairman and staff.</P>
      <P>These two Boards were established under the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936, the Dublin District Milk Board in 1936, and the Cork District Milk Board in 1937. Their function is to regulate the supply and distribution of milk for human consumption in their respective areas, to advise the Minister for Agriculture in prescribing minimum prices payable to producers for milk, to promote milk publicity campaigns and to encourage increased milk production such as in operating artificial insemination services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each Board consists of a chairman and a number of ordinary members representative of milk producers, wholesalers and retailers.  The ordinary members who are elected give their service on a part-time basis and receive no remuneration but are paid allowances for expenses for attendance at meetings.  The chairman is nominated by and holds office at the pleasure of the Minister for Agriculture. He receives such remuneration as the Minister may fix after consultation with the Minister for <Col N="2129" /> Finance.  At present the same person occupies the post of chairman of each of the two Boards.  Each Board employs such staff as are necessary for the performance of its functions and these hold office on terms and conditions determined by the Minister for Agriculture.  The present staff of the Dublin Board numbers 79 and that of the Cork Board 11.</P>
    <P>The expenses of each Board are met out of the Board's own income which is derived from a statutory levy on milk sales and from the commercial operation of its artificial insemination service.  Each Board is required to keep a fund into which all money received is paid and out of which any expenditure authorised by statute is met.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Board has sought my approval for the introduction of a superannuation scheme for its employees and I have given approval in principle, subject to the enactment of the necessary legislation which of course would also apply to the Cork Board.  In deciding to approve of the proposal in principle I was influenced by the fact that legislative provision has been made for the operation of superannuation schemes by other statutory bodies such as An Bord Bainne, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Bord na Móna, Electricity Supply Board, Bord Fáilte Éireann, An Foras Talúntais, etc., and also by the consideration that, as far as can be foreseen, the District Milk Boards will remain a permanent feature of the liquid milk trade.</P>
    <P>The operation of a superannuation scheme for the staffs of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards will also necessitate the operation of a superannuation scheme for the chairman of the Boards who is the only member who receives remuneration for his services.</P>
    <P>This Bill follows generally the pattern of previous legislation authorising the grant of superannuation allowances to the employees of statutory bodies.  It has been necessary to make special provision for a person who, as at present, is chairman of more than one board in view of the <Col N="2130" /> fact that his service in relation to either board alone might be regarded as of a part-time nature only.  Recent social welfare legislation which provides for contributory old age pensions will be taken into account when schemes are being prepared under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not involve any cost to the Exchequer.  The cost of the superannuation scheme will be met out of the Boards' statutory funds into which any staff contributions will be paid.</P>
    <P>I trust the Bill will commend itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This a permissive Bill to which we see no objection, but I think the Minister might have made it more clear what is the exact implication in Section 2 (b).  It is a matter of very great consequence because one individual occupies the post of Chairman to the Dublin District Milk Board and to the Cork District Milk Board and I cannot decipher from the text of the Bill how it is proposed to divide the liability for his pension between the two boards.  How much time of his service does he devote to each board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose he will be included in the Dublin scheme as a whole-time chairman and at a later stage the Cork Board, by agreement, will make whatever proportionate contribution to the fund is necessary in respect of the individual concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the kind of things that give rise to trouble when you try to sort them out later on.  If we are going to pass a Bill authorising the two boards to create a superannuation scheme, the sooner the scheme is adopted the better.  Unless there is some provision for resolving the respective liabilities of the Dublin Board and the Cork Board there will be a row and unless there is somebody authorised by statute to arbitrate in that difference it is a row which could go on for ever.  I am not clear, from my perusal of the Bill, whether the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture have responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather the scheme is to be a contributory one because the Minister says that any funds from the staff's contribution will be paid into the boards' funds.  Of course, most of the boards' servants at present have had quite a protracted period of service. Are we to understand then that there will be contributions to the superannuation fund in order to make it viable or are there to be contributions towards the superannuation fund at all?  I understand there are two systems under which you can operate these superannuation schemes.  One is to charge them on the general funds of the board and deem them to be part of the salary of a servant of the board.  That is the principle that obtains in the Civil Service.  Alternatively, you can set up a fund into which the board pays something and the employees pay something and the fund bears the cost of the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the latter event, there will have to be some substantial capital expenditure from some source to make the fund actuarially viable but if we are to proceed on the precedent of Civil Service salaries it will become a charge on the board's general fund. If that is the principle I do not see where there is any room for staff contributions. These are all details which do not affect the underlying principle of the Bill, which is a permissive measure to give the board power to set up superannuation schemes.  However, we must be sure what kind of schemes we are authorising them to set up&mdash;whether they are to be contributory <Col N="2132" /> or on the same lines as those of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The Bill has this element of importance.  If a man is in enjoyment of a salary as of to-day which is deemed to be adequate for the work he is doing and is given the right of two-thirds of that salary as a life pension, we are giving him a very large addition to the present salary he has.  If that is what we are doing I want to know so.  If, on the other hand, there is to be contributory assistance whereby people's contributions are graded according to the number of years they have still to go in employment, that has to be examined to see if it is fair and equitable.  I should like to know which scheme the Minister has in mind when he gives this general authority to the board.  I assume that both he and the Minister for Finance have some knowledge of what the two Milk Boards have in mind to do under the permissive powers the Minister now wishes to give them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the introduction of the Bill since it meets a request made by the workers through their organisations.  It was promised some time ago and it is good to see it coming to fruition.  There is one simple matter to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention. I asked a Parliamentary Question in the name of Deputy Larkin yesterday requesting the Minister for Agriculture to remove the restrictions that exist at present preventing the employees of the Milk Board from dealing directly with the board in connection with conditions of employment and wages.  The Minister's reply was satisfactory.  He said that in the past questions on such matters were referred by him to the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is quite true in relation to those workers engaged in the artificial insemination side of the work, but there was a difference in respect of the clerical workers.  I should now like to ask the Minister if it would be possible to amend this so that the Dublin and Cork Milk Board workers would be given the same facilities as those in An Bord Bainne where they have the <Col N="2133" /> right to negotiate directly with the board?  The 1936 Act restricted the power to the Minister.  As I understand it, an amendment of two subsections of the 1936 Act by the substitution of the word &ldquo;Board&rdquo; for &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; would meet the case.</P>
    <P>The employees are anxious to have the same facilities as ordinary employees of semi-State bodies and I am sure it is not the Minister's intention to prevent their having them.  In his opening speech he drew attention to the fact that An Bord Bainne and other semi-State bodies have certain facilities and that he intends to give the same facilities to the Dublin Milk Board.  I would ask the Minister to consider having that amendment embodied in this Bill and then I am quite sure the Bill would give 100 per cent. satisfaction to the employees.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>That the workers would have the power to negotiate with the Board rather than with the Minister. In the 1936 Act it is confined to the Minister and unless the Minister refers any dispute about wages and conditions to the Labour Court of his own free will the workers have not the right to do so.</P>

      <P>I am deputising for Deputy Larkin who normally deals with these matters.  He is at a trade union congress in Cork.  He would be in a much better position to give the details.  As I understand from the employees of the board today, the point is that under the 1936 Act there are two subsections providing that all negotiations in regard to wages and conditions are to be dealt with by the Minister direct.  The board does not come into it.  It is quite true that the Minister, excercising his functions, when it came to that stage referred it to the Labour Court.  The employees simply ask that the Minister would amend that and, if he cannot do it in this Bill, to do it in some other way so that there may be direct negotiations between employees and the board.</P>

      <P>An Act to authorise the making of superannuation schemes by boards established under Section 8 of the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936.</P>
      <P>It would appear that this is the wedding, so to speak, of all the Acts from 1936 on.  That would imply that the Minister could make the suggested amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may refer a case to the Labour Court but all we ask is that the Minister should allow the clerical staff and others, directly through their union to negotiate with their employers, the board.  In other words, the Chairman, the Secretary and the members of the <Col N="2136" /> board on the one hand and the union on the other hand could deal with these matters and, if necessary, arrange for arbitration or refer matters to the Labour Court.  We appreciate, as the Minister and Deputy Dillon have stated, that cases were referred to the Labour Court.  That is all right but we wonder why it should be the Minister who should give the permission.  Why should not the Minister pull out altogether and allow negotiation to take place between the employers and workers themselves and, if necessary, have arbitration?  All we want is that in this case the Minister should do what has been done in other cases, that is, keep out of any dispute that may arise between worker and employer, let them iron out their problems and as a last resort have arbitration or go to the Labour Court.  That seems to be a sensible approach and the request is reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a subject appropriate to the Bill before the House.  I cannot see where the necessity arises because, on every occasion where a dispute arose as between employees and the board as to wages, the claim was submitted to the Labour Court and the recommendation of the Labour Court was fully implemented on each occasion.  The distinction is so fine that I cannot grasp it as between giving the board the power and retaining the power in the Minister.  It is a matter that can be debated some other time and I shall refresh my memory on this whole business as soon as I get an opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked what sort of scheme we have in mind.  I must confess that I have no idea at all as to what the scheme will be like.  As Deputies have stated, this is a permissive measure and a scheme will be prepared by the boards on the understanding that the Department of Finance and we will have to be satisfied. I cannot say whether they would favour a contributory scheme or otherwise.  I must confess that I do not know whether or not schemes which have been prepared by other bodies not unlike this one are contributory. <Col N="2137" /> Permissive schemes will be prepared by the board.  Whatever they decide and prepare will be submitted to us.  I am sure that, as a result of discussions, whatever they propose will be amended and an agreed scheme will finally result.

      <P>Since the Undeveloped Areas Act was introduced in 1952 there were three members of An Foras Tionscal, which was the body entrusted with the examination of proposals for grants for new industrial undertakings, or extensions of existing undertakings.  Initially their work was confined to the Undeveloped Areas Acts.  In 1956 Deputy Norton, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, introduced the measure known as the Industrial Grants Act and entrusted the administration of that Act in a similar way to the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Industrial Grants Act was amended and extended in 1959, the Industrial Development Authority represented to me that since they were a promotional body it would be difficult for them to be asked to assess the industries they had helped to promote, and the applications they had helped to make.  It would be difficult for them to decide whether or not the industry qualified for the grants and if so what grants should be given.  They asked to be relieved of that function.  I acceded to their request and gave to An Foras Tionscal the grant giving functions formerly exercised by the Industrial Development Authority.  They then had two Acts to administer, the Undeveloped <Col N="2139" /> Areas Acts and the Industrial Grants Act.  Immediately, there was a considerable increase in the amount of grant applications An Foras Tionscal had to examine and determine.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill as the House has seen is to increase the overall maximum amount of money available for grant purposes, largely because the number of applications has been considerably increasing in recent years.  Having regard to the increased duties given to An Foras Tionscal as a result of the transfer of the Industrial Development Authority function under the Industrial Development Act, and having regard to the increased work thrown on that body as a result of the increasing number of applications it was thought that it was only fair that two extra members should be appointed.</P>
    <P>As well as that, having regard to the amount of money administered by this body I thought that two heads more would be a good thing to add to the three already there.  I can say that the Chairman of An Foras Tionscal agreed with me that it would be a good thing to have two more people on the board.  I think the explanation I have given is reasonable, and I think the House should agree to having five members in An Foras Tionscal instead of three.  I should add that this body meets every week.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 raised the total sum by 50 per cent. from £10,000,000 to £15,000,000.  Can the Minister give us any indication of how long he expects this sum of money to last or has any realistic estimate been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think on the basis of past performance, if I may call it that, one may be able to give an estimate. The Undeveloped Areas Act and the Industrial Development Act have been in operation for nine years. In that period, between the two Acts, a total of over £8½ million has either been granted or committed for grant. It was anticipated at the rate the proposals are now coming before the Board that £10,000,000 might be exhausted by the coming autumn.  On the basis of roughly £10,000,000 in the past ten years, the longest the increased amount would last would be five years, and having regard to the accelerated rate of applications that may be reduced to three.  Since the amount must be increased upwards to ensure that no application would be rejected because An Foras Tionscal had not money at their disposal, it should be raised to a sufficiently high limit to avoid the necessity of coming back on frequent occasions to the House seeking approval to increase that sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, there are two Acts.  Under the Undeveloped Areas Act the amount of grants approved was £5,430,700&mdash;say £5½ million.  Of that sum, £2,318,700 has actually been paid, leaving roughly £2 million hypothecated but unpaid. Under the other Act, grants approved amount to £3,086,200 as against grants paid totalling £648,000, leaving roughly <Col N="2141" /> something short of £2½ million hypothecated but unpaid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1956 Act limited grants payable to industries outside the undeveloped areas to £50,000 in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the purposes of the amendments was this.  These grants were limited to new undertakings. There was a difficulty that if a company which was in existence for the purpose of manufacturing a certain product decided to manufacture, perhaps in an adjacent site, another product, it would not qualify for a grant under the Industrial Grants Act.  The 1956 Act did not provide either for grants for extensions. The 1959 Act extended the upper limit to £250,000 in any one case, except in the case of an industry employing a very high number of people.  The figure given during the course of the enactment of the Bill here was 2,000.  It was not a statutory condition.  It was given as an indication of the type of industry in respect of which a grant exceeding £250,000 might be given.  Such a grant would be given only by a decision of the Government as a result of a recommendation to it by An Foras Tionscal. That is the main difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It did something more than that.  It also made it harder to get a grant if you were going to build outside the undeveloped areas.  You had to establish you could not operate the industry in the undeveloped areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That was one of the qualifications&mdash;if An Foras Tionscal were satisfied the industry was not one which might otherwise be established within the undeveloped areas and also if they were satisfied that the undertaking was one of exceptional national importance, by reason of the type of <Col N="2142" /> commodity it would manufacture and the proportion that would go into exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, it was open to a person to decide to put up an industry anywhere he liked outside the undeveloped areas.  In that case he got a grant equivalent to two-thirds the cost of the building.  He himself was the sole judge of where the building would be put.  He had to manufacture an essential commodity and it had to be a commodity not produced here. But once he decided to do that and fulfilled that qualification, he could then get a grant of up to two-thirds the cost of the factory.  Under the 1959 Act admittedly he could get a bigger grant but he had to be able to establish to the satisfaction of An Foras Tionscal that the industry proposed to be set up could not be located in the undeveloped areas.  If he failed to do that&mdash;and it was not an easy job sometimes&mdash;he got no grant at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get an explanation of this.  The section says that &ldquo;every reference to machinery shall be construed as including a reference to plant.&rdquo;  Would the Minister mind telling us what is intended here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if I read out what is in my brief, it might be more explicit.</P>
      <P>Legal advice recently received by An Foras Tionscal raised doubts as to whether plant as distinct from machinery and equipment qualifies for grant purposes.  By the term &ldquo;plant&rdquo; is meant such fixtures as electric transformers for general use (as distinct from ones for use in a particular industrial process), cranes, roof tanks for the supply of water, etc.  An Foras Tionscal have in practice been giving grants covering plant in addition to machinery and equipment and it is considered desirable to place beyond doubt their legal right to do so.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the distinction is machinery is what we know as such. Plant is construed as electric transformers for general use, cranes, roof tanks for the supply of water and the like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as that, if it were a project which An Foras Tionscal would consider to be the normal development of an industry, it should be capitalised out of profit and out of the industry's own resources.  In such a case An Foras Tionscal would not give a grant.  If the installation of the machinery were for a completely new type of project, or some new field not related directly to what had been done in the factory, then An Foras Tionscal would consider the giving of a grant.  In the case of what is considered normal development and expansion in a factory, that ought to be financed out of the company's own resources, in ordinary circumstances that would not get a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is abroad a queer kind of feeling that, if you come from Nagasaki, you will get a grant and V.I.P. treatment but, if you come from Ballydehob, you are inclined to get the brush-off.  I should like to be quite clear that if a fellow coming from Ballydehob wants to set up a factory in Finglas his enterprise will be treated on exactly the same basis as an <Col N="2145" /> enterprise sponsored by any foreign company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say quite categorically that the man from Ballydehob will receive the same treatment. There is no truth whatever in suggestions made to the contrary.  The two Acts are there for administration, equally applicable to all applicants whether they are Irish citizens, foreigners, or a combination of both. There is no distinction whatsoever made as between people, whether they are Irish or non-native.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, as Deputy Dillon suggests, that there is a feeling abroad&mdash;it may be for want of intelligent information on the subject&mdash;that you can get these grants if you come from the far ends of the earth but you cannot get them if you are Irish.  There is no foundation whatever for that allegation. The nationality of the applicant never matters; where he comes from never matters.  It is the quality of the project.  If Pat Murphy has a project which can stand on its own two feet and withstand the test applied to every project that is proposed, he is entitled to and will get a grant just the same as the man from Nagasaki, or any other part of the world.  I do not think that can be said too often because there is a widespread feeling on the part of some people that that is not the position.  I think these are people who will not take the trouble to inform their own ignorance or who are motivated by self-pity into making these unjustified allegations.</P>

      <P>I cannot resist raising on this section a rather remarkable fact.  There have been several Acts designed to extend this kind of work, one of which was promoted by Deputy Norton when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce in the inter-Party Government.  That was the Act of 1956.  The Long Title of this Bill manages to refer to the Undeveloped Areas Acts, 1952 and 1957 and the Industrial Grants Act, 1959, but, by Jove, they have managed so to arrange <Col N="2148" /> things that the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, which is the root of the Industrial Grants Act, 1959, has now been forever blotted out of the Statute Law of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not done with any ulterior motive.  The 1959 Act carried in it some of the provisions of the Undeveloped Areas Acts, 1952 and 1957, and of the Industrial Grants Act, 1956.  Under the review, which I have mentioned is taking place at the moment, it might be as well if we could consolidate all these in the one Act.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister ought to tell Deputy Dillon he was very blessed in that the Industrial Development Authority was not wiped out, as his predecessor promised.  I pay tribute to the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal for the manner in which applications that come within their province are dealt with.  I have had occasion to see both bodies at different times in respect to different projects.  Not only is the fullest possible assistance given to promoters of new industries but every weakness in an application is pointed out and every effort is made to guide the potential promoters along lines which will command the submission of a satisfactory application.  Both boards have been extremely helpful and extremely painstaking.  Their literature and documentation generally, which help to expand their activities, are something which go well outside what in other spheres might be thought to be the inhospitable red tape <Col N="2149" /> of a Government Department.  Both bodies perform as if it is in their own interest to have a new customer come in to see them.  They appear to be delighted with any effort which helps to develop the activities which are their special assignment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder how many Deputies in this House recollect that to which Deputy Norton is referring when he says the Minister ought to be grateful that the Industrial Development Authority had not been slaughtered.  I see a kind of mystification spreading over Deputy Faulkner's face.  What Deputy Norton means is that when we instituted the Industrial Development Authority in this House in 1950, Deputy Lemass, as he then was, the present Taoiseach, standing approximately where I am standing now, said that the institution of the Industrial Development Authority was an act of folly and he solemnly pledged himself there and then&mdash;he wanted to give notice to anybody who contemplated accepting an invitation to join the Industrial Development Authority&mdash;that, at the first opportunity he got, he would repeal the Act, dissolve the body, and abolish its functions.  It is that to which Deputy Norton now refers.  But, to make a long story short, he learned the value of the Industrial Development Authority just as he has lately learned the value of the British market. Deputy Faulkner and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will excuse some of us who listened to his predecessor playing a somewhat different tune if we now find the present symphony grating a little on our ears.</P>

      <P>I do not think I should let this opportunity pass without endorsing what Deputy Norton has said about the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal.  As a result of my association with them I have nothing but the highest praise to offer to those who constitute the respective boards and those employed on the staff.  I should like to say that I think it is a tribute to the Taoiseach's broadmindedness and objectivity that, having examined the position for himself on reassuming office as Minister for Industry and Commerce, he endorsed what Deputy Norton had done in setting up the Authority as something worthwhile.  There is an Industries Division within the Department and, as he knew it, he assumed that the promotional work that was to be done by the Industrial Development Authority was already being well done within the Department.  Having looked at the matter objectively, he decided the Industrial Development Authority was doing a good job and he was man enough, therefore, to retract what he had said about it, and keep it in operation.</P>

      <P>I must say that the reform of the most abandoned criminal is an admirable development educationally. In the case of the most ignorant of men it is something about which we should rejoice.  I do not know, however, if somebody habitually pulls down the house about your ears, that he is entitled to emerge from the ruins, picking the thatch out of his hair and saying: &ldquo;That was a slight mistake. I will not do it the next time.&rdquo; I think we are entitled to say at some stage, after you have led us through an economic war and fiercely obstructed our creation of the Industrial Development Authority, that we will not continue to have the house pulled down about our ears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton will remember that certain of the persons who were proposed for that Authority were deterred from accepting by the assurance that <Col N="2151" /> they would be swept out of existence if Fianna Fáil returned to office.  When are we going to reach the stage when the house will not be pulled down around our ears by the present Taoiseach to the comforting obbligato, as he picks the thatch out of his teeth: &ldquo;The next time I come to visit you I will not do that again&rdquo;.  It is getting a bit tedious, and what maddens me particularly is that, as he picks the mortar off his clothes, he says: &ldquo;Am I not a wonderfully broadminded man? I am always prepared to pull your house down but, when it comes down, I say I am sorry&rdquo;, and he saunters off down the road.  Somebody is going to suspect at sometime that he is the man with the most brazen face of anybody in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move these amendments to Section 45 of the Bill. Section 45 as it appeared in the Bill is a section which in my view gives great offence to the legal profession, I think, and to a large number of people. I do not know how the section appeared but since it is there it has got to be dealt with.  I made the case on the Second Reading of the Bill <Col N="2153" /> that this was an unwarrantable interference with the courts in the manner in which the courts conducted their affairs and I suggested that the mode of address of judges should be a matter which should be controlled and regulated by the Rules of Court and that, in fact, that has always been the way in which these things are done.</P>
      <P>Obviously the section is designed to prohibit the accustomed mode of address utilised at the Bar in relation to the presiding judge.  That mode of address is one which is used only in court and used only at the Bar.  I do not understand why, if members of the Bar and the courts themselves feel that that is the way things should be done, there should be any interference in that respect.  It was suggested here on the Second Reading that to address a judge as &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo; or to refer to him in the third person as &ldquo;Your Lordship&rdquo; was in some way a remnant of some alien view and in some way servile and servient.  Of course, it has nothing to do whatever with the practice in the British courts and it is well that that should be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is part of the tradition which arises from the fact that the forms in our courts are associated exclusively with Canon Law and with the Ecclesiastical Courts and the title &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo; has come to us from the fact that in the years gone by it was the practice in the Ecclesiastical Courts that applied.  As frequently the presiding person in the old Ecclesiastical Court was a bishop, the title and style of address&mdash;&ldquo;my Lord&rdquo;&mdash;was associated with these courts.  Although our conventions and relations between citizens are no longer based on the Canon Law, it has survived into the ordinary law of the land.  That is history and those who have taken part in the Second Reading, thinking that they were having a tilt at something British, should re-examine the way they are aiming their lances because they are not tilting at anything British; they are tilting at something which is part of our Christian heritage in this country.  I do not think that any Christian in this country of any denomination who recognises bishops in his religion would regard it as being in any way wrong or servile or in any way improper to <Col N="2154" /> address a bishop as &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo;.  That is the recognised mode of address.</P>
    <P>I was interested to learn that some exponents of this section as it stands apparently understood that when one met a judge or referred to a judge outside court he was still called &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo; or &ldquo;your Lordship&rdquo;.  Of course, that is not so.  He is called &ldquo;judge&rdquo; if one does not know him sufficiently intimately to refer to him by his Christian name.  This form of address is purely a form of address existing at the Bar and it is essentially a court matter to be governed and ruled, in my view, by whatever the court itself and the appropriate rule-making committee thinks expedient. The purpose of this amendment which I move at this stage is to substitute in the section for the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in each of the subsections so that the first sub-section would read: &ldquo;The Chief Justice may be addressed in court as &lsquo;A Phríomh-Bhreithimh&rdquo;&rsquo;. Similarly, each other judge may be addressed as &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is felt that if any interference should take place at all it should be merely in providing an alternative mode of address to what there is at the moment and giving permission to address the Chief Justice or any other judge in the Irish form of the title.  I do not think that even that should be done.  However, if something has to be done, it should not be more than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is that the Chief Justice &ldquo;shall&rdquo;&mdash;in other words we must call him by the Irish term.  If we call him by any other term we will be corrected by the judge I assume.  But in the district court 99 people out of a hundred do not know a word of Irish.  In fact, I doubt if they have a good knowledge of English. They are probably well used to slang and probably bad language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can persuade Deputy T.F. O'Higgins to withdraw the amendments because in the new circumstances they will not be really necessary.  Since the Second Reading debate we have been giving consideration to the views expressed by Deputies and by representatives of the various professional interests concerned, and in fact the Superior Court Rules Committee and the Circuit Court Rules Committee have made rules proscribing revised modes of address and these have had the concurrence of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Superior Court Rules Committee have laid down that in the Superior Courts&mdash;the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal&mdash; the mode of address shall be in Irish and English.  The judges shall be called by their respective titles and in Irish the court will be referred to as &ldquo;An Cuirt&rdquo; and in English &ldquo;The Court.&rdquo; The Circuit Court Rules Committee have provided that a Circuit Court judge shall be addressed in court by his title and that the court shall be addressed in Irish as &ldquo;An Cuirt&rdquo; and in English &ldquo;The Court&rdquo;.  This is acceptable both to the Minister and to the Government which was anxious to see the expressions &ldquo;lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;lordship&rdquo; discontinued.  I propose on the Report Stage to move the deletion of Section 45 from the Bill.  The only reason I am not doing it at this stage is because there are some consequential <Col N="2157" /> amendments which have not been prepared at the moment.</P>
    <P>In that connection I should like to express appreciation at the manner in which the Superior Court Rules Committee and the Circuit Court Rules Committee have approached this problem. I think we have met very fairly the objections they made.  The main objection was that we were taking away from the Rules Committees a proper function of theirs and doing the thing by statute.  We are now prepared to hand the job back to the Rules Committees.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary that Section 45 is to be removed from the Bill and that the Bill, when it comes to its Final Stage, will not contain this section.  Having got that, I think progress has been made, but may I say in relation to the obsequies of Section 45 that it should never have appeared in a Bill of this kind.  It was unwarranted interference with the courts of this country and if anyone felt any anxiety in relation to the mode of address which has operated here for over 40 years since the State was established, I have no doubt that a simple, reasonable, polite approach to the Rules Committees would have been sufficient to result in a change.  I am glad that this section is now disappearing and I hope this will be the end of this kind of interference with the purely domestic concerns of our courts.</P>

      <P>Before section 55, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>(1) (a) In this section &ldquo;the Committee&rdquo; means a committee consisting of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the Chief Justice,</P>
      <P>(ii) The President of the High Court, and</P>
      <P>(iii) The Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  The Committee may act by a majority of its members and a <Col N="2163" /> warrant under this section shall be sufficiently authenticated if signed by two members of the Committee.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a county registrar is about to reach the age of sixty-five years, and</P>
    <P>(b)  he satisfies the Committee that he is not suffering from any disability which would render him unfit to discharge efficiently the duties of his office,</P>
    <P>the Committee may, if they so think proper after consultation with the Minister, by warrant made before such country registrar attains the said age, continue him in office for one year commencing on the date on which he will attain the said age.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a county registrar to whom a warrant under subsection (2) of this section or under this subsection relates, or to whom a warrant under this subsection is deemed to relate, is about to reach the age of (as the case may be) sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight or sixty nine years, and</P>
    <P>(b) he satisfies the Committee that he is not suffering from any disability which would render him unfit to continue to discharge efficiently the duties of his office,</P>
    <P>the Committee may, if they so think proper after consultation with the Minister, by warrant made before such county registrar attains the said age, continue him in office for one year commencing on the date on which he will attain the said age.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where, immediately before the operative date, there is a county registrar whose age of retirement was extended under subsection (6) of Section 35 of the Act of 1926, such county registrar shall be deemed to have been continued in office by warrant under subsection (3) of this section and to be a county registrar to whom that subsection relates.</P>
    <P>(5)  The provisions of this section shall have effect notwithstanding <Col N="2164" /> anything contained in subsection (6) of Section 35 of the Act of 1926.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to transfer to a committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General, the function of deciding whether a county registrar's age of retirement shall be extended beyond the age of 65 years.  At present, the law provides that every county registrar shall retire on attaining the age of 65 years but that the age of retirement may be extended by the Minister for Justice with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance to any age not exceeding 70 years.</P>
    <P>It has been represented that it would be more satisfactory to apply to county registrars the same provisions in this regard as apply to extending the service of district justices beyond the age of 65, that is, to leave the question to be decided by a judicial-type committee. As in the case of district justices the committee will be obliged to consult with the Minister for Justice before authorising an extension of the age of retirement, and this will give the Minister an opportunity of bringing to the notice of the committee any information he may have regarding any disability that may exist which might in his view, render the county registrar in question unfit to discharge efficiently the duties of his office for a further year.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) deals with county registrars who have already been extended beyond the age of 65 under the existing law.  At present there are two county registrars in this position.  One of them will reach the age of 70 in November.  The other has already received two extensions of one year beyond the age of 65 and subsection (4) deems him to have been continued in office by warrant of the Committee under subsection (3).  This county registrar may, therefore, when his present extension expires, apply to the Committee for a further extension.  It is a fairly straightforward proposal.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 82b:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2165" /> Before Section 55, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>(1)  Section 4 (which relates to the pensions of Master of the High Court, Taxing Masters and county registrars) of the Act of 1945 (as applied by Section 48 of this Act) shall have effect as if, in subsection (1)&mdash;</P>
    <P>I the reference in paragraph</P>
    <P>(a)  to sixty were a reference to sixty-five,</P>
    <P>II the references in paragraph</P>
    <P>(b)  and in subparagraph (ii) to ten were references to five,</P>
    <P>III the references in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) to thirty were references to twenty, and</P>
    <P>IV the reference in subparagraph (ii) to one-fortieth were a reference to one-thirtieth.</P>
    <P>(2)  References in any enactment to Section 4 of the Act of 1945 shall be construed as references to that section as amended by subsection (1) of this section.</P>
    <P>This amendment is being tabled as a result of representations made in the course of the debate on the Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Bill that, in general, county registrars should be placed in the same position, as regards pension terms, as district justices were placed by the Courts of Justice Act, 1953.  It was not possible to accede to these representations on that Bill because it had been introduced on the basis that no additional charge would be involved to the Exchequer.  The case made for improving the terms of county registrars was that these officers were normally recruited late in life and would normally not qualify for full pension on retirement under the existing pension provisions, which entitled them to full pension only on the completion of 30 years' service. The Government are satisfied that the qualifying period for full pension should be reduced for these officers and this involves making a similar change in the pension terms of the Master of the High Court and the two taxing masters whose terms have already been related to those of county registrars.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2166" /> Placing county registrars and the other officers mentioned in the same position as district justices involves increasing the minimum age at which they may retire from 60 years to 65 years.  Another change of a consequential character which is being made as a result of the shortening of the minimum qualifying period from 30 years to 20 years is that these officers are being permitted to retire after completion of five years' service instead of ten, on medical grounds. Consequential changes are also necessary in the amount of pension a county registrar or other officer will get on retiring before age 65 on medical grounds: this involves changing the fraction of one-fortieth of remuneration for each completed year of service in excess of ten to one-thirtieth for each completed year in excess of five.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this amendment is on the lines of the representations made by Deputies from all sides of the House during the passing of the Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Bill and I am sure it will recommend itself to the House.</P>

      <P>A solicitor who is acting generally for a party in an action, suit, matter or criminal proceedings in the Circuit Court, the Cork Local Admiralty Court or the Cork Local Bankruptcy Court and a solicitor qualified to practise (within the meaning of the Solicitors Act, 1954) who is acting as his assistant shall have a right of audience in such Court.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this new section will be clear to the House.  It is being inserted to remove doubts which have been expressed in regard to solicitors' right of audience in the Circuit Court. Under the existing law, solicitors and their assistants who are qualified to practise have a right of audience in the Circuit Court so that the amendment <Col N="2168" /> does not make any change in the present law.  However, as doubts were expressed as to whether this existing right is being carried over to the new Courts it has been thought better to insert a specific provision to make the position perfectly clear.</P>

    <P>This amendment will be discussed with amendment No. 94 by agreement. The position with regard to amendment No. 94 is that the object of subparagraph (e) of paragraph 19 is to transfer to the Taxing Masters of the High Court the powers of the special Taxing Officer appointed by the Minister for Local Government under the provisions of the Labourers Acts.  This special Taxing Officer died in 1957 and it was then decided by the then Minister for Local Government to abandon the system of having a special Taxing Officer to tax those costs and to leave these costs to be taxed in the ordinary way by the Taxing Masters of the High Court.  An order was made in 1957 under the Labourers Acts providing accordingly, as respects business <Col N="2169" /> commenced on or after the 1st October, 1957.  As regards business undertaken before that date, the arrangement was that it would be taxed by a special Taxing Officer whose functions would be limited to taxing such business.</P>
    <P>In the meantime doubts have been expressed as to whether the Taxing Masters of the High Court have the requisite power to tax post-1957 particular costs and paragraph (e) purports to authorise them to do so.</P>
    <P>The amendment makes it clear that the Taxing Masters will deal with the taxation of these costs in the ordinary way and without reference to any special scales.  As a consequence, the provisions in the Labourers Act of 1906 authorising the Minister for Local Government to provide for the special taxation of costs are being repealed. Amendment No. 85 is to that effect.</P>
    <P>A consequence of paragraph (e) of paragraph 19 is that solicitors in Labourers Act cases will receive ordinary professional remuneration instead of the specially reduced rates allowed to them by the special taxing officer. We are not taking any substantative decision at this stage.  The decision was, in fact, taken in 1957.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that what I have to say in support of this amendment is applicable to amendments Nos. 93 and 97.  It is, I think, worth noting that the only positions in the whole court establishment which require any legal professional qualifications are the offices of the Master of the High Court, the Taxing Master and the Registrar of Wards of Court, but for some reason neither the Registrars of the High Court, the Examiner nor the Official Assignee need have any legal qualifications whatever.  It is a matter which should be noted that these officials are sometimes acting in a limited judicial capacity, or possibly I should say in a quasi-judicial capacity.</P>
      <P>I feel that it is undesirable that people without legal qualifications, professional qualifications, should be acting in that way.  I do not wish for a moment that these remarks should be regarded as detracting in any way from my high opinion of the officials who at present hold these offices.  We are all quite happy that the officials holding these offices at present are very able men.  But not being qualified in a legal or professional sense, I think it is inevitable that they must concentrate rather largely on following precedents which have been set up in past years. They do that very well.  But there is a danger that, in carrying out their duties, they may quite unwittingly be creating precedents themselves.</P>
      <P>For people to be creating precedents without legal qualifications is, I think, dangerous.  In addition, while they are well able to keep matters ticking over, as it were, they are not well qualified to keep in view reforms which might be advisable from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Either now or possibly at some later stage it would be well to consider some amendment along the lines which I have suggested that, examiners, the official assignee and the registrar should be either barristers or solicitors of a certain number of years standing. In my amendment I have suggested 10 <Col N="2175" /> years' standing.  The Parliamentary Secretary or other Deputies may think that period is too long.  I merely inserted 10 years because that period was laid down in other provisions.  I would hope that on this Bill this amendment would be accepted because I believe it will not affect the present office holders in any way but will be of benefit in the future in ensuring that the holders of these very important offices will be fully qualified in a professional sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment for a couple of reasons.  In the first place I would point out to Deputy Booth that his amendment only has reference to the existing staff but there is a broader aspect of this matter to be considered.  This type of amendment is not suitable for this Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to any supplemental provisions which may become necessary as a result of the establishment of the courts.  In other words it is subsidiary and related to the Establishment Bill.</P>
      <P>These proposals by Deputy Booth are of a far-reaching nature and would effect pretty fundamental changes in the make-up of the staff of these court offices.  I would like to have them very carefully examined by the appropriate section of the Department, the Establishment Section.  I think Deputy Booth himself will realise that a lot of subsidiary things would arise if we were to accept these proposals.  We would have to bear in mind the position of the existing staff at lower levels and how their rights would be affected. They may at present have certain avenues of promotion available to them which this might close.  All that would necessitate careful examination in its own context and I undertake to have that done in the Department of Justice and if necessary separate legislation in the nature of a court officers Bill will be introduced if we decide to make any changes of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Booth's amendments light up a certain matter. I was not here during the discussion on Section 14 but seeing that it is proposed to leave this over until perhaps <Col N="2176" /> the introduction of the Court Officers Bill I wish to draw attention to subsection (3) of Section 14:</P>
      <P>(3) Rules of court may, in relation to proceedings and matters (not being criminal proceedings or matters or matters relating to the liberty of the person) in the High Court and Supreme Court, authorise the Master of the High Court and other principal officers, within the meaning of the Court Officers Acts, 1926 to 1951, to exercise functions, powers and jurisdiction in uncontested cases and to take accounts, conduct inquiries and make orders of an interlocutory nature.</P>
      <P>In the Solicitors Act where a matter of limited powers and functions of a judicial nature were to be exercised by people who were not judges was contested the judgment of the court used this phrase:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the exercise of the powers and functions was calculated ordinarily to affect in the most profound and far-reaching way the lives, liberty, fortunes or reputation of those with whom they are concerned they cannot properly be deemed limited.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On that phrase of the judgment read by a Judge of the Supreme Court the Solicitors Act fell: at least the penal clause of it did.  Deputy Booth's amendment lights up this.  Here are definitely things that affect the fortunes of people, for instance, adjudication of bankruptcy.  That affects in the most profound way the fortunes of individuals and it is clear we are handing this over to a person or persons who not only are not judges but who have no legal training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a deplorable situation.  I did not speak on this Section 14 because I did not happen to be here when it was going through but I did intend to raise that matter.  I did put down an amendment which drew attention to this because I wanted to call attention to the fact that the liberty of the subject is not constitutionally protected at all.  It is not protected against the legislative body.  The Article of the Constitution that deals with personal liberty says no person shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with <Col N="2177" /> law.  My amendment drew attention to the illusion that there was any constitutional protection for personal liberty of the individual in this country.  There is of course protection against an unauthorised act of the Executive but there is no protection against the legislative body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to draw attention to the fact that personal liberty is put down here in a reservation with criminal matters, the reason being that the criminal matters cannot be handed over to anybody except a judge or a court under the constitution. Deputy Booth has said and it is not to be contradicted that quite a number of the court officers have no legal training and yet they are given the duties set out in Section 14 (3).  These functions certainly deal with people's fortunes that is to say, proprietary rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter. A person may not have the means to contest a case and if it affects his fortunes his case ought to be heard by a judge and in a court established under the Constitution.  It is certainly outrageous to have people with no legal training whatever performing these duties.  The Parliamentary Secretary will find a certain number of the court officers do not like this jurisdiction being given to them and I do not think it is proper to be handed over to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly a great deal of anxiety amongst certain of the court officers in respect of this and more particularly in regard to the bankruptcy matter.  Some of the <Col N="2178" /> other matters may not affect a person's fortunes in a profound way but certainly a person's fortunes to some extent are prejudiced or affected by what is going to be done here, if this is going to be handed over to court officers who do not appear to have any training.</P>

What was the good of establishing administrative bodies, having a balance between the different groups as laid down by the Constitution for judicial matters while powers and functions of a judicial nature are handed over to laymen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 could not be clearer or more in keeping with the Constitution.  It specifies that the officers shall be entitled to exercise powers in uncontested cases and to take accounts, conduct enquiries and make orders of an interlocutory nature.  These are the mechanics of the courts.  Unless we are to be practical about this thing the law courts would have to come to a stop.  There is no question of these officers exercising the sort of functions of which Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore spoke in his judgment.  They are specific functions which would be given to them in uncontested cases only.  It is illusory to speak of these officers as having no legal training of any sort.</P>
      <P>With all due respect I suggest ten years' practice at the Bar would not qualify a practitioner in this sort of work, this specialised work which goes on in the court offices.  However, as I said, I want to leave over Deputy Booth's proposal to be examined on its own.  I want to rebut entirely any suggestion by Deputy McGilligan that there is anything involved in Section 14 or in this part of the Schedule other than the practical, day-to-day administration of the office work of the courts.</P>

It may not be a matter of vital urgency and I do not want to press it at this stage or delay the passage of this Bill but I would be much happier if I felt the Parliamentary Secretary could give some undertaking that it would be regarded as a matter of urgency and not be put off indefinitely, for the reason that Deputy McGilligan and I have given.  If the Parliamentary Secretary could give the assurance that the matter will be kept under review for early action I would be much happier and I would be prepared to withdraw this amendment at this stage.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate that. I fully appreciate that the amendment that Deputy Booth moved relates to the Schedule of the Bill, speaking of the qualifications of the officers in whom the Parliamentary Secretary desires to vest these powers.  I think he ought to be grateful to Deputy McGilligan <Col N="2181" /> for directing his attention to the fact that the safeguards suggested by Deputy Booth may not be adequate. Even if you meet Deputy Booth in his effort to repair what seems to him a flaw rooted in Section 14 you are not going far enough.  Section 14 may bring down the Constitution on top of your whole Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary does not remember that we have had a great deal of experience of this type of Bill.  I remember the Sinn Féin Funds Bill before this House which was most angrily contested and I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that the Ministers then occupying those seats were passionate, including the then Taoiseach, who regarded himself as the beginning and the end of the Constitution, in their assertions that the Sinn Féin Funds Bill did not infringe the Constitution.</P>
      <P>We were equally emphatic in informing them that it most undoubtedly did.  The Parliamentary Secretary will recall that the late Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy delivered a most classical judgment which was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court who endorsed all he had said.  It is highly inconvenient, to state the least of the evils, to have a long piece of legislation such as this Bill is, disqualified by the Supreme Court as being in conflict with the Constitution but quite apart from inconvenience that arises it is an undesirable thing from the point of view of the domestic atmosphere that the Oireachtas should be coming into constant conflict with the Supreme Court in respect of matters referring to the Constitution as it does create the impression in the country that the Constitution receives scant attention in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a constitutional lawyer but I am qualified to take that much intelligent interest in the activities of the Courts to be quite clear in my mind that the Supreme Court is very jealous of the exercise of judicial functions and I am quite sure that the Parliamentary Secretary deceives himself if he says that because proceedings before a court are uncontested, all orders made in such proceedings cannot be described as judicial functions when he concedes that if these matters <Col N="2182" /> were contested the orders made would be judicial functions.  Is that not the Parliamentary Secretary's contention?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he was making the case that he would not be prepared to maintain that, if these matters were contested, that they were not judicial functions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You say in both cases, but of a strictly limited kind, which are capable of delegation.  An ex-Attorney General and an authority on constitutional law has spoken on this and I think that the Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to say that he will make a note of it and will have the matter scrupulously examined and if necessary make an appropriate amendment on the Report Stage.  But it is quite clear to my mind, and I have a certain sympathy with the Parliamentary Secretary's desire to introduce into the Bill a short circuit in the proceedings.  I am a grandson of the man who established the commercial court in the High Courts in London for the purpose of shortening the proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  But conscious of that I am also conscious of the fact <Col N="2183" /> that in England they have no written constitution and what he was authorised to do under statute and by the rules of court, there was no appeal against it.  That is not so here.  We have got to keep in mind the terms of the Constitution when we are legislating and I am strongly inclined to the view that Deputy McGilligan is right and if that is so the amendment proposed by Deputy Booth is not sufficient.  Not only should officers who have ten years either as barristers or solicitors be appointed for this task, he ought to have gone the whole way and put this within the prerogative of judges under the Constitution.  Nobody who is not a judicial person should have this work delegated to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Dillon goes too far.  You cannot visualise the courts' operations without some form of delegation of judicial functions, and the Constitution clearly envisages that there must be a delegation of certain limited functions to officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is envisaged in the Constitution.  That is all we have done in Section 14.  This section was drafted in careful consultation with the Rules Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>This was the Rules Committee which is responsible for practice and procedure in the superior courts.  It is not the last word, of course.  The Supreme Court could still decide otherwise.  It is a very effective insurance to have this subsection approved by the Rules Committee.  The whole point is to endeavour to ensure that litigation is made as cheap as <Col N="2184" /> possible and that anything that tends to reduce the length of time it takes to take an action through the courts is, of course, beneficial.</P>

      <P>Think well of the Coggs and Bernard case.  I understand it cost over a quarter million pounds to complete the proceedings in a case over a wine cask.  Picture the fate of some unfortunate who, despite his advice, ends up in the Supreme Court in a 14-day hearing and is presented with a bill for £7,000 costs.  We have a great obligation to make it as certain as is humanly possible that nobody will be brought to the Supreme Court to establish the constitutionality of a matter which collapses under him.  Bills have been drafted here with the advice of people who have attained the dignity of the Bench and have collapsed under the strain of the Constitution.  I suggest that Section 14 be examined very carefully again.</P>

      <P>In paragraph 21 (a), line 46, after &ldquo;barrister&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or solicitor&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very small point and in view of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has ruled me out in every amendment so far, I hope he will accept this one.  There is no great principle involved or any breach of precedence.  The amendment simply <Col N="2185" /> proposes that the words &ldquo;or solicitor&rdquo; should be put in after the word &ldquo;barrister&rdquo; in reference to the qualifications for Registrars of Wards of Court. The paragraph says that no person shall be appointed to be Registrar of Wards of Court unless at the time of appointment he is either a barrister of not less than ten years' standing or is a barrister who is then employed in an office as set out under paragraph 2 of the Schedule.  I feel it is unjust that the solicitors' profession should be the victim of discrimination to some extent.</P>

There is a lot of merit in it and I have such a high regard for the solicitors' profession that I am always very reluctant to deny them anything they ask.  However, I should like to crave the Deputy's indulgence.  The matter is being examined Departmentally in connection with the whole question of staffing of court offices and I would prefer to wait until that examination is completed.

In other words, it is to make it clear that damage includes complete disappearance of the property as well as damage to it.  In other words, when we say &ldquo;damage&rdquo; to a ship we include in that the fact of the ship being lost altogether.</P>

We want to provide for the case where, for instance, a person is killed by being knocked down by one motor car into the path of another and it is not possible to say which fault actually caused the death.  In such a case, there might be argument as to whether or not there was simultaneous negligence and as to whether the two negligent courses of conduct overlapped or coincided. Deletion of the word &ldquo;simultaneously&rdquo; will avoid any such argument.  There must, of course, be some element of simultaneity about the two acts of negligence, as otherwise it could not be doubtful which of the two acts did the damage.  It is only where it is not possible to say which fault is actually responsible for the damage that the subsection will apply. Generally speaking the Committee were agreed that it was better to avoid the word &ldquo;simultaneously&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>Again, this arises from the discussion at the Special Committee.

The expression &ldquo;degrees of fault&rdquo; was inserted in Section 34 (1) but, through an oversight, the words &ldquo;in the responsibility for the damage&rdquo; were allowed to remain.  It is now proposed to delete these latter words.  They are not appropriate any more.  The amendments will mean that it will be clear throughout the Bill that &ldquo;fault&rdquo; or &ldquo;degree of fault&rdquo; will determine responsibility in all cases of concurrent wrongdoing.  This is in accordance with the principle accepted by the Special Committee.  In the present text of the Bill the expression &ldquo;degree of fault&rdquo; is used in Section 14 (3), <Col N="2196" /> Section 34 (1) (a) and Section 46 (1) (a).</P>

        <i>(b) Paragraph (a)</i> of this subsection shall apply between two parties notwithstanding that one of them is party to the two actions in different capacities.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was agreed on Special Committee that the <i>res judicata</i> rule should be applied in all cases irrespective of whether or not the parties were parties to the actions in different capacities. Accordingly, in the text of the Bill as introduced paragraph (b) of Section 29 (6) and subsection (2) of Section 37 were deleted.  On further consideration, I felt that these deletions might not be sufficient.  It occurred to me that it might be argued that all we were doing in Sections 29 (6) and 37, as they are at present in the Bill, was stating or clarifying the <i>res judicata</i> rule and that we were not amending the law where the parties were parties in different capacities.  These two amendments are necesary because we want to write clearly into the Bill the principle agreed by the Special Committee.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 15, to delete lines 35 to 47.</P>
      <P>I mentioned at the Special Committee that there were certain matters in relation to bankruptcy that I was examining.  I indicated to the Special Committee that I would be doing something about them on Report. Apart from certain technical amendments, there was the issue of proof of claims for unliquidated damages.  I am satisfied that all claims for unliquidated damages should in principle be provable in bankruptcy where there is a liability at the time of the bankruptcy.  There seems to be no valid reason why claims for unliquidated damages arising out of a breach of contract should be provable while claims arising out of an ordinary tort should not.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to delete subsections (2) and (3) of Section 30 and to insert a new section in the miscellaneous part of the Bill allowing claims for damages or contribution in respect of any wrong to be provable in bankruptcy where the wrong was committed before the bankruptcy.  Where the damages or contribution have not been liquidated, the court may, under subsection (2) of the new section, make an order for the assessment of the amount.  This accords with the provisions of Section 46 of the Bankruptcy (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1872, in regard to unliquidated damages in the case of a contract or promise.  Subsection (3) of the new section simply repeats subsection (3) of the existing Section 30.</P>
      <P>I think that the new section represents a valuable amendment of the law.  The section will not operate in cases coming within Section 63 because, under that section, where a wrongdoer is insured, the insurance moneys will be payable direct to the injured person, who will then, of course, not be a claimant in the bankruptcy.</P>

      <P>I envy the Parliamentary Secretary the brief he has before him, which he so comfortably <Col N="2198" /> reads out to us and which, I am sure, in the written record of our proceedings will throw a flood of light on these matters.  But, <i>ad interim,</i> I should like to raise this question.  The Parliamentary Secretary's attention has probably been drawn to a remarkable case in which a man was injured in a motor accident and recovered very substantial damages against the driver of the car, who was fully insured.  It then transpired that the driver of the car, either at the time of the accident or subsequently, became a bankrupt, whereupon the injured party discovered to his dismay that when the insurance company came to indemnify the insured party, it appeared that the sum received by the injured party to indemnify him against the damages awarded against him would become liable to seizure for the benefit of the bankrupt insured person's creditors and that the situation could arise in which the man who suffered the damage would lose all except, perhaps, whatever compensation the bankrupt was in a position to pay.  Does this section and the deletion now proposed bear upon the facts of that case?</P>

      <P>That arises by virtue of amendments we made in the Special Committee to Section 14 (3), 28 and 38 (2).  The Special Committee amendments were made as a result of the observations of the Bar Council.  The Council suggested that the plaintiff should be allowed to apply for secondary judgments only upon satisfying the court that he had taken reasonable steps to obtain satisfaction in whole or in part of his original judgment against one of the wrongdoers. The Council's suggestion was accepted by the Special Committee and the present amendments are consequential on the amendments made by the Committee to subsection (3) of Section 14, Section 28 and subsection (2) of Section 38.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We are proposing to cure a defect in Section 39 of the Bill as it stands.  This deals with a set of circumstances in which A, B and C are wrongdoers and B, who becomes a bankrupt, gets a judgment against A for £500 and C obtains judgment against B for £1,000.  Under Section 39 as at present, B will not be able to execute his judgment against A unless he satisfies C's judgment in full.  This, in practice, would mean that neither judgment could ever be enforced.  A would gain an advantage from this but C would be worse off because of the inability of the Official Assignee to recover the £500 from A. B's assets, against which C would be claiming in bankruptcy, would be less to the extent of this £500 due from A. To remedy this defect, it is proposed to allow for the attachment of A's judgment for the benefit of C.  Thus C will obtain £500 of his £1,000 from A and he can then claim in the bankruptcy for the remaining £500.  Where A, B and C are motorcar drivers and the wrong is covered by insurance, no difficulty will arise because of the provisions of Section 63.  In addition to bankruptcy cases the new section will also cover cases involving the insolvency of estates.  Clear?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will explain why.  The section is not necessary, because the scope of the new Act will follow the ordinary scope of the law of wrongs without express statement. Moreover, the section is fragmentary in that it leaves a number of matters uncovered.  For instance, it does not cover a wrong occurring in a foreign aircraft; nor does it say what happens if there is a collision in foreign waters. These are all problems in what is known as the conflict of laws or private international law.</P>
      <P>We cannot define the whole field of the law of tort from the territorial point of view.  To do so would involve a separate Bill and consideration of a number of problems to which the answers are far from clear or logical.  For instance, one of the views expressed in Dicey's Conflict of Laws, a monumental work on the subject, is that if a tort is committed inside a foreign aircraft over the high seas&mdash; not taking effect outside the aircraft&mdash; the English courts will apply English law to the situation.  In the case of ships, however, the law of the flag will apply as a general rule.  To complicate matters there is the rule in <i>Machado v. Fontes</i>.  This was a case in 1897.  X published a libel on A in Brazil.  On the assumption that libel was a crime but not a tort in Brazil, the English Court of Appeal held that A could successfully sue X for libel in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2207" /> I trust I have said enough to show that it would be better to delete Section 48.  The section does not even attempt to tackle the whole problem of conflict.  So it is wiser not to have it at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>These are drafting amendments designed to make it clear that the reference to one action is a reference to one action for damages against the same person.  Where the death was caused by concurrent wrongs, there might be two actions as, for instance, where one of the wrongdoers was a hit-and-run driver whose identity was not discovered until after the action against the other wrongdoer. Moreover, it is desirable to make it clear that &ldquo;action&rdquo; refers to an action for damages and not to an action for contribution.  The provision in the Fatal Injuries Act, which is followed in section 50 (2) of the Bill, was taken from the Fatal Accidents Act, 1846. However, in 1846, the law was that judgment against one joint tortfeasor discharged the others in respect of that tort; and there was no right to contribution between tortfeasors, whether they were joint or several tortfeasors.</P>
      <P>It is not alone necessary to amend the relevant provision in respect of an ordinary fatal accident.  We must also amend the corresponding provision in Part VI in respect of a fatal air accident.  Hence, the need for amendment No. 50.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 48 and 51 are cognate.  It is proposed to replace Section 53 of the Bill and Section 116 of the new Road Traffic Bill by the new section contained in Amendment No. 51.  The new section will deal comprehensively with the liability of the Minister for Finance in respect of damage caused by State-owned mechanically-propelled vehicles or such vehicles deemed to belong to the State. Section 53 of the Bill deals with fatal injuries and section 116 of the Road Traffic Bill with all types of injuries. It is not proposed to enlarge the liability of the State beyond that set out in the Road Traffic Bill.  The present amendments are simply tidying-up amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 64 was inserted in the Bill as a result of a discussion in the Special Committee. Subsequently Deputy Costello, who was a member of the Special Committee, at my suggestion, discussed this matter with the Attorney General and the present amendment is the result of that discussion.  It is proposed to allow the infant plaintiff, if his advisers so wish, to apply to the judge to decide whether or not the sum lodged in court should be accepted.  It is being made clear that an application may be made to the judge and that the judge will have to decide whether or not the action should go to trial.  We want to avoid a situation where solicitors acting for a minor plaintiff will be encouraged to fight the action instead of setting it out of court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept Deputy McGilligan's amendment.  It means that every action by an infant will have to be fought, unless it is discontinued altogether. A defendant may want to settle and this even though he has a good case. The infant who is not certain to succeed may also want to settle.  Under the Deputy's amendment, money could not be lodged in court and the action would go to trial.  The infant might <Col N="2215" /> lose the action completely or fail to beat the lodgment, in either of which events he would be at the loss of costs. If he failed completely he would lose everything and if he did not beat the lodgment he would lose the difference and the costs after the date of lodgment.  The amendment prevents an infant accepting a lodgment when, in fact, he might want to do so. Indeed, the case made to me by Deputy Costello was the case where an infant might be anxious to accept the lodgment but where the judge would decide that the action should go to trial, with the result that the lodgment would not be beaten.</P>
    <P>A further and an important aspect is that we must be fair to defendants. The Deputy's amendment takes away their right to lodge money in court where the plaintiff is 20 years of age but not where he is 21.  The lodgment of money in court facilitates settlements and our object should be to encourage settlements.  There is a problem at the moment where the plaintiff is an infant but my amendment solves that difficulty.  The Deputy's solution is that we should do away completely with lodgments in actions brought by infants.  This does not appear to me to be very desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in court at the moment is that in any case in which an infant is plaintiff every settlement must go before a judge.  The procedure is that settlements may not be agreed where an infant is a plaintiff without a judge approving of it.  I want to ensure that if we must go into court the action will be fought.  The infant cannot lose the action on account of the money lodged in court being more than was given afterwards.  He must get his costs.  The measure of costs will go according to the statutes which regulate the scale.  An infant might lose a case in any event under any of the amendments if negligence is admitted and the whole question is how much.  Nobody can say except the judge.  An offer may be put before it can be answered and there must be application to the judge and the <Col N="2216" /> judge will decide whether money will be accepted or not.  I do not see why the infant should not be helped to the extent of getting the case fought. It is not a question of the infant's own costs.  An infant may go into court against the lodgment and may not beat the lodgment but he has to pay the costs of the other side.  I think that is objectionable.  The infant must always go to court.</P>
      <P>The infant therefore should be protected. A judge might say: &ldquo;You are fighting the case.  You cannot lose on costs.  I will allow no lodgment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only answer that the way I propose is a much better way of doing it.  I am providing that the matter will be at the discretion of the judge.  The point which was advanced by Deputy Costello at the Special Committee was that practitioners and those advising infants were placed in a very difficult and invidious position when they came to recommend acceptance of lodgments.  It was in an endeavour to meet that point that section 64 is in the Bill.  I think the section, as I propose to amend it, meets the point.</P>
      <P>We must also be fair to defendants. If the plaintiff is an infant, we must have regard to his special position as an infant, but the defendant has rights, too.  I suggest my proposal is a fair compromise between the special case of the infant and the rights of the defendant.  At the same time, it meets the problem that was put to me in relation to difficulties encountered by practitioners in these sorts of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection is that this only meets the case where money is lodged in court, the infant being the plaintiff.  Then you go to trial.  You say: &ldquo;I have come before Judge A who is looking at the pleading and looking at the settlement of claim for damages and says: &lsquo;Fight that case&rsquo; and that it is not enough&rdquo; Eventually, you come before Judge B or Judge C.  These judges do not know what was in Judge A's mind.  You may fight your case and lose it in the sense that the lodgment is not beaten but that a difficulty arises about costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Judge B will be informed by Counsel as to what happened.  The case is fought because of the decision of Judge A.  The application was made to Judge A and he decided it should be fought.  That is a relevant factor for Judge B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Judge A, for some peculiar reason, refuses to allow the settlement.  Judge C might say: &ldquo;I shall not allow any costs.  He should have taken the lodgment.&rdquo;  That means only the very odd case but the very disturbing case where there may be some doubt about negligence and a compromise offer is made.  People may advise that you may be beaten entirely, that you had better take what is offered though it be a very small sum.  It is a disturbing case to have to fight.</P>
      <P>Take a shockingly bad case of negligence and suppose you are made fight the case.  The only thing that emerges is that the costs in the case will be at the discretion of the judge who may not allow them to the plaintiff who has been made fight the case by the intransigence of a judge.</P>
      <P>Under our procedure at the moment no infant's action can be settled without a judge hearing the matter.  That being so, why not have him hear it properly and say: &ldquo;As we have to go to court,&rdquo; because that is really the situation, &ldquo;then the infant should not have his costs jeopardised in the action&rdquo;?  If he wins, he may be beaten on negligence.  That will happen even in the case the amendment is attempting to meet.</P>
      <P>I am taking the case where the infant has a good claim, a lodgment is made and a party advises the infant that it is a tricky thing and that they must go before a judge to get an offer, even on proof.  Why not let them fight the whole thing?  Infant cases are not so numerous.  I have no figures in the matter but I have experience of the courts.  There would not be a very high proportion where negligence actions, because this is really what it amounts to, are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The defendants are mainly assurance companies.  Now they will always have to pay whatever the court will <Col N="2218" /> award.  The only question is whether they might save their costs now and again.</P>
    <P>I discussed, very informally of course, the amendment I was thinking of.  I asked members of the Bench as well as members of the profession about it.  I found nobody who disagreed with the point of view that is expressed in the amendment.  I found it generally acclaimed.</P>

      <P>The amendment does not in any way deal with the situation which arose and can still arise on a settlement, leaving aside the question of monies being lodged in court, with the defence, the question of settlement being entered into and brought before the court for approval. When the settlement is not accepted by the judge and the action has to go on the infant may lose or gets less than was on offer.  I think I am correct in saying there was at least one case in which a judge refused to accept a settlement which came before him and that, when the case proceeded, the infant lost.  Is there any way in which that kind of situation can be guarded against ?</P>

There was a suggestion that the Government might be moved to take up a matter like this.  The Special Committee did not have a vote on the matter.  It is an old-time standard, really, that in this age, we still have what used to be called &ldquo;Crown protection&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;State protection&rdquo;. The British got rid of this long ago.

All that now remains in that Act are sections 4, 5, 6 and 7.  Sections 4, 6 and 7 are merchant shipping provisions not appropriate to this Bill.

      <Col N="2221" /> These amendments are consequential. The Road Traffic Act, 1933, is being repealed in the new Road Traffic Bill.  Section 76 (4) of that Bill is replaced by the wider provisions of section 63 of the present Civil Liability Bill.  Section 116 of the Road Traffic Bill is being replaced by the new section provided for in amendment 51. Section 117 of the Road Traffic Bill, which provides for the survival after death of the liability of a person for negligent use of a mechanically propelled vehicle, will no longer be necessary in view of the provisions of Part II of the present Civil Liability Bill which deals with the survival of all actions on death.  Section 117 of the Road Traffic Bill replaces Section 171 of the 1933 Road Traffic Act.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 8 to 11, to delete &ldquo;the Supreme Court and the High Court and Courts to be called respectively the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Circuit Court and the District Court&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;A Court of Final Appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Courts of First Instance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  The occasion of the amendment gives me the opportunity of saying that the points made by Deputy McGilligan on Committee Stage regarding the position of the Court of Criminal Appeal have been considered.  I am satisfied that the Constitution does not restrict the courts to be established to a Court of Final Appeal and Courts of First Instance and that it is open to us to establish other Courts, such as the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
      <P>I have also considered the suggestion of Deputy McGilligan that the Court of Criminal Appeal should normally consist only of High Court judges, but here again I have come to the conclusion that the proposals in the Bill, which re-enact the existing law, are satisfactory.  They have, in fact, operated successfully for a great number of years and, if only for that reason, I would be slow to make any change unless there were to be some compelling advantage to be gained from it.  I do not think the proposals would represent an improvement, because I think, as a matter of principle, there should be a representative of the Supreme Court included in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  If there is not, there might be a feeling in the minds of the accused persons&mdash;there would be no justification for it, but it might be there just the same&mdash;that a Court of Appeal, consisting of colleagues of the judge, against whose decision the appeal is being taken, would be less likely to upset that decision than a court having one or more representatives of the Court of Final Appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be &ldquo;page&rdquo;. As I read it, the title as it will now be, is:</P>
      <P>An Act to establish, in pursuance of Article 34 of the Constitution, a Court of Final Appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Courts of First Instance, to specify the constitution of those courts, to provide for the vacation of judicial offices and the filling of vacancies therein, and, in pursuance of Article 58 of the Constitution, to disestablish the several Courts of Justice mentioned in that article and to abolish the offices of the judges and justices thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only amending the title.  The important thing is to amend Section 3 of the Bill which constitutes the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I had raised this point.  Article 34 of the Constitution says that the courts shall comprise Courts of First Instance and a Court of Final Appeal.  The Supreme Court is the Court of Appeal, the Court of Final Appeal, which shall be the Appeal Court.  The Courts of First Instance are courts other than that.</P>
      <P>What we have here is a Court of Criminal Appeal which is not the Court of Final Appeal.  There would be an appeal to the Supreme Court on very special points.  Clearly it is not a court of first instance.  It is a court of appeal of some sort.  Its constitution is that there must always be a judge of some sort.  The other personnel are from the High Court.  First of all, it is not a court of final appeal and it is not a court of first instance. It is a court of appeal in composition hybrid.  It is neither a Supreme Court nor a High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had prepared amendments to Section 3 and I was asked not to move them because the matter, the whole composition of the court, was being considered.  What I had by the amendments sought to achieve was a Court of Criminal Appeal set up under Section 3 under the control of the President <Col N="2225" /> of the High Court and that the President of the High Court or a member of the High Court be associated with the personnel of the court. That made it a court of the High Court.  In hearing appeals that is allowed.  Appeals are directed to them by law.  Now we seem to be going forward and directly bringing the searchlight of investigation on this by saying that we are establishing by Article 34 of the Constitution the various courts. We are saying that there is to be a Supreme Court, that is to say a Court of Final Appeal&mdash;which is all right&mdash; Courts of First Instance, and in addition a Court of Criminal Appeal. Then in the body of the Bill we find that the Court of Criminal Appeal falls on either side of the fence, it is an intermediate or hybrid type of court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to argue the constitutional issues but I think it is quite clear from the Constitution, from the Irish and English text, that &ldquo;comprise&rdquo; in the text means &ldquo;include&rdquo;.  It is perfectly in order to have a court which is not either a Court of First Instance or a Court of Final Appeal.</P>
