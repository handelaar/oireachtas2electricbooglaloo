      <P>The total salary and emoluments of the Attorney General were at the rate of £3,000 per annum up to the 30th April, 1960, and at the rate of £3,500 per annum as from the 1st May, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the emoluments mentioned by the Taoiseach are for work performed on a part-time basis by the Attorney General?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate Question.  Only the salary and emoluments were asked for; nothing more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the emoluments concerned represent only a small portion of the entire emoluments received by the Attorney General?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is referring to.  The Attorney General, as such, is paid certain fees.  Is that what the Deputy is referring to?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach knows perfectly well what I am referring to.  Would the Taoiseach say what are the full emoluments of the Attorney General from his position?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of these fees is quite interesting.  In 1936, the Government at the time decided that the salary of the Attorney General should cover all services rendered by him as Attorney General and that he should surrender all fees received by him in respect of his functions as Attorney General.  That decision was reversed by the Government that came into office in 1948.  That Government decided that fees received by the Attorney General should be retained by him as part of his personal income. The present Attorney General has, however, since his appointment surrendered to the Exchequer all such fees received by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with 1948 or 1949, but I am concerned with 1960-61.  Are the figures given by the Taoiseach the full emoluments of the Attorney General?  In view of what the Taoiseach has said, has he surrendered portion of that £3,000 to the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure I have given represents the salary and emoluments of the Attorney General.  Fees received by him, as Attorney General, are surrendered by him to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Attorney General is entitled to private practice at present and that, in view of the fact that he has private practice, he is not in a position to give full time attention to the very important issues which have faced him for the past three years?  In view of that, would the Taoiseach reconsider the terms of appointment of the Attorney General and put him on a full-time basis?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    <P>In addition to the pension payable to the widow, a pension of £29 9s. 8d. per annum is payable during the mother's lifetime in respect of each child of a deceased officer&mdash;in the case of a boy, up to the age of 18 years and, in the case of a girl, up to the age of 21 years while unmarried. In the event of the mother's death, the child's pension is increased to £43 4s. 10d. per annum.</P>
    <P>The Scheme does not provide for the grant of pensions to the widows of non-commissioned officers and men, however, are insured for the purposes of contributory widows' and orphans' pensions under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will explain why, if the grant of children's allowances to Army officers was a new departure, there was previously in existence a form A.F.C. (revised 1950) on which officers were instructed to claim under D.F.R. S.3 (paragraph 47) such allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to 1st April, 1950, married officers who were not provided with public quarters received, in addition to lodging, fuel and light allowance, an allowance at the rate of 6d. per day in respect of the fourth and each subsequent child under 16 years of age in the case of a boy and <Col N="615" /> 18 years of age in the case of a girl. No allowance was granted in respect of any of the first three children.</P>
      <P>When the new pay structure for officers was introduced on the 1st April, 1950, the lodging, fuel and light allowance was consolidated with regimental pay and the payment of the allowance of 6d. per day in respect of the fourth and each subsequent child was discontinued except in the case of those officers who were in receipt of the allowance on the 31st March, 1950.  Children born on or after 1st April, 1950, did not, however, qualify for reckoning in connection with the payment.  The claim for payment of the allowance had to be made on the form referred to by the Deputy.  I may add that by January, 1964, there would be no children eligible for this allowance.</P>
      <P>The children's allowance of £20 per annum granted recently to Army officers is payable in respect of each dependent child up to the age of 16 years or up to the age of 21 years if the child is in full-time attendance at school or is an invalid and incapable of self-support.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress last night, I was pointing out that the Government speakers have been boasting that they balanced their Budget in the past few years and I said that a great part of that balance was contained in the burden of £9 million which was imposed upon the destitute classes.  These people have been obliged to pay very high prices for the necessities of life, bread, butter and flour.  There are hundreds of thousands of people on incomes which are barely at the subsistence level.  These are the people who have contributed the lion's share of this £9 million.  This £9 million has been used one year after another by the Government for the purpose of balancing their Budget.</P>
      <P>In recent times the Fianna Fáil Party have been running around the country claiming credit for the progress we are witnessing in the industrial field.  When we examine the facts we find that the claim is completely dishonest, that the credit must go to the progressive enterprise that exists amongst the directors and managers of various factories and the various manufacturers.  They have been encouraged in this effort by the tax remission allowed as a result of the 1956 Finance Act.  Two aspects of these exports are connected with the oil refinery, the plans for which were made by the previous Government.  The other industrial expansions of exports are mainly as a result of the tax remission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The causes of the emigration which has persisted and reached almost the dimensions of a stampede were discussed very much in this debate. Bringing it down to simple figures, almost 1,000 people per week are leaving this country not to come back. The Government made an issue of that in the last general election and they seem to have taken no practical <Col N="635" /> steps towards the solution of that problem.  The policy the Government have operated during the past four years has not brought any improvement in our national economy.  I am giving full credit to the people engaged in industry for the expansion which is taking place there and I am giving no credit whatever to the Fianna Fáil Government for the changing picture.  If they were honest they would not claim any credit for that development.</P>
    <P>Taking the major side of our economy, the agricultural side, we see that the annual income from agriculture has dropped by nearly £20 million a year.  Those engaged in agriculture are receiving nearly £20 million a year less than they were before this Government took office. The trend seems to be continuing and the Minister for Agriculture is taking no practical steps to deal with the stagnation which is there.  We have witnessed the manner in which the Minister has fallen down on the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme.  He has failed to get this scheme completed within a reasonable time.  He expressed himself in this House some years ago as not being behind this T.B. eradication scheme. We can see that in the years which have passed he has not put his back into the work.  He seems convinced now of the necessity to have that scheme completed in the national interest as soon as possible, but in the meantime the people depending on the export and the rearing of cattle are suffering heavy losses in the form of depressed prices and an absence of good markets for the cattle available.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we have a situation where the taxpayers are being burdened to the extent of £30,000,000 more than four years ago and there is every prospect that the burden will be higher.  We must examine what they are getting in return for it.  It is very difficult to see that they are getting anything in respect of the extra taxes they are now paying.  The health services, which are costing this country a pretty packet, are not satisfactory to <Col N="636" /> those who want to avail of them. Those who do qualify for so-called free hospital and medical treatment are being subjected to a means test where previously they were not. People living on incomes over and above what might be described as bare subsistence allowances must pay 10/- a day while they are in hospital.</P>
    <P>I have not found, on examining the general policy of the Government, any hope at all that they intend to strengthen our economy or bring to the people any prospect of prosperity which might be sufficient to discourage the mass emigration which is taking place.  Not one scheme of major importance have the Government succeeded in putting before the people. They seem content to rest on their oars and carry on in the same old way without making any effort to bring any kind of change.  Emigration can be traced mainly to the fact that taxation is rising so steeply.  It is making it difficult for people to make ends meet so they emigrate to earn an income which would maintain them.  This situation will continue so long as the cost of living is deliberately forced up by the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>The cost of essential goods has gone up by approximately £9,000,000. Hundreds and thousands of the people mainly affected by this include hungry children with healthy appetites, manual labourers and their families, small farmers and their families whose average incomes are sometimes below those of manual labourers.  In addition to those, we have the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and the sick poor.  All those people must pay for the bread and butter essential to keep their bodies and souls together and they are contributing the lion's share of this £9,000,000.  Nobody will refute the suggestion that an old age pensioner is working a near miracle in maintaining himself on his present allowance.</P>
    <P>The standard of living among the subsistence classes has definitely fallen. The upper-strata class may not have many complaints to make, but certainly the subsistence classes are worse off today than they were at any time since we got native government and <Col N="637" /> the record is very clear that those people were best off during the two inter-Party Governments who were sensitive to the needs of the destitute classes and very careful to keep down the cost of living and avoid in every possible way any action that would send up prices.</P>
    <P>A very heavy tax has been imposed on agriculture and industry by the increase in the cost of national health cards.  The Government may say they did not impose a tax in that way, but I can assure them that the position is very bad.  Through these national health cards, a colossal sum of money will be collected.  In round figures we could almost say there has been a 75 per cent. increase in the cost of the national health card.  I think the price has gone up to 11/- a week. National health cards which were costing 4/- a week are now 7/1d. and the card which was costing 6/- or 7/- is now 11/-.</P>
    <P>That is a very heavy tax on enterprise. All concerned are obliged to pay this extra cost, both those engaged in industry and those who employ them. In addition, the amount collected in the form of income tax is up the best part of £10,000,000 this year as compared with last year.  The Government may say that is not a tax either, but all these things put new pressures on the people who are trying to make ends meet on limited incomes.  I should like to conclude by drawing attention to the grants of different kinds being paid nowadays.  We should be careful when making these grants available in the various fields to ensure that they will achieve something of a lasting nature because if grants are paid just to create temporary employment, temporary prosperity and some kind of industrial activity of a temporary nature, they will be futile.</P>
    <P>It does not achieve what should be expected from a State grant.  When a State grant is made the public, who are the guarantors, ought to be assured that some permanent asset will be provided by that grant.  I mention that because there is considerable criticism regarding the manner in which money available for certain types of grant is expended and people wonder whether <Col N="638" /> the expenditure on State grants in that way is justified.  In my opinion the results obtained from expenditure on these grants should be carefully examined to ensure that it is not something like a pep pill that will stimulate temporary economic activity, temporary prosperity or temporary employment but that it should be something that will create permanent benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote on Account has always provided an opportunity for review of Government policy generally. Both through the Budget and the Vote on Account we have been able to get some picture as to the direction in which Government policy is moving because both the Budget and the Vote on Account can be used as instruments of national policy and of national economic development.  It should be possible for one to see, through the Budget and the Vote on Account, a clear picture as to the direction in which the State is moving.  I propose to look on the Vote on Account from that standpoint and to refer to some aspects of our national activities especially in the light of promises made by this Government as to how they would apply their energies and talents towards solving our problems in the economic field.</P>
      <P>During the last general election, I remember saying that I would stake my political future on a belief that if Fianna Fáil got back to office the first thing they would do would be to abolish the remainder of the food subsidies. I made that statement in public; it was reported in the Press and heard by many people not of my political views, but the moment it was made the present Minister for Justice, the present Taoiseach and the former Taoiseach not only repudiated the suggestion that Fianna Fáil would do anything so perfidious but they asked the rhetorical question: did I think they were so stupid as to do anything of the kind?  I quoted that speech in this House before and there is no use in building a monument to the denial any higher than it is in the official records at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, the promise was that Fianna Fáil would control prices and <Col N="639" /> maintain food subsidies and a positive assurance was given by people occupying Ministerial posts and by the present President that, even if they thought of doing it, it was a bad thought and that Fianna Fáil were not so politically foolhardy as to contemplate doing any such thing.  Therefore, one was entitled to feel that was a promise made to the electorate at that time. It was on the basis of that promise, plus others to which we shall come later, that this Government was elected. What has happened in the meantime to keep the promise?  Let us see in what way the Government has implemented the promise that they would not abolish the food subsidies, then amounting to £9 million, and that they would control the cost of living.</P>
    <P>One of the first things they did was to abolish about 150 price control orders which had been imposed by the previous Government to keep prices down and to protect the interests of the consumer.  One hundred and fifty of these were wiped out virtually overnight. In their first Budget, subsidies on bread, flour and butter were abolished and there are now no subsidies on these commodities.  The Government put £9 million into their pockets which was previously utilised to control these essential commodities. There is now only a subsidy on one of these commodities but it is not for the Irish people; it is for the British people that we are now heavily subsidising the export of butter and we are selling it in Britain much cheaper than here although, of course, we could have continued to subsidise butter here. We abolished the subsidy here and continued it on the butter that we export to Britain.</P>
    <P>Look at the index figure movements since 1957.  In mid-February, 1957 the cost of living index figure was 135; in mid-February, 1961 it has moved up to 149; in other words, an increase of 14 points in the past four years.  That fourteen points has meant for a large number of people&mdash;the small farmer, the person on static rates of income, the self-employed person, a large mass of unorganised people&mdash;a debased standard of living because they have <Col N="640" /> no elastic method by which they can adjust their incomes in order to compensate for the rise in prices nor have they any economic strength such as trade unions have to compel better remuneration in order to protect and compensate them for rising prices.</P>
    <P>The result of this increase of 14 points in the cost of living has been that the country has been faced&mdash; inevitably and properly&mdash;with demands by trade unions for increased wages because if you permit the cost of living to rise, or deliberately direct it to rise by Government action, the obvious corollary to that is that you must pay compensation to those affected by your action.  Compensation was denied to a very large number of people but the trade unions have been able to get some compensation for the rise in prices, though it is true to say today that a very large section of the community are enjoying a standard of living which is substantially lower than they enjoyed in 1938 and that their remuneration today, allowing for the increase in the cost of living, is in fact less than it was in 1938.</P>
    <P>If one looks at comparisons with other countries in OEEC, we find that so far as this country is concerned, it is pretty high up among the list of countries where the cost of living has risen substantially.  Many other countries in Europe have been able to maintain price levels lower than we have.  Many of them have been able to hold their cost-of-living index figure at a lower level than we have been able to achieve. Proof of that is to be found in an examination of the cost-of-living consumer index in which you find that out of the 200 items comprising the index, the price of over 150 commodities has increased in the past four years.  The biggest blow of all is, of course, the deliberate action of the Government in increasing the price of bread, butter and flour, the staple foodstuffs of large masses of our people, large masses which have suffered heavily by the decision of the Government to repudiate the promise which they gave at the last election.</P>
    <P>I want to pass from that now to the subject of emigration.  No subject <Col N="641" /> looms larger in public discussion and in the Press than emigration does.  At a meeting in Galway recently, the Taoiseach felt compelled to refer to emigration in these words:</P>
    <P>Emigration will always be with us. There will always be young men and women who will answer the call of adventure, who will want to see the world.  But the problem of to-day, as it has been for so many years, is that too many of our young men and women are forced to emigrate to get a living.</P>
    <P>He went on to suggest a possible remedy:</P>
    <P>Wage standards here will have to be raised in our industries to be more or less comparable with those in neighbouring Great Britain. Living standards for the men working in agriculture will have to be brought in line with those obtainable by men working in factories.</P>
    <P>I suggest that is a clear indication by the Taoiseach that he realises that the problem of emigration will not be solved by relying on our present methods or by patriotic appeals to people to stay at home, if staying at home means regular visits, week after week and month after month, to the employment exchange or running the hazard of intermittent employment at reduced wages which do not provide an answer to the ever-present economic wolf at the door.</P>
    <P>That is not the only reference to emigration we have had during the past year.  Many members of the Hierarchy have been compelled by the facts which they have witnessed with their own eyes to refer to emigration as sapping the moral fibre of our people and calling into question the ability of the country to maintain its independence and the viability of its economy.  These members of the Hierarchy refer to the fact that parishes are denuded, that priests have had to be withdrawn from parishes because of the extent of emigration.  In certain areas the Garda Síochána have been reduced in numbers because of emigration.  Whole families are leaving the country.  Homesteads are locked up and families are drifting <Col N="642" /> elsewhere in search of the livelihood they are unable to get here.</P>
    <P>We have seen newspaper articles day after day and week after week referring to the suppurating wound of emigration and the havoc it is wreaking not only on our population and our economic development but also on the very existence of the nation; it is challenging the very existence of the nation to remain as a cohesive, independent unit.  We had the extent of the problem measured recently in a report of the British Overseas Emigration Board. It was stated in that report that the national insurance data showed that of the total of 170,000 immigrants from all sources over 64,000 were from the Republic in 1959; in 1958 the figure was 58,000.</P>
    <P>We gave to British immigration statistics 64,000 souls in 1959 as against 58,000 in 1958.  From independent Commonwealth countries there were 35,000 immigrants; from the British colonies there were 30,000 immigrants; from all foreign countries 45,000 immigrants.  The picture we have is of the British Commonwealth providing 35,000 immigrants, the British colonies providing 30,000, the rest of the world 45,000, while we provided no fewer than 64,000, as if we suffered here from a problem of excess population or a problem of living space in either a physical or economic sense.  The report states that these figures do not include nonworking dependants.  The figure may have been much higher than the figure given for adults alone.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the matter from another angle.  I asked a Question recently to ascertain the number of Irish-born residents in Great Britain at the latest date for which the information was available.  The information given to me was the result of the British census of population in 1951&mdash; ten years ago.  At that time there were 517,000 Irish people from the Republic living in Great Britain. There were another 178,000 from the Six Counties.  There were 20,000-odd from Ireland whose origin, so far as nativity is concerned, could not be classified.  That was ten years ago. <Col N="643" /> Members of this House have lived through the past ten years and they know the extent of the tidal wave of emigration.  If we add our emigration figures to the 517,000 Irish people, born in Ireland but living in Britain in 1951 the fact must be that approximately 1,000,000 of our people, born in the Twenty-six Counties, are living in Britain to-day, or more than one-third of our entire population.  It is because of that, as well as other things, that we get the figures we have now where population is concerned.</P>
    <P>I asked a Question recently directed towards ascertaining the population at the last census taken in 1956 and the estimated population since then.  The figures are interesting.  In April, 1956, we had a population of 2,898,000. The estimated population in April, 1957, showed a drop to 2,885,000.  In 1958, it dropped to 2,853,000; in 1959, to 2,846,000; and in 1960, to 2,834,000.  In other words, between April, 1956, and April, 1960, we lost 64,000 of our population.  But that is not all.  We lost as well the entire natural increase in population, which during the past five years amounted to approximately 28,000 persons per year.  Therefore, if you want to make the calculation, you make it on the basis that we have lost 64,000 on our net population figure, plus the entire loss of the natural increase in population.</P>
    <P>If we take the census figure in April, 1951, for this portion of the country, when there were 2,961,000 persons, and compare it with the present figure of 2,834,000, we have lost in the 10 years 127,000 of our population, plus the entire natural increase in population, about 27,000 or 28,000, for each year of the 10 years.</P>
    <P>Can anybody find a more depressing, a bleaker or less heartening picture than these figures reveal?  What I cannot understand&mdash;and I do not profess to be able to plumb the mentality responsible for it&mdash;is why, in the face of this catastrophic fall in our population and this catastrophic loss of the natural increase in population, <Col N="644" /> we got from the Fianna Fáil Party a pamphlet published in Cork during the last election in which it was stated:</P>
    <P>Quick action is needed to avert national disaster... The present spate of emigration is the most serious problem now facing the nation. The recent census report has shown that the situation must be righted quickly if disaster is to be avoided. In contrast to the inaction of the present Coalition, Fianna Fáil have been preparing plans for the day when the Party will again take up the reins of Government.</P>
    <P>The pamphlet goes on:</P>
    <P>The full employment proposals recently announced by Fianna Fáil show how the Party intend to deal with the problem of emigration by providing work for our own people at home.</P>
    <P>These words were then added in heavy type:</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil plan proposes an increase over five years in the number of new jobs by 100,000.  This would result in full employment and the end of abnormal emigration.</P>
    <P>There is the promise.  There is the Fianna Fáil special Cork plan for ending emigration and providing 100,000 new jobs.  With the 100,000 new jobs you would have an end to emigration and everything in the garden would be lovely.  Four years ago last month this Government commanded a very substantial majority in this House and have had that majority ever since.  So far as its Parliamentary strength is concerned, there is not the slightest impediment to the Government implementing the plan to provide the 100,000 new jobs and thus end emigration.</P>
    <P>But what is the position?  As far as emigration is concerned we have now reached the lowest level of population this country ever had, notwithstanding the Fianna Fáil promise to end emigration.  When that promise was made we had 2,885,000 people. Twelve months ago it had fallen by 64,000 plus the natural increase in the population.  So much for curing emigration.  I see no evidence, nor has anybody been able to direct me to <Col N="645" /> evidence, of the provision of 100,000 new jobs.  I know that the Minister for Transport and Power, when he gets loose at week-ends, can flood the country and the newspapers with statistics. Every time I look at his statistics I am reminded of a comptometer machine out of order.  He grinds out the most crazy statistics, all to suit the particular toy with which he is playing at the time.  But when we come to the more important statistics we will see how the Minister for Transport and Power will explain them with his calculating machine efforts.  I would advise him to tell us what has gone wrong with the plan to provide 100,000 new jobs promised in Cork in 1957.  So far, it has not been perceived by anybody, not even by the authors of the plan itself.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in his speech at Galway, and it has been said by many other people who have given the problem close study, that the fundamental cause of emigration is economic. Husbands simply do not abandon their wives and children and go to live in &ldquo;digs,&rdquo; sometimes pretty poor &ldquo;digs,&rdquo; in the built-up areas of Britain merely for the sake of getting to see what these overcrowded places are like; nor do they relish the prospect of keeping two homes just to see what it is like to be paying a landlady for inadequate comforts and plenty of discomfort in other lands.  They are driven in the main by economic considerations. So long as economic considerations are the basis and the stimulus behind our emigration, we have got to find a remedy for it; and the only way it can be found is by providing work for our people at home and by raising living standards here so that the living standards of other countries do not provide too irresistible an attraction for many of our people who do not enjoy these living standards at home.</P>
    <P>If we are to provide work and improve living standards, that means the development of our resources under every head.  I am glad, of course, that in the past we have spent such large sums of money on houses.  I believe that has yielded a substantial dividend in human happiness and has paid a <Col N="646" /> good social dividend to the nation as well, while at the same time providing valuable employment, particularly in periods when no other employment was available.  I am glad we built more hospitals, more sanatoria and that, generally speaking, we have spent considerable sums of money in the development of that side of the national estate, bringing with it, I think, dividends of a social character which have improved the health of the nation and which have made a very big contribution towards raising the standard of living of our people.</P>
    <P>But I think we have reached a stage now in which, apart from that kind of work, valuable though it may be and desirable though it is that it should go on, we have got to search for schemes of development which can be tested and judged against the background of the work these schemes will provide and the conditions which it is possible to provide for those employed on them. If we are to do that, we have got to look, in the main, to our two sources of activity, agriculture and industry, perhaps with the development of State enterprises in various other fields into which the private <i>entrepreneur</i> is not prepared to go because he is unable to see the future in a reassuring way.</P>
    <P>Let us turn to agriculture.  I heard Deputies on the benches on my left say that agriculture provided the best source of offering additional employment to our people.  A big question mark has to be put there.  Many question marks have to be put there if you think agriculture will provide a substantial improvement in employment in the near future.  I frankly do not think it will.  I think the statistics will show to the contrary.</P>
    <P>In this country 40 per cent. of our people are employed in agriculture or as near to 40 as does not matter&mdash;38½ per cent.  That is, four out of every ten people are employed in agriculture. Agriculture plays a predominant part in our whole national development, our national life and our national activity.  We tend to see things, inevitably, through agricultural spectacles because, as I have said, four out of every ten people you meet are engaged in agriculture whereas less than three <Col N="647" /> out of ten are engaged in industry.  It is inevitable, therefore, that agriculture will play an important part in the nation's development.</P>
    <P>In Britain, only five per cent. of the people are engaged in agriculture, as against 40 per cent. here.  From that, one can get a picture of the contrasting systems in the two countries.  In Denmark, our biggest rival in the agricultural-dairying field, approximately 23 per cent. of the people are engaged in agriculture.  If you take Denmark as a serious agricultural competitor on the one hand, if you take Britain which provides the market, and if you take this country competing on the British market against the Danes, you can see what our position is.  We start with a situation in which we employ 40 per cent. of our people in agriculture, the Danes 23 per cent., the British only five per cent.</P>
    <P>I read in the papers this morning some more statistics by the Minister for Transport and Power about the amount of carcass beef and other stuff that was exported to Britain and the increases were about 300 and 400 per cent.  Of course, any simpleton, and only because he is a simpleton, can get figures like that.  That is an insult to people's intelligence.  If you start at zero and agree on a unit, if it is a penny and somebody gives you a penny a day for doing a job and at the end of a month you get tenpence a day for doing a job, you can say you have got a 1,000 per cent. increase but you have got only tenpence at the same time.  Somebody ought to take the Minister for Transport and Power in hand or take that machine of his in hands and give us broad national statistics instead of the kind of angular things that he grinds out for his own edification.</P>
    <P>Look at the facts in agriculture over a period and then you find the real situation.  Between 1929 and 1959, a period of 30 years, a long swing, the output of agriculture has increased by approximately 12 per cent.  Take 60 years as the normal span of human life.  You find that agriculture increased by 24 per cent. during your lifetime.  There is the monumental <Col N="648" /> achievement in agriculture&mdash;a 12 per cent increase over 30 years.  I do not believe there is a country in the world where agriculture has increased by a lesser percentage than that.  If we produce beet to-day that we did not produce in 1929, well and good, that is so; take credit for that to-day, but we have lost large portions of land which have gone out of other crops. The net result is that over 30 years agriculture has increased by approximately 30 per cent. and employment in agriculture has fallen heavily and continues to fall.</P>
    <P>The latest figures show that approximately 10,000 persons per year are leaving agriculture because there is no employment for them there.  If that happens in a highly developed country such as Germany, America, Great Britain, they can find alternative employment in secondary industries, often in manufacturing the agricultural machines which have displaced them on the land, but when you displace 100 Irish workers on agricultural land because of the introduction of agricultural machinery you provide additional employment somewhere in England, or Germany, or America, in the manufacture of agricultural machinery. Our industrialisation is simply not able to take up annually the loss of employment in agriculture.  It has never been able to do so.  It is not able to do it to-day and there is no indication that it will be capable of doing it in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that these people have left the land?  In 1939 we had about 2,000 tractors.  The horse, a familiar sight in the fields in those days, has been largely displaced by the tractor and to-day we have, not 2,000, but 40,000 tractors.  One can see that they were not bought for the sake of driving around the farm.  They were bought to cheapen production on the farm, to displace labour, and they have done that so effectively that on an average 10,000 persons leave agriculture every year.  Mechanisation of agriculture is displacing the land worker.  He is not going into the town or the city: he is going elsewhere because the towns and the cities have <Col N="649" /> their own unemployment problems. He seeks a living where he knows there are vacant jobs.  Indeed, to a very considerable extent that has happened even in the case of road-workers, who have been displaced by the introduction of foreign road-making machinery.  Many of these workers who previously got a livelihood on the roads now look on while foreign-made machines do their work and displace them.</P>
    <P>What we have to ask ourselves is the simple question: Can agriculture arrest this decline of 10,000 per year in the number employed in agriculture? So far, the answer has been &ldquo;no&rdquo; but if emigration is to be mitigated and ultimately arrested then agriculture must play its part although it would be a slowly effective part having regard to the problems to be dealt with.  These problems in agriculture involve a reappraisal, perhaps, of our whole agricultural potential.</P>
    <P>At one time it was thought that grass was the enemy of the Irish people.  Bad grass can be the enemy of the Irish people as bad grass is the enemy of every people in the world but good grass can be an asset to the Irish people and to all peoples because good grass is the raw material of the livestock industry.  What we have to do here is to concentrate on the production of better grass to give us better livestock and in that way get from the land greater wealth than we get from the neglected lands of our country to-day. But even the improvement in livestock and the improvement in grasslands will make no substantial contribution to the plight of the small farmer, and that is an unenviable plight today.</P>
    <P>If he is to be helped, he has got to concentrate on products which will give him a good return, concentration on grass and livestock is beyond the area of land he has at his disposal and beyond his financial resources.  He has got to concentrate on products which will give him a good return and because of that fact, I commend to the Government and to the nation the excellent work of the Irish Sugar Company in proposing to set up pilot plants <Col N="650" /> for the production of fruit and vegetables for sale to the market of 50 million people which we have next door to us, people who are not capable of growing these products themselves and who have to import them from many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>The small farmer has to be encouraged to remain in the production of milk and of pigs and pig products.  It is these that will give him a better return than any other form of agricultural activity.  All farmers, big, small or medium, have need of constant technical and scientific advice.  It is necessary that our farming community should be able to pick the brains of the world so that they can apply to their own lands modern methods which have proved to give satisfaction elsewhere. Too much emphasis cannot be placed on the necessity of bringing to the aid of our farmers modern techniques and knowledge which will enable them to increase their production and to get the best possible value for what they produce.</P>
    <P>I have been gratified, and I am sure that all of us have been gratified, by the growth of industrial production and the expansion in industrial exports. I do not think anyone will attempt to gainsay the fact that this impetus in industrial exports has been largely motivated by the tax concessions which are very substantial and attractive and a very generous contribution by the State and the people to those engaged in the production and export of industrial goods.  These tax concessions have induced many people to go into the export market who would otherwise have left that market alone.  The inviting of foreign investment and technical knowhow to this country is showing results, especially when it is linked with the facilities provided in the form of taxation reliefs on profits from exports.</P>
    <P>There was a time when it was very unpopular to invite foreign manufacturers to come here and manufacture goods which we could not produce ourselves.  Very many more than one member of the Fianna Fáil Party nearly had apoplexy when they heard of the idea.  Now all these loves and <Col N="651" /> hates are over, so far as that issue is concerned.  Everybody now seems to have grown up to the realisation that if countries all over the world are satisfied to invite foreign investors to help them, there cannot be anything wrong in the idea of the dwindling Irish nation protecting itself against further annihilation by inviting foreign technicians and financial investors to come in.  It is only a very few years since some people on the Government front bench said that inviting foreign investments to this country meant selling the Irish nation.  The absurdity of all that must now be obvious to all and I do not want to cause blushes by quoting the names of the distinguished gentlemen who used language of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that many of our old firms have now gone into the export market and are showing a new enthusiasm for export.  It is also a good thing that it is possible for them to share in the tax concession which has been made generously available by the people and the State to encourage the development of industry and the employment of more people in their own land.  However, there are many who are still not availing of the export possibilities and there must be some deliberate, conscientious systematic drive to require those people who can produce goods to try to sell them in the export market.  It is only in that way that we can hope to expand our industrial potential.</P>
    <P>Our own home market is a small one but it is the home market price that very often helps the export of goods to outside markets.  We have a small home market which, in numbers, is not any greater than that of many large cities in the world.  It is on that home market that we have to base our exports.  It will absorb a limited quantity of our goods, but we have to try, not only to find export markets for all the goods we produce, but markets which will buy our goods at rewarding prices and not simply take them because they carry substantial subsidies.</P>
    <P>I now get back to what I said before by way of underlining the fact that, <Col N="652" /> despite their commendable expansion, our industries are still incapable of taking each year the number of people leaving the land, to say nothing whatever of the 20,000 new jobs that are necessary to give employment to the outturn of our schools and colleges every year.  So long as our industrial position is such that it can make no contribution to taking up the sag in employment, then, whether we like it or not, a solution for unemployment will be found in one way only&mdash;by way of emigration.  Those who are not willing to emigrate are costing us substantial sums each year by way of the small allowances made available under the Social Services Act to people who are compelled to remain idle because of economic inertia.</P>
    <P>A continuance of the industrial drive is vital and attention must also be directed to new methods of increasing grass lands and livestock and to new products in general.  The twelve per cent. increase in our agricultural production in 30 years is appalling and more especially when you remember that we have a British market of over 50 million people at our doorstep. There are other fields of endeavour in which we can make a contribution towards the relief of unemployment. There is the development of our tourist industry, the development of our peat resources and electrical development. All these could play, and are playing, a useful part in the provision of employment at home and the development of the nation's resources.</P>
    <P>What worries me in connection with all this is that while we discuss these problems at home and are not conspicuously successful in solving them, there has emerged in Europe two trade blocs, the E.E.C. representing the Six and the E.F.T.A. representing the Seven.  We are members of neither bloc; we are among the undeveloped countries of Europe and we are numbered among the forgotten five of the O.E.E.C. bloc of countries.</P>
    <P>My fear in connection with the development of these two large trading blocs is that it may seriously impact upon our development here. Britain is a member of the European Free Trade Association and in the <Col N="653" /> course of time, by the repeal of tariffs, the other six countries there will be entitled to have their industrial goods, and maybe in time their agricultural goods, exported to Britain free of duty. If we get into the E.F.T.A. with the British or into the Six of which Britain is not a member now, we shall be compelled to repeal our tariffs, to reduce them proportionately.</P>
    <P>Both these groups have decided to repeal their tariffs at the rate of ten per cent. per year.  They may be prepared, in the case of an undeveloped country such as ours, to allow the repeal to take place at a lesser rate but, one way or the other, whether we repeal at the rate of ten per cent. a year or five per cent, a year, we will then be marching systematically towards a situation in which there will be complete free trade.  If we are in a group with the British, whether it is the Six or the Seven, we must face the situation in which British goods and the goods of all their partners will be entitled to come into this country free of duty.</P>
    <P>It may very well be that a firm like Guinness's could compete with them all.  It may very well be that some of our older concerns engaging in indigenous activities might be able to compete but I am as certain as I am standing here that a very large number of our industries will not be able to compete against the highly mechanised, highly rationalised and highly capitalised countries which will form these trading blocs and that for these industries, which are not able to compete, there will be a rather dismal future. As the Taoiseach said recently, we must start dismantling our tariffs and many industries may have to close down.</P>
    <P>That is a serious situation because once we are compelled to allow British goods in here free of duty&mdash;and that seems to be an essential and integral part of the Seven and the Six agreements so long as Britain is a member of it&mdash;unless we do something between now and the day we reach that stage, grievous harm will be done not only to our industries but to the prospects of our people being employed at <Col N="654" /> home.  All this might well kill, unless we are careful the way we tread, the possibilities of further development in the export market.  I believe the development of both these groups separately will be serious for us and may prove to be fatal in some respects unless we can, as I think we should be able to do, get the British to recognise our special position as it was recognised under G.A.T.T. because of our proximity to Britain.</P>
    <P>In this whole matter I take the view, not a Party view but a national view, that we are all together, because whatever happens by the wrongful development of these two blocs and because of any unprofitable association by us with either or both blocs, will impact upon every one of us.  It will not just hit one Party or two Parties; it will hit the whole nation and give us problems that will not be solved for many a day if it does not completely destroy the possibility of maintaining the viability of the economy.</P>
    <P>I said before in this House something that will bear saying again, that we ought to recognise that nobody owes us a living in the world; nobody cares how we get on in the day-to-day effort to maintain a balance and to maintain the nation's integrity.  The world will expect us to help ourselves. It will not expect us to do nothing but blame the other fellow whoever he may now be.  I do not think the world is in any mood either to understand or sympathise with us if we do not do the best we can for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Much has been done.  One may complain this has not been done and that has not been done which should have been done.  Somebody once said that the best way to measure progress is not to look at how far more you have to go but to stand and look back at the distance you have come.  If that test is applied to our efforts over the past 40 years, we will see what has been done in the field of housing, hospitals, sanatoria, roads, water, electricity, peat, air, shipping and other services.  All that represents a very substantial achievement for our people or, indeed, for any people. However, we must recognise that the <Col N="655" /> world has also moved on.  We have done nothing that has shaken the world.  We have done nothing better than the rest of the world; in fact, we have gone slower in many respects, particularly in industrial and agricultural development, than the rest of the world or even the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>If we are to maintain our stand and our association with Europe, not as a permanently undeveloped nation but as an equal partner in the European comity of nations, we must resort to ceaseless striving by our people to strengthen and develop our economic fabric.  Frankly, I do not see today that we are taking the necessary steps to give that kind of aggressive leadership to our people which is so necessary to beget their goodwill and their enthusiasm.  I see nothing happening, for example, to capture the enthusiasm of men and women, of adolescents in the small towns, in the villages or in the rural areas.  Life for them just runs as it did 40 years ago.  Their lives are just as bleak.  Unemployment is a permanent resident with them; wages are low&mdash;inevitably low in the small, isolated communities.  There are no industries and the small farms provide only a meagre living for the small farmer and practically no improvement in his standard of living.</P>
    <P>If any Deputy cares to check that, let him go to any town in his constituency which has not got a new, attractive, and developing industry. He will find life there is as it was 40 years ago.  The problems are the same as they were 40 years ago.  The standard of living has not risen as it ought to have risen in the period of 40 years.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult in these places to generate, capture and maintain any real enthusiasm among the people.  I think there is scope for some kind of evangelist to galvanise these people into action on the basis that, unless the nation can work hard and utilise its energies to the fullest, there is a danger we shall slip back so rapidly that we shall lose touch with the pace of progress in the civilised world around us.  Until we harness the <Col N="656" /> enthusiasm of the small people in the small towns and villages, I am afraid we shall continue to have a substantial number of unemployed persons, emigration will continue and this day 10 years our population will be even lower than it is today.  I regret if that should be the course of development. We are all in this together. The whole nation&mdash;and the Government has prime responsibility in this&mdash; ought to decide on some way in which we can avoid these rocks and try to get unity at least on the essentials on which we agree so that we will get a dividend in which the nation as a whole will share.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long road back to the time when Fianna Fáil were going to run this country on £10,000,000.  That was a time when another Government was in office and it was costing £20,000,000.  It is a long way back, but the same people bring in a Book of Estimates now amounting to £131,000,000.  Of course, at that time the same Party must have had some view of what was to come because they were about to find gold in this country of ours.  Surely it was never more important to find it than at present when we find that it costs nearly £132,000,000 to run the country?</P>
      <P>This year alone there is a sum of £110,744,347 for what they call &ldquo;Other Services&rdquo;&mdash;the Supply Services. If Deputies look up the Book of Estimates for the year 1957-58 they will find the present figure is an increase of £8,600,000&mdash;more than £8½ millions of an increase in roughly four years.  In the first year after 1957-58, the Fianna Fáil Party said: &ldquo;Give us time.&rdquo;  The next year they said: &ldquo;Give us more time,&rdquo; but now that the Government is on the brink of extinction they cannot ask for double time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very people who, when they were on this side of the House in 1957, said that the bill then was an overburden, come in here now and tell us, with all the cheek in the world, that a sum of £8½ million is no great increase. <Col N="657" /> That is why I want the Galway Fianna Fáil Deputies here in the House.  They had better hear what I have to say and try to explain the matter.  An increase of £8½ million in four years is bad enough but we must add to that the £9,000,000 that the Fianna Fáil Government took off in food subsidies making a grand total of £17½ million.  And this extra burden is placed on the backs of a population which has dwindled at a far greater rate during the past four years.</P>
    <P>There is no one in this country who can put something over more quickly and more easily than the present Minister for Finance.  No man is more able to do it.  I wonder how, no matter how able and slick he is, no matter how cute he is, he will put this £17½ millions extra over on the electorate?  I wish that Deputies Killilea, Kitt, Carty and Millar were here.  I expect they will be asked that question about the £17½ millions when they go down to Galway to fight the general election.  They might learn here how to explain it away.  Perhaps I could enlighten them.</P>
    <P>Mind you, the present position is very far from the promises they made in the last general election.  Then the promises were that there would be reductions&mdash;that the Civil Service was top-heavy and that there would be a reduction in numbers.  On this side of the House you had people like Deputy Corry when in Opposition&mdash;I do not see him here now&mdash;saying that the Civil Service were drones and should be exterminated.  Not only that but even after the election the Minister came in and said there would be a reduction in Government expenditure. What have we in this Book of Estimates? At least 500 additional civil servants in four years on the payroll instead of the reduction promised by Fianna Fáil at a time when they would promise anything, before the general election.  It was also promised by the Minister after the election.</P>
    <P>I wonder how that can be explained? That is why I wanted the Galway Deputies, to whom I have referred, to come into the House so that the Minister could explain things like that to <Col N="658" /> them.  Instead of having a reduction in Government expenditure we have something additional, a new Minister. They call him Minister for Transport and Power; I call him Minister for no transport and damn little power and dear power.  He is the one who is now going around the country shoving out his chest, what he has of it&mdash;and that is not much.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power is the man who is now going around the country telling people how well off they are and what the Government have achieved.  We also have Deputy Kitt going about talking of what the Government have achieved.  Their achievements are very little.  Apart from the increases I have mentioned we have increases in postal charges, electricity charges, hospital charges and bus fares since this Government came into office.  We have increased prices for bread, flour and butter and all the commodities necessary for life among the poorer sections of the community.  The Government have come in here for an extra £17,500,000 to talk about their achievements.  These achievements are dearer prices for the essential commodities. They are wondering what is the cause of the flight from the land; why, during the last few years 200,000 of our people have emigrated.  Think of that, with a population of less than 3,000,000 and probably much less when we have the results of the next census.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They say there are more people at work.  I always give credit where it is due and in certain industries I believe <Col N="659" /> there are more people at work but I want to point out, regardless of what Deputy Norton will say, that agriculture is the greatest industry and the greatest hope for this country.   I believe it is the only industry that creates money as every other industry only deals in money but the man who works on the land pulls new money out of the ground.  Agriculture alone creates new money.  At present we have 50,000 fewer people employed in agriculture.  It is all right for Deputy Norton or any other Deputy to talk about machinery, such as tractors coming in.  I think Deputy Booth spoke on the same lines.  It suits him: he sells them, but he has left the House now.  People are fleeing from agriculture and the land. The flight is worse than at the time of the Famine.  Never was it so bad as it is now.</P>
    <P>I had the happy experience of being present in my own Church at Dunmore, County Galway last Sunday when it was visited&mdash;as happens every three years&mdash;by His Grace the Archbishop of Tuam.  While he praised the people of this small parish he said he very much regretted to tell them that within the last three years 34 homes had been closed down.  The keys had been turned in the doors and not alone had the sons and daughters gone but the fathers and mothers with them.  He also regretted to say that by order of the present Government one national school in the parish had been closed.  That is only one parish and these were the words of the Archbishop of Tuam.  Then you hear Deputy Kitt and the like of him, with faces of brass, talking of the achievements of the present Government.</P>
    <P>What I have pointed out are the achievements of the present Government and they are nothing to be proud of.  Then, they say: &ldquo;Look at the unemployment figures; they are down since last year.&rdquo;  Of course they are because the people have all gone away. Go to any church in the West of Ireland or any public meeting and what do you find?  The children and the very old people.  All between are <Col N="660" /> gone.  Those are some of the achievements of Fianna Fáil.  May I quote for them the words of a great writer:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But a bold peasantry, its country's pride,</P>
    <P>When once destroyed can never be supplied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position is that our country's peasantry has been destroyed by Fianna Fáil.  I will give the House some figures.  The Minister loves figures.  I would appeal to him and his Government to take a look at a little booklet supplied recently by the Taoiseach's Department.  It is pointed out in that booklet that employment on the land, on forestry and fisheries accounted in 1948 for 429,000 people.  In the year 1961 it is estimated 400,000 will be employed.  There is a reduction in that sphere alone of 29,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had been listening he would know.  Let him look at the booklet supplied by the Taoiseach's Department, the Central Statistics branch.  He will be able to read it, will he not?  He will find a reduction of 29,000 estimated for the coming year.  Despite that, the cry is that industry is &ldquo;away&rdquo;, and all because a few Japs, a few Jews, or a few Negroes come in here for the taxpayers to build factories for them, contribute to the cost of their machinery, give them slave labour&mdash; if it can be got&mdash;protect them on every side so that they can export their goods into other countries under the label &ldquo;Irish.&rdquo;  I warn the Minister they will pack their bags to-morrow, or the day after, and clear off, and they can tell this Government, or any other government, where they get off.  They can snap their fingers at any Government because they care damn all except for what they can get as soft as they can get it from the people of our country.  That is the kind of increase that there is in industry.  That is the kind of thing the Minister for No Transport and Dawn Little Power is now running around the country boasting about.  But he is not boasting about the 29,000 fewer people in <Col N="661" /> employment in rural Ireland and on the land of this country.  There is no danger of him doing that.  He knows nothing about it, and he cares a damn sight less.  For Deputy Cunningham's benefit, if he wants to challenge the figures I have given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Addressing the annual general meeting of the Cork Savings Bank on 17th February Most Rev. Dr. Lucey said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No amount of talk about the improved balance of payments, or the rising total of our exports, or the increased number employed in industry can get over the fact that people are still our greatest export. We must not be led to believe that because there is more money in the bank all is well with the country. Let us talk of Ireland in terms of persons and population not in terms of trade figures and production, and the truth as to how she stands will be obvious.  What is wrong?  The <Col N="662" /> answer, I think is, that our prosperity is not properly distributed.  Agriculture gets too little of the national income and, of the little it gets, far too little finds its way to the small farmer.  Consider just the mere fact. The farming community in 1960 only got ?ths of all the income it got in the year 1955 and, of that total, the small farmer got even less proportionately than he did five years ago.  Is it any wonder so many holdings are disappearing and with them so many families, so many people?  Since it is not in our power to remedy that ourselves, let us at least not keep silent about it but bring it to the notice of the public and try to stir the public conscience about it.  To plan for increased prosperity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is well worth listening to.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;To plan for increased prosperity without ensuring fair shares for all of that prosperity is unworthy of a Christian people.</P>
      <P>Those are the words of Most Rev. Dr. Lucey.  Surely the Minister knows the cause of the trouble.</P>
      <P>I well remember when Fianna Fáil were on this side of the House and certain matters came up here.  The present Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, sitting on these benches, was the person who said: &ldquo;You are the Government. It is your job to remedy it. It is your job to do it.&rdquo;  But to-day we are asked by the very self-same people who said that: &ldquo;What do you suggest?&rdquo;  They would not suggest anything, of course.  They have no suggestion to offer, but they will pretend that they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few weeks after that, during the course of the general election they had 100,000 jobs to offer.  Do you remember that?  They had 100,000 extra jobs.  They had the slogan: &ldquo;Wives, vote Fianna Fáil and put your husbands back to work.&rdquo;  They also said: &ldquo;Get cracking&mdash;let us beat the crisis.&rdquo;  They had all those stupid, if I may so describe them, slogans.  Some <Col N="663" /> people, I regret to say, believed them. They thought something would happen and they put them back.  But to-day the position is as I have explained it. It is the position in rural Ireland; even Deputy Cunningham must admit that it is a fact in Donegal.</P>

      <P>I was of course. And what is wrong with talking about Sligo-Leitrim?  When we hear from different parts of the House about subsidies for this, subsidies for that and subsidies for the other, in my view the real trouble is, as the Bishop of Cork explained, that they are not going in the right direction.  There has been a reduction in the price of wheat&mdash; about 11/- a barrel&mdash;by the very people who were going to increase it. You have subsidies for fertilisers, but where do they go?  They go to the larger farmers.  As far as the small farmer is concerned, the land is not worth the rates being paid on it and that is why we have the flight from the land.</P>
      <P>The present Government raised the price of flour from 4/3 to 8/3 a stone. That was a very harmful action.  That was the day people decided to fly away.  They were not able to pay that price.  Something definitely must be done to relieve the rates on the small tenant farmer of this country. It is my view, and it has always been my view, that up to a certain valuation, say up to £40 or £50, there should be no rates of any description on agricultural land in this country.</P>

      <P>Listening to the members of the Government talk about progress, one would think that somebody believed them.  I do not believe that they believe in it themselves. They know there is no progress. They know that within the last two years 100,000 of our people have left the country.  They know that homes are closed up, that keys are turned in locks, that fathers and mothers have gone as well as the other members of the family.  The great cause of that flight from the country was the increase in the price of flour. By raising the price of flour the Government have achieved one great aim.  I believe that the Fianna Fáil Party think that the small farmers of this country should be exterminated. If one follows up their attitude for the last few years, one must agree that every act and every deed of Fianna Fáil was to exterminate the small farmers in every way they could.  I remember on one occasion before the last general election my good friend, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, said that there were two classes of flour in this country&mdash;the rough flour for the countryman and the white flour for those who could afford it.  It is now 8/3d. a stone.  At that time it was 4/3d. a stone.  That is the reason 200,000 of our people have left the <Col N="665" /> country.  That is one of the great achievements of Fianna Fáil about which we hear Deputy Kitt speak.</P>

      <P>It has been mentioned in the course of this debate that the likelihood, sooner or later, of there being complete free trade all over Europe will have such a serious impact on our economy that we shall not be able to stand up to it.  That is certainly true to a very great extent. At any rate, it is a fear that should not be discounted and which should be taken into account in the preparation of the nation's policies and the budgets necessary to sustain those policies.  If we were not afraid that the results of free trade might bring disaster which could not easily be repaired, it might not be a bad thing if it came about because it would jerk us into an atmosphere of realism and at least rid us of the obligation, self-imposed on themselves by every Government, to prove that they have done better than anybody who went before them. There can be nothing so dangerous as the conclusions that can be apparently reached from arguments based on half-truths.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I can leave Deputy Donnellan's demolition to the Deputies from Galway.  I would rather think that my remarks about conclusions and arguments based on half truths would be more referable to the cases made here by the various Ministers of the Government and the speakers who attempted to support them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton talked about the necessity for an evangelist to bring this country to a proper appreciation of all that is necessary to put it right, to lead its people and harness their enthusiasm to the degree necessary in order to sustain them in the difficult role of surviving economically in the world of today.  But I do not think that evangelist can be found in the ranks of the Fianna Féil Party, at any rate.  One of the necessary qualifications for an evangelist is that his words must be simple and that they must have the basis of truth that will prevail not alone from <Col N="666" /> elections to election but all down the ages.  If we examine the statements of the Fianna Fáil evangelists in the course of the last general election and contract the results that followed from them, I think we can dispose of them as likely candidates in the evangelism which Deputy Norton considers so necessary for the survival of our people.</P>
    <P>On an occasion such as this, we must examine the figure which the people are asked to pay, examine the results likely to flow from that, and examine in particular the capacity of the people to bear the burden they are asked to bear.  In this Vote on Account, and taking into consideration the overall figure of £131,000,000 which the Minister for Finance will seek from the people to keep the policy of this Government in operation, one is driven to the other conclusion: that we have each year an ever-increasing figure by way of demand and, unfortunately&mdash;I do not refer to emigration in any gloating fashion and when I say &ldquo;unfortunately&rdquo; I say it quite sincerely&mdash;there is an even-decreasing number of people and family units to bear that demand.</P>
    <P>Somewhere in between there should be some sort of bolstering up of the economy, either agriculturally or industrially, to bridge that gap.  I do not see anything of it, either in the Minister's opening address or from a perusal of the Estimates.  That simply means that fewer will have to contribute more.  In the circumstances in which we live that will be a not too easy task.  I always thought&mdash;this applies to the whole of the time in which this State has enjoyed its independence&mdash;that policies were designed here simply for the good land leaving out, except in minor cases, the bad land, and the in between land.  Until such time as there are policies&mdash;particularly in relation to agriculture and possibly in relation to industry, too&mdash; designed to have regional effect or to be adapted so that they can be applied regionally, we will not make any real progress.</P>
    <P>The man on the small holding has a contribution to make to the economy of the man on the larger holding.  The man on the smaller holding can produce up to a certain stage only: the product must be finished on the bigger <Col N="667" /> holding where the owner has greater facilities, greater scope and, incidentally, greater capital.  In these circumstances nobody will disagree but that a different situation obtains in the area roughly west of the Shannon, with the possible exclusion of parts of Roscommon and the richer portions of East Galway.  A different situation obtains there from the North of Donegal right down to East Cork.  It is of those people I speak, naturally, when I address myself to Votes on Account, policies and systems of economics.</P>
    <P>Whatever we like to think and whatever our allegiances are, it is an undeniable fact that over the last four years&mdash;I know it was going on to some extent before that&mdash;the emigration drain has been at its greatest.  What I said, speaking on the Budget in 1957, would, I think, bear repetition.  I said the only result I could see for the people I represented of the withdrawal of the food subsidies and the consequent increases in the prices of essential commodities was that more people would emigrate, and emigrate at a younger age, than the people before them.  That was not a prophecy but, unfortunately, that pronouncement turned out to be only too true.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands in an impassioned oration tried to convince the House, which was rather difficult because he was not really convinced himself, that such a thing was not happening and that he did not know of any area where there were any deserted houses or deserted villages. They are there.  I have them here in a debate some time ago for three parishes in my constituency.  In one half of one of those parishes there were 122 empty houses, in the other there were 12 and in another whole parish 25 families had gone away. That was last year.</P>
    <P>The numbers have increased since that time, I am sure.  In one case, certainly, the number has increased from 25 to 27 up to last week.  The Minister for Lands asserted that there might be a pool of land available to him to relieve congestion, if he knew where <Col N="668" /> these places were.  They are there and any of his inspectors in any part of the West of Ireland can tell him.  I am sure that that is true of West Donegal. I am sure it is equally true of South Mayo as it is of North Mayo of which I speak with particular knowledge and accuracy in this regard.  I am sure it is true of Clare and parts of Galway.  I am certain that it is true of North Leitrim.  The people on the opposite benches who have come back from there after the recent campaign must realise all too bitterly that it is true.</P>
    <P>Even if you are not prepared to admit that, you must admit something that is factual.  On the register for Sligo-Leitrim on which the recent bye-election was fought, which was that of 15th September, 1959, there were over 4,000 fewer people than there were on the register compiled on 15th September, 1956.  Where did they go? There was not any kind of plague or pestilence there, other than that imposed economically by the Fianna Fáil Party through this Government, that caused them to go away.</P>
    <P>If you examine it in what might be called &ldquo;micro-economics,&rdquo; take the average small holding in the West of Ireland where a man and his wife and probably seven or eight children will consume an eight stone bag of flour in a fortnight; they are suddenly asked to find £1 6s. 0d. each fortnight over and above what they previously had been spending in addition to extras on almost every commodity including butter if they are buying it. Where does he get it?  Where could a householder get that extra money? The price of his cattle had gone down. I am not blaming Fianna Fáil for that, with the possible exception of blaming them for not attending to the market and consolidating it when they were wasting the nation's time and Parliament's time on futile things like P.R.  They might have done something during that time, but that is a debatable point.  Whether it was due to world trends or mismanagement here, cattle prices were depressed so that the small farmer's income was reduced while the price of the things he had to buy was increased.  How could he bridge the gap?  The only <Col N="669" /> way was to send somebody extra away to earn either in England or America.</P>
    <P>Let nobody deny that they are going.  They are going, not alone to England but to America.  Anybody who is in touch with the American Consulate here must see the flower of this country going away.  Anybody who is in touch, like Deputy Carty in his profession as a national teacher down the country, must know exactly what is happening with regard to population trends.</P>

There are no marriages taking place in rural Ireland.  Everybody knows there has been a great decline.  There is nobody to marry. The girls have gone to America or England.

      <P>By and large, the situation in the country as a result of the policy of this Government over the last four years is not a result of which anybody could be properly proud.  No doubt, the Minister for Finance will have reasons to advance as to why things are not better and no doubt he will tell us that things are better than we say they are.  Nevertheless, the average man and woman knows what the position is, how difficult it is, and all I would ask is that while, of course, the Minister for Finance has to make a case for his Government and for his Party, he should not delude the people to an extreme degree because it is by such delusion that there will be smaller and smaller polls and less faith in us as public representatives.</P>

      <P>What I might say generally with regard to the debate over the last three or four days is that it has not been very helpful.  There has been a lot of criticism but no suggestions for <Col N="670" /> improvement.  Could any Deputy who has sat here&mdash;and the two Deputies on the Front Bench opposite have sat out this debate almost as well as I have and have heard all the speeches&mdash; mention to me now any suggestion that was made by a Fine Gael speaker for improving matters?  It has been a long, long litany of criticism of conditions but that is not going to be very helpful to the country.  It may&mdash;and I suppose it was so designed&mdash;improve the electoral chances of the Fine Gael Party.  Whether that is going to be of any benefit for the country or not many people would be doubtful.  I have no doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be.  I am on the point that what we should do in this House is to try to get the facts and, knowing the facts, have suggestions of what the improvements might be.</P>
      <P>I shall just mention some of the matters raised by some of the speakers before I go on to what might be regarded as a more constructive part of this speech.  Deputy Sweetman started off by saying that expenditure is higher by £8 million than it was in 1957-58 and said that you could add to that the saving made on the food subsidies, which is a fair enough point, I must admit, as far as Deputy Sweetman is concerned.  But, of course, there are always other sides to the picture.  I came into this job for the first time about this time four years ago, about the middle of March, 1957, and the Estimates were before me as presented by Deputy Sweetman.  I did not know at the time how we were going to meet those Estimates.  I had no idea at all about that until I got reports from the officials of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton made a statement there that he had said before the election and during the election that if Fianna Fáil came into power they would remove the food subsidies. Looking back on it, if I had been in Deputy Norton's place at that time <Col N="671" /> and had been a member of that Government and knew fairly well that Fianna Fáil were coming into power, judging from the temper in the country at the time, I would have said the same thing because I would have known, as Deputy Norton knew, that you could not possibly balance the Budget without taking off food subsidies at that time.  You could not do it.  There was a big gap there.</P>
    <P>I put before the Government what my proposals were and they agreed to them and the Dáil agreed to them in the end.  I said, &ldquo;We cannot possibly raise more than about £3 million in new taxation&rdquo;.  I think Deputies understand quite well that there is a limit to what you can raise.  I shall give an instance of what I mean.  If you put a penny on 20 cigarettes it will bring in between £900,000 and £1,000,000.  If you put twopence on that packet of cigarettes, the second penny will bring in only about £500,000 and if you put on threepence the third penny will bring in only £200,000 or £300,000.  It is the same with any other tax you think of.  There is really a limit to the amount of taxation you can put on.</P>
    <P>I found that the very most I could put on was £3,000,000.  I had to advise the Government to do away with the food subsidies and even then we could not get a balance.  There was a deficit that year of £5.8 million. If I had made an honest and strong attempt that year to balance the Budget and leave on the food subsidies as they were, it would have meant that I would have to put on £15,000,000 in extra taxation.  During the election Deputy Norton and the other members of the Government knew that.  We did not know it.  I did not know it.  The knew that we could not do it without taking off the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>What would they have done if they had come in?  I have asked them that question several times.  I have asked them where would they get that £15,000,000 if they did not take off the food subsidies and they never answered the question.  I asked them during the Budget debate of 1957 if <Col N="672" /> they could suggest where I would get even £1,000,000 and there was no suggestion from them.  It is all very fine now for Deputies on the other side to talk about taking off the food subsidies but it has been done and I notice that Fine Gael have not said that, if they come back, they will restore them. They know it could not be done.</P>
    <P>Before I leave that point of the promise alleged to have been made by Fianna Fáil about the food subsidies, perhaps I should again remind the House that Fine Gael put their staff, their very able staff, to examine every word spoken by Fianna Fáil in that election.  They examined every leaflet issued and every advertisement that appeared in the local newspapers and the only thing they could find in all that search and research was that some of our responsible speakers had said that they had no intention of removing the food subsidies and that, in fact, they had come to no such decision.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could claim that I was more of a student of politics than some of my colleagues because I came to the conclusion that I did not need to do any speaking in that election. I knew we could not help winning that election and I only made eight speeches in the whole campaign.  They were very short and the only trouble I got was from Fine Gael supporters who were pressing me that we should throw our whole heart into the election. They were afraid of their lives that the same thing would happen again as happened in 1954.  I made no promise in that election.  I knew very well that we could not help winning that election because the people were determined that they would not put the Coalition back again.  However, if during that election somebody had put the question to me from the crowd: &ldquo;Is it true that if you become the Government you will remove the food subsidies?&rdquo;  I would have said that we had made no such decision and that we had no such intention because we did not know what the position was.  Deputy Norton and his colleague knew what the position was.  We did not.  Therefore, they were able to make the announcement that if we <Col N="673" /> got into office we would remove the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>Going back again to Deputy Sweetman's figure, which is correct, that expenditure is up by £8 million in addition to the food subsidies being abolished, I want to say that there were reasons why the Estimates had to go up.  Opposition speakers say that expenditure is going up and up and up and that it was never as high before as it is now.  In five years' time, whatever Minister for Finance is here will be faced with the same argument. Every country has had the same experience because the value of money is going down all the time and therefore the amount of expenditure is going up.</P>
    <P>Take three Departments.  Take the Department of Agriculture, the Estimate for it has gone up by £8 million. I am quite sure that there is not a member of the Fine Gael Party who would say publicly that that is too much.  No one will say that it is too much.  The Estimate for Education has gone up by about £3 million.  Not a member of the Fine Gael Party will say that that is too much.  The Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has gone up by £2½ million. That is a trading Department and if the expenditure goes up we will get the same amount back because it is a Department made to pay.</P>
    <P>There are three Departments with an increased expenditure of £15 million and I am quite sure there is not a member of the Fine Gael Party who would point the finger at a single item in any of these three Departments and say that there is £5 or £15 that should not be there.  There is not very much use in that type of criticism from Fine Gael about increased expenditure if they do not say that if they were in power they would cut such an estimate by a million, half a million or a quarter of a million.  No such suggestion has been made here.</P>
    <P>Between 1956-57, the last year in which the Coalition was a full year in office and 1960-61, which is the year just concluding now, the current expenditure has increased by 10.9 per cent.  One thing on which Deputies <Col N="674" /> should agree is that if the national income can bear that increase things are not too bad.  While we would like to make economies where possible, if we are not spending a bigger percentage of our income on national expenditure we are leaving the country in relatively the same position.  In those four years the gross national produce rose by 16.3 per cent.  Actually we took only 10.9 per cent. for central government expenditure.</P>
    <P>I would like also in that connection to deal with a point made by Deputy Sweetman.  He said that we were not even making as much progress as many of the other European countries.  In a publication by O.E.C.C., <i>Statistical Bulletin,</i> January, 1961, which any Deputy can consult by going down to the Library, there is given the volume of gross national production in the various countries for 1959, which is the last year for which there is a full return.  Ireland increased the volume by 2.9 per cent.  We beat certain countries and were beaten by other countries, but we beat certain important countries.  We were better than Belgium, 2.4 per cent.; we were better than France, 2.1 per cent.; we were better than Iceland, which is a small country, 2.5 per cent.; and better than the United Kingdom, 2.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>That was no mean achievement.  I need hardly say that 1959 was the first year in the history of this country that we came into the top class, as it were, in national output.  In 1959 it was higher than that of three very important countries: Belgium, France and the United Kingdom.  That is on the basis of volume.  On the basis of value there is a different result.  In that case Ireland had an increase of 4.7 per cent. which was better than Belgium, 3 per cent.; Switzerland, 3.1 per cent.; and the United Kingdom, 3.6 per cent. Therefore, we have taken our place amongst the nations of the world&mdash;to use a very old and well-honoured ex-pression&mdash;and taken our place with great credit.  I have not the returns for 1960 yet.  We just have the national income in industrial output which is better than last year.  It has gone up from 6 per cent. to 7 per cent.  In all <Col N="675" /> probability, therefore, when we get the complete figures for 1960 we will find ourselves in an even better position than in respect of 1959 and we will find ourselves vying with some of the principal countries in Europe in our progress in national output.</P>
    <P>Unemployment was mentioned by many speakers.  I have always thought, in dealing with this question, that unemployment and emigration should be taken together because it is conceivable that unemployment may go down, and there is emigration instead; or it is conceivable that emigration may go down and people will go on to the unemployment register instead.  It is well therefore to take account of the two figures at the same time.</P>
    <P>Taking the unemployment figures, they are lower now by over 30,000 than they were in 1957.  If you take the people that have no work&mdash;and they must go on the unemployment register or emigrate&mdash;we are at least 31,000 better off than we were in 1957.  Let us look at the emigration figures.  There was evidently a dossier passed around to the Fine Gael Deputies by the Fine Gael office because they all used the same figure except that some of them improved on it.  The first man to speak gave the following figures: 60,000 for 1957; 40,000 for 1958; 38,000 for 1959 and 48,000 for 1960. When he added them up he got 182,000 as an aggregate for the whole year.  It is a very disturbing figure; there is no doubt about that.  However, they were not satisfied with that. They called it 200,000.  Any speaker who came along after that said 200,000 emigrated since Fianna Fáil came into power.</P>
    <P>It is no trouble to Fine Gael to misrepresent or misconstrue figures in that way when the figures are in their favour and against us.  They all spoke on the basis of emigration for those four years being 200,000.  In relation to the figure for 1957, may I say that we came into office at a time when the country was overcome with despair? There was not a shilling credit to be got by anybody.  People had been thrown out of work because the banks would not give the industries and other <Col N="676" /> enterprises money with which to carry on.  Everything was in a desperate mess when we came into power in 1957.  It was not possible for any Government or any Party to make that position right in the course of a month or two. Therefore, 1957 should be eliminated. If Fine Gael had any shame they would forget about 1957.  They would give us at least some breathing space and take 1958, 1959 and 1960.</P>
    <P>However, we will not ask them to take away 1957.  If you take the monthly figures in 1957 you will find that half that 60,000 went out in January and February and we are not going to take credit or responsibility for the people that went out in January and February before the general election. If you do that it will be found that the figure is down to 150,000 not 200,000.  Take the 150,000 for the period when we came into office until the end of December last.  If you deduct from that, which is only fair, the 31,000 that were taken off the unemployment list, the figure then becomes 120,000 which, as I want to say again, is a very unpleasant fact.  Anyway it is 120,000, not 200,000.</P>
    <P>Let us take 120,000 as the fact and not the Fine Gael figure of 200,000.  If you take the three years before that when Fine Gael were in office, the figure is a little bit more.  There is not much to be gained now by bringing up that fact, but it was a little bit more. Emigration is a great evil in this country and we should do our best to stop it.  It has been there under all Governments and the situation has not improved though I might possibly claim a small improvement if figures were analysed minutely.  Generally speaking, it has not improved and it is a thing that should be dealt with if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael speakers said&mdash;I think they believe it themselves, because they say these things with such assurance that they must believe them&mdash; that I want to persuade the country that the cost of living went up more under their Government than under this Government.  That is not true. The cost of living is all the time going up slightly, but there was never, I <Col N="677" /> think, such a long period of stability as from the end of 1956 to the end of 1960.</P>
    <P>However, leaving the question of stability out of it and taking the February figures from 1954 to 1957 and again from 1957 to 1961, in the former period the increase in the cost of living was eleven points, while in the latter it was 14 points.  The Fine Gael men are fairly quick at making calculations so they can calculate this: if the index goes up by 11 points in three years is not that worse than 14 points in four years?  It may be only slightly worse, but it gives no grounds for the sort of complacent Fine Gael speeches made so often about the difficulties faced by the population under Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Remember that in the figure of 14 points for four years, food subsidies were included and, as far as the food subsidies are concerned, big sections of the population have been compensated for the increase in the cost of living; the old age pensioners for instance.  While the Coalition were here for three years there was an 11-point increase in the cost of living, but old age pensions went up by only 2/6d.  In the four years we have been in office we have put the pensions up by 4/6d.  Which is the better for the old age pensioners?</P>
    <P>The same test could be applied under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions and to all the other social welfare classes.  They have all been compensated for the increase in the cost of living during the past four years.  I have also looked into the matter of the effect of the increased cost of living on the wage classes and how they fared.  Deputy Dillon, in his rhetorical speech&mdash;he likes to get in a good impression down the country, whether or not there is any truth in it, so long as it is a good catch-cry&mdash;gave as his big argument the suggestion that everybody was worse off under Fianna Fáil except the very few.  That is not true.</P>
    <P>The social welfare classes are not worse off.  They are somewhat better off than they were four years ago, on strict economic figures.  I do not want <Col N="678" /> to be taken, as I nearly certainly will be by some of my opponents, as saying that they are better off than they should be, but on strict economic figures they have been compensated for any increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Let us take wages.  About 660,000 people are in insurable employment in this country.  A great proportion of those have families so that we can, in round figures, say we are speaking about a million people in this class. How have they fared?  First of all, the cost of living went up by 14 points. The average weekly earnings in the manufacturing industry during the four years have gone up by an average of 29s. 1d. a week, a percentage increase of 23.1, while the cost of living increase was 10.4 per cent., so that there was a real increase in wages of 11.5 per cent.  Therefore, under Fianna Fáil, a very big slice of the population in this country were better off than they were four years ago, even allowing for the increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>The same percentages apply to transport goods industries.  In the case of agricultural workers the story is not so good.  They got an increase in wages of 13.7 per cent., so that in real values they are better off by from 3.2 per cent. to 1.7 per cent.  Accordingly, Fine Gael speakers have no reason to look upon themselves as the people who kept down the cost of living.  They have no reason to look at the cost of living and to say they did better than we did.  Perhaps we are a little bit slower to put it up than they are.  They should remember that, as the cost of living went up in the past four years we made sure, with every step, to see that the main classes concerned&mdash;social welfare, pensioners and the wage class&mdash;were covered against any increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>There were vague accusations made in this connection.  There was talk about the blisters put on by Fianna Fáil, but that is the type of speech a Fine Gael man usually makes.  He makes it down the country as well as in the House.  On a few occasions I have had the opportunity of listening <Col N="679" /> to Fine Gael speeches in the country and I have heard them refer to the blisters and the increased cost of living and all these other things.  They would make one imagine that they were angels when they themselves were in power.  Luckily the people in the country are fairly astute and do not believe everything they hear, like the young Fianna Fáil Deputies when they are listening for the first time to Fine Gael speeches in the House.</P>
    <P>I was accused in particular, and the Government in general, on this matter of health expenditure.  I was reminded that when I was bringing in the Act I said it would not cost local authorities more than 2/- in the £.  I wonder if it did cost any more.  Deputy O'Sullivan said that it cost 2/- in the £ more in Cork this year.  How can that be so when the average increase in the Health Estimate for the whole country is about 3d. in the £&mdash;and that does not apply to the Health Act in particular but to the whole Health Estimate?</P>
    <P>While one hears those figures thrown out at random&mdash;and I would ask the new men in the Fianna Fáil benches not to believe all they hear&mdash;the fact is that the total expenditure under the health services since 1952-53, the year before the Act was introduced, shows an increase of £3 million.  That means, of course, £3 million on the Exchequer and £3 million on the ratepayers. Three million pounds is 4/- in the £ on the rates.  Did any Fine Gael speaker have the courage to say today that if no Health Act had been introduced the Health Estimate would not have gone up 2/- in the £ despite the extra charges on local authorities on behalf of nurses, doctors and mental hospital staffs?</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that any honest-minded person who wanted to give what he would regard as an honest answer to that question would say: &ldquo;I am sure it would have gone up by 2/- in the £.  To take the total rate in the county council, it has.  I do not know what the figure is, but I am sure that if you related it to the proportion of the health estimate you had to meet, <Col N="680" /> you would find it had gone up by 2/- in the £.  I had no opportunity of examining the detailed estimates of the various counties except what my colleague, Deputy Browne, showed me, and it is quite evident from that estimate that, as far as the Health Act is concerned, it did not cause a higher rate than 2/- in the £.</P>
    <P>A couple of Fine Gael Deputies made the point that we should not tax the milk producers for exports.  There are two policies in this matter and they are very simple.  Fianna Fáil has the policy of putting up the price of milk. We put it up to 1/7 since we came in and we take back less than 1d. by way of levy.  Fine Gael has the policy of not putting up the price and imposing no levy.  Which is better?  Is it not quite evident that the Fianna Fáil policy is better?  We give something and take back less than a penny; they give nothing and take back nothing.  We should leave the farmers to decide that.</P>
    <P>Other Fine Gael speakers have taken their cue from somebody or other and they admit that there is a pretty good boom in certain ways.  They must admit that because of certain arguments they are making that all this boom is due to the Fine Gael proposal or plan, if you like, to relieve exports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is right.  It was a very good proposal as far as it goes, and I want to congratulate Deputy Sweetman and the Coalition Government on that policy.  But, of course, it is not responsible for all the improvement in our exports.  After all, if a man wanted to export and to benefit from this plan, he had to find the market and he had to be able to sell on that market.  In order to benefit he must make a profit.  Otherwise it would be no good to him.  Therefore, it required conditions where people could produce for export, get export markets and make a profit.  Then they benefit from the proposal made by the Coalition Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are helping, naturally. I am not going to find fault with new industries started under the Coalition but I want to say that there are industries in the country other than those started by the Coalition and they are very important also.  Looking at a list of exports I find industries like confectionery, glasswear, woven goods and textiles, footwear and leather, paper and cardboard, furniture, etc.  They are industries which, I think, are the mose desirable of all. They were started with Irish capital which is a great thing.</P>
      <P>I still believe that the Fianna Fáil Government were right to have Irish capital used to the greatest degree possible in building up our native industries. These industries are using Irish raw materials to the fullest extent possible and have a good labour content in proportion to the value of the exports.  From every point of view they are a very desirable type of industry and, in the past 11 months&mdash;I was not able to get the returns for the 12 months&mdash;from January to November, 1960, they accounted for £14.1 million of our exports.  I want everybody to have a balanced mind on this matter of the industries that are helping the country to prosper and build up our exports.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne mentioned a case to which I want to refer in passing.  It was not referred to to any great extent in the debate.  He mentioned a case of a man who had an old age pension and a wife who was under 70.  He got a contributory pension and 28/6 for his wife and was actually better off by £2. But, as Deputy Kyne said, the Government come along and take home assistance from him, take turf from him and a few other things that he mentioned and leave him only 5/- better off.  I should like to look at these figures to see if it is a very exceptional case or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even taking it as it is, the Government is responsible only for the turf part of it.  The turf was given during the war, because it was impossible for poor people to get fuel and was only <Col N="682" /> given in the towns far away from turf supplies.  This shows that it was a scheme for supply rather than to help in the way of prices, but it has continued. It is very hard to get rid of these schemes.  The Government do not like facing the task of getting rid of them, taking a decision which, perhaps, must be reached at some time or other.  The local authority took off the home assistance which is given under a means test and the local authority is quite entitled, naturally, to examine the means when there is a change.  If they consider the person's means go beyond the means laid down by them, I suppose they are entitled to make the deduction.  Some might say the local authorities were a bit harsh; others might say they were right.  In any case they did this.</P>
    <P>Some other speakers&mdash;Deputy Jones in particular, I think&mdash;complained about the boundary drawn for the Undeveloped Areas Act.  This was brought in to enable the undeveloped areas to get industries because they had no chance of getting them in competition with the cities without holding out some special attraction to those wishing to start industries to induce them to go to these areas.  A boundary had to be drawn.  I think, roughly speaking, it was drawn on the lines of the old Congested Districts Board.  If there was no boundary, the scheme would have no effect as everybody would be equal.  Deputy Jones may be right in suggesting that the boundary was wrongly drawn but it is a very difficult problem on which to get full agreement.</P>
    <P>Some speakers, including, I think, Deputy Sweetman, said that the terms of trade were with us in our figures. They were.  They were favourable to us up to 1959 but they were not so good for 1960.  They are going against us in recent times.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan complained that agricultural production in the country had not gone up.  I tried to correct him on that point but he still held to that view.  Deputy Dillon was very perturbed about farmers' indebtedness going up too much.  He thought there was a danger that farmers might be going into debt without having a very secure basis to work on.  At any rate, there was complete disagreement between the two Deputies. Both were finding fault with what they believed to be the case.  Deputy Dillon was right as regards the position.  Agricultural credit at the end of 1957, advanced by the commercial banks, amounted to £16.58 million.  At the end of 1960 it was £31.16 million.  It has gone up very considerably.</P>
      <P>I said at the outset that the question was what are we going to do?  I gave figures to correct some of the assertions made by Fine Gael in relation to claims which are not really justified on the figures.  It should be possible to get agreement on figures.  It should be possible to get agreement on the cost of living now and three or four years ago.  It does not matter very much whether it went up more in our time than in their time, though in actual fact it went up more in their time than it has in ours.  But that does not matter very much.  The cost of living is going up all the time.</P>
      <P>Emigration was also higher in the inter-Party Government time than in our time.  I can prove that with figures.  But that will not help the people who have to emigrate.  What we want from the people on the other side are suggestions.  We have not had one suggestion in the four days as to what should be done.  The only thing that Fine Gael says is that if they come back things will be better. They do not say why they will be better.  They do not say what they will do.  Unless people have very short memories, Fine Gael will not do all that much.  I am sure people remember the last time they were in office; the people were no better off.  Unless Fine Gael can point to how they will be better off, they are not very likely to get much support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> We have done everything that can be done within reason and the resources at our disposal to improve agriculture.  If, when I have finished speaking, some Fine Gael Deputies can suggest a change here or there in our system, I will guarantee that it will be considered.  With regard to agriculture we must improve the land and bring it up to the best possible standard.  We have increased expenditure on arterial drainage.  Drainage is no good unless it is undertaken on an arterial scale.  When that is done, the tributaries can be tackled.  After that it is a question of going in on the land.  There are complaints from several parts that land is not being drained rapidly enough.  The land cannot be drained or reclaimed properly until the arterial drainage is carried out.  Arterial drainage is proceeding as rapidly as possible.  I have been informed by the Office of Public Works that they will enter on the last river within ten years.  That is not such bad progress remembering that the Act was passed only in 1945.</P>
    <P>Having drained the land, the next step is to put the land in good heart through the use of lime, phosphate, potash and so on.  We have increased the subsidy in that regard.  It is £3,000,000 this year.  Results are good. We are using twice as much fertiliser now as compared with six or seven years ago.</P>
    <P>We are also improving farm buildings. Recently we introduced a scheme for grants for piggeries.  Silos, the installation of water, and so forth, are all being provided for.  There is the improvement also in regard to livestock.  There is no need to dwell upon the Bovine T.B. scheme.  This year we are spending £7.1 million gross, net £5.4 million.  That is a huge amount for a small country, but it is better that we should get on with the job as quickly as possible.  There is also progeny testing.</P>
    <P>On the educational side, we are all the time providing more money for instructors.  Recently we set up the research body, Fóras Talúntais.  All these things cost a good deal of money.  In the coming financial year Agriculture <Col N="685" /> will cost £16,000,000.  That is a huge sum.  I do not think any Party can say we are not spending enough.  Some Parties may have their own ideas as to how the money should be spent.  If any concrete suggestions are made I shall certainly undertake to have them considered by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any difficulty in getting farmers to work and produce more provided there is a market for their produce.  We have set up marketing boards.  I think they have a very tough job and I sincerely hope they will be successful.  It is more than likely they will be able to do more than has been done in the past, so far as markets are concerned.</P>
    <P>We are giving a good deal of help by way of subsidy.  This year we are providing £2.35 millions for milk products. We increased the price early last year by 1.3d. per gallon which gave the farmers £1,500,000.  On the bacon side, we guarantee 245/- per cwt. for top quality.  That is approximately £850,000.  We are getting results from that.  I do not say we are complacent about things, but we are certainly getting a trend in the right direction.</P>
    <P>In the last two years cattle have increased by 264,000, sheep by 280,000 and pigs by 20,000.  We have the highest number of pigs for the last ten years.  Tillage is holding its own.  Last year the output of milk was the second highest in recorded history.  These are the facts according to the statistics.  It would be a good thing if those who are in touch with the farmers would show the farmers that we are making progress.  More has to be done, however, before we get a proper output from the farmers.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the small farmer.  Any proposition put to me as Minister for Finance aimed at helping the small farmer will be received enthusiastically by me.  Fianna Fáil initiated quite a number of schemes to help small farmers&mdash;the tomato growing scheme, which is particularly suited to the small farmers in the west of Ireland, onion growing, and the cultivation of fruit and vegetables.  In regard <Col N="686" /> to the latter there is one very heartening development.  In Carlow, Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann are processing and canning fruit and vegetables. As time goes on, they will be able to take substantial quantities of fruit and vegetables and there is no reason why a great number of farmers should not grow a substantial acreage of these commodities.</P>
    <P>In Mallow there is a new process of dehydration of vegetables and it can also take a large volume of produce from the farmers of that area.  I think I should say that in Tuam an industry is being started which I think is one of the best started in the west of Ireland for a long time, and that is the making of potato flakes.  I am assured by the Sugar Company that they will be able to take a very big tonnage of produce into the Tuam factory and will be able to benefit a very big number of farmers in the west of Ireland in the years to come. They feel, anyway, that they will have no difficulty with regard to the markets for these potato flakes when they are turned out.  I think that the Sugar Company are setting a headline which I hope will be followed by other private interests in these industries.</P>
    <P>I have been able to give only a very hurried few minutes to the things we are doing for agriculture but, as I say, I would be very glad indeed to hear from any Deputy&mdash;I do not care from what side of the House he is&mdash;a suggestion of what could be done, that we are not doing at the moment, to help the farmers, having regard, of course, to the resources at our disposal. I think Deputies will have to admit that we have not been parsimonious in regard to agriculture.  The fact that we have built expenditure in regard to agriculture up to £16 million shows we are not frightened by any propositions that might be put up to us.  But, as I say, there might be disagreement in the way that money is going. Deputies might have an idea that the money could be spent in a better direction; if they have I think it would be very much better to have a discussion on that matter rather than waste three or four days discussing whether this Government or the last were worse for <Col N="687" /> emigration, the cost of living, or anything else.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to answer refers to something said about civil servants.  I said when I came into this office that I thought there were too many civil servants, and I did think so.  For a year or so I made some progress, but after three years I was back where I started.  This year's Estimate compared to 1960-61 shows an increase of 400.  But the Revenue Commissioners have taken on 160 in the pay-as-you-earn scheme, the Board of Works have taken on 150, principally technical staffs for all these necessary technical things like fisheries, and the building of police barracks; Agriculture has taken on 140 for the bovine tuberculosis scheme and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs took on 40.  I did not realise my hopes of keeping down the number of civil servants.  I was overborne by things that had to be done; we cannot refuse to do them because of lack of staff.</P>
    <P>If I have a moment to spare, I want to say that Deputy Dillon appears to have some misapprehension with <Col N="688" /> regard to the nature of the national income.  If Deputy Dillon looked at the headings of these statistics, he would see that it is defined as the total of all payments for productive services accruing to the permanent residents of this country.  All wages come into it; all profits, salaries and so on, and farm income come into this item.  This is the point I want to make: Deputy Dillon thought it might have been swollen by our borrowing.  It is not true that credit would come into it. Just as a man makes up his own accounts at the end of the year, he does not take in any credit he got as an asset.  Neither is it taken into the national income.</P>

      <P>In the absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The purpose of this Bill is to confirm thirteen Orders made under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, which provides that Orders made by the Government under that Act, imposing or amending duties must be confirmed in the calendar year following that in which they are made.</P>
      <P>Six of the Orders afforded new protection. Five others amended existing duties where experience had shown that these duties were not adequate because of increasingly severe competition from imports.  Two further Orders were made because the existing duties were being evaded.</P>
      <P>An explanatory memorandum on the Bill has been circulated to Deputies.  I shall, of course, be willing to give any further information or answer any questions which Deputies wish to ask about the Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the information one would normally ask for on this Bill I obtained by way of Question about a fortnight ago and I do not propose to go into that matter again. One is bound, however, to feel each time we get a new Imposition of Duties Bill some apprehension as to what is going to happen to new protection starting now when the wind of change in Europe becomes even more pronounced.  Most people who are acquainted with the situation in <Col N="694" /> Europe feel that it is a matter of a very short time before the tendency towards freeing trade barriers is so great that we here will have to pay some considerable attention to it.</P>
      <P>Whether we join the Common Market or the E.F.T.A. or whether we remain outside of both, it is a fact that the trend is towards freer trade and I am apprehensive, therefore, on that account as to the future of the industries which are concerned.  It is an issue that cannot be burked indefinitely and one that will have to be considered in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is probably taking this Bill at short notice for reasons that are obvious but better left unsaid.  In that he has a colleague because I only heard ten minutes ago that I would be asked to say a word from this side of the House.  However, I do feel strongly that during the course of this year the Government, with the special information that they must have about the progress of the Common Market and E.F.T.A. and our possible adherence to either of these bodies, will have to do something towards publishing a White Paper making the information available to them available to the rest of the country.  I appreciate there may be difficulties as part of the information might be confidential, but there is not sufficient awareness in the country of the problems with which we are likely to be faced in that regard and the best way of obtaining that awareness and creating an informed public opinion on the problems involved would be for the Government to give a lead by the publication of a White Paper.</P>
      <P>Industrialists, although they have a good deal of information, have not got the same facilities at all to obtain the information necessary on which to make decisions as the Government would have.  I would ask the Minister to discuss, not merely with the Minister for Industry and Commerce but with the Taoiseach and the Government as a whole, the desirability of the publication of information of a statistical nature such as I suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister is handling this Bill for his colleagues and I do not want to ask questions which are complex or embarrassing. I want to make one observation, so as to give notice that I shall raise the matter on some other appropriate occasion.  The Taoiseach made a speech recently in which he referred to the developments in Europe, to the emergence there of two powerful trading blocs and from what he said one could assume that some <i>via media</i> would be found whereby Ireland could be associated with either one or both of these two blocs.  He said that when this situation came about it was going to mean a draught on our industries and that we may have to proceed to dismantle our tariffs.  He said that because of that some industries might go to the wall and might have to be closed down but that others, perhaps more deeply rooted, would be able to survive and carry on.</P>
      <P>The pattern of that speech was, as I recollect it, that the Government contemplated taking steps to temper the storm and that it is beginning to think of dismantling tariffs.  One would assume that from that time onwards the tariffs to be imposed would be less protective in the future than in the past.  Some of the tariffs here are pretty high.  There is one here which is 75 per cent. full and 50 per cent. preferential and there are others which are 60 per cent. full and 40 per cent. preferential with minimum rates for specific articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether this Bill is intended to implement in any way what the Taoiseach said, that tariffs would have to be dismantled or whether the Bill contains any of the dismantling machinery which he foreshadowed.  I see no difference between these tariffs and those imposed in the past.  I want to find out from the Minister whether the dismantling process envisaged by the Taoiseach has yet commenced or whether we are carrying on in the old pattern of tariffs which would mean that the Taoiseach's proposal has not yet been put into operation.  I do not know if the Minister is in a position to answer that question.  I know the form of this Bill having been myself <Col N="696" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce and I know the elaborate brief that comes with it.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister tell me from the brief what is the position in respect of the imposition of duties on the importation of toy balloons?  There is at present a customs duty of 60 per cent. full and 40 per cent. preference.  Are these balloons being made here now? Where are they being made and how many people are employed in the making of the balloons?  What is the annual output of the firm in respect of these toy balloons?  I think the Minister will find that information such as that is usually in the brief.</P>
    <P>I would also like similar information in regard to No. 8 which imposes duties in respect of watches.  These duties, in my recollection, have been altered on more than one occasion and apparently a further alteration was made in August last when the <i>ad valorem</i> duty was reduced from 60 per cent. full and 40 per cent. preference to thirty-three and a third per cent. full and 22.29 per cent. preference with a minimum rate of duty of 30/- full and 20/- preference on watches, watch parts and springs.  Who exactly is doing this kind of work here?  How many firms are engaged in it?  Where are they?  What is the value of their output and how many people are employed by them?</P>
    <P>Then we come to No. 13 which is a duty on socks made of man-made fibres which came into operation in November.  It amended the previous duty of 75 per cent. full and 50 per cent. preference and provided instead for a minimum rate of 50/- full and 34/4d. preference per dozen pairs of socks.  Is this designed to deal with the socks imported from Britain or the Continent or is it a device to catch Hong-Kong socks, Japanese socks or socks made in other countries where cheap labour is used?  I should be glad if the Minister can let me have this information but if he finds it difficult to give me the necessary information now I will be satisfied if he will send it to me.</P>

      <P>The matters raised by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Norton <Col N="697" /> in relation to the position that exists in the trading groups in Europe have not come to any finality, as the Deputies will know, and I would not wish to enter into the field of prophecy as to what exactly will happen in that regard. I would suggest to the Deputies concerned that it would be more appropriate to raise these questions that have been raised here on the Minister's Estimate.</P>
      <P>Any change in tariff policy or fiscal policy in any country necessarily brings with it difficulties.  It brings with it a change in the organisation even of the firms that are engaged in industrial production in any country, and it is bound to bring a change in our country.  We have been operating a protective policy for a long number of years and I want to assure the Deputies concerned that the Government is very much alive to the likely outcome of any definite and final decisions that may be arrived at in Europe and in regard to our participation in any trade groupings or arrangements in the future.  The Government did prepare and circulate papers before giving information on free trade developments, and no doubt they will favourably consider doing so again or publishing a White Paper when the time is ripe and when there is something concrete on which to report.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton raised questions on certain duties.  He asked a question as to where toy balloons are made. Toy balloons are made by the Shannon Industries, Ltd., Carrick-on-Shannon, Co. Leitrim.  There is a market in toy balloons in this country and it is valued at £10,000 a year.  Shannon Industries, Ltd., was supplying one-third of the market at the time of their application, and they are in a position to meet all reasonable requirements of the market.  Of course, they give a guarantee, as every other firm is asked to give, that they will not raise their prices unduly or, if they have to, in the early stages, as their experience increases, they will be in a position to sell their manufactured articles at competitive prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the imposition of the minimum duty, Shannon Industries, <Col N="698" /> Ltd., employed a total of 23 persons. They were not employed full-time; five people were employed full-time and four part-time in connection with the production of balloons.  There has been no increase in employment on the production of balloons, as the effect of the duty has not yet been fully felt, and when it is they hope to be in a position to employ a total of 23 persons.</P>

      <P>I am reading from the brief and I am accepting that is the correct information.  The question of watches was raised by Deputy Norton. The watches are mainly assembled in Dublin by Dublin firms.  The Irish watch assembly firms are concerned mainly with the lower and medium-priced watches.  These firms represented that the former rate of duty was inadequate to overcome the established trade connections and traditional preference for imported Swiss watches. They maintained that the cheap type of Swiss watches, because of the indication on the dials of their Swiss origin, had an overwhelming competitive advantage over the Irish products and that the duties imposed were necessary to ensure the survival of the Irish watch assembly industry.  The output of home assemblers was 50,000 watches annually but they have the capacity to increase it to 100,000 watches which is the estimated market for low and medium-priced watches. As a result of the amendment of the duty the output of watches by Irish assemblers increased in 1960 to 80,000 watches.  Some 40 workers were employed on watch assembly but as a result of the amendment of the duty the employment given by firms in the Watch Assembly Association has increased to 65 persons and the association estimates that there are about 15 persons employed by firms outside the association.</P>

The Federation of Irish Industries made urgent representations regarding threatened imports from Hong Kong.

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for easing certain hardships of jury service occurring at present or liable to occur in the County Boroughs and Counties of Cork, Limerick and Waterford, either through jurors having to serve too frequently or having to travel unduly long distances to County Borough Courts from remote parts of these counties.</P>
      <P>This arises chiefly from the provision in the present law whereby juries for Circuit Court sittings in a county borough are drawn from the county borough or the county, according as the case is a county borough or county case.  In Cork in particular this system has not been entirely happy in operation, because, owing to the insufficient number of jurors in the county borough, their frequency of service is as much as once in one and a quarter years, while at the same time, the remoteness of parts of the county from the city obliges county jurors to travel excessive distances when required for county cases triable in the county borough.  In recent times the position in the county borough has been made more difficult still by the development of High Court jury trials there, all the jurors for which are drawn from the county borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remedy provided in the Bill is that jury panels for all County Borough trials shall be drawn partly from the County Borough and partly from the County or from a certain District or Districts of the County, as may be <Col N="701" /> specified by the Minister for Justice by Order.  Thus, in the case of Cork City the adjacent County areas, where the frequency of jury service is of the order of once in 10 years, can be joined with the County Borough to average the frequency of jury service more equitably, while at the same time the jurors outside these areas will be relieved altogether from the obligation of rendering their jury service in the County Borough.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, the provisions of the Bill will have no practical effect, because the system of mixed panels of County Borough and County jurors already applies there under the existing law. The present position with regard to other County areas is not unsatisfactory because the provisions of the existing law with regard to Circuit Court juries are sufficient to deal with the kinds of hardship to which I have referred. These provisions consist of power to specify Districts from which juries may be drawn and this power, which in the Bill is extended to High Court juries as well, can be exercised to provide the most evenly distributed frequency of service that is possible, consistent with the avoidance of bringing jurors from too far in the County.</P>
    <P>With these provisions there will now be power to regulate most effectively everywhere, within the limits of the Counties, the areas from which to call jurors, and instances of excessive frequency of service or of long travel in relation to particular localities can be equitably dealt with.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, the Bill contains a very minor adjustment of the law relating to juries for lunacy matters, in order to cover specifically the type of case where there are proceedings in the form of a Commission <i>de lunatico inquirendo.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not entirely catch what the Minister said in his opening speech but it seems to me that the main effect of this Bill is in Section 2 which simply applies elsewhere what is at present practised in Dublin.  I think that is what the Minister said.  I understand that under the 1937 Act it is possible to have what is called a mixed jury, drawn partly <Col N="702" /> from a county borough and partly from a county.  Must they be always mixed?  While it is right to have the permission to draw from the county boroughs and from the county, is it necessary always to have a mixed jury?  I do not see why it is necessary to have them mixed all the time.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the minor point covered by Section 5 where there are lunacy proceedings.  Section 5 says:</P>
      <P>Whenever a panel of jurors is lawfully in attendance before a commissioner under a commission <i>de lunatico inquirendo</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and goes on to provide that for the purpose of the section the commissioner shall be a court and also a judge of such court.  I thought that was an effort to make sure that the commissioner could not be ousted from his jurisdiction because of an article in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>It says that except in criminal matters certain limited types of jurisdiction may be handed over to people who are not judges and people may be tried before courts which are not courts established under the Constitution. I thought this was an effort to make sure, by calling a commissioner a judge&mdash;he is ordinarily a judge&mdash;and by saying that the tribunal over which he presides is a court, that there was a way of getting over the difficulty. The Minister might advert to that in replying and also to the other points which I have mentioned.  Section 65 is being repealed but I do not know to what that section refers.</P>
      <P>The Bill is merely a machinery measure which is quite welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I want to make about what is included in the Bill and about what has not been included in it.  Deputy McGilligan referred, as did the Minister, to the fact that under Section 2 of the Bill there will be power to have a mixed jury from two different areas. It seems it will be unnecessarily cumbersome to have two different people sending jurors to the same jury panel. In Dublin, for example, it will mean that the city sheriff and the county <Col N="703" /> sheriff will both be sending people to the same jury panel and in Cork the same, I think, will apply.  That seems to be an unnecessarily unwieldy and cumbersome procedure.  It will lead to a good deal of inconvenience and I think inevitably to some extra expense with no commensurate advantage.</P>
      <P>While it is necessary to ensure that the persons qualified as jurors in one area would be liable to be called for another area also, at the same time it should be possible to devise a scheme by which they would not be called for the same jury panel.</P>
      <P>Apart from what is in the Bill there are certain things not in it and whose inclusion would, perhaps, have made it a better Bill.  Section 62, I think, of the 1927 Act provides that jurors are paid 5/- per man for a civil jury.  There is a great difference between what 5/- was worth in 1927 and what it is worth now.  In those days it would have met the juror's subsistence for lunch and, perhaps, for tea.  Certainly, it does not do anything like that now and it is an unnecessary hardship on a man who has to serve on a jury that not merely is he away from his own business and suffering the loss of his absence but he also has to pay out of his own pocket for his subsistence. I think we must move with the value of money in that respect and that it will be necessary to provide in the immediate future that something other than the figure fixed 34 years ago is paid to those who do what is a public service.  We must regard it as such to serve on a jury but nevertheless a public service which it is not reasonable to ask them to do at their own expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time there is considerable agitation that jurors should be paid.  It is very difficult to arrive at any method by which you can get a yardstick to pay people what they have lost on an equitable basis.  The man employed by a big firm and who serves on a jury probably does not lose anything. He may have to do a bit of extra overtime to catch up on his work, but his firm continue to pay him.  The man who runs his own business, a one-man business, loses very heavily in <Col N="704" /> carrying out this public service particularly if he is involved in a case of any magnitude or one that lasts any length of time.  It is very hard to find a method of reimbursement that is fair without the possibility that there would be a profit for serving on a jury for some and a loss for others.  I would violently oppose anything that would mean in any circumstances that anybody could get a profit from so serving.  However, that is an entirely different consideration to that of not being out of pocket to the same degree and the Minister should give that serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Under Section 3 of the 1927 Act the only persons liable for jury service are rated occupiers of premises and included in the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; are not only houses but lands.  The tenant of a house or a flat in respect of which the landlord is the rated occupier is not liable for jury service.  A person living in a house provided by his employers is not liable; members of the family of the person who is the rated occupier are similarly not liable. One can consider, for example, a man aged 58 who has three sons aged 25-30 living in one house.  The father of the family is liable for jury service but none of the three sons are liable.</P>
    <P>Because the number of people liable for such service is so seriously restricted their turn comes round unpleasantly often.  If the number liable was extended it would mean a far lesser burden on those who are called because they would be called less often.</P>
    <P>In these days I think none of us would agree that the rateability of a person is a proper test upon which to determine his liability for jury service. Certainly, with the extension in all social strata of the use of the flat which is not separately rated it would seem that there is undoubtedly a necessity to consider changes in that respect. I would urge the Minister, therefore, to consider such a problem to see if the numbers of those liable to be called could be extended to ensure that those who have to give such service would not be called too frequently.</P>
    <P>In parts of the country there is a <Col N="705" /> very great hardship imposed on jurors from the point of view of travelling. The most striking example is possibly the juror who has to travel from Castletownbere to Cork.  I heard Castletownbere described by the Minister for Agriculture the other day as &ldquo;a little place,&rdquo; much to the annoyance of Deputy Michael Pat Murphy.  Whatever its size, it is about 100 miles from Cork.  If a juror has to travel 100 miles to Cork and remain there for a fortnight to act on criminal juries without getting any expenses that is imposing a very unfair burden on one particular citizen.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why jurors are called more frequently at the moment is because the jury books are not brought up to date.  I am advised that it may very often be 15 years before a jury book is revised.  The revision is done under, I think, Sections 21 and 22 of the Act of 1927.  If my information is correct&mdash;I think the Minister will find it is&mdash;it means that during the whole of that 15 years anyone who dies or reaches the age of 65 is removed from the book, but no new people are added.  Therefore, the number in the book gradually goes down year by year and that means a more frequent rota and more frequent service for those who are left, putting on them an unfair share of this burden of public service.</P>
    <P>I am told that in certain parts of the country there are people properly liable under the existing law for jury service, because they are rated occupiers.  There are some who have been rated occupiers for ten years and upwards, but they have never been put on the jury panel because the jury book is revised so very seldom.  So far as my own personal experience is concerned, that does not happen in Kildare.  I am told that it is the position in Cork and there are people who can be identified in the city of Cork who should have been on the jury panel for the last ten years, but they are not on the panel because the book has not been revised.  I understand the panel survives until it is completely and absolutely exhausted.  That is a very bad arrangement.  It is a matter to <Col N="706" /> which the Minister should give immediate attention.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGilligan said, the Bill so far as it goes is welcome.  My only complaint is that it does not go nearly far enough.  It does not deal with some of the really outstanding and pressing problems.  Even in respect of those with which it does deal, I think it could have dealt with them in a much tidier way.</P>
    <P>I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to ask the Minister whether he has considered another problem in relation to juries, namely, whether it might not be better to have no jury at all in a civil action.  There is universal acceptance that it is desirable that there should be a jury in a criminal action so that judgement will depend on the joint wisdom of several rather than on the particular determination of one; with the best will in the world, a judge might become prejudiced on certain aspects of a case before him.  There are not the same dangers of prejudice in a civil action and I think my suggestion ought to be seriously examined.  I shall not put it any further at this stage.  The civil actions arise mainly out of motor accidents.  Across the water juries have been abolished in such civil actions.  I do not know whether or not that has been a success but I think the Minister would be well advised to inquire into its working there with a view to adopting a similar system here.</P>
    <P>It is a matter&mdash;Deputy McGilligan will contradict me on this if I am wrong&mdash;for a jury to decide the manner in which it reaches a verdict in relation to damages.  A system has grown up in which all 12 jurors write down a figure and that total is then divided by 12.  That may be a convenient way for a jury to get out of this very onerous service but it can scarcely be held that such a system produces the results it should.  Inevitably there is almost always one junior who feels so strongly&mdash;I shall use no stronger word&mdash;that the case is not being sufficiently appreciated by his colleagues and he adds a global figure ten times the figure he really considers <Col N="707" /> appropriate.  In that way he believes he will offset any wrong his colleagues will do.</P>
    <P>For example, 11 jurors each write down £1,000; one juror writes down £30,000 though he believes about £1,500 would be a fair assessment.  He writes £30,000 to counterbalance the others and bring the assessment up. When the system has come to that in terms of assessment of monetary damages I suggest it is time to examine it carefully to see whether or not something else might be substituted for it. I am not suggesting at all that it should be thrown out automatically and without examination.  There are considerable dangers in doing away with it.</P>
    <P>There have been considerable abuses in its working and it becomes therefore, so far as I understand it, a matter for consideration, and careful consideration, to decide whether it is better that the system should be retained exactly as it is or whether there should be some change.  I think it is a pity when the Minister was bringing in the Bill to the House, even though I accept that it was on a limited field, that he did make the Bill on such a limited field and did not give consideration to the other matters I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister and his associates in the Department do not claim that this is one of the many Bills which necessitate the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice.  This is only one of the many Bills of a similar kind which are pigeon-holed in the Department of Justice and which every Government knows it can call on at short notice when they are short of any other form of legislation.  Nevertheless, I suppose it is an ill wind that blows nobody good and we can rejoice that this very necessary Bill has now come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that so far only lawyers have spoken to the Bill for this is a Bill which affects laymen more than lawyers because laymen can be called <Col N="708" /> upon to serve on juries and lawyers cannot.  There are two other classifications of people who are not available for jury service and I think that some steps should be taken to make them available for jury service; No. 1, because they are the type of people who would make excellent jurors and No. 2, because if they were called for jury service it would relieve the burden which all too frequently falls on other jurors.  I refer first of all to the vast mass of civil servants.  I think it is wrong that civil servants should not be called upon for jury service.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the reason is that the Minister for Finance for the time being feels that the public should not have to pay for the services of a civil servant when he is doing anything but his Civil Service work.  But they ought to some extent try to relieve the liability which too frequently in jury service falls on others or we may have to face up to paying the jurors out of Exchequer funds a reasonable amount to compensate them.  If civil servants were to be available in Dublin City and Cork City it would add greatly to the pool of jurors and I have a feeling that civil servants would not need to get medical certificates to excuse their absence as do people in private occupations.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that within the last week or thereabouts one judge had to say that he had good reason to doubt some twelve doctors' certificates which had been produced to him in respect of people liable for jury service and any practical person knows that unfortunately, only too frequently, would-be jurors avoid service by getting doctors' certificates on rather flimsy excuses.  I think the vast army of civil servants ought to be available for jury service and that they should be no longer exempted.</P>
    <P>There is another much smaller group who avoid jury service because they are entitled to exemption; the office they hold does not confer exemption on them but if they claim it they can get it.  I refer to Peace Commissioners. We all know that, certainly in the cities and towns, many businessmen seek the appointment of Peace Commissioner <Col N="709" /> not to perform the duties of that office but to avoid jury service. It cheapens the office when it is merely got as an excuse to avoid jury service and it is unfair to the people who have not got the post of Peace Commissioner that others who are similarly circumstanced are enabled by reason of exemption to avoid jury service.</P>
    <P>I think that in future P.C.s should not be exempted except in relation to a charge which was originally before them.  Obviously if a person is brought before a Peace Commissioner in the initial stages by the Garda Síochána it would be most undesirable that the particular Peace Commissioner should sit on a jury which would hear a criminal charge against that man.  But I can see no objection to a Peace Commissioner serving on juries when he has not already had something to do with the case.  Even if we accept the argument in relation to criminal work, Peace Commissioners ought to be available for civil work and if so it would prevent a considerable amount of the onerous duties falling on other jurors at the present time.</P>
    <P>I would not go all the way with Deputy Sweetman when he wants to see all the civil cases taken out of the hands of juries.  I believe that 12 honest men and true can bring in as honourable a verdict in relation to a civil matter, for damages or otherwise, as can one man.  One man does not become a god; he does not lose all the human vices to which we are all heir merely because he wears a wig and we have had cases where we have had members of the judiciary with bees in their bonnets about some particular action or other, giving decisions which are not in keeping with the facts of the particular case.  But where you select on a broad basis twelve reasonable citizens, then I think you may get a fair verdict.</P>
    <P>It may be in some cases that laymen err on the side of generosity when they feel an insurance company is involved, but I think it is the lesser evil.  I agree that the ancient basis of calling jurors, merely because of their qualifications <Col N="710" /> as rated occupiers is unreal.  In this day and age there are many people who are not rated occupiers who are of greater wealth, greater substance, greater independence and of broader education than people who are rated occupiers.  I think that there are many tradesmen who make perhaps better jurors than many of the jurors we have at the present time.  I think there are thousands of people in the land who would make excellent jurors although they are not rated occupiers and it seems a pity that we have not yet devised some system whereby such people would be liable for jury service. I think that one of the reasons we have not done it is that we feel perhaps if we extend the field from which we can draw jurors we will have to bring in a reasonable scheme to compensate them while they are carrying out jury service.  I think that the dictates of justice and fair play both to an accused, and civil litigants, and others, necessitate that we should bring about this remedy and bring it about very soon.</P>
    <P>I think it a pity that in this country we do not have more women on our juries.  As I understand the position women are not appointed as jurors unless they apply to become appointed as jurors.  Because the number of women who have stepped out of line to apply for appointment is so few, we do not have any women on our juries.  There are many cases, both civil and criminal, where women, because of their particular disposition, would make better jurors than men. In this modern responsible age we ought to have a number of women on every jury.</P>
    <P>At present if a few women, who would be considered cranks, just as the suffragettes were in their day, volunteer for jury service and are called into court, the inevitable practice is that the solicitor acting for the parties involved objects to them as jurors merely because they are women. I think that is a slight on us.  It shows we are very immature and that we have not yet appreciated the valuable services which women can offer in a <Col N="711" /> court of justice.  On that account, I should like to see that discrimination between men and women removed as far as jury service is concerned.  It should be precisely on the same basis.</P>
    <P>We ought to remove the qualification of being a rated occupier and we should extend the right of jury service to people who have had a secondary education.  According to the statistics produced by the Minister for Education, up to 70 per cent. of our people are now getting education up to the age of 16&mdash;not indeed that I think that would qualify many of them for jury service.  But certainly a much larger proportion of our people are getting a broader education than they used to get, and all of them ought to be available for jury service.  Other matters in relation to this Bill have already been queried by Deputy McGilligan and I do not intend to repeat those queries.  I look forward, however, to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When I came into this House ten years ago one of the first questions I asked was if it was intended to pay jurors or not.  I was full of hope in those days when I got the reply that the matter was under active consideration.  As I know the position now, I think jurors are still unpaid; and there does not seem to be any indication in this Bill that the Minister is thinking on those lines at all.</P>
      <P>Reading through this Bill, it appears to me to confer benefits on Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, but it is not going to ease the position as far as jurors in the average rural constituency are concerned.  I want to put the position to the Minister from the point of view of a rural juror. In my own county, Wexford, there is only one town where the Circuit Court is held.  The length of the county, from its northern extremity to Wexford town, is a matter of about 32 or 33 miles; and from other parts jurors have considerable distances to travel.  If they get a summons to attend court, they have to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of jurors, naturally, are farmers.  It very often happens that <Col N="712" /> right at the busy time, at the sowing season or harvest&mdash;our Sessions are held in Spring and Autumn&mdash;the farmer may be called away from his farm and brought 30 odd miles to Wexford to answer a summons as a juror only to find, when he gets there, he is not wanted at all.  Or he may find that the case is adjourned and he has to spend the whole day there.  If the case is on the following day, he has to come back again at his own expense.</P>
    <P>Medical certificates have been mentioned here.  There was one judge in this country, who is now retired, who would not accept a medical certificate unless the doctor who issued the certificate appeared and gave evidence on behalf of the juror.  That meant considerable expense to the man concerned. A man summoned as juror, who was not able to attend because he was genuinely ill, had to issue a medical certificate and had to pay a doctor to travel to Wexford to appear and give evidence on his behalf before the judge. In the light of these facts I can only express great disappointment that this question in regard to the payment of jurors, which has been asked not alone of this Minister but of every Minister on several occasions since I came into the House in 1951, has always been met with the reply that the matter is under consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us, when replying, if this matter has been under consideration, what consideration has motivated him to do nothing about it in this Bill.  It is a flagrant case of injustice and nothing else.  Why should people be taken from their business, have to travel miles and spend a day, or maybe two days, waiting about a court and get nothing at all?  I believe I am right in saying that a criminal jury get nothing at all and that a civil jury are entitled to £3 divided amongst them.  That is a matter the Minister could earnestly consider.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Ryan's suggestion that we should extend jury service to the public as a whole and that it should not be confined to ratepayers. I do not think I agree with that. A jury's job is a highly responsible <Col N="713" /> one.  If you are to get satisfactory results, you must have the people with the most stable outlook and stable situation in the country.  I think you get that more from the ratepaying class, which mainly consists of the heads of households and people somewhat more mature than the ordinary individual.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give some explanation to the House why jurors are not being paid and, if they are not going to be paid, why every Minister, presumably acting on advice from his officials, has given the same answer: that they are going to be paid or that the matter is under consideration.</P>

      <P>It is a strange anomaly that the matters raised were matters not contained in the Bill, while very little was said in regard to what is contained in the Bill.  Deputy McGilligan asked was it permissible at present to have mixed juries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is that Section 31 of the 1927 Juries Act provides that in Dublin juries must be mixed, that is, drawn partly from the city and partly from the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill in the first instance was to bring relief to a very severely tried section of the community in Cork city.  These people were being called on for jury service at least once every 16 months, whereas in most other districts the rotation is about once in every ten years.  That matter was brought to my attention on a number of occasions, and not so very long ago by a member of the Opposition.  I deemed that a very severe trial on these people, that they should be asked to render jury service every 16 months whereas in most other cases it was every ten years.  This Bill will not completely alleviate their hardship, but it will bring a considerable degree of relief. We hope by reason of the fact that we bring parts of the county into the borough that we shall bring in a <Col N="714" /> sufficient number of the population to add names to the jury list.  As a result of that move we hope to be able to reduce the period of service to about once every four years.  Even that, in comparison with other districts, is still reasonably difficult.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman wanted to know why it was that the jury record book was not being dealt with more promptly.  He gave the impression that when people die or reach the age of 65 years they went off the register and that the book of records was being continually depleted as a result. My information is that that is not correct. The position is that a juror is asked to serve only once in the lifetime of that book of records.  Therefore, I cannot see Deputy Sweetman's point of view.  Either he has been misinformed on that point or he is misinterpreting the regulations.</P>
      <P>As I have said, most of the discussion related to matters that are not contained in the Bill and it would be highly undesirable for me to answer questions that are not relevant to the Bill, such as the question of the payment of jurors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I brought in this Bill specifically to bring relief to a certain section of the community that require relief.  If it is thought desirable to bring in an all-embracing Bill containing all the matters referred to by Deputies, such as payment of jurors, the right of women to sit on juries and so on, that is a matter for another day or another Minister or another Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing only with a certain aspect of jury service that I think should be dealt with and in regard to which, perhaps, if it had been brought to the attention of Ministers in former days, they also might have realised the hardship that was being imposed upon these people and might have taken the same type <Col N="715" /> of action that I am taking now.  I am not suggesting for a moment that I am dealing with all the ills from which jurors may suffer.  Therefore, I feel it would be undesirable for me to answer all the questions that have been put up.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman wanted my opinion as to whether civil cases should be tried by a judge without a jury or not. I am pretty certain&mdash;I am sure Deputy McGilligan will verify this&mdash;that even in legal circles that is a matter for dispute&mdash;as to whether civil trials should be judged by a judge with a jury or a judge without a jury.  I could not give any opinion on that. First of all, I would not be competent to do so.  I am sure that on that aspect there are many varying opinions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to the fact that there were great hardships caused by jurors having to come very long distances.  He mentioned one of the things that I was made aware of, that is, jurors having to travel as far as from Berehaven to Cork City.  That was an undoubted hardship, especially when one considers that these people had not only to travel that distance of roughly 100 miles but had also to pay their own expenses to get there and perhaps had to keep themselves while in the city.  That will not happen under this Bill.  They will be completely and entirely relieved of that and will have to serve on juries only in their own district or the surrounding area.  Therefore, I can conclude by saying that the Bill will bring necessary relief to the people of Cork City especially but also to the people of the other areas referred to in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked one question and it has been misunderstood.  I knew it was possible to have a mixed jury in Dublin, that is, juries drawn partly from the borough and partly from the county.  What I was asking and intended to ask was what was the reason for insisting on a mixed jury, why not have it possible to have a jury drawn entirely from the county borough or entirely from the county or mixed as between the two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> While I am on that point, I do not know who decides, so to speak, the proportions of the mixture.  I assume it is the county register.  I presume it can be, say, 10 per cent. would be from the county, 90 per cent. would be from the borough.</P>
    <P>I want to come to the further point of freedom, not insisting on anything but allowing the jury panel in Dublin to be made up entirely from the borough, entirely from the county or partly from one or partly from the other.  That was the point of my question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only assume that the reason is the same as in the case of Cork.  We were so limited as to the number of people available for service in Cork City that we had to go outside and bring people in from far away in the county.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear <Col N="718" /> that he is engaged somewhere in this Oireachtas because I had suspected that he was disseminating his usual inaccurate information at some dinner around Dublin or somewhere else. Since speaking on this motion on 16th February, some matters have arisen to which I want to draw the attention of the House.  One is the matter of the Taoiseach's speech on that very day.  On that day the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>I think I am entitled to assume from the terms of the trivial amendment moved by the Fine Gael Party, and the speech delivered in support of it by Deputy McGilligan, that, in fact, the Fine Gael Party, the principal Opposition Party in the House, has no serious complaint to make about transport policy as it is now being administered and have, indeed, no objection to the closing of branch lines so long as local politicians are given adequate opportunity of blowing off steam on deputations to the C.I.E. Board.</P>
      <P>That was a most disgraceful statement to make and even more disgraceful was the manner in which it was reported all over the country.  It was reported by Radio Éireann on the 6.30 News Bulletin.  Nothing else was reported in that News Bulletin except the paragraph that I quoted.  The serious part of that is that from a semi-secret circular I have got of the census taken recently of how the news was heard by the people, it seems that 40 per cent. of them listen to the 6.30 News and to the 10.15 News.  We got a fair report in &ldquo;To-day in the Dáil&rdquo; at 11.15 p.m. but only 10 per cent. of the people of Ireland listen to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat that it is not for political purposes that we bring these matters in here.  We come in here to protest against the policy of C.I.E. and especially against their policy of taking up the railway lines.  We are compelled to come in here by the pressure of our constituents and of people of all shades of opinion.  If we do not come in here and do that we are failing in our duty to the people whom we are supposed to be representing.  When we have the Taoiseach making such a <Col N="719" /> speech as that and when it is so widely reported I throw it back to the Taoiseach that we are not local politicians who are blowing off steam on deputations to the C.I.E. Board.  In any case, the C.I.E. Board saw to it that nobody could blow off steam or say anything at all to them because, in their own dictatorial fashion, when they did agree to receive a deputation from the various authorities they would not allow them to speak about the railway lines they were tearing up.</P>
    <P>That action, as I said when I was speaking on this motion on the last occasion, was going back on the undertaking that the Taoiseach solemnly gave to this House when the C.I.E. Bill was going through.  Now we know, and we should have known then, that the solemn undertakings of the Taoiseach are worth nothing.  The Taoiseach went on to say that he had got nothing but a niggling speech from the spokesman of the Opposition and he went on to speak of the complaints that had been made by the various constituencies in which the C.I.E. Board were tearing up the lines and blowing up bridges.</P>
    <P>He went on to say as reported at Column 604:</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the roads of these areas will be given an amount of additional traffic which they are unsuitable to bear.  The figures given earlier today by the Minister for Transport and Power go a long way towards demolishing that contention.  It is, however, the policy of the Government to assist local authorities to maintain the roads in their areas in a state suitable for the traffic using them.  If we get from these areas realistic proposals for the bringing of roads up to that standard, they will be very carefully considered.  But it is not helpful, either to the consideration of the problem or to the interest of these areas, to have fantastic estimates of costs prepared on a propagandist basis and publicised in the press.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach spoke of realistic proposals and a Deputy who supports Fianna Fáil applauded him as if the only realistic proposals were those put up from Donegal.  The proposal put up from Waterford was put up by two competent engineers of high integrity, men who could stand over their proposals.  It will be proved when the time comes, and I shall say it in this House, that the Minister for Transport and Power has given wrong figures again.  The proposals put up by the engineers of the Waterford County Council and the Waterford City Council were realistic proposals put up by competent engineers.  Why should we have to put up with this policy of C.I.E. and this policy of Fianna Fáil for the destruction of the railways?</P>
      <P>We find the Road Fund practically raided to drag large sums of money into a county that the Minister for Local Government happens to come from.  We were told there was £75,000 of special railway grants being given to Donegal to make good the loss of the railways.  Now it is £75,000 for five years which will cost the people who pay road tax on their cars £375,000.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to interrupt me and have this dirty, I can make it as dirty as he likes to have it.  I have listened to the Minister and the Taoiseach belying the situation.  I think Deputy Loughman on the back seat had better go to the Department of Local Government to have his own constituency gerrymandered so as to make sure he comes back.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This Deputy will look after himself.  The Taoiseach also said during this debate that C.I.E. had gone to merchants in another area <Col N="721" /> outside my constituency and asked them how much extra traffic they were prepared to give the railways if the railways were continued, and they did not get satisfactory answers.  Deputy Michael Pat Murphy in reply said this was a gross misrepresentation.  I asked how many merchants were approached in Waterford and Tramore and the Taoiseach, in his usual sidestepping manner, did not answer that question at all.  The Waterford and Tramore railway with which I am concerned does not carry very much traffic or goods.  It is passengers it carries.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the accurate figures that would be given by the Minister for Transport and Power.  The Minister for Transport and Power in his address to the House at column 537 of the Official Report of 16th February last said that the Waterford-Tramore service would have three buses and one lorry plus appropriate trailers and containers.  &ldquo;Some additional vehicles will, of course, be required for peak traffic.  For example, two additional buses will be required for the Waterford-Tramore service during the holiday season.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a very well-informed Minister giving us accurate information.  He said there would be three buses on the usual service and there would be two more, five buses.  I can show the figures which will indicate that 2,000 people could be carried to Tramore by train. When I was on this famous deputation to C.I.E. the General Manager of C.I.E. told the Mayor of Waterford that he would have 20 buses on the road.  The Minister for Transport and Power comes in and tells us there will be six.  It is there on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the pronouncement that was issued by C.I.E. to the various areas where it was intended to close the railways the people concerned were told that when the railway lines were removed an adequate service would be substituted.  The phrase &ldquo;adequate service&rdquo; used by C.I.E. is a Fianna Fáil habit.  They did not say that that service would be as cheap.  What do we find now?  We find, of course, there is no bus service at all to Tramore <Col N="722" /> except the private bus service the Tramore workers organised.  We find that the bus service when it is running will cost the people much more.  The adult day return fare was 1/9d.; child, 11d. return, and 11d. return for a pram.  The bus will take the adult for 2/6d. return, the child for 1/3d. and the pram for 3/- That is the blessing the Minister for Transport and Power has conferred on the mothers of Waterford who want to take their children to the seaside.</P>
    <P>It is a disappointment to me that a Tipperary man should interrupt when I was speaking about the Tramore railway because even before the Tramore railway was built Kickham mentioned that Tramore was a place where most of the people in Tipperary first saw the sea, and he wrote a magnificent chapter on it.  I have the figures for 1959.  In the month of July, 1959, 5,813 people were taken on an excursion from Tipperary, Clonmel and New Ross to Waterford and thence to Tramore on the Tramore railway.  There were also excursions from Kildare, from Thurles and again from New Ross; excursions from Abbeylaois, Portlaoise, and Tipperary again.  On the following Sunday in July there were excursions from Thurles, New Ross and Tipperary; 377 people from Tipperary and 287 from New Ross.  On the days of Tramore races the following passenger figures are recorded in respect of the train services: on 12th August, 1959, 2,506; on 13th August, 1,060; on 14th August, 1,386, and on 15th August, 3,680.  It would be marvellous on the next 15th August to be watching all these people storming around trying to get to Tramore if there were only the six buses and the special lorry the Minister for Transport and Power is providing.  If there were 20 buses there it would be a nice sight on the Tramore road.</P>
    <P>This was a railway service which was supposed to be losing £3,000.  Then it was losing £6,000, then they told us it was £9,000.  Never did they use any vision.  Next they sent the efficiency experts, the dictators.  When the old &ldquo;dodderers&rdquo; were running the railway they were able to have <Col N="723" /> £30,000 in their reserves.  That was when they were using an old line and an old-fashioned brass engine.  But in those days it used to be baskets of coal, shovelled in by what the experts called an inefficient fireman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they had to keep him on as a railway porter. Then they sent us a diesel.  It was supposed to be the wonder of the world.  What would it not do for the Tramore line?  In the old days we were able to do the journey in twenty minutes.  But this new diesel, this masterpiece, would do it in fifteen minutes and would take 600 people.  At one stage I said that the old train could carry 1,500 people.  Soon afterwards I got a storm of letters of protest saying that I was wrong.  I was wrong, the letters said, because the old train could take 2,000 people instead of 1,500 and, I was told, when the old train was running there were no queues of people left waiting on the platform.</P>
      <P>However, we had to concede to the dictators, the men with the cold eyes who could not see anybody, reason with anybody, talk to anybody.  They gave us their efficiency.  They sacked our fireman.  And then they said they could not run the railway any more. Immediately before that decision, we expected, of course, that we would be consulted.  We were depending on the word of the Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass, and now we and the people of West Cork and West Clare know what the word of the Taoiseach is worth&mdash;nothing better than that of a thimble-rigger.</P>

I suppose it was the fish they eat that helped close the place down.  I must say again that I despite the audacity of the Galway Deputy who keeps interrupting us here on such an important motion.  I think I am perfectly entitled to continue without interruption, coming as I do from a city where 4,000 people have bought single tickets for Britain in one year and where we have no special benefits or grants towards the foundation of new industries.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the Tramore railway line was not economically important.  That is what I call the Dublin mentality about such things.  But it was very important in the summer months when thousands of mothers from Waterford were able to bring their children out of the city on Sundays to the seaside in Tramore in speed, comfort and what we call efficiency.  No accident ever occurred on that line, but the Taoiseach says it was not economically important. I suppose if some Germans, Japanese or Chinese gentlemen came along and got us to stick in thousands of pounds belonging to the &ldquo;Tá Sés&rdquo; it would be economically important although it would not cost this House one brass farthing.  I suppose it was economically important to call for such speed in the tearing up of the tracks when, on a wet day, the workmen came along, minutes after the close down order, and tore down the bridge and then began to tear up the line.  Andrews was able to do that in a few hours.  And then we had these audacious interruptions from the Galway Deputy.</P>

      <P>Neither do I see why a Donegal Deputy can come in here and interrupt us when we are talking about a small matter of a £3,000 loss and when we see the burdens his Party have thrown on the country.  I wonder how many of them will have the audacity to go down the country in a few months' time?  I wonder how many of them would have the guts to go down to Tramore and consult even members of their own Party on the matter of this railway line and the manner in which the whole matter has been treated by the Minister for Transport and Power?</P>
      <P>When this matter became known to Deputies early in November last it was impossible to get a reply from the Minister for Transport and Power. He could tell us nothing about it; it was a matter for C.I.E.; it was not his function.  When it came to the day that I put down a motion we had no less a person than the Taoiseach coming in challenging the right of a Deputy to put down a motion. The Taoiseach is referred to here in the Report on the 7th December, 1960 as saying that he was not refusing to provide time for a motion which he thought the Dáil could properly discuss but in his view this motion was so framed that it was objectionable.  That motion was submitted to the Chair and had been accepted and with no disrespect to the Taoiseach I suggest he had &ldquo;a neck&rdquo; to say that.  That is what Parliament is here for and what he is here for&mdash;to provide time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He staved it off.  He wanted to make sure he would stave it off until the bridges were down and the rails torn up.  Then the C.I.E. motion was brought into the House by the Minister for Transport and Power, a Minister who was mute through all this agitation by myself, by Deputies from Cork and by one Deputy from Clare, Deputy William Murphy.  I say that with all respect because there is another Deputy from Clare in the House that I am sure the Chair knows about and who would not be in a position <Col N="726" /> to say anything about the matter. There is another Deputy, a Member of Fianna Fáil and a Minister and probably one of the nicest people over there, but he would be precluded from saying anything about it.</P>

      <P>I shall not impinge on it.  It was possible for that Minister to pull this man out of his office and I am just making a comparison and saying, would it not have been possible for the Minister for Transport and Power to have sent for the Chairman of C.I.E. and asked him to meet the deputation led by the Mayor of Waterford and to discuss this matter and let him then give a ruling on it?  He would not do that.  He refused to do it; refused to speak of it and refused to meet anybody about it.  As a matter of fact one could not meet him at all at <Col N="727" /> that time.  He was like the Scarlet Pimpernel, rushing from one Chamber of Commerce dinner to another, making extraordinary statements about some never-never land that was enjoying enormous prosperity.  We could never find out where this Innisfáil was that he was talking about.</P>
      <P>I got so many letters and protests that, as a matter of fact, they include some from very staunch Fianna Fáil supporters who, I am sure, will still vote Fianna Fáil but who were loud in their anger not alone at the fact that this railway was being destroyed but at the manner in which C.I.E. did it.</P>
      <P>Now I want to come down to the small man, somebody that Fianna Fáil Deputies may laugh about, such as the fireman.  With the Deputies opposite it is always funny for a man to lose his job.  There are a couple of forgotten people in this case.  There are two employees of C.I.E. who live in Tramore, not actually working on the Tramore section of C.I.E. but at Waterford-North.  They travelled in every morning, on a privilege ticket that railmen get, to their work and they paid 9/9d. a month for the ticket. Now, with the Minister's magnificent &ldquo;adequate service&rdquo; they will pay 11/9d. a week.  These men will never have income tax worries or P.A.Y.E. worries.  One of them is married and has four children and he takes home £6 13s. a week from C.I.E.  The other man has twice as many children and he takes home £6 18s. a week.  His travel bill comes to £2 7s. a month&mdash; it used to be 9/9d. a month.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to take note of that and hand it to the Minister for Transport and Power and ask him what he is going to do about it or can he do anything about it, or would he be afraid to give a direction to the satraps of C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are tearing up these lines and have come along from what is called the Metal Bridge and they are approaching Carriglong Bridge now. They may have it down tonight.  But it is not too late yet.  I think the Minister should show his teeth, if he <Col N="728" /> has any, by sending a direction to the Board of C.I.E. telling them to relay the rails and operate the railway in the coming Summer.  If it loses money I will be the first to come in here and say: &ldquo;<i>Mea culpa.</i>&rdquo;  I do not think now that I shall have to do that.  I think, too, it will be a miracle if the Minister responds to my request.  Let me tell him it would be the kind of gesture which would make him a really great man and demonstrate to the Deputies of this House that the direction of a Minister of Dáil Éireann carries some weight.  It would also rehabilitate the Taoiseach, for he has broken his word and broken the undertaking he gave here.  It would be a great day's work for the Minister for Transport and Power to restore this fine service, a service which gave such pleasure to such large numbers of ordinary people.  Above all, such restoration would rehabilitate the Taoiseach in the eyes of the people of Tramore and Waterford.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I want to mention.  There are certain items which do not appear in these accounts. C.I.E. have a Gestapo travelling around the fairs and marts.  These Gestapo travel in cars.  They are constantly changing.  They behave like the meanest informers.  They act as <i>agents provocateurs,</i> going into bars trying to find out is any farmer carrying home a beast for a neighbour and getting a few bob for doing so.  I should like to know how much that service is costing C.I.E.  What does it cost to maintain these cars?  What is the cost of depreciation on them?  What does it cost to pay the salaries of the people who do this work?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like again to ask the Minister for Transport and Power to make some statement in reference to what the Taoiseach said about the engineers in the employment of Waterford County Council, Waterford City Council and Cork County Council.  That was a scandalous reference and there should be some explanation given.  I hope there will be, though I doubt it.  I have never known the people on the other side of this House ever to admit they were wrong. I have never seen them do the proper <Col N="729" /> thing.  I have never yet experienced any number of this Government getting up and saying that he did not mean what he said in the terms in which he was reported and that it was not his intention to make any attack on particular people.  I hope some statements on those lines will be made now.  But I doubt it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a more favourable position to speak here this evening than the previous speaker, Deputy Lynch, because our railway in West Cork is still running.  I have had representations from every organisation in West Cork, from people from the West Cork area and from all over the world asking us to ensure that this railway will continue in operation.  We describe it as the lifeline of West Cork. If we lose it we will lose a very valuable asset, an asset the loss of which will sever us from the direct route to Dublin.</P>
      <P>We are told that long haulage is the most economical and the most suitable. The railway line from Bantry to Dublin is the longest rail service in the whole of Ireland.  The main line from Cork to Bantry is 62 miles.  There are 30 miles of branch lines, making 92 miles in all.  We do not regard the line from Cork to Bantry as a small line or as a branch line.  We regard it as a main line, with branch lines at Timoleague, Courtmacsherry, Skibbereen, Baltimore, and various other small stations.</P>
      <P>I want to impress on the Minister&mdash; let us hope he will be impressed&mdash;the importance of this area to the whole economic structure not only of West Cork but of C.I.E. itself.  The railway line of West Cork has contributed its share to the workings of C.I.E.  Looking at the report, I am very pleased to see that the financial position of C.I.E. is improving notwithstanding the fact that the railway is still running in West Cork.  I am glad to see that in the railway section the loss of £1,247,489 for the year ended 31st March, 1959, was reduced to £558,614 for the year ending 31st March, 1960.  A total loss of £558,614 for the whole country is not a very huge sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an operating profit on the <Col N="730" /> road passenger service of £868,480 as compared with £783,415 in the preceding year.  That goes to show that C.I.E. is improving its position.  Over 300,000,000 passengers were carried, more passengers than were ever carried before on this system.  That shows the importance of the service we have. I wonder do we appreciate the service as much as we should.  I believe it is a better service and a better system than any substitute which could be put on the road.  I believe it is more economical than any substitute.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, agreed in 1957 that it was far more economic for C.I.E. to keep on the rail services than to change over to road services.  I believe that the same position obtains in this country to-day, that if they change over to road services it will cost this country a colossal amount of money. Wear and tear will be far greater.  I know that in West Cork alone the first thing C.I.E. will need to do is to buy about 100 new lorries to cater for the requirements of that area and they must put two men on each of those lorries, which makes 200 men and 100 lorries.</P>
    <P>I am basing that on the trade of the area.  We, in West Cork, can produce probably 100,000 tons of beet and that must be transported in 100 days.  That means that from our area, which is now on the point of closing down its railway, we must transport 1,000 tons of beet a day.  That involves 100 lorries a day travelling over the roads of that area for beet alone.  In addition to the beet traffic we have the fairs and traffic from the fairs at that particular time of year, when the beet trade is in full swing, is at its heaviest. We know that the traffic from fairs varies from 30 to 70 wagons in addition to lorry transport and if the 100 lorries of beet and 50 or 60 wagons and lorries of cattle are on the road, in addition to the trade of the area with the various merchants, I do not for the life of me know how the roads can carry that traffic.</P>
    <P>Great industrial development is taking place in West Cork at the moment.  There are, as we are informed <Col N="731" /> by the Taoiseach, new factories building which I am very well aware of&mdash; three new factories going up and applications for four more and, in the words of the Taoiseach when he spoke here in this debate, the outlook for West Cork was never brighter.  The Taoiseach also said that the demand for industrial development in that area was unprecedented.  I think if the outlook is so good and with our present business going on as it is in the cattle and the beet trade this is the wrong time to close the railway.  The decision to close the railway was taken I believe four years ago.  I have here before me the Beddy Report and also the map which they outlined in that report.  In that map they cut off every line from Cork West and the next line they meet is that from Cork to Tralee via Killarney.</P>
    <P>Times have changed considerably in those four years.  We have, I am glad to say, made progress.  The Taoiseach knows we have made progress in those four years.  I agree we have made progress and I hope we continue to make progress.  We intend to expand also in the tourist development of the area and we are grateful to Bord Fáilte for the interest they are taking in that development.  But it certainly will be detrimental to the area if what we started last year with the aid of Bord Fáilte is to be curtailed now.  We started package deals last year and attracted tourists to the area from Dublin who travelled by train down to West Cork.  Is that to be sabotaged now because the railway is to be taken from us?  It was only a start but it is a business that was going to grow to great dimensions&mdash; the tourist industry of the area.</P>
    <P>I believe that a rail service to West Cork is as important as a rail service to Killarney and, indeed, Glengarriff can rival Killarney for scenery and attractions.  Instead of closing the line from Bantry to Cork, I would make a very strong appeal to extend the line further west from Bantry to Glengarriff because that is going to be of great benefit to the tourist industry. The people of that area depend solely on tourism for their livelihood. <Col N="732" /> There is a tremendous interest at the present time in the development of tourism in West Cork.  We have inquiries from all over Europe and from America and Australia and there will be a great influx of tourists to West Cork.</P>
    <P>It is only now that the people have really discovered the south.  We were forgotten and lost long enough but they have discovered us now.  The Germans have discovered us; the Dutch have discovered us and the Yanks have discovered us.  They are all interested in us.  Why, in the name of heaven, are the only people not interested in us here in Dublin?  Why would they not do something practical to keep the railway going?  I would not make a case to keep the railway going if I felt it was not justified, but I believe that the railway is essential for development both from the agricultural, industrial and tourist development points of view.  The Tourist Board agreed when they submitted their recommendations to the Beddy Board in 1957 that it would be detrimental to close it.  The same argument holds good to-day.</P>
    <P>Some people may not realise that the President of America has many relations in West Cork, on his mother's side&mdash;the Fitzgeralds of Skibbereen&mdash; and when American people, who are taking a great interest in President Kennedy's ancestors and the place of their birth, come to Cobh, they certainly will be very pleased to be transported in a decent railway carriage pulled by the excellent diesel trains which we have, rather than to be rattled about in C.I.E. buses, which may lead to illness on the way down. If we are to develop tourism as it should be developed, we must retain the railway line to West Cork.  I believe common sense will prevail and that we will succeed in keeping this lifeline.</P>
    <P>I note here in this Report that the Board closed seven lines last year but they do not know yet what savings will be effected as a result.  It would be good policy for the Board to stay their hand. They admit they do not know whether the result has been a saving or a loss. <Col N="733" /> I believe the closing of the West Cork line would result in a very serious loss, whereas both the people of West Cork and C.I.E. would benefit if the line were kept open.</P>
    <P>I also notice this Report states that:</P>
    <P>...a Suggestions Committee was set up and is in permanent being to deal with suggestions from the staff and from the general public.</P>
    <P>I wonder where that Suggestions Committee have their headquarters?  For several months we in Cork County Council have been trying to get an interview with somebody in order to make suggestions.  When the announcement was made of the closing of the railway line, the Cork County Council immediately formed a representative deputation comprised of the highest in Church and State in Cork county, men quite capable of making suggestions to anyone interested in receiving them. But we could not get a receiver for the huge volume of suggestions we wished to put forward to improve the railway system in West Cork.  I can assure the Minister that we had on that deputation men who could put forward constructive views and suggestions to the responsible authorities in Dublin.  I do not know what this Suggestions Committee have been doing.  Are they being paid?  I think we should find out a little bit more about them?</P>
    <P>One of the suggestions which that deputation was going to put forward was made already in the Beddy Report.  It was the suggestion that C.I.E. could run their business economically and efficiently with 30 per cent. fewer staff than what they have at present and that they could carry on the same amount of business.  I knew that was a fact.  I knew there was no necessity whatever to close down completely the line to West Cork. A good case could be made for closing down certain stations where very little trade was being done.  I would approve of closing down some of the stations and dispensing with some of the stationmasters, porters, and others who were doing nothing.  Indeed, I feel that some of the stationmasters who were doing nothing could have been put to better use trying to get some trade for C.I.E.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> That is just one of the suggestions made in the Beddy Report which was never implemented.  If that suggestion had been implemented during the past four years and there had been a cutting down of staff by 30 per cent. all over the country, C.I.E. would have become a paying proposition overnight and there would be no necessity to close any railway line.  But I suppose the powers that be in Dublin had greater influence than the people in Cork and were able to retain a 100 per cent. staff in some areas while the employees in West Cork were wiped out 100 per cent.  That is most unfair and unjust, to wipe out 100 per cent. in one section and retain 100 per cent. in other sections carrying the same amount of traffic as the West Cork line.</P>
    <P>I have a volume of correspondence to convince me that there are many lines in Ireland carrying much less traffic than our line.  I am informed there is a line from Drogheda to Oldcastle, 40 miles, on which there is one goods train daily and no passenger service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">

      <P>There is another line from Clonsilla to Kingscourt, 15 miles, on which there is a goods train on two days of the week only.  There has been no passenger service there since 1947.  I have got these figures by post and I am giving them for the benefit of the House.  There is another line from Clara to Banagher, 18 miles, with only one goods train daily.  There is a line from Portlaoise to Mount-mellick, seven miles, with one beet train daily from October to January. It is closed for the remainder of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I get letters like that pointing out the injustice being done to West <Col N="735" /> Cork, I think I have a duty to my people to fight, whether we win or lose.  I have correspondence even from the city of Dublin pressing me to keep up the fight to the end.  It comes from people in Greystones who tell me of the difficulties they have experienced since some of their services were curtailed.  This is what the letter says:</P>
    <P>We wish you every success in your fight to save the railways.  As you probably know, we here in South County Dublin were very active and have averted a complete closedown.</P>
    <P>They must have been more active than we have been in West Cork because we have not succeeded in doing that yet.  The letter goes on:</P>
    <P>However, there is at present great dissatisfaction with the bus service to Dún Laoghaire and Dalkey.  The difficulties now existing are due to the closing of the railway stations and the curtailment of train services.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power informed this House that there were no complaints subsequent to the closing of the railway.  I have evidence here from residents in Dublin, Greystones and Dalkey that within the bounds of Dublin there are complaints since the Harcourt Street railway line was closed.</P>
    <P>We also know that in Kenmare there were complaints when cattle were left overnight after a fair.  I appreciate that it would be almost impossible for C.I.E. to estimate the number of cattle at a fair and that it would be frightfully expensive for them to cater for a fair because in one fair there might be 60 wagons of cattle whereas in another fair there might be only 30 wagons of cattle.  In the rail system a train with two men could carry the 60 or 70 wagons.  At no extra cost the engine pulls 60 or 70 wagons to the town where the fair is held.  If the train is taken from that area, will C.I.E. send 30 lorries or 60 lorries or will they take the chance that there may be 70 lorries of cattle at a fair? Will they send down all those lorries <Col N="736" /> and employ the necessary number of men on the speculation that there will be so many cattle at a fair?  It would be impossible, impracticable.  Chaos will be caused in the cattle industry in the area in West Cork which is going to lose the train.</P>
    <P>In our case if the railway is closed, the roads must be improved.  I sincerely hope that it will not be necessary to go ahead with road improvement. I hope that commonsense will prevail and that the railway service will continue to operate.  Should the railwayline be closed, a colossal amount of money must be spent on the roads serving the towns which are now being served by the railway.  The roads are narrow and winding.  There are approximately 100 bridges and level-crossings in that whole railway-line, all of which would have to be improved.  I accept our county engineer's report as being factual.  I have known our county engineer over a long number of years.  I have never known him to be out in his estimates.  He is a conscientious, hardworking man. I regret that the Taoiseach saw fit to criticise in any way our county engineer's report on the road requirements of West Cork consequent on the closing down of the railway.  I know it was a very modest report and the amount he specified would not bring the entire road up to the required standard.  Each bridge and level-crossing will cost approximately £2,000.  That means £200,000 at the outset to level the bridges and level-crossings for the traffic which will come on the roads.  If we were to get £75,000 a year for five years, the first £200,000 would go on straightening bridges and level-crossings and all that would be left to improve the roads would be £175,000.  I know that is not sufficient because in my experience of road-making it costs from £10,000 to £15,000 a mile to bring a road up to main road standard and there are 113 miles of road to be brought up to that standard.  As the engineer said at the end of his report, there is no use making an estimate on that basis because the sum would be prohibitive, running into millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> I do not think the people in Dublin realise the seriousness of the position. I should like to impress on them the great disadvantage it will be for the people of the area if the line closes and the fact that the country generally will lose a great deal more than it will gain. In the event of an emergency we would have no mode of transport.  It is absolutely necessary to keep the railway going.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the figures produced by C.I.E. in respect of losses in West Cork, West Clare or Tramore.  I reject them on very good grounds.  There was never a breakdown of the figures.  I think Dr. Andrews stated that he could not segregate the figures.  At best, the estimate of a loss of £56,000 was a shot in the dark.</P>
    <P>To justify my case, may I say that in 1957 there were 22 branch lines in this country losing £100,000.  How can three lines be losing over £80,000 in 1960?  It does not sound sensible to me.  Neither does it sound sensible that the West Cork line is losing £56,000. Even if it was losing £56,000 there were plenty of ways and means at the disposal of C.I.E. to remedy that situation and to improve the position if they had any ambition to do so.  They allowed the position to go from bad to worse without making a genuine effort to remedy it.  The only conclusion the people can come to is that C.I.E. were biding their time until the position got so bad that a good case could be made for closing the lines.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the position with merchants in West Cork since the decision to close the line was taken.  I asked them if they would give their trade to C.I.E.  They informed me that they would do so if C.I.E. were competitive in their charges.</P>
    <P>I got the charges at which they could get their goods delivered and I got the rates which C.I.E. were charging.  There was a difference of 10/- a ton.  I think it would be hardly fair to expect the traders of West Cork to support C.I.E. while that difference obtained.  They could get their goods delivered by the private haulier into their stores at 10/- a ton cheaper than C.I.E. would bring it to the station for them.  At that time <Col N="738" /> the C.I.E. men were practically idle, both the freight men and the men at the station so that the whole thing must have been mismanaged.</P>
    <P>The claim that the people of West Cork did not support the railway line is not supported by the facts.  How could they be expected to support it when the charges were prohibitive, so as far as the carriage of goods was concerned? C.I.E. should have become competitive.  I believe they were competitive in other areas, and that they made package deals with firms.  I know that they made no package deals in West Cork except the one deal in connection with the tourist development of the area.  If that development had been carried a little stage further, it would benefit C.I.E. and it would benefit the whole area.  It is wrong then to claim that the people of West Cork did not support the railway.  C.I.E. was to blame.  If there was something wrong in the whole set-up then the matter was well worthy of discussion.  This suggestions committee must have been very lax in their duty when they did not attempt to discuss the matter with the people of West Cork.  When they saw their business going down, they must have realised that something was very wrong.</P>
    <P>As regards the transport of cattle, I know that the rail service is the most satisfactory and economical for the long haul.  Buyers come from the midlands and Northern Ireland to West Cork and they send their cattle back by the long haul.  The rates for that long haul were very reasonable indeed, much more reasonable than the rates by lorry.  A wagon of cattle from the fair in Bantry to the midlands or to Dublin would cost about £18.  I discussed the matter with some of the lorrymen and their charges would be from £45 to £50.  That should give an idea of what the people of West Cork are in for when the rail service ceases.  Will C.I.E. give the same service as the lorrymen and at the same rate that they have been giving for the long haul?  If they do I am afraid they will not be long in business.  The lorrymen who are doing it at the moment have to charge from £45 to <Col N="739" /> £50.  The rail service is the most suitable for the long haul and the longest haul in Ireland is from Bantry to Dublin.  It is one that should be maintained at all costs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Board of C.I.E. we have other State-sponsored bodies operating in West Cork.  I wonder is there any co-operation at all between those State-sponsored bodies?  We have the Dairy Disposal Board there. It was stated that the co-ops. did not support C.I.E. but here is the State-sponsored body, the Dairy Disposal Board, which operates over the whole area and I wonder if they support C.I.E.?  We also have An Bord Iascaigh Mhara which does substantial business in the area.  That is a State-sponsored body and I wonder does it contribute to the trade of C.I.E.? We have the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna operating in West Cork.  They are State-sponsored bodies doing substantial business in the area and if they gave their freight to C.I.E. it would amount to a considerable volume of business.</P>
    <P>We are, at the moment, contemplating the development of Castletownbere as a major fishery harbour.  I mentioned the advisability of extending the line from Bantry to Glengarriff. That would bring it much nearer to Castletownbere where we are considering this development.  I want to impress on the Minister the importance of having a railway near such an important development.  In the Beddy Report, they stated that such an important development should be within 25 miles of the nearest railway.  If we extend the line from Bantry to Glengarriff the town of Castletownbere will be approximately 25 miles from the station.</P>
    <P>There are other villages 10 or 12 miles further on so that even after extending the line to Glengarriff there will be areas of West Cork still 35 miles from a railway.  I consider that it is absolutely necessary to extend the line to bring it nearer to the people of that peninsula, to bring it nearer to the major fishery harbour of Castletownbere where hundreds of thousands of pounds are to be expended on the <Col N="740" /> development of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Between that major development and the major development of tourism for which Bord Fáilte are giving us substantial sums at the present time, and with other local developments we hope to spend over £200,000.  I hold that all that money will be wasted if we are to lose the railway line on account of the few pounds supposed to have been lost on it in the last year. I want to make the best case I can for holding on to our railway lines.  I am doing it on the instructions of the people of West Cork.  The people of Dublin have not shown any great anxiety to keep the service going.  The Board of C.I.E. are not very interested. Those who spoke so far in this debate, mostly from Dublin, seem to be very anxious to close down our lines.  The most unkindest cut of all was to find even Deputy Sherwin throwing his weight behind the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>I do not know what grievance the people of Dublin have against us. Many a West Cork man took a single ticket to Dublin and has contributed to every development that has taken place since the foundation of the State in building up this magnificent city. They contributed in the industrial sphere.  Housing estates went up.  Factories and airports were built.  Dublin would not be the beautiful city it is today were it not for the people of rural Ireland and were it not for agriculture, our major industry.</P>
    <P>It is shortsighted on the part of Dublin people to adopt this attitude towards an area which in the past was forgotten but which, I am glad to say, is about to turn the corner.  We often hear it said in this House: &ldquo;We have turned the corner.  We have beaten the crisis.&rdquo;  We in West Cork have reached the corner, and we were about to beat the crisis which has been confronting us for the past 30 years.</P>

We shall make it up by means of the people who take the single ticket to Dublin and contribute to the management of the city's affairs.  If the people of Dublin were as efficient as the people who came from Cork to run affairs in Dublin, there would be no necessity to close the West Cork line.</P>

      <P>This proposed close down of the West Cork line reminds me of something I read in Chesterton's <i>The Omnipotent State</i> in which he described how the elephant travelled through the forest one day, and came by a nest of eggs which had been abandoned by the mother.  Looking down at the eggs, he wept over them with pity and compassion and, in that moment of pity and compassion for the eggs that had been abandoned, he decided he would sit on them himself. I am afraid Dr. Andrews, when he discovered West Cork late in life, wept with pity and compassion over the people there and, like the elephant and the eggs, decided he would sit on us.  The people of West Cork are not and never were people to be sat upon. They are not taking this lying down. They have a hard battle to fight but they are waging it honourably in defence of their own territory.  We have suffered enough in the past through emigration and it is high time we turned the corner and started to improve our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Transport and Power, when he is replying, will try to put it across that it is a step forward to put extra buses and extra lorries on the road.  However, that is not recognised in any other country in the world.  There is no other country abandoning its railway system in this manner.  Every country is holding on to its railways to the greatest extent possible as a vital necessity in building up its economy.  I am sorry the Minister <Col N="742" /> for Transport and Power is not here to listen to a final appeal from me tonight.  When he was Minister for Lands he took a great interest in fisheries in West Cork.  He went down there and discussed the problems with the people concerned.  He wined and dined with the fishermen in Schull and Castletownberehaven.</P>

      <P>I want only to appeal to him to continue the same interest in the transport and power of West Cork as he did in the fishery industry when he was Minister for Lands.  I believe if he does, he will immediately bring pressure to bear on Dr. Andrews and his board to change their mind.  Dáil Éireann is still supreme and, if the Minister for Transport and Power wants to do so, he can do it with the help of the Taoiseach and the help and blessing of this House.</P>
      <P>This matter has been very badly handled from the start.  It was a pity that the deputation appointed at the outset was not received so that their views could be heard and digested before any action was taken.  I know the Taoiseach did approve of such a course because he said in this House that Dr. Andrews might well have received that deputation.  Is it too late now for common sense to prevail, for Dr. Andrews and his board to receive this deputation and to hear their views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> Let the Minister for Transport and Power and Dr. Andrews and his board bury their pride.  It takes big men to admit they made a mistake.  The mistake they made in not hearing the views of the deputation has been recognised by even the Taoiseach. From the point of view of the development of West Cork, I say this is the wrong time to close this railway. That is the only black spot on the map as far as we are concerned.  It is a blot that could easily be wiped out overnight.  I feel sure some Deputies are bored stiff with West Cork and its railway.  I was often bored myself, but when the shoe pinches one must make allowances.</P>
    <P>The shoe is pinching that particular area just now, and I feel Deputies not directly interested might allow us a little leeway.  Dr. Andrews is not being asked to accept the views of the deputation.  All he is being asked is to hear them.  It might do him and his Board some good.  It is essential in all business that the goodwill of the customers is retained.  C.I.E. and their attitude to problems of this kind have done nothing to keep the goodwill of their customers.  They should change their attitude if they are to survive at all.</P>
    <P>There is a long history attached to the West Cork Railway.  If I gave that history I am sure Deputies Loughman and Geoghegan would be really stiff before I had finished.  The railway has been there over a hundred years.  It was built by the people of West Cork, at great expense, and the people of the area invested their money in it.  It broke many of them. C.I.E. have not the moral right to do what they are doing&mdash;to kill the life effort of so many people in West Cork.</P>
    <P>That railway was at one time the Cork-Bandon and South Coast railway, run by local people, but once it became a national effort it got top heavy and inefficient and the closing of the line is the price we pay for this little piece of nationalisation and centralisation. I have here a letter from the Save the Railways Committee of West Cork which says that their <Col N="744" /> efforts to save the line were non-political, that the members of that Committee are drawn from all political parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is another letter that I have not referred to.  It is a quotation from &ldquo;Save the Railways&rdquo; of West Cork.  The other was from &ldquo;Save the Railways&rdquo; in Dublin. In addition we had the Teachers Organisation, recognised as a very learned body of men, who, when the decision to close the line was made, passed a resolution boycotting C.I.E. in future in the road transport section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>C.I.E. are getting £1,000,000 a year for five years from the Exchequer.  I presume this is to tide them over the transition period in which they are expected to improve their position and build up trade.  The 1958 Act was passed through this House. Nobody opposed it but it would be wrong to suggest that we gave full power to Dr. Andrews and his Board to close down whatever line they choose at their own discretion.  On the contrary we gave them £1,000,000 a year to build up their business and show by their efficiency and good management that they could do the necessary work of making the railway services a profitable business in five years.  One very prominent man in West Cork, at one of the meetings to which I was invited, said: &ldquo;Any fool could close the railways but it would take a man of great ability to make them pay.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I imagine he had a car.  During this period when C.I.E. are getting £1,000,000 a year the people of West Cork, West Clare and Waterford and the rest of Ireland are contributing their share of that £1,000,000.  In fairness to them they are as much entitled to the service as the people of any other area and while that £1,000,000 is being paid they should at least get the railway service to keep the business going and develop it further if at all possible.  There is room for development in West Cork; it is only now development is taking place.</P>

      <P>I shall conclude with a final appeal to the Minister for Transport and Power to do something big in the immediate future to rectify the damage that has been done and arrange for Dr. Andrews and his Board to receive the deputation to discuss the future development of this vast area, over 100 miles long, where there is wealth for all only to exploit it.  We have English, American, Canadian and German firms there at present exploiting the area.  Some of them deal in minerals.  There are two mines, one at Allihies and the other in Clonakilty. The railway is essential at the moment; never before was it so essential for the development of the area. I ask the Minister to arrange to discuss with the people of West Cork the future development of the area.  If there is no future for the area.  Dr. Andrews and his Board are perfectly right but I am one of the optimists who believe there is a future for West Cork and a future for the railways also.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly Deputy Wycherley is a very fluent orator but the odd thing about his speech is that he had very little to say which was relevant, in my opinion, to this <Col N="746" /> motion.  He had very little argument to put forward in favour of continuing the railway in West Cork.  As far as I could judge, his best argument was the tremendous development in West Cork at present but the extraordinary fact is that it all began after it was decided to close the West Cork line.</P>

      <P>I am pretty certain that the industrialists concerned would have taken that into consideration if they were anxious about it.  If the railway was an essential part of their investing in these industries they would try to have the railway continued.</P>
      <P>I shall come back to the speech of Deputy Wycherley.  I listened for three-quarters of an hour to Deputy Lynch and I gather he rather resented a person from Tipperary talking about the Tramore railway line.  I can inform Deputy Lynch that the people of Tipperary have a tremendous interest in the journey between Waterford railway station and Tramore and I can assure him they would welcome very much the change which will take place when the new bus system starts because henceforward they will get into a bus when they get out of the train in Waterford and will be saved a journey of practically two miles across the city before coming to the station for Tramore.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch spoke of 2,000 people travelling on the train to Tramore. That number may travel but certainly not 2,000 Waterford people as he suggested.  I am pretty certain that three-quarters of these came from Counties Wexford and Kilkenny and even further away, people who went there on excursions practically every Sunday.  I go to Tramore frequently and one of the amazing things about it is the enormous number of people who travel there in cars.  In fact during the summer period it is practically impossible to get parking space for a car down even into the sand at the end of the promenade.</P>

    <P>Under the provisions of the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, grants equivalent to one-half of net revenue expenditure are paid from the Health Vote to each health authority.  The loss to local funds which would result from a cessation of the income shown above would accordingly be reduced by one-half.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Total: £50,000</P>
    <P>
      <i>Note</i> 1.  The grants at (<i>a</i>) and (<i>g</i>) represent 40% recoupment of approved provisions by the local authorities concerned for main road upkeep.  The figures marked with an asterisk are provisional.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Note</i> 2.  The grants at (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) are allocated on a mileage basis.  In a number of cases transfers as between the two classes of grants were effected in accordance with general conditions laid down by the Department, during the course of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Note</i> 3.  The grants at (<i>d</i>) are confined to counties in the Gaeltacht and congested areas in accordance with an eight year programme initiated in 1953-54.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Note</i> 4.  The grants at (<i>e</i>) are made available for selected works on main roads, such as the replacement of dangerous bridges, which cannot be dealt with under the main road improvement grant (<i>b</i>).  In addition to the allocations listed, there are provisional commitments in respect of certain bridges where increases in cost, etc. are likely to arise.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Note</i> 5.  The grants at (<i>f</i>) arose following the passing of the Road Fund (Grants and Advances) (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1959, and are given to certain road authorities to enable them to deal with the road problems created by railway closing and the establishment of major industrial undertakings.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Note</i> 6.  The grants at (<i>h</i>) totalling £150,000 are determined having regard to the relative needs of each area and are similar to previous years' allocations.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Note</i> 7.  The urban road improvement grant (<i>i</i>) was introduced for the first time in 1960/61.  The distribution of the £50,000 is related to the mileage of urban roads in each town.</P>
