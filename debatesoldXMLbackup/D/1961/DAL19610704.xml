      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental difference between the arrangements for the training of psychiatric nurses and general nurses.</P>
      <P>Each district mental hospital has a training school for psychiatric nurses and the number of student nurses in each is limited to the capacity of the hospitals concerned to absorb them when their training is completed.  Very few psychiatric nurses are trained in this country outside these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are only four training schools for lay general nurses attached to local authority hospitals, viz. St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork, the Galway and Limerick Regional Hospitals and Ardkeen Hospital, Waterford.  The intake of student nurses at these hospitals is not related to the capacity of the hospitals to absorb them as qualified nurses in due course, with the result that many who train at the hospitals in question must, after qualification, seek posts elsewhere.  Consequently, there can, in present circumstances, be no question of permanency in the <Col N="5" /> local authority service for nurses who train in these hospitals.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I regret that I cannot see any prospect in the immediate future of extension to general nurses trained in the four schools for general nurses referred to of the arrangements mentioned in the case of the district mental hospitals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no functions in relation to the charge for rations supplied to nurses employed in Voluntary Hospitals.</P>
      <P>The charge for rations supplied to nurses employed in health authority hospitals is a matter primarily for the health authority concerned.  Prior to the most recent bonus award, the deduction in respect of rations was within the range of £91 to £95 a year. Following that award, the question of an increased deduction for rations arose and an increase of 6d. per day was applied to certain categories.  I understand that in cases where the deduction was increased, health authorities are considering the abandonment of the increase and a refund of the extra deductions.  I have informed health authorities that I have no objection to this adjustment.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to doubt that the quality of the rations is other than satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,398,450 be granted to complete <Col N="16" /> the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing and Miscellaneous Grants.</P>
    <P>The total Vote for my Department for the year 1961/62 is £5,488,450, involving a net increase of £151,420 on the corresponding provision made in the last financial year.</P>
    <P>The chief increases are £105,000 in the provision for grants to private persons, etc., for the purchase, erection, reconstruction and improvement of dwelling houses; £39,000 in the provision for contributions towards loan charges of sanitary authorities; and £15,000 in the provision for grants for the acquisition, clearance and improvement of derelict sites.</P>
    <P>The cumulative increase in the provision of grants for private persons' housing is now £900,000 in excess of the corresponding provision made before the passing of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1958.</P>
    <P>The demand for new house grants rose by a further 20.7 per cent. in 1960/61 as compared with the previous year.  The number of grants finally paid showed increases as compared with the previous year of 22.1 per cent. for new houses; 14.5 per cent. for reconstruction, repair or improvement of houses; and 48.8 per cent. for water and sewerage grants.</P>
    <P>I expect that in the current year there will be a further increase in the allocation of grants for new houses and also for provision of piped water supply and sewerage in rural houses.  In particular, the organisation of co-operative groups to provide private water supplies in rural areas is likely to increase the demand for grants under this head.  A number of these schemes have been completed and have clearly demonstrated the benefits which co-operative effort can provide for the participants.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31st March, 1961, housing authorities completed 1,463 <Col N="17" /> dwellings as compared with 2,414 in the previous year.  At the close of the financial year the number of houses in progress amounted to 1,751 as compared with 1,429 as at 31st March, 1960, while houses in tender at 31st March, 1961, totalled 941 as compared with 847 at a similar date in 1960. Tenders sanctioned during 1960/61 provided for the erection of 1,917 dwellings as compared with 1,068 in the previous year.</P>
    <P>A circular letter issued to housing authorities in October last was designed to extend their discretion as regards the initiation of schemes to complete slum clearance and also to widen the scope of the classes for whom new housing schemes might be undertaken. They were advised that they might, without obtaining the Minister's prior approval, formulate proposals for schemes to meet the needs of persons living in unfit and overcrowded conditions and of other persons in the letting categories to whom housing authorities are required by law to give priority.  In any area where there is a large number of persons in the priority categories still to be rehoused, all new housing proposals must, on legal and social grounds, be directed to rehousing such persons.</P>
    <P>This is the position, for example, in Dublin and Cork County Boroughs, where active slum clearance is still in progress.  The circular letter went on to advise housing authorities that where the needs of the priority categories have been or are in course of being met, proposals could be submitted for persons eligible for and in need of housing qualifying for one-third subsidy, where such persons are not able to rehouse themselves with the aid of grants and loans etc., under the Housing Acts.</P>
    <P>As regards areas in which there may be a small number of persons living in unfit and overcrowded conditions, the councils are advised to prepare a comprehensive programme to meet the needs of all categories.  Where the persons living in unfit and overcrowded dwellings cannot afford the rents normally charged, there is an obligation on the housing authority to fix a rent within the means of the <Col N="18" /> family in question or to seek a suitable opportunity to rehouse the family in a vacant pre-war house at a low rent.  If the housing authority&mdash;as is its statutory duty&mdash;is prepared to undertake in a reasonable period of years to deal with all such remaining cases of persons living in unfit dwellings, there is no objection to its formulating schemes for other categories.  Arrangements on these lines have been made with a number of housing authorities.  Inability to pay a high rent should not be allowed to prevent families being rehoused from unfit and overcrowded conditions and there is an obligation on housing authorities to fix rents accordingly.</P>
    <P>As regards rural areas, provided the housing authority is taking reasonable steps to meet its statutory respon-sibility in relation to families living in unfit or overcrowded conditions, there is no objection to the formulation of schemes for other categories for which genuine housing needs exist. The circular letter specifically refers to the position in this respect of towns and built-up areas in county health districts.  The terms of the circular letter would admit the building of houses in county health districts both for persons living in unfit and overcrowded conditions and for other categories provided, of course, a new house is not let to a person not in the priority categories when a person who has such a priority is available to take the house.  The objective should be to build enough houses to meet all needs and by building one-third subsidy housing where required, to prevent the recurrence of slum conditions.</P>
    <P>When I speak of meeting all needs, I intend to include cases of bad housing which up to now have not come to the notice of the housing authorities. Most of the major housing programmes of the past decade have been based either on the necessity to rehouse persons displaced by housing authorities' operations or on individual applications for housing accommodation. We have now reached the stage where we must ensure that all unfit and overcrowded housing conditions are brought to light and dealt with.  There is an obligation on housing authorities <Col N="19" /> under the Act of 1931 to inspect their districts and to keep up to date records of all unfit dwellings.  In general, however, housing authorities have not complied fully with this obligation, and I therefore over a year ago requested them to carry out comprehensive surveys in their areas with a view to formulating specific proposals to eliminate the remaining unfit housing conditions.</P>
    <P>These surveys have been carried out in some areas and considerable progress made in others.  I am sorry to say, however, that there are quite a number of areas where progress has been unsatisfactory.  Preliminary estimates received indicate that there still exists a residue of unfit dwellings which should be made the basis of further building programmes.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly told housing authorities that there is no financial or other restriction on their plans to eliminate unfit and overcrowded housing conditions.  My circular letter of October last freed them from the necessity to seek my prior approval to formulating schemes to deal with such cases.  Housing authorities, therefore, have adequate facilities and freedom to undertake all schemes needed for the eradication of bad housing.  No comprehensive programme can, however, be formulated without first ascertaining if and where the unfit conditions exist and what is their extent.  I would, therefore, appeal to the housing authorities which have not yet done so, to press ahead with the housing surveys and complete this very necessary work as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like, once more, to impress on housing authorities that it is in their own interests to help persons to build houses for themselves with the aid of the grants, loans, rates remissions, and other public facilities that are available.  There are many people who in the absence of these facilities would have to look to the housing authority to rehouse them.  Most local authorities have responded commendably to my appeals that they should continue or resume the making of supplementary grants to persons <Col N="20" /> erecting or repairing their houses.  I now appeal again to the authorities in the few areas where these grants are not being given to reconsider their attitude in the light of the fact that it would be to their own benefit to formulate a scheme.  Housing authorities should also provide sites for private building.  This is being done in many areas, but the need for any further such sites should be carefully examined.</P>
    <P>As regards advances under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, I am happy to be able to inform the House that I have made arrangements with the Minister for Finance whereby issues from the Local Loans Fund will now be available for the purpose of making such advances to persons whose incomes do not exceed £1,040 per annum, instead of £832 per annum as was previously the case.  At the same time, I hope that local authorities in a position to do so will continue to explore sources other than the Local Loans Fund for the purpose of making these advances, in view of the various other demands on the resources of the Fund.</P>

      <P>Housing authorities have now reached the stage where the good management of their housing estates should be a matter of prime concern, particularly because of the rate of demand by tenants for the purchase of their houses.  When a housing authority proposes to transfer a house to the tenant, it should have been maintained in such a manner that the necessity for costly structural repairs should not arise.  Borrowing of substantial capital sums at high interest rates could largely be avoided if a reasonable policy of annual maintenance were pursued.  The postponement of essential maintenance works can result only in far more costly major repairs having to be met later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 31st March, 1960, over 51 per cent. of the 84,150 cottages provided under the Labourers Acts had been <Col N="21" /> vested in the tenants and the rate of vesting is improving each year.  There are, however, wide differences in the amount of progress achieved in different areas.  In one county, over 77 per cent. of all the cottages provided have been purchased by the tenants while the lowest percentage is 16.2.  It is in the interest of both the tenant and the housing authority, and indeed, in the overall national interest, that this policy should be advanced and I appeal especially to the local representatives in areas where the rate of vesting is low to bring to the notice of the tenants the benefits to be derived from taking advantage of the cottage purchase scheme.</P>
    <P>A slightly increasing trend is shown in the number of houses sold or leased to urban tenants and urban housing authorities continue to facilitate those tenants who wish to acquire their dwellings.  Schemes for the sale of 16,893 houses in 71 urban areas have been approved up to 31st March last and 1,640 houses have been sold.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in Subhead E.4 for taking up the share capital of the National Building Agency, Ltd.  The company's capital, £100 divided into 100 shares of £1 each, is purely nominal.  In accordance with normal practice, the formal allotment of the share capital will provide that the bulk of the shares will be held by the Minister for Finance.  The relatively substantial call on the Agency's services which has so far emerged has justified our anticipating this particular problem associated with industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>As regards the work of consolidating the various legislative codes relating to housing, I hope that it will be possible to include in next year's housing legislation a clear and manageable code governing all aspects of private housing, including grants, supplementary grants and loans.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provides in Subhead G for a sum of £425,000 for subsidy towards the annual loan repayments in respect of sanitary services schemes. This sum shows an increase of £39,000 over that provided for 1960/61.  In dealing with last year's Estimates, I <Col N="22" /> referred to the fact that the planning and execution of sanitary services works generally spans a number of years and I pointed out that curtailment of the programme produces effects which are evident over a long period.  I am glad to be able to report that the results of the corrective measures which I had put in train became apparent towards the close of the last financial year.  There was a small but significant increase in the draws by local authorities for sanitary services works from the Local Loans Fund last year, notwithstanding the fact that persistent wet weather entailed serious delays in some of the major schemes.  Work was started during 1960/61 on 95 water supply and sewerage schemes estimated to cost a total of £1.8m.  The aggregate value of water supply and sewerage schemes in respect of which loans were sanctioned during the year 1960/61 was £3.1m. as compared with a figure of £1.06m. for the previous year.</P>
    <P>At 30th April, 1961, the gross value of all schemes at the various stages of planning was approaching £11m. as against a comparable figure of £7m. at the end of April, 1960.  The bulk of the increase reflected in these figures was in the value of schemes at the contract stage, which increased by approximately £2¼m.  This, I think, augurs well for a significant improvement in the volume of work which will be under construction in the coming year. The increased activity of sanitary authorities in the implementation of the programme for the improvement of the piped water supplies position in rural areas is reflected in the figures I have just mentioned.  In pursuance of the drive for the improvement of the water supply position in rural areas, which I announced in September, 1959, as the next objective of social policy, no effort was spared by my Department to ensure the early completion by sanitary authorities of the comprehensive county surveys which will form the basis of the programme.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that, with the whole-hearted co-operation of the local authorities, preliminary surveys have been completed in all areas, and the first results of these surveys in the <Col N="23" /> form of maps outlining possible schemes and areas of development of the water supply programme in the various counties have already been on display at the &ldquo;Turn of the Tap&rdquo; Exhibition at the Mansion House in mid-April.  In some areas, definitive programmes have already been adopted by the councils and have been submitted for consideration by my Department. In North Cork a programme has been prepared envisaging a cost of £2.06m. which will cover 71% of rural houses.  In Tipperary South Riding, outline plans have been prepared for regional schemes to cover practically the entire county health district and to serve over 90% of houses.  In Donegal, a three-year programme envisaging an expenditure of £621,340 has already been adopted and will be followed by further similar programmes.  In a number of other counties the comprehensive reports from the surveys are being considered by the county councils at present with a view to the adoption of definite programmes of works.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the water supply drive which has engendered a certain amount of controversy in the course of the past year arises from opposition in certain quarters to the local authority programme because of the alleged impact on the rates.  It has been suggested that increases varying from 9/- in the £ to 15/- in the £ will fall on the rates as a result of the carrying out of a ten-year programme.  There is no foundation in fact for these forecasts.  The true estimated cost can be determined in detail only on the basis of the definitive programmes which will be adopted, I hope, by county councils in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>The figures of £35 million for the ten-year water supply and sewerage programme and of £30 million for water supplies only, are necessarily tentative estimates based on the probable cost per house of the number of houses which are likely to be served directly by sanitary authorities.  They do, however, substantially represent my aim of securing an expenditure on these programmes of approximately £3 million a year for the ten-year period. <Col N="24" /> While an estimate can be made of the probable cost on the rates in the country as a whole of the service of the debt arising from a programme of £30 million, if carried out uniformly and spread over a period of 50 years, such figures do not constitute a valid basis for estimating the impact on the rates in any particular area.  Such an estimate should be made on the basis of the local programmes.  The impact on the rates will vary from area to area according to the valuation of the area, the extent of the programme to be adopted by the sanitary authority, whether the area is suitable for servicing by smaller schemes, or whether large-scale regional schemes will prove the most economic in the long run.</P>
    <P>The programmes which will be adopted will be based on the detailed facts brought to light by the comprehensive surveys, evaluated by experts, and processed finally into a programme following the most careful consideration by the local elected representatives. For example, in the case of South Tipperary, where an almost complete regional coverage is anticipated, the programme is expected to represent a gross cost of 5/- in the £ on the rates. In the North Cork area, the £2.06 million programme to which I have referred is expected to entail a gross expenditure of about 3/- in the £.  In Donegal, it is estimated that a gross rate of 1/5d. in the £ will result from the adoption of the first three-year programme. Thus the estimates so far show considerable variations as between one county and another, and, although they are gross figures subject to abatement by various factors, in no case do they amount to anything more than a mere fraction of the net rate increases predicted by the sectional opposition to the programme.</P>
    <P>My figures are exclusive of income from water rents or water rates and it would be proper to take into account the substantial relief to rural ratepayers afforded by the agricultural grant, which will reduce the impact on the first £20 of the land valuation of holdings to two-fifths of the net rate involved.  Income from water charges cannot be accurately estimated at this early stage, but in some counties calculations <Col N="25" /> based on estimates of the numbers of houses to be served suggest that further reductions in the gross rate of from 7½d. to 1/3d. in the £ may be obtainable from this source of revenue. Furthermore, in assessing the effect on the rates of any continuing programme of capital expenditure financed by borrowing, account must be taken of reductions in annual loan charges as earlier borrowings are paid off.  Responsible public representatives will, I am sure, agree that this important social programme can be considered by them only on the basis of authoritative facts and figures elicited by surveys and evaluated by the experts.  A decision as to what the ratepayers can or cannot afford can be left safely in the hands of the local elected representatives.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of domestic water supply, I should like to refer to a demand which has emerged in the same quarters that the entire cost of the programme should be borne by the consumers.  Some have even suggested that if the consumers of water cannot afford to pay for its full cost, then they should not get it.  I am quite sure that this approach will receive no support from any responsible quarter.  In the case of a vital resource such as water the community must bear a collective responsibility.  In the rural areas 84 families out of every 100 have no piped water.  The majority of families without piped water are the smaller farmers. These same farmers have been contributing to the annual loan charges in respect of the sanitary programmes carried out for towns and villages in their county health districts over the past 30 years.  Apart therefore from the impracticability of carrying out largescale schemes on the basis of their being financed by individual consumers, these persons have a positive right in equity to participate in the amenities which they have already helped to provide for other portions of their districts.</P>
    <P>The argument has also been used that people who are installing private grouped water supplies should not be asked to contribute towards public schemes.  While paying due tribute to these people for their enterprise, I <Col N="26" /> cannot agree that that should absolve them from any liability towards their neighbours in this matter.  They are being given substantial help by the community in installing their private supplies&mdash;State and local grants are available for this purpose.  It is also the intention that in appropriate cases the local authority will take charge of the maintenance of these schemes.  It is inevitable that any large scale programme should take time to implement and that its benefits should only become available gradually.  It must happen that many people who will not benefit immediately are nevertheless called on to contribute under the system of spreading of charges over county health districts which is now universally applied to sanitary expenses. The same process, the same deferment of benefit should be as acceptable for water supplies as it is in relation to roads, housing and other services.  The principle of community responsibility for such services is now well established, and reversion to a system of benefit charges would be to re-erect a barrier to progress which has fallen into discredit.</P>
    <P>I have recently given local authorities details of the increased Exchequer subsidies now available for the provision of public sanitary conveniences, ranging from 40 per cent. to 60 per cent. of annual loan charges.  These represent a substantial advance on the flat rate of 25 per cent. formerly allowed, and I hope that sanitary authorities will be encouraged thereby to furnish their areas adequately with structures of good design and appearance. I need not stress the desirability of these amenities at beaches, beauty spots and other points of tourist attraction, as well as in our towns generally.</P>
    <P>I have recently reminded sanitary authorities of their obligations and powers in keeping bathing beaches free not only from the obviously dangerous types of litter such as broken glass and jagged tins but also from unsightly litter of all kinds.  Some beaches near Dublin are already in a deplorable condition in this regard, although the season is not very far advanced.  This is a matter, of course, <Col N="27" /> in which public co-operation and regard for the public interest are essential to any real progress.  I would appeal to Deputies who are in a position to do so to help in making the people realise their own responsibilities in this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to see some positive action taken in the immediate future in regard to the development of a programme for the provision of swimming pools.  With this in view I have addressed a circular letter to sanitary authorities recommending them to undertake without delay a planned programme for the provision of swimming facilities in urban areas where the more important demands of piped water and sewerage facilities have already been satisfied.  Generous financial assistance will be made available to approved swimming pool projects in the form of contributions towards any loan charges incurred. The rate of subsidy, save in exceptional circumstances, will be 50 per cent.  Loans from the Local Loans Fund will be available and will be repayable on the instalment system for periods up to 30 years.</P>
    <P>As an alternative to providing swimming pools themselves, sanitary authorities may, with my consent, make capital contributions to the funds of societies, clubs, committees or other bodies providing or proposing to provide swimming facilities and for this purpose may borrow the sums required.  The same loan facilities and subsidy arrangements will apply to the capital contributions made by a sanitary authority to a body providing swimming facilities.  I have also asked sanitary authorities, as part of their programme, to endeavour to arouse local interest and to secure local co-operation in their efforts to provide adequate swimming facilities in their areas, and to bring to the notice of voluntary organisations, particularly those concerned with swimming and life-saving activities, the financial assistance available for swimming pool projects.</P>
    <P>The need for improved swimming facilities is particularly evident in our capital city.  It may be argued that <Col N="28" /> there are a number of good sea beaches within reach of the citizens, but the expansion of the city in recent years has created a number of inland suburbs whose inhabitants&mdash;and I have children specially in mind&mdash;are denied ready access to the sea or other suitable swimming places.  If they are to swim at all they are forced for the most part to use the canals, disused quarries and the like which are hazardous and objectionable on many grounds.  What is required to meet this urgent need is a number of relatively inexpensive swimming and paddling pools in or near these areas. I understand that Dublin Corporation are considering a solution on these lines and I hope that proposals will be speedily prepared for submission to my Department, where I can promise them a sympathetic reception. Any larger project for a central indoor swimming pool of international competition standard must clearly take second place to making good the serious deficiencies in elementary swimming facilities in many parts of the city.</P>
    <P>Apart from the immense benefit which swimming pools would bring to the various local areas from the health and amenity aspects, and from the tourist viewpoint, they would provide a very valuable adjunct to the efforts I have been making to secure an increased consciousness by the various authorities of the importance of water safety.  I have recently had a circular letter issued to all sanitary authorities conveying my concern for an improvement in water safety measures, and I have conveyed specific suggestions to them which I hope, if put into effect, will help to eliminate loss of life through drowning accidents.</P>
    <P>I hope to see the stage reached soon when we can say that no single life has been lost from drowning which could have been saved if reasonable precautions had been taken by the responsible authorities.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of fire protection, reasonable standards continue to be maintained by local authorities.  The necessity for this service can be judged from the figures for the year 1959/60, which show that a total of 4,713 fires <Col N="29" /> were dealt with by the fire brigades and that the total fire loss for that year was estimated to be over £3,300,000.  The Committee which was set up to review the fire protection standards for public buildings and institutions continued its work during the year.</P>
    <P>In my last Estimate speech I referred to the precautions which require to be taken to ensure proper standards for caravan sites and about the same time I conveyed to all sanitary authorities details of model standards.  I emphasised the necessity for control over temporary dwellings and I asked sanitary authorities to take the initiative in bringing into effect the statutory provision which gives them power to grant licences for camping.  I am glad to report now a considerable improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>Eight county councils and a number of urban districts have acquired powers of control, bringing the total of sanitary authorities who have acquired these powers to 16 county councils and 8 urban districts.  Most of the important tourist centres are represented in these areas.  There is every evidence that the use of caravans will increase progressively from year to year, and it is essential that reasonable standards of health and hygiene should be maintained on the sites.  The tourist potential of this form of holiday is immense and could easily be lost to the country if there is not wholehearted co-operation from all concerned in providing reasonable standards of services and amenities on the sites.</P>
    <P>Sanitary authorities can do much good by the wise exercise of powers of control of this type of development, but in many cases some more positive intervention is required if the best results are to be obtained.  Developers may quite often be unaware of the sanitary authority's precise requirements in relation to the extent of area which should be utilised for this purpose or they may be inexpert in matters such as the proper screening, lay-out and drainage of sites.  I would urge local authorities to help in such cases by providing guidance and advice, and to facilitate good development by assisting, so far as may be practicable, <Col N="30" /> in the provision of access roads, water supplies and sewerage.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in this year's Estimate for a sum of £20,000 for the making of grants to private individuals, local authorities, local development associations and other bodies towards the clearance and improvement of derelict sites.  This represents an increase of £15,000 over the amount provided last year.</P>
    <P>This scheme of grants was introduced in December last to encourage and assist in the clearance and development of derelict sites.  Grants are made on the basis of 50 per cent of the cost of any work which exceeds £30 that may be approved, subject to a maximum grant of £100 in any one case.</P>
    <P>In the short time since the grants were introduced, the initial response to the scheme has been very satisfactory and encouraging.  By the close of the last financial year, applications had been received in respect of 156 sites.  The number of sites in respect of which grants were allocated totalled 91 and the total value of the grants allocated was £6,891.  Payments amounting to £4,090 were made in respect of 35 sites by the 31st March, 1961.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants has been given widespread publicity in the Press, and Radio announcements have also urged owners of derelict property to avail themselves of the scheme.  In addition, local authorities have been encouraged in three circular letters to make special efforts to secure the clearance and improvement of such sites.  I hope that local authorities will make an all-out effort to clear and improve derelict sites in their own control, especially any open spaces in housing schemes that have become over-grown and unsightly and that as many as possible of these sites will be given vitality and character by the provision of such amenities as seating and children's playground equipment.</P>
    <P>The Derelict Sites Act, 1961, became law on the 15th February, 1961. Hitherto, the means available to local authorities for the purpose of securing the clearance and improvement of derelict sites, were both cumbersome <Col N="31" /> and restrictive.  Because the statutory powers were largely inoperable, this aspect of local authority activity has been at a low ebb and there is now a considerable back-log of work to be undertaken.  I hope that the procedures contained in the new Act will be much more effective and that, with the assistance of the grants scheme, many of the waste plots and other derelict properties will be cleared and put to some beneficial use.</P>
    <P>As I previously intimated, the Derelict Sites Act is but the first instalment of a more fundamental campaign to improve the physical development of town and countryside.  Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1960, it is intended to provide local authorities with planning powers considerably more flexible and effective than those contained in the Town and Regional Planning Acts, 1934 and 1939.  These powers will include more effective control over private housing estate development. The Bill is a highly complex one, and the completion of its drafting has to compete with other claims on the time of the officers concerned.</P>
    <P>The growth in the number of motor vehicles, which has been very pronounced in recent years, continued during the past year and has become an accepted feature of the nation's economy.  The number of vehicles of all classes under current licence in August, 1960, was 302,767 compared with 278,469 at the corresponding period in 1959, representing an increase of over 24,000.  In the same period the number of driving licences current increased from 305,000 to 331,000. Extra traffic means more danger to road users and more wear and tear on the roads with a consequent need for more expenditure on the improvement and upkeep of the road system.  Thus, although Road Fund revenue has increased, there is also an increase in the variety and extent of the demand for grants from the fund.</P>
    <P>The programme of county road improvement has advanced so far in many counties that minor roads, <Col N="32" /> involving lower standards of construction, are now being done.  This development, together with the use of modern methods and new materials has led to substantial reductions in the cost of works on these roads so that more work can be carried out in each annual programme than was the case formerly. This augurs well for the possibility of completing the county road improvement programme, in some counties at least, in a shorter period than had been considered possible at its earlier stages</P>
    <P>The bringing of main roads, particularly arterial routes, up to a proper standard is still a big problem, the solution of which would yield major benefits by saving time, fuel consumption and wear and tear of vehicles as well as reducing the number of accidents. Limitation on the moneys available for this purpose (on account of the other demands on the Fund) entails postponement of all but the most urgently necessary works and only a selected number of such works can be done each year.  I am having the problem examined to see what further steps can or should be taken to ensure that at least the most important routes are brought up to standard more expeditiously.</P>
    <P>As a result of the increased revenue accruing to the Road Fund it has been possible this year to increase the grants allocated by £700,000 approximately as compared with last year, giving a total allocation of £6,080,000.  This amount includes a county road improvement grant of £2,949,000 (representing an increase of approximately £350,000), a main road improvement grant of £1,230,000, a main road upkeep grant of 40 per cent. of approved expenditure (this grant also applies in the county boroughs and Dún Laoghaire), £400,000 for the tourist road scheme, £300,000 for road improvement in the county boroughs and Dún Laoghaire and £50,000 for urban road improvement.</P>
    <P>In addition to the normal revenue of the Road Fund, special assistance was made available to the Fund under the terms of the Road Fund (Grants and Advances) (Temporary Provisions) <Col N="33" /> Act, 1959.  This assistance extends over a period of five years at the rate of £400,000 per annum, half being a loan and half a free grant.  These special moneys are utilised to deal with urgent problems created by railway closings and the improvement of access to major industrial undertakings.  The full amount of £2,000,000 has been committed.  Further requests for special grants of this nature have been received and are being examined.</P>
    <P>A recent circular letter issued by my Department draws attention to the need for &ldquo;hard shoulders&rdquo; on heavily trafficked through routes and for laybys in other appropriate cases. These improvements, which are a valuable aid to road safety, will rank for recoupment under the appropriate Road Fund grant.  Advice as to how and when they should be provided is contained in the circular letter.</P>
    <P>As regards road traffic, as distinct from road construction, Deputies may consider that this subject has been exhaustively treated in the debates on my proposals for new legislation. I may mention that improved versions of certain traffic signs, and particularly of the Major Road Ahead Sign, were prescribed during the year.  A series of leaflets on particular aspects of road safety is being prepared, and two have already issued to the public&mdash;one on pedestrian crossings, and one on behaviour at road junctions.  Short films on the same subjects are in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>In most counties the high standard of rate collection of previous years was maintained, the percentage of the rate warrants collected at the 31st March, 1961, being 97.1 as compared with 96.44 at the end of the previous financial year.</P>
    <P>The rates struck by most county councils show increases this year&mdash; the average county rate for the current year being 40/11d. as against 38/11d. last year.</P>
    <P>During the last financial year the total revenue expenditure of local authorities, excluding vocational education committees, committees of agriculture and harbour authorities was approximately £55.5 million.  The <Col N="34" /> figure for the present financial year has been estimated at £58.7 million. These figures represent gross expenditure. Of the £55.5 million for last year, the State contributed £23.1 million or 41.6 per cent. by way of grants and the State's share of the estimated expenditure in the year 1961/62 is £24.5 million or 41.7 per cent. of the total.  When account is taken of other miscellaneous receipts, such as rents from property and repayments by borrowers of loans made to them under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, the net amounts falling on local rates last year and this year are estimated to be £22.3 million or 40.2 per cent. and £22.9 million or 39 per cent. respectively. The State is thus continuing to contribute more towards the cost of local services than the local authorities themselves are levying by way of rates.</P>
    <P>While the total revenue expenditure of local authorities has been increasing, their capital expenditure, which had been decreasing significantly for a number of years, has now levelled off at between £8 million and £9 million per annum.  Capital expenditure decreased from £18.9 million in the peak year&mdash;1953&mdash;to £8.6 million in 1959/60 and has been estimated at £8.7 million for the year 1960/61.  This decrease has been due principally to the fall in capital expenditure on housing consequent on the progress achieved with the satisfaction of housing needs.</P>
    <P>The total net indebtedness of local authorities increased by some £5.4 million in the last financial year and was estimated to be £148.7 million at the 31st March, 1961.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think perhaps one of the outstanding reasons for the reference back arises from the fact that reference to the <i>Economic Statistics</i> issued with the Budget of 1961 reveals that income, including wages, salaries and profits, from agriculture, forestry and fishing is, in terms of pounds sterling, as set out in Table X of the National Income, 1956-60, less in 1960 by some millions than in 1957.  Over the same period, <Col N="35" /> the value of those pounds has declined by approximately 12 per cent., or 2/6d. in the £.  Therefore, not only has the total income from agriculture, forestry and fishing declined in terms of money received but it is also true to say that those engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing are getting fewer pounds of lesser value in 1960 than in 1957.  Yet if we turn to the rate position we find&mdash;and I am taking the most recent figure supplied by the Minister in his statement&mdash;that the figure is £22.3 million.  We find that the rates in 1939, that was before the war, were £6.2 million.  In 1954 they were £15.9 million, in 1955, £17 million, in 1956, £17.7 million, in 1957, £19.7 million, in 1958, £20 million, in 1959, £20.5 million, in 1960, £21.4 million and this year, £22.3 million.</P>
    <P>That represents the total rates collected by all local authorities, including county health districts, urban districts and county boroughs.  The House will observe that the total increased from £15.9 million in 1954 to £22.3 million today.  That is dramatic.  When we turn to the increase that has taken place in respect of the rates in county health districts, we find that before the war they were paying £3.2 million, and as of 1954 they were paying £8.8 million. In 1961 they were paying £12.06 million in rates.  I have not got a breakdown of the total rate collection for county health districts, urban districts and county boroughs for 1961, but it is clear for all to see that the accumulation of burdens that are piling up on those who seek to make a living on the land are breaking those engaged in agricultural industry, especially those engaged in family farming.</P>
    <P>The net result of that is that a very substantial number of them are clearing out of the country because they can no longer pay their way.  That has had the consequential result that the towns depending on those rural areas for their livelihood are finding that the population from which they made their living in the past by providing services is steadily dwindling.  In some area, to my knowledge, the rate has been in the order of 25 per cent. of the population in the hinterland of some of <Col N="36" /> these country towns.  I have in mind towns like Ballybay, Clones&mdash;which has its own particular difficulties arising from its propinquity to the Border &mdash;and towns with which I am familiar in the West of Ireland.  While at the same time the population in these areas is going down with a consequent disastrous abandonment of the land from which families have emigrated and a reduction in the volume of trade passing through the towns, the burden of rates continues to rise and the circle is becoming more and more of a vicious circle with the passage of every year.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that if we are not to have a social revolution in rural Ireland, of a very disastrous and irrevocable kind, some means must be found of relieving the ratepayers in rural areas from the burdens they are at present carrying.  I shall have some reference to make to some of the Minister's further proposals for increasing those burdens before I sit down.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to those paragraphs in the Minister's speech in which he referred to housing.  I have often admired the brazen audacity of Fianna Fáil in connection with their housing activity.  Let me give some round figures.  The total number of new houses built with State aid, as set out in Table 150 of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> of 1960, in the four years from 1954 to 1957 inclusive, was 42,465 houses, giving an average per annum of 10,600 houses.  Remember while that was being done the Fianna Fáil benches in this House were being made ring with protestations that housing was breaking down in Ireland. At the same time 10,000 houses per annum were being erected with State Aid.</P>
    <P>I remember the loud hullabaloo that was going on about the inability of anyone to get employment building houses at that time, and the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass, and Deputy Briscoe drowning all the crocodiles in the Zoo with their floods of crocodile tears over the disastrous situation.  I refer now to Table 152 of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>.  In 1954 there were 7,000 men working on <Col N="37" /> local authority housing schemes.  In 1955 there were 6,000 and in 1956 there were 6,000.  Then Fianna Fáil hove in view, and remember they hove in view pledged to provide work, pouring forth lamentations all over Ireland that the women of Ireland looked to them to provide work for their husbands.  We had an average of 6,000 men employed in local authority housing schemes.  That is leaving out all private houses and leaving out all State-aided houses. These were local authority housing schemes being built by Dublin Corporation, Waterford Corporation, Limerick Corporation and the county councils.</P>
    <P>As I say, in 1957 Fianna Fáil hove in view.  The average number of men employed on local authority housing schemes dropped from 6,000 to 3,500. They did not really get under way then.  They could not stop the programmes that we had inaugurated. But by 1958 they had really got control of the situation and the number of men then employed was 2,500 and by 1959 it had dropped to 2,200.</P>
    <P>What became of the men?  They have found out now because there is a great campaign to pour out money to build anything from office flats to anything else on which money can be spent in Dublin in preparation for a general election.  Now it is found that the men were driven to emigrate and are not here.  The skilled workers are not there with the result that many building operations that should be going forward are not going forward because the key men are not available and, when the key men are not available, the unskilled workers cannot be employed.  That is one of the most cynical and disreputable transactions of which this country has ever been witness.</P>
    <P>The average number of houses built with State aid in the four years from 1954 to 1957 was 10,600 per annum. In the three years since Fianna Fáil came into office, 1958 to 1960 inclusively, the number has dropped to 6,100 per annum.  Now I do not expect them to blush for shame at their own disreputable and fraudulent record in that regard, but I do want to put on record&mdash;it is good for the <Col N="38" /> common policy of the country that it should go on record&mdash;that that kind of dirty fraud degrades the public life of this country.  If that kind of confidence trick is frequently repeated the voters of this country will be right to say that they would not believe the gospel from a public man; and Fianna Fáil have succeeded in persuading a very considerable number of our young people to believe, so gigantic was the fraudulent confidence trick that Fianna Fáil perpetrated in regard to housing and employment, that you cannot now believe anything a public man says in the political life of Ireland.  That is disaster and I am not at all sure whether in our generation it is disaster we will be able to repair.  I am not without hope that we may recover the confidence of the younger generation and convince them that that kind of fraud is not the practice of every element in the public life of this country.  There are still some people who recognise the obligation to tell the people the truth without counting the cost.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was making his statement he said at Page 5:</P>
    <P>As regards advances under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, ....  I have made arrangements with the Minister for Finance whereby issues from the Local Loans Fund will now be available for the purpose of making such advances to persons whose incomes do not exceed £1,040 per annum, instead of £832 per annum as was previously the case. At the same time, I hope that local authorities in a position to do so will continue to explore sources other than the Local Loans Fund for the purpose of making these advances, in view of the various other demands on the resources of the Fund.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to put it on record that in 1956 Deputy Noel Lemass was Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation.  In pursuit of a sinister conspiracy, Deputy Noel Lemass combined with Deputy Briscoe, at present the Lord Mayor of Dublin, to frustrate the purpose of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts and to deny facilities to hundreds of citizens of this city who wanted to build <Col N="39" /> houses, who wanted to employ their neighbours, and who had every right to do so.  They were denied the opportunity of getting their houses.  Their neighbours were denied the opportunity of getting employment.  All that was the result of a sinister and discreditable conspiracy between Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Noel Lemass.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass announced that he would, as Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation, sanction no application for a Local Loans advance unless the moneys to finance it were already provided by way of loan to the Corporation.  It is well known that any such procedure simply suspends the operation of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. Deputy Noel Lemass had guarantees at the time, on the strength of the Irish Exchequer, that there would be available to the Dublin Corporation annual sums from the Local Loans Fund, a source to which they had never had access before, sufficient and adequate to meet every application made to the Dublin Corporation for a Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act loan.  That was a dreadful thing to do.</P>
    <P>Mark you, the House should remember that up to about the year 1956 the Dublin Corporation was not given access to the Local Loans Fund; they were expected to raise their own revenue by loans floated by the Corporation itself.  In the extremely difficult situation then obtaining in the world as a result of the Suez crisis, and a variety of other international upheavals, it was felt that to send the Dublin Corporation to the public money market at that time might involve them in the payment of an excessively high rate of interest with consequent burdens and charges on those who sought accommodation under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act procedure; and the Government not only advanced money to the Corporation but told them that over the next three or four years they could confidently budget in the certainty that they would get from the Government by way of accommodation some £4,000,000 to £5,000,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> The answer applicants were given, when they applied for accommodation consequent on that undertaking was: &ldquo;Not one penny piece until the money has been placed in the bank account of the Dublin Corporation&rdquo;.  That was the reply, although it was notorious that a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts could not be paid out to the applicant for six to eighteen months after the application had been sanctioned.  Now that was an iniquitous thing to do.  It resulted in the emigration of thousands of our people who could have been profitably employed at home.  It held up housing for a most deserving section of our community and it shamefully depleted the resources of our people in skilled operatives to carry on the desirable building undertakings which, from time to time, a socially progressive community should have in hand.</P>
    <P>I have been told by the Minister for Local Government that one of the reasons why there has been this dramatic fall in the total number of houses built or building, with State assistance, is that the back of the housing problem has been broken.  It is true that in those difficult years from 1948 to 1957 we did pour out money on an heroic scale in building houses and many of the orthodox economists thought we were improvident.  One thing we certainly were not was improvident. We knew exactly what we were doing.  We knew the burden the people would have to bear.  Having known the slums of this city, and other cities of the country, since our childhood, we said perfectly deliberately and calmly, that this was an expenditure which we considered to be a first charge on the resources of this city.  We thought it was more important to build houses for the people than to rebuild Dublin Castle.  We thought it was more important to build houses for the people than to buy Boeing aircraft.  We thought it was more important to build houses for the people than to erect places in the Phoenix Park.</P>
    <P>I sometimes walk the streets of Dublin today and look at some of the old sites that I knew, and that the late Deputy Alfie Byrne knew, and in relation <Col N="41" /> to which he was never content to rest until something had been done to remedy the position.  I look at them now and I remember them as he saw them and as he spoke for them in this House and I rejoice that our Government had some share of responsibility in wiping out the hideous conditions that then obtained and in answering to the people for the costs that had to be met.  When I am told the decline in the building of State-aided houses can be accounted for by the argument the Minister makes, I think of the vast areas which have never been reached upon.</P>
    <P>We are now contemplating a £30,000,000 scheme to bring piped water down every road in Ireland.  No one has ever asked himself apparently who will maintain the pipes after they have been laid.  Is there a Deputy in this House from rural Ireland who is not familiar with the water scheme in a rural town?</P>
    <P>Is there a Deputy here who has any knowledge of a town like Ballaghaderreen, Ballybay, Clones, Castleblayney or elsewhere who does not realise what the meaning of a piped water supply is in maintenance in a very restricted area?  You bring water by pipe into a country town; you have a water main from the lake or reservoir from which you draw your water and the main runs through the streets.  If there is a break, to survey the whole length of a main appears a simple job but it can take you months to find where the water is going.</P>
    <P>We are going to spend £30,000,000 to bring water down every road in Ireland and nobody seems to bother to walk up the boreens leading off the roads and look at the houses to which we are going to bring the water and ask why is it that many of the most hardworking farmers are living in houses that are antediluvian in the accommodation they provide.  Has any Deputy ever asked himself that question?  They can get grants from the Government, from the Department of Local Government.  They can get grants from the local authority and yet they do not.  Why?  Because they <Col N="42" /> cannot afford them.  They have not got the capital sum to put down to pay the balance to the contractor.</P>
    <P>Who can say the housing problem in this country is resolved if we are building flats in the city of Dublin costing some thousands of pounds per flat and rightly accommodating the citizens of Dublin but leaving the person living in rural Ireland, the small farmer, in a house which would be condemned as unfit for human habitation if it were within any urban area?  Go and ask these people why do they not improve their houses and they will tell you they are not worth improving.  Ask them why they do not avail of the grant and build new houses and the answer is: &ldquo;Who is going to pay the contractor the balance?  I have not got it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is fantastic to say the housing problem is resolved until we have brought within the reach of the small farmers a scheme whereunder they can build reasonable houses, providing modest accommodation on terms it is possible for them to meet.  I hope to put such a proposal before the country.  I have no doubt, now that that is being adumbrated, Fianna Fáil will do their best to think up another one between now and the general election.  The difference is that the proposals we make result in performance; the proposals they make begin with promises and end with disillusion.</P>
    <P>Now I want to talk about the water supply.  I introduced the first scheme in this country for the provision of water supplies to rural houses.  It is no harm that we should go back over the history.  There was a Deputy here once, Deputy O'Donnell, the Lord have mercy on him.  He came into this House as an Independent Farmer Deputy from South Tipperary.  I very well remember he was in this House in the &lsquo;30&rsquo;s.  Deputy O'Donnell would get up to speak on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs but would end up talking about water supplies to houses in rural Ireland. He would get up to speak on Defence and would end up by speaking about water supplies to houses in rural Ireland.  The plain fact is that many of us thought he had a King Charles's head, that he was a bit cracked on <Col N="43" /> the subject of water and could not keep away from it.  But one of the results of his activities was that long after the poor man was dead and in heaven, I could not get out of my head what Deputy O'Donnell used to say, which corresponded with my own experience.</P>
    <P>The more I thought of how passionately he was attached to this cause, the more it began to dawn on me that Deputy O'Donnell was right, that one of the most cruel inadequacies in the amenities of rural Ireland was the inaccessibility of running water to a farmer's wife.  So, when I was Minister for Agriculture, I succeeded in getting the Government to agree to a scheme whereby if any farmer wanted to bring water into his house, the Government would pay half the cost up to a maximum of a £100 grant. I know there were a great many schemes of that kind carried through and are still being carried through. That meant that a farmer could dig a well, could instal a pressure pump or an electric pump, put a tank on the roof and bring the water into the kitchen.  If that operation cost £150, he was entitled to a grant of £75; if it cost £200, he was entitled to a grant of £100 and if he had to pay £250, the maximum grant was still £100.</P>
    <P>That was followed by a scheme inaugurated by the Department of Local Government.  They are operating another scheme to facilitate individual farmers and groups of farmers to bring water supplies to their houses from a common well.  The construction and protection of the well is part of the scheme in respect of which they are entitled to claim recoupment.</P>
    <P>There is a third problem in the country.  We all know of this.  There are certain areas in rural Ireland where the sub-strata of the soil is such that well water is not to be found.  You will find such an area in the vicinity of Castlepollard in County Westmeath, another such area in the Burren of Clare, another such area in the vicinity of Cong.  There are areas of that character, well defined, scattered here and there, mainly associated with a limestone rock subsoil, badly fissured, <Col N="44" /> which will not retain water.  I am prepared to concede at once that in those areas special measures are necessary and that we should be generous in our readiness to assist the local authority which is responsible for an area of that kind, because in those areas you might have to go three miles for water.  That is an area where it is perfectly justifiable to design a plan to try to bring water, by pipe, if necessary, over a wide area, because living in that area without that amenity becomes extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>But seriously, to set out to bring a water main down every road in Ireland is not only illusory, but it is fraudulent because, if you did bring the water main along every main road in Ireland, you would leave half the farmers just as far away from the water as they are now, and, having paid the rate necessary to meet the capital cost of the main water line, they then have to pay, in addition to that, so much per thousand gallons of water or, if they wanted to put a trough in a field, have to pay an annual charge in respect of the trough.</P>
    <P>If we really are serious about effectively bringing water to every house in rural Ireland, why on earth we do not, if necessary, double the grants we are prepared to give for the individual water supply or the group water supply I cannot imagine.  If we did that then, once you had dug your well and installed your pump, you had free water for the rest of your life, except for whatever the electricity charge was for working the pump and the pump does not work except when you are drawing water from it under one system or for the period taken to fill the roof tank under another system.  If you do not want to use the electricity, you can put up what is installed on every ranch from Kansas to Los Angeles in the United States of America, that is, a windmill pump.  Now that we have rural electricity, the installation of an electric pump is sensible, because the cost of operation is insignificant.  If you do not want to pay for it, you can use the wind as it is used throughout the whole of the rural areas in the United States.  The important thing is that once you have the water, you have <Col N="45" /> nothing more to pay.  If it is a group scheme, once you have installed the group scheme, that is the end of your expenditure.  There is no annual charge in respect of water mains, rent or anything else.</P>
    <P>It would be a thousand pities if we are to spend £30,000,000 over the next ten years, half of which is to be provided by the Exchequer and half by the local authority, I think, not to spend that money on an effective drive to multiply group schemes and individual schemes.  If we did that, I believe we would very quickly bring water effectively to 90 per cent. of our rural homes.</P>
    <P>I ask any Deputy who has any knowledge of rural Ireland to tell me what percentage of water supply will be made available to rural homes if the pipes are brought along the sides of the main roads?  How many farmers in rural Ireland have their houses on the main roads?  Speaking as one who was responsible for sponsoring the first scheme ever operated in this country for the purpose of bringing water to the country homes, I want to put to the Minister that his concept is daft.  If this money is available, it should be applied to the development of the existing schemes under the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Local Government, for the provision of water to rural homes, and we could achieve four times the maximum result that he can ever expect to achieve by bringing the water mains along the roads of Ireland.  At the same time, the water would be made available free to those who availed of the scheme and there would be no maintenance problem for the water mains, thousands of miles of which the Minister is now proposing to conconstruct.</P>
    <P>All that being said, we can confine ourselves unanimously to the necessity for a scheme based on water mains along the roads in those areas where the substratum of the soil is such that the construction of wells is impossible.  I offered as a typical example of that kind of area the Castlepollard area, the Burren of Clare, Cong, and I think there is an area which I recall somewhere in West Cork.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> I am looking now at North Cork where a cost of £2 million to cover 71 per cent. of the houses in North Cork is envisaged.  We are told the average cost for the whole country is to be in the order of 5/- in the £ on the rates.  That is the average; what it will be in certain areas God alone knows.  The people will also be paying for the rest of their lives in respect of water supplies&mdash;for ever from the first day they turn on the tap.  I am for the free water.  I strongly object to providing £30 million for water for which I will also be paying all my life, as will my children, my grandchildren and their grandchildren after them.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the more detailed matters to which the Minister referred.  He speaks of the conditions of the beaches in and about Dublin. I raised that question in this House 15 years ago.  I know of nothing more futile than telling the mass of the people who go to the seaside on Sunday to put their litter in bins.  They will not put their litter in bins; they never have put their litter in bins either here or anywhere else in the world.  There is not any place in the world that has not erected yellow bins, blue bins, bins in the shape of elephants, bins of attractive design, and ultimately the story has always been the same&mdash;the litter eventually ended anywhere but in the bins.</P>
    <P>In any case a good deal of the litter consists of material no one considers to be litter.  Does anyone ever realise what maintains the hairpin industry in existence?  Has any Deputy ever asked himself what becomes of all the hairpins?  They are strangely indestructible.  If you try to destroy a hairpin, you find it is the most indestructible thing you can imagine, and yet women buy them in millions of grosses.  What becomes of them? No one knew the answer until they went to clean up the boardwalk of Atlantic City.  They tried to apply a certain form of vacuum cleaner and the Atlantic City boardwalk but hairpins choked the vacuum cleaner and they found they had to conduct the preliminary operation of removing the hairpins with magnets before they could clean the boardwalk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> I do not say that all the litter on the beaches of Dublin consists of hairpins but a good deal of it consists of material which is simply lost.  People should bring home their lemonade bottles.  They do bring home three, but perhaps the baby has gone off to build sand castles with the other two or three and they become mislaid or are covered by the tide, and they go home with three out of the half dozen.</P>
    <P>Someone else has brought milk bottles and they are used to take water from the sea to build structures in the sand.  When the time comes to go home, no one can find one of the milk bottles.  It is in fact rolling to and fro with the tide and when the tide recedes, the milk bottle is there or there is broken glass on the sand for someone to put his foot on.</P>
    <P>There is no way of dealing with this problem unless we employ what is used on the great beaches at Sydney in New South Wales, on the coast of California and in Long Island in New York.  We must turn to their experience there.  The problem there had become utterly intolerable and had to be dealt with or the beaches would have become uninhabitable.  I am informed they have dealt with it completely effectively and that it can be done.  I understand it must be done by a process of mechanisation.  Unless that is demonstrated to the local authorities here by some central authority, I do not think any local authority will want to take it up.  There is a system now by which, as you move a machine down along a beach, all the sand to a depth of some inches actually passes through the machine, which eliminates all debris, glass and foreign material of one kind or another and which retains and returns the sand to the beach.  Short of that, there is no effective system of making beaches, used by large numbers of urban populations, habitable after a certain period. I suggest to the Minister that if he wants to get something serious done about that, some central authority will have to be asked to demonstrate that system to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I doubt if it will be necessary on the beaches in places like Kilkee and Bundoran. <Col N="48" /> Even were it necessary, it certainly should not be as necessary to do it as on beaches approximate to large cities like Dublin and even Waterford. There, it may be necessary to do it several days during the tourist season; but it is not impossible, even if it were done at much more infrequent intervals in other centres, that it might prove adequate.  There might be some collaboration between several tourist centres to employ one unit of equipment which could be used at less frequent intervals on different stretches of strand.</P>
    <P>But I see this reference to this problem turning up so regularly over the years that I begin to wonder is anybody serious about it.  It is a matter of real concern, just as important as the matter referred to by the Minister when he spoke of the desirability of providing camping sites, properly equipped.  I think clean beaches and decent camping sites are a very necessary part of our tourist drive, if it is to be truly effective. I hear everybody pay lip service to it, but I often wonder does anybody intend to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>The same doubts cross my mind when I hear the Minister talk about swimming pools.  I have been listening all my life to schemes for providing swimming pools in this city of Dublin. All my life I have walked along the banks of the canal and it has always struck me that if ever there was an ideal swimming pool available, it is the canal, if it were properly maintained. But instead of its being maintained for that purpose, I see it being filled in.  There is a stretch of canal running from beyond Mountjoy Jail up to the Basin.  I walked along that all the days of my youth, and it then became superfluous.  If that had been taken in hand and turned into a clean, properly maintained swimming pool, it would provide a gala ground for thousands of children in the city.  All you had to do was line it with a bit of cement and employ some elderly gentleman to look after it, or two elderly gentlemen, retired pensioners, chlorinate the water, empty and fill it at regular intervals, and it would have been a great luxury. <Col N="49" /> But, instead of that, for the past 30 or 40 years, the children of the city have been &ldquo;lepping&rdquo; in and out of the canal, dead dogs, dead donkeys, and all, because there was nowhere else for them to go.  I have seen them plunge into it up at Rathmines Bridge, where the old flyboats used to stop&mdash; all the way down from Portobello along the various stretches of the canal.  They would put the heart across you.  How they do not all die of appalling diseases, I cannot imagine.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why, at this time, we cannot take stretches of the canal and make them fit for the children to swim in.  I do not think they want elaborate baths.  I believe the vast majority of them would be delighted with the canals, if they were fit for them to go into.  I heard Deputy Sherwin say &mdash;Deputy Sherwin is a person for whose sagacity I have considerable respect; at present I am confining my admiration to his sagacity&mdash;that children frequently get drowned in the canal.  That causes me some anxiety.  But I am bound to say this: no matter how careful you are, unless you put children in cotton wool, they will meet with accidents if they live a normal life.  If you had stretches of the canal properly prepared to serve as public swimming places for children, you could take precautions and provide some kind of life saving service in periods when large numbers of children use the canal.  But that will not avoid the occasional circumstances of children going to bathe or swim at a time when nobody expects them to be swimming.  If you are not prepared to take that risk, you cannot have baths at all.</P>
    <P>Little children, or indeed grown people, can drown in suprisingly shallow water if they get a cramp at the wrong moment.  The trouble is that little children and youngsters will leap into the water on occasions immediately after their dinner or tea, which is a time they should not do it. You may get an odd case where a child gets a cramp and drowns in spite of the most elaborate precautions you can take.  But I am bound to say I think you ought to take that risk.</P>
    <P>We all have that kind of nightmare to live in, that as soon as children get <Col N="50" /> out of the pram and begin to run off for themselves, your first instinct is to fence them in for fear something will happen to them.  You then realise you cannot fence them in all their lives.  Sooner or later, they have got to meet the ordinary hazards of life. All you can do is to try to introduce them to them with all the circumspection you can, and advise them and counsel them, but, in spite of that, they will do some daft thing.  They would not be children if they did not. You cannot keep them in cotton wool all their lives.</P>
    <P>The canals are part and parcel of the city of Dublin.  It is perfectly possible to make considerable stretches of them safely acceptable for children to swim in, with adequate sanitation and proper chlorination.  If it is desirable, as the Minister has declared, that we should forthwith make available to the bulk of the children of this city bathing facilities as distinct from the Olympic standards that might be required in big municipal swimming baths, I believe we would get a better return from going to work on the canals, quicker and cheaper, than we would get anywhere else.  I believe it could be done safely for the children and at a cost that could readily be met.</P>
    <P>I want to say a short word about town planning.  Town planning is a good thing in theory, but it is getting a very bad name in this country.  The people who live in an area where the county council have had the misfortune to adopt town planning discover that if they want to put a stone upon a stone, they are liable to run into the town planning authority.  They discover that to get any decision out of that anonymous gentleman may take from six to 18 months and that it is extraordinarily difficult to find out who he is. He usually turns out to be an architect or engineer living anything from 50 to 100 miles away, whose concern it is to provide a decision as to whether you can erect your petrol pump on a particular site or whether the end of your barn is not too near the public highway in accordance with the town plan adopted 20 years ago.  If town planning is to retain its good name in this <Col N="51" /> country, steps should be taken to provide that it will not become a clog on new construction or adaptation, and there is that tendency at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of the necessity for the bringing of main roads, particularly arterial roads, up to a proper standard as still being a big problem, the solution of which will yield major benefits by saving time, fuel consumption, wear and tear on vehicles, as well as reducing the number of accidents.  I wonder does it reduce the number of accidents?  I think the slaughter on that part of the Naas Road which was turned into an autobahn in the course of the past few years has been heavier by far since it was turned into an autobahn than before these improvements were carried out.  In any case, I wonder, with our density of traffic, is it necessary to spend the hundreds of thousands of pounds that are being spent on what are called main road improvements as distinct from main road maintenance?  If we could get the maintenance of all main and county roads kept up to the standard at which it ought to be kept, I would not be one bit worried if some of the vast operations that have been going on in rural Ireland, the elimination of curves and providing autobahns, were long postponed.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we have the traffic density on the roads in rural Ireland to justify the millions of pounds we are spending on these huge mechanised operations.  I have a certain sympathy with engineers.  Since the huge earthmoving machinery has been invented, there is something positively exciting in the realisation that at last that curve in the road is no longer their master.  You can now hit the hill right in the middle and go clean through it, whereas before it was a feature of the scenery.  No one had any more thought of moving it than of moving the Rock of Cashel.  Some of these hills were named after the contractors who went bankrupt 50 years ago trying to cut pieces off them.  There are two or three hills in the countryside where I live which are called after the contractor <Col N="52" /> who went broke trying to cut the top off them 40 years ago by manual labour.  They have stood there as a challenge to successive generations of engineers.  Since they had burst so many contractors, nobody would ever try them again, and now they have discovered they can go clean through them.</P>
    <P>I have seen work proceeding in certain counties which leaves me breathless, valleys being filled up, hills being levelled, and the net result is that somebody will take about 90 seconds less to cover two or three furlongs than he did heretofore.  He will save those 90 seconds by travelling that much faster and being required to take that much less care, and I do not know, at the end of it, if he will be very much better off.</P>
    <P>We are all rushing into this actuated largely by what we read in the American and British newspapers about their traffic problem.  Their traffic problem is not our traffic problem at all.  The traffic problem in the United States relates to States like California, New York and densely populated areas like Pennsylvania, where the numbers of motor cars are vastly multiplied.  But when you live in Colorado or Idaho, both of which have a much denser population than Ireland, there is no traffic problem.  We live in the shadow of what we hear is going on in places like New York, Pennsylvania and even Florida and are too much influenced by what we hear is happening in England when the populations of London and Birmingham begin to move to the coast on Sundays and bank holidays.</P>
    <P>We have no such problem.  There may be a slight degree of congestion on the road from Dublin to Bray for a couple of hours on a Sunday or holiday. There may be a slight degree of congestion on the road from Wexford to Rosslare on holidays and weekends, but perennially you can travel the rural roads of Ireland and meet little or no traffic, certainly no traffic that creates a problem, except for the specialised type of traffic like the articulated lorry, which is two lorries functioning as one.  However, that is a separate problem with which we have been dealing for long enough under the road traffic legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> There is no part of Ireland that I know where there is a problem of travelling for long periods bumper to bumper.  I have seen that in New York; I have seen that in England; but I do not believe anybody has ever seen it here except on the day of a race meeting or some local event.  You can even get to the Galway races very handily if you do not travel at the crowded hour before the races begin. Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that when people lay it down to him as a hypothesis that we are behindhand in the bringing of our main roads, particularly arterial roads, up to a proper standard, if that envisages an intensification of the large arterial road schemes, it is something we ought to think about again.  I doubt if it saves much time; I doubt if it saves much fuel; I doubt if it saves much wear and tear on vehicles; and I very seriously doubt if it reduces the number of accidents. One thing is certain, that arterial roads do not improve the attractions of rural Ireland and there is something to be said for that if we are serious in our efforts to encourage tourists to come here who want something different from the autobahns they have left in Pennysylvania and from which they have sought to escape when they elected to take their holiday here instead of heading for Brighton, Bournemouth or Cornwall.</P>
    <P>Is it not interesting to read on page 19 of the Minister's statement that the capital expenditure of local authorities had reached its peak of £18.9 million in 1953 and is now down to £8 or £9 million?  This, under the Government pledged to expand social capital expenditure.  You remember the old warrior proclaiming that that was the test by which they would stand or fall.  Does the Minister for Defence remember that: &ldquo;We will reduce the numbers of the unemployed and arrest the national haemorrhage of emigration&rdquo;?  Social capital expenditure has declined in this particular sphere from £18.9 million to £8 million or £9 million and has been stabilised at that figure. That decrease has been due principally to the fall in capital expenditure on housing.  At the same time, you get a <Col N="54" /> typical figure.  The numbers of men employed have fallen to an even more dramatic degree.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Local Government is responsible for the Vote in this House associated with the crippling burdens of rates that help to make survival on the land of Ireland almost impossible for those who get their living there.  I think he is responsible for the Vote associated with the greatest instance of fraud that has ever been practised on the people of this country.  I think he is associated with the Vote under which measures are taken by the Government of which he is a member which are largely responsible for driving thousands and thousands of our people into the industrial slums of England who would not be given the chance of earning their living here.</P>
    <P>If that indictment is true, he ought to share with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is responsible for the cost of living which also has made its contribution to that tragic migration, the sleepless nights that any conscientious man should have if he felt that he had contributed to the picture I read to the House of what many of those emigrants have been brought to in the slums of London.</P>
    <P>I think we ought to refer this Vote back because we ought to try to bring home to these Ministers, before they get the five years' holiday which I hope they will get next September or October, a full sense of the realisation of the great crime they perpetrated against our people in seeking to solve the unemployment problem in Ireland by shovelling our people into the slums of Notting Hill, hoping that, having done so, that is the last we would ever hear of them and they can point to the statistics to prove that in any case they were no longer unemployed in Ireland. I wish to God that many of them were unemployed in Ireland rather than earning their living in the employment to which Deputy Blaney, Deputy Lynch and Deputy Lemass, the Taoiseach, have helped to send them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that housing is still the most important function of the local authorities, with the assistance, <Col N="55" /> especially the financial assistance, of the Minister for Local Government.  It is the most important work for which they have responsibility. One might say it is the most important work in the local service in which they can engage.  In 1948, this country was confronted with quite a formidable housing problem.  I think it is generally agreed that for some years after 1948 the local authority and the various Ministers for Local Government tackled this problem of providing houses with enthusiasm, zeal and one might say, courage but it seems to me that over recent years there is an assumption on the part of this Government and the Minister for Local Government that we are no longer confronted with a housing problem of any dimensions.</P>
      <P>It is very wrong indeed for the Government and the Minister for Local Government, in particular, to assume that.  The Government from 1954 to 1957 showed in a practical way that they were prepared to continue the housing drive of 1948 and 1951.  That housing drive had been slowed down from 1951 to 1954, but, when 1957 came, we saw a dramatic decrease in the house building industry in the country.  That decrease in house building was certainly evidenced in the years 1958 and 1959.</P>
      <P>We from this side of the House during the past three or four years have urged the Minister to give greater encouragement to the building of houses by local authorities.  The usual reply, of course, by the Minister was&mdash;he is probably right to some degree and in some circumstances&mdash; that the initiation of housing schemes rested with the local authorities.  There is much evidence&mdash;I want to say very tangible evidence&mdash;in any case, there is evidence to me, that, while the Minister over the past three or four years said that the initiation lay with the local authorities, many of the delays were occasioned by the deliberate policy of the Minister in withholding sanction and by asking futile and ridiculous questions in an effort to delay the progress of these housing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me from the Minister's <Col N="56" /> speech though that he has changed his tune to some extent.  It seems evident that for the present year, or at least for the year ending 31st March, 1961, there is a slight improvement in progress in the building of houses by local authorities compared with the previous year, but I say that there is still much more work to be done to provide houses for those who are usually catered for by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have an appreciation of this matter.  Has he got any evidence to show what number of houses are required now to be built by local authorities because it seems to me that the surveys carried on by the different housing authorities are haphazard surveys.  There do not seem to be any set rules or standards laid down by the local authorities to determine the persons and the number of families who need to be housed by the local authority.</P>
    <P>We had a conflict of evidence in that respect in at least one town with which I am very familiar and to which I directed the Minister's attention very many times in the past two or three years.  Let me give the example.  The Minister stated in this House on one occasion that Wexford town needed 35 houses.  After question and answer in this House over a period of months, we did discover that the real figure was something in the region of 240. There we had a situation where the Minister was prepared to allow the building needs of that town to appear as if only 35 houses were needed, whereas in actual fact something like 240 houses were needed.  If that is the sort of liaison we have between the Minister for Local Government and the local authorities with regard to building houses, it is no wonder that the house building industry so far as local authorities are concerned, finds itself in the very low state it is in at present.  I know the Minister has an absolute responsibility for it.  Deputy Dillon spoke about the number of building trade operatives, skilled and unskilled, we have lost in recent years. We have lost thousands of them.  The Minister must take his share of responsibility for the loss of those workers. Not alone have they been lost to the <Col N="57" /> building industry as far as the local authorities are concerned but they have been lost to the country by emigrating to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>There have been protracted delays in giving approval to the building of local authority housing schemes.  Futile sorts of questions asked by the Minister for Local Government of these local authorities are in my opinion designed merely to delay the commencement of schemes.  The Minister did not seem to appreciate that many workers depended upon obtaining employment in the building of these houses.  They could not afford to be idle for a week or two weeks, for a month or three months.  The Minister withheld sanction because the local authority did not give him some information and these workers emigrated. Thousands of them have been lost to the country due to the policy as far as local authority house building is concerned over the past three or four years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon gave figures of the number of workers employed from 1954 to 1957.  This was the period described as a bankrupt period by the people now in Government.  This was the period that was much criticised by Deputies Briscoe and N. Lemass as one of stagnation in local authority house building.  But, as it now turns out, it was a period which was three times better, as far as employment was concerned, than the period the workers have undergone since 1957.</P>
    <P>I read a statement recently from the Minister for Industry and Commerce in which he bewailed and bemoaned the absence of skilled workers in the country.  It showed a bit of a nerve, coming from a Minister of a Government who had by their handling of the house building industry, driven thousands of skilled workers out of the country.  At present there are, and there have been for a long time, generous grants given towards the building of new houses by private individuals and for the reconstruction of private dwelling houses but even that would be much more successful if an effort were made to retain skilled and unskilled building operatives in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> The grants, which are generous, cannot be availed of to the full.  Anybody who now contemplates building a house or who makes plans to reconstruct a house finds great difficulty in getting a contractor.  The contractor himself finds difficulty in many cases in getting a plasterer, a mason, a carpenter, a plumber and, in many cases, skilled builders' labourers.  For that situation, the Minister for Local Government must take an awful lot of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister should approach the question of the building of houses by local authorities, especially in the urban centres, in a much more enthusiastic way than has been the case up to the present.  There is some merit in his action last October when he gave more or less an overall permission to the local authorities to go ahead with their house building schemes.  If the Minister does not follow up that, if he does not confer with officials of the local authorities, they will not build the houses.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister's saying&mdash;I do not think he would:&mdash;&ldquo;The initiative rests with the local authority,&rdquo; the local authority in this case being the 15 members of the Urban Council or the 12 members of the Corporation.  They are public representatives. They take a general interest, as much as they can, in the place for which they have some responsibility as public representatives. They cannot look after the day-to-day administration of the local authority. The officials do that.  The officials are in close contact with the Minister's officials in the Department of Local Government.  I suggest they be required to do their job more expeditiously. All the power the Minister gives to the local authority will go for nil unless the Minister, who provides a good portion of the money, insists that the work be done.</P>
    <P>We have a perfect example of it in Wexford Town.  I think the Minister and his officials are aware that what was represented as an urgent scheme some nine months ago is now at practically the same stage as it was when the Minister gave his approval.  Members of the local authority can ask <Col N="59" /> questions at meeting after meeting on that particular matter.  They can pass resolutions, resolutions of which no notice will be taken unless the Minister, the man who provides the money, who approves of the plans, who sanctions every move for this building scheme takes action.  If he does not this place will still be without houses in another 18 months.  The danger is that many skilled and unskilled building workers who could have got employment there will be prepared to leave the town or probably the country.</P>
    <P>We arrived at a situation in many of these areas where everything was ready for the building to go ahead but the local authority could not get the masons, the carpenters, and so on.  If they do not show some continuity in their building programme, a building programme that means the building of about 200 houses, they cannot expect the builders' labourers and these skilled operatives to wait during the slack period for them.</P>
    <P>The problem, whilst not the same in the rural areas, is still a problem.  We have protracted delays.  One would imagine that between the officials of the local authority, the officials of the Department of Local Government and those in the legal profession who could be engaged in the transfer of sites, establishment of title, and so on, the system would have been perfected by now.  It seems to me that when a number of cottages in a rural area need to be built there are still long delays. There is still a period of 18 months before a brick is laid upon a brick after a decision has been taken by a local authority for the building of a house or houses for certain people. That sort of delay is very annoying not alone to the people waiting for the houses but to those who contract to build them.</P>
    <P>I support the proposal for the provision of houses for small farmers. Deputy Dillon is correct when he states there are small farmers in this country who have not the necessary cash to avail of the building grants and the loan facilities that are now available through the local authorities and through the Minister for Local <Col N="60" /> Government.  Between loan and grant from the local authority and the Department of Local Government they must be able to get within about £200 or £300 of the actual cost of the house but that £200 or £300 is a formidable ditch for them to cross.  The small farmers just do not find it possible, within their financial resources, to avail of the loan facilities and the grants from the Department of Local Governernment and the local authority.</P>
    <P>I shall not attempt to define what a &ldquo;small farmer&rdquo; is.  If one tries to define a small farmer in Wexford, Deputy Blowick suggests that, in the West, he would be considered a pretty well-off farmer indeed.  It varies from county to county.  The local authority knows what a small farmer is in their locality.  I shall confine myself to saying that I believe the local authorities could do much more to provide houses for small farmers. In my county I came across a man who was refused a house by the local authority.  He was a man with nine acres, which is a very small holding and which indeed would not keep a single man who is a hard worker.  I do not think he should be outside the scope of the Housing Acts.  If he is not, the Minister should urge local authorities, by way of circular, to give special consideration to the provision of houses for these small farmers who cannot avail of the loan or grant facilities that we have in operation.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to inquire into this aspect of local authority housing.  Governments over the past 20 or 30 years have given pretty reasonable assistance to local authorities to build houses.  I should like to ask the Minister is he concerned about the manner in which these local authority houses are being maintained? It is a scandal that houses on which so much money was spent by local authorities and Governments down through the years are being allowed to fall into a very bad state of disrepair.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that many of the local authorities are not prepared to accept their full responsibility in this matter.  There are local authorities who provide as little as £1 per annum for <Col N="61" /> the repair of each house.  The Minister must take some responsibility in this, because, as I say, he has provided a certain part of the money for the building of these houses.  To a large extent it may be a matter for the local authority itself, but the Minister has some responsibility and should be in a position to insist that the minimum amount of repairs be carried out to each local authority house.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also concern himself with the cottage purchase scheme.  It is a scheme that is regarded by some people as being pretty generous and one which seems to be regarded by most local officials as being very desirable.  I do not think it is absolutely desirable that all cottage tenants should own their houses in that, as soon as the cottages are vested, they are responsible for their repair. It would be a very bad thing if we were to arrive at the stage where we had so many rural slums.  The Minister should try to insist that local authorities in turn ensure that there will be proper maintenance by those in whom local authority cottages are vested in rural areas.  The cottage tenant whose cottage is vested in him should also be protected.  Under the Act, a cottage before being handed over is supposed to to be put into good repair by the local authority. Many local authorities get away with murder in that respect.  I know of cases where tenants unwittingly signed a form to have the cottage vested and the form included a statement to the effect that the cottage was in good repair.  I think we have been &ldquo;codded&rdquo; in many cases and there should be greater protection than there is at present for tenants who have cottages vested in them which are not handed over in proper condition.</P>
    <P>In some cases, the Minister may be an adjudicator but like many Ministers who deal with local authorities, he may take up the attitude that it is a matter for the local authority.  He has to be a strict umpire in this matter and lean over backwards to try to protect the individual tenant against the local authority which tries to insist that the cottage has been handed over in good repair, when it is obvious that it has not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> I should like the Minister to comment on what concerns many Deputies in regard to private building and reconstruction and the grants given by his Department for both building and reconstruction.  I do not know whether this is peculiar to one county, or to one part of the country, but it seems to me there are very long delays between the time a man makes an application and the time he gets approval to go ahead. I can quote instances and give the names and addresses of applicants who had to wait seven months before their applications were approved by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties which inspectors have.  I appreciate that at the drop of a hat, or at the request of any person, they cannot just drop down to Carlow, say.  They cannot be in Enniscorthy or Wexford at the same time.  They may have two or three counties to cover but I suggest that a period of seven months is too long. Three months is too long.  Might I suggest that a period of one month is too long?  I do not think the Minister could tell me that there have not been such delays.  He may ask the officials concerned with these applications about the position and be told that in a particular case, the inspector, Mr. So-and-So, called to such a house and no one was there.  That is an infantile excuse.  I do not suggest that the man is lying.  It could be a good excuse. He could say he called three times, but in a town like Ballina or Gorey or Wexford, would it be worth the man's while to go back to Dublin or to Carlow without making some inquiries as to where &ldquo;Mr. Murphy&rdquo; was?  I am sure in many of these small towns it would not take half an hour to locate anybody, in a town with a population of, say, 10,000.  It would be better still if the inspector or the Department's officials notified the applicant for a grant that the inspector would be there on 22nd, 23rd or 24th of July. That would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>I have known men to take time off from their work and to inconvenience themselves to a very great extent in anticipation of the inspector calling, because they heard he was in the locality.  I know where inspectors have called to different parts of the county <Col N="63" /> and have visited two or three applicants but have missed out another applicant.  That involved expense to the State as well as inconvenience to the applicant.  I know the difficulty there is in recruitment and I know the difficulties there are in the areas these inspectors have to cover, but I do suggest that since these applications have reached an all-time high, some effort should be made to convenience the applicants, so that, particularly at this time, they may get approval and go ahead with their work in the fine weather.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk recently about the provision of regional water supplies throughout the country.  I wish to commend to the Dáil and to the country the general attitude of the Minister in relation to those who criticise the implementation of such schemes.  There have been criticisms from various quarters.  There have been cries that only those who benefit should pay, that the consumers of these newly established water supplies should pay the cost of the entire scheme.  Those criticisms come from people who for years have been getting substantial grants and bounties in respect of everything for which they could apply.  I do not think it is good enough for those people now, who probably got grants to install water themselves, to say that the consumers in a particular area should pay for the entire scheme.  That is not the way we behave in regard to roads or in regard to services administered by the local authority.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a regional scheme to provide water for many people in half of my county, I say the entire community should bear the cost.  Possibly the cost has frightened a great many people but it should be remembered that those who will benefit contribute generously by way of either direct or indirect taxation.  There are people who have been helped to improve their hotels, to drain their land. There are people who have had grants for building piggeries, haysheds and cattle byres.  When it is a question of establishing a benefit to provide water for ordinary individuals, there is criticism and the cry that those who <Col N="64" /> consume the water should pay for the schemes.  The attitude of the Minister in respect of that criticism, as expressed in his speech here to day, is to be applauded.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Dillon in his tacit criticism of the road programme. I think the improvement of the roads and the manner in which the improvements have been carried out&mdash;the elimination of dangerous corners and the cutting through of hills&mdash;has had very desirable results.  I do not think it is good enough to say that the car population of this country does not warrant our having nothing but autobahns. These newly-constructed roads &mdash;some hundred yards long, in cases&mdash; would take no more than three cars.  I do not think they could legitimately be described as autobahns.  In any case I do not think any of us would like in 20 years' time to hear queries as to why we did not make the roads to fit six motor cars rather than three and so relieve congestion 20 years hence.</P>
    <P>The evidence is that the car population is increasing every year.  We do not need figures to convince us that that is so.  The only criticism I have to offer is that road work does not provide maximum employment any longer.  Since Fianna Fáil came into office, there has been a rapid decrease in employment under local authorities. I do not hold them entirely responsible in the matter of housing and I suppose we all share to some extent responsibility for the decrease in employment on the roads.  Enormous and formidable machines now operate in road improvement works and those machines have disemployed thousands of Irishmen. I think we should be ashamed of ourselves for having allowed such a rapid introduction of these machines.</P>
    <P>I know we cannot do these improvement works with a pick and shovel but I suggest that much of the work that is being done, and that was done over the past seven or eight years, could have been done by Irishmen from the rural areas instead of with machines.  We import machines manufactured in Germany, in Britain and in America.  The manufacture of the machines gives good and remunerative employment to Germans, Americans <Col N="65" /> and British.  We import in here machines made by foreign workers to displace Irish workers.  All of us know that the number of road workers has declined by hundreds in every county and the majority of those who were disemployed have gone across to Great Britain to seek a livelihood.  It is scandalous that we should have allowed that.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Minister concerned at all about the Wexford-Gorey road. In his speech, he talks about special assistance being made available to the Road Fund under the terms of the Road Fund (Grants and Advances) (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1959.  He says that these special moneys are utilised to deal with urgent problems created by railway closing and the improvement of access to major industrial undertakings.  I know that everybody in Wexford does not talk Irish.  I know that Kilkenny and Connemara and Donegal are regarded as much more attractive than County Wexford, but, even though all of us do not talk Irish and even though we are not regarded as a tourist county, I think there is a case under this particular Act, at least, for some assistance to improve the road from Wexford to Gorey.  That whole area has been opened up by the building of the bridge over the Slaney, just outside Wexford town.  According to what the Minister says, it qualifies.  I do not think anyone will deny that we have reasonably large industrial undertakings in Wexford.  Before the bridge was built, the lorries from the foundries, from the various factories and from the merchants went through Ferrycarrig, Oylegate, Enniscorthy and Gorey and then continued on the Dublin road from Gorey.  Now buses and lorries are crossing Wexford Bridge and travelling to Dublin on what is known as the coast road.  Naturally, this traffic is doing some damage.  The road is very narrow and twisty.  It slows up traffic to some extent and that constitutes a danger to traffic plying along it.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to consider seriously an application&mdash;I think there were two from the county council recently&mdash;for some assistance to do that stretch of road of approximately 26 miles.  I believe that <Col N="66" /> such moneys should be available, according to the Minister's own statement.</P>
    <P>One of the best things ever done in the cause of road safety was the painting of the white line down the centre of the road.  That has been a tremendous help to motorists.  I am sure nearly every Deputy drives a car and I think they will all agree that that white line is one of the simplest, one of the best and one of the cheapest ways of preventing road accidents.  I should like to know whether or not the money expended on this sort of business is provided by the local authority alone. Many local authorities have engaged in the practice of splitting the road with a white line in the cause of traffic.  I would suggest that the Minister should try to make the practice universal and, if possible, within the limits of the Road Fund resources, should apply some moneys to that work because I can say honestly and sincerely that it is a tremendous help to drivers.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by a brief reference to the cost of local government. It is difficult to talk about the cost of local Government unless one believes in certain things, in which case one can be pretty direct.  I suppose in every year since local government was established, there has been a cry about an increase in rates.  If the rates increase because there is waste or because money is misspent or because a local authority engages in foolish schemes then criticism is valid.  One can meet criticism which is to the effect that a local authority has too many officials. Criticism to the effect that officials are overpaid, is fairly direct criticism. It is very difficult to understand criticism about an increase in rates from persons who at the same time advocate improvement in services, which seems to be the pattern in respect of many local authorities.  There is the famous example where a great number of people in one district protest to a county council that the rates should not go up by a shilling, in the month of March or February and then, in the following April, May or June, the same group of people appear before the county manager and local authority demanding that certain improvements <Col N="67" /> be carried out to the roads in the area.</P>
    <P>The problem of local government should be faced in an honest way. Valid criticism in respect of the matters I have mentioned should be met and combated.  Local Government is designed to provide services for the people.  If houses are needed, and if we believe in the principle that the local authority should contribute to building local authority houses, we must also accept the principle that money must be provided for that purpose. It seems to me that the most criticism in respect of increasing rates, outside the city of Dublin, comes from those who are also concerned about roads.  I mentioned the example of people who criticise rate increases and then demand, after the striking of the rate, that the roads in their area be brought to a certain standard.  They are not concerned about the money then.  They assume it is got from some source other than the rates or that the Minister for Local Government will provide it.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is criticism in respect of the provision of water supplies, to which I have referred.  If a local authority believe it is their duty and responsibility to provide water for the community, they must face up to the problem of raising the money and the most equitable way of doing that is by the present system, through the rates.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism in recent times about the health services and a demand from a great many people for improved health services.  I agree that money could be saved in health services by a change of administration and methods and by cutting down unnecessary expenses but an improvement of the health services generally means the provision of more money, which is the responsibility of local representatives and the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Of course, the biggest scandal of all is the manner in which local authorities treat the poor people.  We all know the usual pattern of local <Col N="68" /> authority meetings when it comes to the adoption of the manager's estimates. Say that in the previous year the rates were 38/- in the £, the manager puts in his estimates and the local representatives are told that they would mean an increase of 5/- in the £, making the rates 43/-.  Immediately the 21, 22 or 25 members go to work on the manager's estimates.  The first thing they operate on is public assistance, home assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am talking about the raising of money by rates and the responsibility of local representatives for it.  However, if that is your decision, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as usual I bow to it.  Of course, every local authority in Ireland talks in the same strain as the Minister about the provision of swimming pools.  I suppose every Mayor and every chairman of an urban authority elected in the last year has said that one of his first objects was to have a swimming pool provided.  The Minister indicated in a practical way how he proposed to assist in the establishment of swimming pools.  Frankly, I do not think it overgenerous.  In any case, money is to be provided, small though it may be, for the establishment of swimming pools but the local authorities will adopt the usual attitude, when it comes to the practical proposition of making schemes and plans, that the matter will have to be deferred because they are not prepared to raise the money.  Therefore, in regard to swimming pools, the Minister, this time next year, will find that the amount provided for in the Estimate last March will be unexpended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> The price of money to the local authority represents the heaviest burden.  I do not know what the Minister for Local Government can do about that but it does seem to me that the indebtedness of local authorities is very heavy indeed and constitutes a very big proportion of the money they have to raise from year to year.  Until this problem is tackled, local administration and the provision of local amenities will be a very serious problem.  The price of money is much too high.  It has increased rapidly over the last five or six years and falls very heavily on local authorities. Unless local authorities can get money cheaply, the cost of money will still represent a very big item in their yearly administration of local affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important Estimates that come before the House in the whole range of Government expenditure.  One of the first things I want to deal with is the question of housing and the way the present Minister has helped to keep down the number of new houses being built throughout the country.  I want to make a definite and positive complaint that, under the present Minister's direction, it seems the inspectors of his Department have been instructed to use every shallow trick in the bag, if not to get the grant which has been sanctioned for a person building a new house or improving or reconstructing an existing one cut out altogether, to get it reduced or delayed.  I have known instances of concrete footpaths around houses having to be torn up, or at least the contractor who put them down having to take them up and lower them by half an inch.  All the trifling details are, in my opinion, purely matters for the person getting the house built.  It is not the Minister or the Departmental inspector who will have to live in the house but the person who is getting the house built. If he is content to allow things to be done in a slipshod fashion, then it is his look-out.  He will not get another grant for 15 years and the Department is not the loser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> It is only recently that these tricks have been developed and thought out. I charge the Minister with plotting them himself because they did not occur under any previous Minister, either of a Fianna Fáil Government or inter-Party Government, so far as I know.  The Government were not too keen on developing housing.  Since they came into office, the number of houses being built has dropped not considerably but alarmingly.  Anyone who goes through the country must admit that a huge number of houses are required and a very large number need to be reconstructed.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to quote the figures given to the House in reply to a question on housing put down by Deputy O'Donnell, the previous Minister for Local Government.  In 1954, the first year in which the Government were in power for their second period, the number of houses built by local authorities and privately was 10,750; in 1955, it was practically the same number, 10,125; in 1956 it was almost 10,000; and in 1957, it was 10,000 again.  I suppose Fianna Fáil had to pay the grants sanctioned by the inter-Party Government and follow up our programme until they could give it a slow death, but, in 1958, the number had dropped from 10,345 in the first year in which they were responsible, to half that figure.  In 1959, the total number was 4,438; in 1960, there was a slight improvement to 5,600; and in 1961, it was down again to 5,300.</P>
    <P>I wonder what explanation the Minister will give for that drop.  I wonder what explanation he will give for the purely false campaign that was carried on that people who built houses during the inter-Party Government régime would not get and did not get the grants.  I should like the Minister to give one instance of one person in the whole 26 Counties whose grant was denied or delayed during the régime of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister has great talk now about encouraging the local authorities to start building.  It seems that the Fianna Fáil method is to get into power and for their first four years in power to squeeze and crush the people as much as possible and gather a little <Col N="71" /> nest-egg that can be used with a flourish during the election campaign that must come at the end of a five year period.  That has always been the Fianna Fáil pattern with regard to the food subsidies, the cost of living, the restoration of grants and so on.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister what he proposes to do, as Minister, with regard to the countless numbers all over the country who are living in houses not fit for human habitation who have not the necessary money to bridge the gap between the grant they get from the Department and from the local authority and the total cost of building a house.  He said something in his opening speech about a survey being carried out by the local authorities to find out how many persons are living in houses unfit for human habitation.  He referred to them as slums but they cannot be described as slums.  I understand the word &ldquo;slum&rdquo; to mean a collection of dwellings unfit for human habitation.</P>
    <P>I am speaking principally of loan houses scattered on small holdings throughout the country.  There are also people in towns living in houses unfit for human habitation.  Some of those people might own their house and the local authority might not be in a position to take any action or to interfere because of the fact that they own their house.  Nevertheless, they are people who cannot help themselves and it is high time the State came to their rescue and did something for them.  I know several in my own constituency who are in a pretty bad plight with regard to housing.  Some of the houses are dangerous and they do not know when a squall of wind or a gale may blow the house down on top of them.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of housing, can the Minister tell us if any steps are being taken to try to bring back the vast army of skilled artisans that flew from the country in 1957 and 1958 when the housing programme collapsed under the Minister?  It is all very fine to talk about and make political capital out of the fact that they are gone, but the time has come to offer some inducement to them to come back.  I know several builders who <Col N="72" /> were anxious to go ahead with certain building projects but who found difficulty in getting skilled men to work for them, for the simple reason that they are not in the country because they were banished.  I suggest the Minister should do something about bringing them back.</P>
    <P>I come now to the regional water supply scheme about which the Minister boasts.  In his opening speech, he referred to South Tipperary and to the average increase per £1 on the rates.  He said:</P>
    <P>For example, in the case of South Tipperary, where an almost complete regional coverage is anticipated, the programme is expected to represent a gross cost of 5/- in the £ on the rates.  In the North Cork area, the £2.06 million programme to which I have referred is expected to entail a gross expenditure of about 3/- in the £.  In Donegal, it is estimated that a gross rate of 1/5d. in the £ will result from the adoption of the first three-year programme.</P>
    <P>To my mind, that smells very strongly. I remember the jeering attitude of Deputy Dr. Ryan, then Minister for Local Government and Public Health when he introduced the Health Bill in 1947.  He told us the cost would not under any consideration exceed 2/6 in the £.  We all know what it is today. In my county, it is 19/10½d.  &mdash;three halfpence less than a £1 in the £.  When the Bill was passing in 1947, the Minister told us it would not exceed 2/6 in the £ and the Minister for Local Government must now have his head in the clouds if he thinks a regional water supply can be procured for a county, or portion of a county, for 5/- in the £, even with liberal Government help.</P>
    <P>Recently Sligo County Council adopted a regional water supply scheme for a certain small portion of the county and their experts told them it would cost 6/1 in the £ for a start, taking the present cost of materials, rates, wages, compensation for land acquired, way-leaves and so on into consideration.  If the Minister thinks he can fool me a second time as did <Col N="73" /> his colleague in 1947, he is a long way out.</P>
    <P>First and foremost, a regional water supply scheme is very necessary in certain areas.  One of the areas mentioned in his opening speech by the Minister was South Tipperary. That recalls to my mind a Deputy of our Party, the late Deputy O'Donnell, God rest his soul, who was always pressing for a regional water supply scheme.  In Mayo also, some kind of water supply scheme is absolutely necessary.  I know of areas where scores and scores of farmers have to drive two or three miles for water for their stock.  Those are small areas but in other areas in Mayo and Galway the problem is not to bring water but to take away water that is water-logging the land and leaving land wet that could be fertile and productive. My advice to the Minister is that a rough survey should be taken of the counties and in those portions of the counties where the nature of the sub-soil precludes the possibility of finding an adequate supply of spring water, by all means build group schemes.</P>
    <P>I know of one case where there are five houses comparatively near a well. A regional supply scheme will never come to these people.  I would say that for less than £100 per house they could be provided with an never-failing supply of water for both house and land.  The Minister is going off on a complete wild goose chase when he proposes to put water mains along every public road.  Deputy Dillon asked how many of our people live on public roads.  I would say about two out of five, and that would be a high average.  I am thinking not of areas along main roads, but the areas which badly need regional water supply schemes.  But, as the E.S.B. refuse to install electricity in certain areas because it is not economical, I know those areas will not get water.  Everyone knows the areas which want water and those which do not.  I know that the farmers around Kilmaine and New Abbey in my constituency are scourged for the want of some kind of a water supply.  I know in County Galway there is a huge sheep area <Col N="74" /> around the town of Athenry, and that some kind of a water supply scheme is a pressing need for those people.</P>
    <P>This rule of thumb method of bringing water along the main roads to supply a few fortunate houses, if they wish to take it, is a foolish scheme and should not be pursued.  It is going to be very costly.  With the exception of the labour employed to dig the portion of the trenches not dug by foreign machines, the pipes, the pumps and everything else will have to be imported. The bulk of the cost of such schemes will go to foreign manufacturers and will be of no use to our industrialists at home.  With the exception of the payment of the men who dig portion of the trenches, as I say, and the expenditure on whatever bit of concrete is used, the rest will go to help foreign industrialists.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to two interrelated questions.  One is rates and their effect of driving the small farmers off the land in increasing numbers. That is just one more burden on their backs.  The removal of the food subsidies drove up the cost of rates, particularly by increasing food costs in institutions and by the increase in salaries which officials and servants had to get to offset the rise in the cost of living caused by the present Government.</P>
    <P>I want to dwell on another subject&mdash; the injustice of the method by which the agricultural grant is paid at present. The Minister will tell me that three-fifths, or almost three-fifths, of the rates on agricultural land are defrayed by the grant.  The grant is divided into two portions, one to relieve the rates under £20 valuation and another which goes to pay the £17 employment rebate for those over £20 valuation.  The Minister will tell me that is an even way of working it out.  It would be if the rates were even all over the country, if they were the same on the eastern sea-board as they are on the western, but that is not the case.  Take Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Clare and Donegal, the principal counties along the western seaboard, and not forgetting Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon.  We must take into account that in practically all these counties we have an immense mileage of road to maintain, much <Col N="75" /> more so in proportion than the eastern counties.  The second thing is that we have to meet health charges which counties near the city of Dublin have not to meet.  I think health charges in County Dublin itself and in Counties Meath and Kildare are practically negligible because of their proximity to the Dublin hospitals.</P>
    <P>I made a rough and ready calculation of the rates paid by two similar farmers, one living along the western seaboard, in Mayo or Galway, and the other living in County Dublin.  The rate in the £ this year in Mayo is 50/-. The rate in County Dublin is 33/-. Take the case of two farmers, one in County Mayo and the other in County Dublin, with the same valuations on lands and buildings.  Say the farmer in Mayo is John Murphy and he has a valuation of £10 on lands and £6 on buildings.  Say the farmer in Dublin is John Walsh and he has the same valuation.  By and large, valuation is a fair measure and indication of the productive capacity of land, no matter where it is.</P>
    <P>On lands, the farmer in Mayo is paying a total of £25 rates.  The farmer in Dublin on lands is paying £16 10s.  The Mayo farmer gets a rebate of three-fifths on that&mdash;we will call it three-fifths, though it is not quite that.  That means that the Mayo farmer has to pay £10 to the county council.  The Dublin farmer is relieved to the extent of £9 8s.  Therefore, whereas the Mayo farmer has to pay £10, the Dublin farmer has to pay £7 2s.</P>
    <P>We now come to the £6 valuation on buildings, £4 10s.  on the dwelling-house and 30/- on the out buildings. The Mayo farmer has to pay £15 and the Dublin farmer, £9 8s. 8d.  Therefore, as between these two farmers with exactly the same valuation on lands and buildings, the man in Mayo has to pay a total of £25, while the farmer in Dublin has to pay only £17.  If we take the man with £20 valuation, we find the Mayo farmer with £6 valuation on buildings has to pay £35 while the farmer in County Dublin has to pay only £23 2s.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> Let me say at once, without beating around the bush, that the time has come, unless we are to banish the small farmer altogether, when the agricultural grant paid by the Government should relieve all the rates on all holdings up to £20 valuation.  I am saying that because I believe it.  While that would be some help, much more than that is needed to be done by the Government if we are not to banish the small farmer from the land.  Down in my part of the country house after house has been closed, houses that have been built by Government or county council grants within the past 20 years.  The people are leaving and the land is going derelict for the simple reason that the small farmers are being taxed out of existence and, on the other hand, the price of their produce is allowed to go anyway it likes.  If they are to be saved we must give them an inducement such as increasing the agricultural grant at least up to the rate of £20 valuation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the valuation of farm buildings which comes under the Minister's control, will anybody explain to me why a farmer has to pay rates on farm buildings?  Let us take two farmers living side by side. One farmer is up and doing, his holding is neat and tidy and fully stocked and he is doing his best to make a living on it.  Right outside the wall is a man who sleeps until 2 o'clock in the day, lets all his buildings fall in until finally there is only one room in the house in which it is safe for him to sleep.  For every room that falls in on the lazy fellow he can get rates struck off it.  On the other hand, if the industrious neighbour makes any improvements, for instance, erects new out-offices, it is not half finished before a reviser is on his doorstep to increase his valuation and tax him for his industry.  If anyone can give me an explanation of the sense of that I will be glad to hear it.  Farm buildings are just as necessary to a farmer as the land.  His crops must be housed; his livestock and farm machinery must be housed.  All these things are part of his living.  He cannot get on without them unless he becomes a grazier. The Minister should look into that <Col N="77" /> whole question of penal taxation, because there is no other name for it.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us exactly what is happening about grants in respect of derelict sites, that is, in the case of private individuals.  Many people, including some of the officials, do not seem to know what the Minister has in his mind about that.  Have regulations been laid down or proper instructions been issued to the officials so that they can tell the interested public how the scheme works?  I, for one, do not know how it works and I know of people who made application for it and the local authority officials did not seem to understand fully what the Minister's intention was. The Derelict Sites Act was passed some time this year or late last year but that merely gives the Minister power to pay grants.  I should like to know what are the regulations the Minister has made under the Act.</P>
    <P>In regard to roads, all over the country the Department of Local Government was giving grants to county councils for making, as Deputy Dillon described them, autobahns, that is, wide roads such as they have on the Continent of Europe.  Perhaps they are necessary there.  I like to see a good road but, as I said, three out of every five of our people living in the country are not living along a good road.  I would go so far as to say that three out of five of our people in wet weather have to plunge through dirt and water to get to the main road to go to Mass or to business or, in the case of children, to go to school.  We have these huge main roads, 20 or 30 feet wide, taking three or four lanes of traffic, being constructed, whereas people along some of our roads, to go to Mass on Sunday, have to wear Wellingtons to get to the main road, bring their Sunday boots, as they call them, under their arm, sit down by the roadside and change into their boots and then when they come back from Mass change back into the Wellingtons.  We are attacking this problem in the wrong way.  While we want tourist roads to induce tourists to come to this country, our own people should have first claim on our services because we are taxing them to run the country.  If the Minister <Col N="78" /> dealt with this problem, he would be taking away one of the causes of discontent among country people.  The youngsters nowadays will not stay in the old parent holding where family after family was reared in the past, because they are not satisfied to travel a quarter of a mile or a mile of a dirty boreen with no hope of ever having it improved.  They say: &ldquo;I am not going to live here.&rdquo;  That is one of the matters which has contributed to people having a disgust for life on the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the fifth Estimate for Local Government introduced by this Fianna Fáil Government and it would be no harm if we had a brief review of the activities of the Department since the change of Government. I remember some six years ago when I had the privilege of introducing the Estimate here I was badgered from all sides of the House by the then Opposition, Fianna Fáil, and was told I had ruined the building industry, that there was no employment on the roads and that things in Local Government were stagnant.  I remember when the Minister's predecessor, the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, became Minister, several Fianna Fáil Deputies told us that the first thing he did was to release at least £1,500,000 of tenders which had back-logged in the Custom House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take that at its face value and see what is the position in relation to the building industry.  In reply to a question put by me to the Taoiseach on the 24th May last I received certain figures which I propose to quote.  In the year 1954 we had 33,887 people employed in the building industry.  In 1955, there were 32,938; in 1956, 33,856; in 1957, 32,224.  That was the last year of the inter-Party Government.  In the first year of Fianna Fáil, 1958, the figure fell from 33,000 to 25,391; in 1959, we had 25,137; in 1960, 25,629; and in 1961, 26,833.  There was an average of over 32,000 employed in the building industry during the years of the inter-Party Government.  Taking the average of the years since Fianna Fáil returned to office we find the average is somewhere <Col N="79" /> in the neighbourhood of 25,500; in other words, there has been a fall of over 7,000 per annum in the number employed in the building industry. That does not look as if there was any great revival in the building industry. It may be that some mechanical means have been procured in the erection of houses and that manual labour is no longer as necessary, so let us look at the number of houses which have been built, first of all, in the days of the inter-Party Government and, secondly, during the term of office of this Government.</P>
    <P>In 1954 the local authorities erected 5,643 houses.  In 1955 they erected 5,267 houses.  In 1956 they erected 4,011 houses.  In 1957 they erected 4,784 houses.  These were houses completed at the end of the financial year. Then we come to Fianna Fáil.  In their first year, which was 1958, the number of houses fell to 3,467 houses, 1,300 houses fewer.  In 1959 it fell to 1,812 houses.  In 1960 it was 2,414 houses and in 1961 it was 1,463 houses. In other words, the average number of houses erected by local authorities since Fianna Fáil took office is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2,000 per year, whereas in the days of the inter-Party Government the average number of local authority houses erected was over 4,000.</P>
    <P>Let us take private dwellings.  The number of houses erected by private persons in the year 1954 was 5,107. In 1955 it was 4,858.  In 1956 it was 5,368 and in 1957 it was 5,561.  Then we had the full blast of Fianna Fáil in 1958 when the figure fell to 3,559. In 1959 it was 2,626.  In 1960 it was 3,190 and in 1961 it was 3,895.  In other words, in each year of the inter-Party Government there were over 5,000 houses erected by private individuals but since Fianna Fáil came into office there has been an average of somewhere in the neighbourhood of 3,500 houses, so that we cannot find any great activity in so far as the building of houses and the employment of individuals in the building industry are concerned.  We have not tapped this flow of money for employment which we heard so much about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> Let us take the capital expenditure on sanitary service works.  In the year 1954, the days of the inter-Party Government, the sum expended on sanitary service works was £1,473,000 odd. In 1955 it was £1,535,000.  In 1956 it was £1,847,000 and in 1957 it was £1,995,000.  Those are the years of the inter-Party Government.  Immediately Fianna Fáil came into office in 1958, the amount spent was £1,553,000. In 1959 it was £1,622,000 and in 1960 it fell to £1,281,000, the lowest in the past ten years.  We cannot say that there is any great activity in regard to capital expenditure on sanitary service works.</P>
    <P>We know that the Department of Local Government administered funds under the Local Authority (Works) Act.  In 1954 the sum of £414,000 was made available.  In 1955, £509,000 was made available.  In 1956, £749,000 was made available.  In 1957, £602,000 was made available and in 1958 it fell to £83,000.  In 1959, it fell to £4,000 and in 1960 it was £4,914. I do not see anything to rejoice about in the expenditure under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>It was admitted&mdash;and we all agree&mdash; that the Road Fund is increasing.  The Minister told us today in his opening statement that it has gone up by some £2,000,000.  Let us look at the employment given by local authorities on roads.  On the 24th May last, I asked the Minister for Local Government if he would state the total number employed by local authorities on road works during each of the years ending 31st March, 1954 to 1961 inclusive.  He gave a list by months.  Instead of going through the table, let us pick out the month of March which is a typical month for road expenditure.  We find that in the year 1954 during the month of March there were 21,201 people employed on the roads.  In 1955 there were 16,000.  In 1956 there were 14,992.  In 1957 there were 13,501.  In 1958 there were 12,616.  In 1959 there were 11,997 and in 1960 there were 13,373.  In other words, there were fewer men employed during those years than in any one of the years in which the inter-Party Government were in power, in spite of the fact that <Col N="81" /> £2,000,000 additional is available for expenditure out of the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>Actually, the Road Fund in the year 1954 amounted to £4,409,000.  This year, 1961, it was £6,703,000.  There was an increase of over £2,070,000. Despite that, we can find no activity whereby employment is given.  Let us deal with roads.  The Minister in my opinion has fallen into the same policy as his predecessor in Fianna Fáil, building what I once described as autobahns for plutocrats.  It is quite evident that he proposes to continue that policy. The county roads are going to remain in the condition in which they are while all this additional money out of the Road Fund is to be expended on these main artery roads.</P>
    <P>Not only are we going to spend money on them, building three and four lane roads, but we propose to go further.  According to a circular issued by the Minister on the 3rd May last, the following guiding standards should be laid down:</P>
    <P>(a)  Lay-bys should be provided only on straight sections of the road.</P>
    <P>(b)  They should be clearly distinguishable from the roadway.</P>
    <P>(c)  They should provide parking space for at least five cars unless intended only as passing places.</P>
    <P>(d)  The existence of a lay-by should be clearly indicated by advance sign.  The question of the type of sign to use and its siting has been dealt with in a separate letter.</P>
    <P>(e)  The interval between lay-bys should normally be not less than 10 miles.</P>
    <P>(f)  Lay-bys are not required on roads with hard verges of adequate width, except possibly at places of scenic interest.</P>
    <P>I agree that lay-bys in regard to places of scenic interest would be most useful.  One can imagine the cost of setting up a lay-by on the road from Dublin to Cork, one every ten miles where five vehicles may be parked.  Is this how our money is to be spent?  At every ten miles on our main roads there is a village or small town and the side streets and even main streets <Col N="82" /> of these small towns should become lay-bys.  Then the tourist, or any motorist who wished to stop there, could spend his money in these villages and towns and will not shoot through them as they will do when we have these boulevards which are erected all over the Six Counties and in Britain.</P>
    <P>I would have no objection to considerable expenditure on our main roads, provided our county roads are brought up to standard.  There are certain counties, particularly County Clare, which still have miles and miles of dust-covered main roads, roads which could, in the ordinary course, have been tarred and rolled.  Unfortunately the money which was or which should have been allocated for them is being spent on cutting corners and making boulevards and, if the Minister gets his way, on erecting lay-bys and the provision of all these signs and standards he has set out.  I think that is a waste of public money.</P>
    <P>The Road Fund was not established to create lay-bys such as these.  It was established to give us good serviceable roads, free from dust and tarred.  I am very glad indeed to see that it is now suggested under the Civil Liabilities Bill that local authorities will become responsible for non-feasance. If they do, I can assure this House that much more attention will be given by the Department of Local Government to putting our country roads into shape than in making these boulevards or autobahns to which we have already referred.</P>
    <P>Is there any possibility whatsoever of the Minister's reconsidering the position which throws an onus on local authorities to provide 60 per cent. of the fund for the improvements of our county roads?  There is a grant of 40 per cent. from the Road Fund for the improvement of county roads but each local authority endeavours to get as much as possible out of that grant and, in so doing, they have to put up 60 per cent. themselves from the rates.  We are aware that the Minister's Department does give a 100 per cent. grant for the improvement of main roads.  That is wrong.  I think it should be left to the discretion of the local authority as to whether they themselves should spend the <Col N="83" /> money on main road improvement or county road improvement.</P>
    <P>If the bulk sum were given to the local authority and the local authority were given discretion as to the amount they themselves would subscribe for the improvement of county and main roads it would be a much better system than the system which is now being operated.  In that way, local authorities would spend some of this 100 per cent. grant which they are getting at the moment for the main roads on their county roads.  It is the agreed policy of all political Parties that agriculture is our main industry. Unless we give the farmer and the agricultural worker a decent road on which he may use some of the amenities of present day life, such as a motor car, we shall not get him to stay there. He is the main contributor of the poor rates which are collected throughout the country.  He should at least have decent roads in the farming area in which he resides.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about a private piped water supply to every farmer and farm labourer in Ireland.  I can assure him that they are more anxious to see proper roads throughout rural Ireland than to have this additional burden put upon them by way of water rate if the scheme proceeds. However, I shall deal with that later.</P>
    <P>The Minister now suggests we should do something about cleaning up the beaches on the coasts of Ireland.  I am in full agreement with him but the first thing we have to do is to provide roadways into our beaches.  Some of the finest scenic beaches in this country are absolutely inaccessible to present-day traffic.  In County Donegal and in my own parish there are a number of beaches with a tourist potential which are absolutely untapped for want of a road.  If some grants could be made available to provide proper roads into beaches and proper egress from them, not only one but several, we would not have the congestion at beaches to which the Minister has already referred and we would make more beaches available to the people. People with transport would have an opportunity of moving further out to <Col N="84" /> beaches other than those in close proximity to the town or city in which they reside.</P>
    <P>I know that several applications have been made for tourist grants for the making of roadways into beaches. It would be a very good thing if the Minister could see his way to make available some additional money from the Road Fund for this specific purpose.  Even <i>ad hoc</i> grants would be welcome and leave the maintenance to the local authority afterwards.  I think money spent in that way would be much better spent than on building arterial roads which by-pass our beaches and give our tourists no opportunity of seeing them.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has now decided to make grants available for the erection of swimming pools which in my view are an absolute essential. When I was Minister I endeavoured to make some provision under the Local Authority Act, 1955.  I gave power to local authorities to make grants to voluntary bodies who wished to erect swimming pools.  Unfortunately, very few local authorities adopted that section and made those grants available. Section 55 of the Local Government Act, 1955, gave sanitary authorities, with the consent of the Minister, power to make capital contributions to various societies.  The Minister proposes to make available 50 per cent. of the loan charges.  That is wrong.  It starts the old rut of borrowing by the local authority and the Department paying 50 per cent. of the loan charges.</P>
    <P>It would be much better if the Minister could see his way to make an annual capital grant to private societies for the erection of swimming pools.  I am satisfied there a number of societies in this country who could and would borrow the money themselves for the erection of swimming pools if they were assured of a capital sum being paid to them each year over a period of 30 years by the Department of Local Government.  That would save local authorities from borrowing further moneys and again incurring further debt which would eventually require to be paid off.</P>
    <P>It would be a very good thing if, <Col N="85" /> instead of giving a loan of 50 per cent., the Minister could see his way to making these capital grants.  It would be of considerable advantage and might possibly encourage private societies who had incurred debt in the erection of swimming pools to keep up their efforts to liquidate the debt, knowing that an annual sum was being paid to them through the Department for the purpose of that liquidation. It might encourage them to raise local subscriptions and clear off this debt much sooner than they would in the ordinary course.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us that there will be an additional £15,000 this year, over the amount provided last year, for the improvement of derelict sites. Deputy Blowick asked the Minister how was this fund administered.  As far as I am aware, several applications for information have been made to the local authorities on this matter but no information appears to be available. Perhaps when he is replying the Minister would tell us if the moneys allocated last year for derelict sites have been used at all and if not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They were practically all paid out before the end of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear it, but it would be desirable if further information could be made available to the owners of these derelict sites as to how they could and should apply for the grants.  Some simplified method will have to be devised to estimate the cost of demolishing these sites.  Speaking from recollection, I think that unless the demolition costs £100, or is it £30&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>£30 is the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>If it costs £30, then a grant is payable.  We all know that the owner of a derelict site generally does the demolition himself.  There will be disputes, and there have been disputes, as to the actual cost of demolition and whether the owner's time, in lieu of wages, should be taken into account.  If some simple method could be devised, whereby the cost of the demolition could be assessed and the amount of grant determined, it would <Col N="86" /> be better and it might encourage more people to pull down these unsightly ruins, and at the same time take advantage of the grants made available. The grants are made available, the Minister said today, on the basis of 50 per cent. of the cost of any work which exceeds £30, subject to a maximum grant of £100.  There is our difficulty &mdash;if it exceeds £30.</P>
      <P>Who is the arbitrator as to the actual cost of the demolition of the derelict site?  So far as I know, it is an official of the local authority, the assistant county engineer.  I understand that, in assessing the cost, he refuses to take into account the wages of the applicant. It would be a good thing if, when these derelict sites are cleared, particularly in towns, they were rebuilt on. Where sites become cleared and are on the market, local authorities should purchase them for local authority housing or local authority offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this subject, may I mention one other matter to which I have referred on many previous occasions&mdash;the provision by local authorities of pounds throughout the country.  This House spends a considerable time legislating for the Department of Justice.  We ensure that judges and district justices are appointed and we ensure that the orders of the courts will be enforced in so far as we possibly can.  We provide jails for defaulters but we make no provision whatsoever for the impounding of animals seized on foot of judgments of our courts.  We have no provision for animals found straying on the lands of farmers, straying into the gardens of private individuals, or found straying on the road.  It is the duty of the county registrar to see that his assistants make the seizures if seizures become necessary.  It is the duty of the Gardaí to see that cattle found straying on the road are impounded and it is the privilege of a person who finds cattle straying on his land to impound them.  The local authorities are neglectful in that they do not provide pounds to ensure that these functions are exercised.  In my own county we have not one solitary pound at the moment despite the fact that some 40 years ago there were some 20 pounds in the county.  Some <Col N="87" /> of these derelict sites to which I have referred could easily be utilised for the provision of pounds.  A pound might be of considerable assistance not only to litigants but to other people, particularly the Garda, in enforcing the law.  I know that lack of money prevents a lot of desirable work being carried out and I was rather amused to see in the Minister's statement that while money will be available from the Local Loans Fund for various projects he encourages local authorities to seek money elsewhere, other than from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>I wonder do Deputies remember the outcry in this House when I sought the co-operation of the insurance companies in making money available to the local authorities?  I do not hear any outcry now when there is an endeavour to follow the headline I set on that occasion.  I am referring here to the facilities given to some local authorities by various insurance societies and insurance companies which were very much appreciated at the time.  I am glad the Minister goes on to say today that local authorities should continue to seek funds elsewhere than from the Local Loans Fund.  It would be a good thing indeed if they did.</P>
    <P>May I refer now to the erection of specific instance houses?  In my opinion that is one of the finest schemes introduced in this State.  It permits local authorities to build houses for certain classes, farm labourers and so on, throughout rural Ireland.  Up to date, on the direction of the Department of Local Government, or otherwise, local authorities will now build these specific instance houses only when the site provided by the applicant is on a main or county road.  It is most difficult to acquire a site on a main or county road.  The excuse offered by the local authority is that, should the particular individual for whom they build the house leave the country, they may find difficulty in disposing of the house.</P>
    <P>We should not become pessimistic about the building of these specific instance <Col N="88" /> houses.  We should look to the future and to the time when people will be glad to come back and live on the land of Ireland.  If it is a directive of the Minister that these houses should be built only on main or county roads, then I would ask him to revise that directive and permit specific instance houses to be erected anywhere a site is available, with access to the various amenities such as water and sewerage.</P>
    <P>Rates at the moment are soaring and no effort whatsoever is being made to assist local authorities in reducing them.  As I have already pointed out, the Department of Local Government insists on a local contribution when a grant is made available and that insistence by the Department encourages a further increase in rates.  In my own county at the moment, the rates are over 52/- in the £.  If that trend continues, it will become impossible for small farmers and uneconomic holders to meet the rate burden.  Consider the position of an individual who owns a private dwelling house of £10 or £15 poor law valuation.  If the rate is over 50/- in the £, the poor rate amounts to almost the full letting value of the house and for all practical purposes, the local authority is the owner of the house.  That position cannot possibly continue and some device will have to be found to assist local authorities in reducing the rates.  If that is not done, people will not be able to continue to pay rates.</P>
    <P>I have been some time in correspondence with the Minister about the liability for rates on premises used for public or charitable purposes.  So far, no relief has been given.  I ask the Minister to look into the matter again. I know some premises in Cork city and county which are used solely for charitable purposes and poor rates are demanded and paid on such premises. The relief sought by the various users or trustees of these properties should be granted.  The Cork County Council have sued the trustees of the Gurrane Estate for rates and the rates in that case are practically equal to the amount of the rent.  It would be equitable that these people should get the facilities they request on these premises used for charitable or public purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> I understand the Minister was in consultation with the Local Government Officials Union some time ago with regard to salaries payable to the clerical staffs of local authorities.  I understand the Minister has sanctioned retrospective increases as from 1st August, 1960, to clerk-typists and clerical officers but no increase has been granted to staff officers or analogous grades.  The reason given was that until analogous grades in the Civil Service have settled their claims, nothing can be done for these local government officials.  That is not fair.  If the Minister has decided that clerical staffs are entitled to increases, why should the other categories have to wait until analogous grades in the Civil Service have been dealt with?  There is a good deal of dissatisfaction, ill-feeling and a sense of frustration because salaries have not been adjusted.  I ask the Minister to do justice to these officials and remedy the apparent inequity.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to town planning. Town planning is something that has caused not only the present Minister but many of his predecessors a great deal of trouble and worry.  The principle underlying town planning is, first of all, to ensure ample breathing space and, secondly, to preserve scenic beauty.  There is nothing more obnoxious or more hideous than the forest of television aerials throughout the country.  I suggest to the Minister that he should make representations to his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in this matter.  On several occasions, I have requested the latter to permit piped television.  That would abolish this multiplicity of aerials and help considerably in town planning.  It would also obviate the need for annual repair to roofs of local authority and private houses because of aerials being blown down in winter storms.</P>
    <P>Piped television is modern; it is 100 per cent. efficient.  I do not see why we should wait until some private commercial concern sets up here for the purpose of providing piped television when we could now do the job ourselves at much less expense.  Piped television would preserve the symmetrical view of roof tops.  The Minister <Col N="90" /> should make some representations to his colleague, whose refusal to act in this matter I cannot understand. This is the time to make progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to it only in relation to town planning.  I do not wish to go into it further than that.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department are doing a considerable amount of useful work, with the assistance of local authorities, in signposting the country. They are making it feasible for visitors to travel throughout the State without enquiring the route to this place or that place.  In recent times a practice has grown up of erecting advertising signs which are very misleading.  They are very similar to some of the direction and instructive signs which the Minister has caused to be erected and which local authorities have had erected. That practice should be inquired into and, if at all possible, these signs should be repainted, reprinted or else taken down altogether.  It would be a good thing if that could be done.</P>
      <P>It would be a good thing also if there were stricter observance of the Town Planning Act in erecting such signs.  We all know the difficulty the Minister has under the Town Planning Act in trying to see that justice is done and at the same time avoid doing an injustice to an individual who seeks permission to erect signs, buildings, petrol pumps or other such facilities under the Town Planning Act.  Without trampling on anyone's toes, the Minister should ensure that signs which are misleading are dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is amusing to me to see this Estimate discussed in this quiet peaceful manner.  It is a good omen in one way.  It bears out what we said.  But, it shows a lot of depression on the part of the Minister's supporters.  I remember when no Estimate could be discussed without the present Lord Mayor of Dublin getting to his feet and making tear-moving speeches, ably supported by Deputy Larkin from the Labour benches.  Deputy Noel Lemass followed in their footsteps for a while until he was probably told to pipe <Col N="91" /> down.  One would imagine that the Custom House, no matter who the occupant of it was, was the bully of Dublin Corporation, that refused to give the money, refused to give them sanction and continuously brandished the big stick over their heads.  However, it is a good thing that these gentlemen are now learning to respect the occupant of the Ministerial post in the Custom House and now see the truth, what we told them to be the truth, when they were loudest in their outcries and protests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to some criticism levelled at the Minister for Local Government on account of the money that has been spent on improving main roads.  As one who has used the main roads fairly extensively, I could not agree with that criticism.  We must be realistic enough to recognise that there is a change-over of traffic on to the roads, that the number of vehicles using the roads is increasing by the thousand every year and that, therefore, the roads must be in absolutely good condition or certainly as good condition as we can afford to put them in.</P>
      <P>The roads in our country are a great potential attraction to the motoring tourist.  Tourists are coming here in increasing numbers with their cars and certainly it is necessary that the roads on which they travel would at least compare favourably with roads in other countries.  The Minister is wise in spending the money on the development of roads.</P>
      <P>It would be a good thing if the Minister could encourage local authorities, through financial assistance if possible, to do more for the country roads, especially&mdash;I agree with Deputy O'Donnell&mdash;roads leading to the coast.  There are in the South many beautiful parts of the coastline which are inaccessible to motor traffic because the roads are bad or not adequate to take the motorists to them.  That is a matter to which attention should be drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great source of complaint from tourists when they visit this country <Col N="92" /> is the fact that the overgrown hedges all over the country prevent them from enjoying the scenery.  I wonder would it be possible for the Minister to help the local authorities to remedy that position?  Anybody travelling along the country must be aware that the best scenery is blotted out from the motoring tourist by overgrown hedges.  Something should be done about that matter.  There is also the consideration that if hedges could be cut down drastically or completely removed it would make the roads safer.  A driver could see traffic a good distance ahead, even on a road with a bend, if these hedges were not there.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister's suggestion of having films to instruct people in road safety.  The short film is one of the best possible media of educating people on how to avoid traffic hazards, how to drive and in general use of the road.  I also welcome the Minister's reference to caravan sites. There the Minister has put his finger on something in which there is a great tourist potential.  This country is ready for development for the caravan tourist.  In other countries, particularly on the Continent, facilities for caravans are provided in a very big way.  Anyone travelling around this country, north, south, east or west, must be aware of the tremendous potential in the development of sites for caravan tourists.  If we play our cards properly, that is a feature of tourist traffic that will increase enormously in the next few years.</P>
    <P>I entered this discussion to welcome the Minister's approach to the provision of swimming pools.  As one who has spent the best part of his life promoting swimming and life-saving, I want to say how glad I am that the Minister has officially, as it were, recognised the value of swimming and life-saving.  Everyone should appreciate that there is no better exercise for the growing boy or girl than swimming.  There are many physiques that are not robust enough to take part in field games but I have personal knowledge of the fact that if children learn to swim at a <Col N="93" /> tender age, say, eight, nine, ten or 11 years, they can grow into very healthy men and women of fine physique.  Not only from that point of view but if we are to tackle the problem at all properly, children should be taught to swim while they are still at school, and that, of course, means the facilities must be made available.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister in regard to the encouragement of the provision of open-air swimming pools or baths. In this country, the climate allows open-air swimming for only three months out of the 12, in the best of summers.  The swimming pool in Cork is the biggest in the whole country. Unfortunately, it can be used for only three months of a year.  For the other nine, it lies there useless and neglected and, therefore, it takes more to maintain it than it would if it were in use all the year round.  I agree that an indoor swimming pool would cost more in capital at the outset, but surely that is worth while in order that swimming and life saving can be taught for 12 months out of the 12 and that children can go to the swimming pool during the school term and be taught in organised classes. That is an invaluable asset.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that for the three months of the year when it is possible to use an outdoor pool, because people in most parts of the country do not live far from the coast or a river, they have somewhere they can bathe or swim.  Since Dublin has become so thickly populated, I agree wholeheartedly that the provision of indoor or outdoor swimming facilities is absolutely essential.  Even as a Corkman I am ashamed of the facilities for swimming provided in Dublin. I do not think there is a city in Europe with the population as large as the population in Dublin which is so badly provided for in regard to swimming facilities.  I think I can say that without fear of contradiction.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I welcome the proposal that inland towns with a population of over 5,000 should be encouraged to spend extra money, if necessary, to provide an indoor swimming pool <Col N="94" /> which could be used all the year round.  I am not at all satisfied that an outdoor swimming pool can be converted into an indoor swimming pool after a certain number of years. It would cost more money and would never be as suitable as it would be if the capital required to provide an indoor swimming pool were provided at the outset.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister that there are very few exercises that I know of in which so much voluntary help is offered as in the teaching or coaching of swimming and life-saving.  In Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway&mdash; places I know very well&mdash;an abundance of voluntary help is given freely and willingly in teaching children swimming and life-saving.  That should be encouraged and we should do everything possible to encourage it.  There are the Irish Swimming Association, the Red Cross Water Safety Association, the St. John's Lifesaving Association and various other bodies, well equipped and anxious to teach if they had the facilities.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister, if possible, to increase his contribution for the provision of indoor facilities.</P>
    <P>I feel that the whole effort must come, not from the local council or the Government.  As Deputy O'Donnell, I think, said, many local associations are keenly interested in the provision of a swimming pool and if they get some help from the Government and the local authority, they will do something themselves also to provide the facilities.  Therefore, I welcome the Minister's comment and I hope that when the Estimate comes before us in 12 months' time, the country&mdash;and if I may say so, particularly Dublin&mdash; will be better off in that regard than it has been up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot welcome the outlook of the Minister with regard to the rates position.  The Minister very glibly passed over the fact that the rates have increased by 2/- in the £.  Last year, the average rates were 38/11d. and this year they are 40/11d. That is a very serious position.  The people who are mainly called on to pay rates are the farmers, and they <Col N="95" /> must pay them irrespective of what the year was like.  Whether it was a good year or a bad year, they must pay their rates.  People object to paying income tax, but, after all, income tax is collected only on earnings or profits, as the case may be.  Farmers find it very hard in certain years to pay their rates.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, we in Kilkenny County Council received a deputation from very responsible farmers who put up a very reasonable case and produced a graph comparing rates and prices since 1953.  Farmers' prices remained roughly at 100 and the rates in Kilkenny have increased from 100 to 160, that is, a 60 per cent. increase over the period from 1953 to 1960.  I understand that in Kilkenny we have the second lowest rates in the country. Since we feel the rates so heavily, what must they feel in other counties? In some counties also, they are very highly rated and people with small holdings of 40 or 50 acres have to pay rates in the region of £100.  That is a great burden on them and as was pointed out, their competitors in Northern Ireland and Britain have no rates to pay.</P>
      <P>I feel that the county councils should do something about that problem. Wages, salaries and costs in general have gone up over the years and, therefore, the county councils under the present system of rate collection or rate levy cannot do very much.  I thought the Minister would have made some mention today about changing the method of assessment of rates, but he just said the rates have gone up by 2/- from 38/11d. to 40/11d. as if it were a normal thing that the rates should go up.  It means that the rate-payers are contributing about £22 million in direct taxation, irrespective of their incomes for the year or what the weather was like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should look at that problem.  Much of it is caused because in certain circumstances the county councils must provide the same money and grants as they did in the previous year.  Money must be provided to maintain other services and therefore the rates increase each year.  The Minister <Col N="96" /> should take a more serious view of the rates position than he did in his opening speech.  He took the whole position in his stride, but it is a very serious business.</P>
    <P>I take it that the main point in this debate is the question of housing.  In regard to housing, we have been badly handled over the past four years by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I have mentioned before, and it is no harm to mention again, that the Minister's predecessor in office, Deputy O'Donnell, sanctioned schemes in Kilkenny for the building of houses, but it took the last by-election in Kilkenny to get sanction from the Minister to go ahead.  Now we have got other sanctions, like, I suppose, a lot of other places, because of the general election that is pending.  That is the only thing that puts any life into the Government &mdash;the prospect of a general election.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" />&ldquo;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;the Act&rsquo; means the Charities Act, 1961;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;gift&rsquo; and &lsquo;charitable gift&rsquo; have the same meanings as they have in the Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  This section applies to every gift made before the 1st day of July, 1961, which, if it had been made on or after that day, would, by virtue of section 50 of the Act, have been, to the extent provided in that section, a charitable gift.</P>
    <P>(3)  As respects the year 1961-62 and subsequent years of assessment, section 37 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, shall have effect in relation to a gift to which this section applies as if the gift had been made on or after the 1st day of July, 1961.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I explained on the Committee Stage I was bringing in this amendment.  The position is that Section 50 of the Charities Bill provides that in the case of a gift for the maintenance of a grave or memorial the money provided, to the extent of £60 per annum or £1,000 lump sum, will be free of income tax.  That section applies from the 1st August, 1961.  This amendment is to bring in such moneys provided before the 1st August, 1961, as if the gift had been made after the 1st August, 1961.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 28, after &ldquo;acquired&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are put down because the matter was overlooked in the original drafting of the Bill.  The word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; should have been put in the same as it has been put into other subsections <Col N="99" /> to deal with the same point.  Subsection (2) paragraph (c) (i) of Section 31, on page 18, line 36, states:</P>
    <P>... that the property is property which is being acquired exclusively for the purposes of an industry other than agriculture....</P>
    <P>That word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; should have been repeated in the two places here where it is now proposed to insert it, in page 20 and page 24.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I want to be quite clear about in relation to this is a case somewhat as follows.  An industry buys, shall we say, 20 acres for its initial development. It puts its factory on the 20 acres so as to ensure it will have enough land to expand at a later stage if it succeeds in attaining its hopes and ambitions.  During the stages when it is growing, so to speak, obviously if it is using ten acres to start with, the other ten acres should not go to waste.  Probably the remaining part of the site will be utilised for agricultural purposes until such time as the industry is ready to expand.  I appreciate that there is the three-year period.  What I want to be quite clear about is that where a company buys a site, which it requires for an industry now, the use of the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; does not mean it cannot at the same time buy reasonable ground for expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any doubt about that at all.  It is simply a matter of looking at it in a commonsense way.  For a person who wants ten acres for an industry it would be obviously prudent to take 20 or 30 acres, if he could get it. That would be allowed.  What we want to exclude is the case where a small industrialist wants five acres but buys 300 acres and says he is buying it for his industry.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5a:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 37 and 38, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( )  If before the 1st day of <Col N="100" /> September, 1961, notice in writing is given to the Revenue Commissioners and a person proves to their satisfaction that a contract for the sale of any lands, tenements and hereditaments was completed before the 20th day of April, 1961, and the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the conveyance or transfer executed on or after the 20th day of April, 1961, gives effect to such sale, and does not give effect to a sale in respect of which a contract was completed on or after the 20th day of April, 1961, then, notwithstanding anything in the preceding subsections of this section, the stamp duties chargeable on such conveyance or transfer shall be the same as if this Act had not been passed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a repeat of the amendment we discussed on Committee.  I may as well tell the Minister that since it was discussed in Committee I have had very strong representations made to me to repeat it because of the immense hardship that is going to be involved. I have before me a case from one of the most reputable firms of solicitors in this city&mdash;not my own, let me add&mdash; in which a contract was made on the 11th June, 1960.  But the contract was subject to the vendor getting possession from the purchaser of a house that was on the property.  The vendor and the purchaser agreed, out of consideration for the occupant of the house, that time would be given to the occupant to go out of possession and, in consequence, it was not possible in the circumstances to complete the contract before Budget day this year.</P>
    <P>As the law stands, when that contract was entered into in June, 1960, it was subject only to three per cent. stamp duty, but because the two parties did not take the occupant of the house by the scruff of his neck and peg him out without consideration of where he had to go, the stamp duty is 25 per cent.  That is harsh beyond question but, in addition to being harsh, I have some doubt in my mind as to whether the imposition of stamp duty in a case such as this after the contract has been completed is constitutional.  However, <Col N="101" /> that is neither here nor there; it is not my pigeon.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister also that I am advised that there are other similar cases and I want to draw his attention to the phrase that I included on the last occasion, namely, &ldquo;a person proves to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;  I am perfectly happy to leave this matter to the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners as to whether it was or was not a genuine contract.  I accept at once the Minister's anxiety that any amendment providing for a contract of this sort should not be utilised for evasion, should not be utilised by people attempting to back-date documents.  I would not countenance that for a second but where there is a genuine contract already in existence&mdash;it may have been in existence, as in the particular case to which I referred, as far back as 11th June, 1960&mdash;there is undoubtedly a case to be met which should in honour be met so that the Government would not put the parties to such a contract in a position which they did not visualise at the time they came to agree on the contract.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the last day that one of the methods would be an impressed stamp.  Possibly there might be some way of getting over that by a person having a certain number of stamped blank pages and being able to utilise them afterwards for a contract. However, the safer basis would be to provide that a person should prove it to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners.  There are a number of ways in which the Revenue Commissioners could satisfy themselves.  They could, for example, call for the cheque by which the deposit was paid.  If it had been paid by cheque, not merely the date on which it was drawn but also the date on which it passed through the bank would be clear on the face of it.  They could call for the correspondence books of the solicitors dealing with the matter and see whether in fact there was such correspondence at that time so as to make it clear that the contract was, in fact, executed before 19th April.  They could provide that one of their requirements before they would accept it as <Col N="102" /> being proved to their satisfaction would be that the parties concerned, and perhaps the solicitors as well, would execute statutory declarations which, if they were wrong, would mean that the people completing these statutory regulations would be guilty of perjury and could be sent to jail.</P>
    <P>There is a combination of circumstances which the Revenue Commissioners could fairly lay down to the effect: &ldquo;Before we will accept the proof as being to our satisfaction, we want to see this, that and the other.&rdquo;  I am not prepared under any circumstances to cavil at the strictest proof being required but I do think that, where there is a contract made according to the law, a Government has not the right, and we in this House have not the right, to amend that contract and provide penalties under it&mdash; because this is a penalty&mdash;which will affect the parties to the contract and which they could not visualise at the time they entered into it.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested on the last occasion that coming up to Budget time people thought this was certainly going to be included.  Did they think it was going to be included on the 11th June, 1960, more than a year ago today? Was there any indication from any member of the Government, the Minister for Finance or anyone else that there was any likelihood of such a provision being inserted in June, 1960? The Minister knows perfectly well that there was not.</P>
    <P>I do not stand at all on the wording of this amendment, but I think the Minister is in honour bound to provide that where a person satisfies the Revenue Commissioners by any method of proof that the Revenue Commissioners require, that person is entitled to be put in the position in which he was before the Minister of his own volition altered the law.  Let the Revenue Commissioners call for the contract.  Let them call for the correspondence or for the postage books that show that that correspondence was duly entered into at the appropriate time.  Let them call for the cheques that show that the deposit was paid, see the dates on which those cheques were paid through the <Col N="103" /> bank.  Let them call, if they wish, for any receipt that was issued.  Let the Revenue Commissioners satisfy themselves that the receipt issued was one issued in proper sequence, issued on the date on which it purports to have been issued.  Let them put on that whatever form of words the Minister considers appropriate to give the widest possible discretion to the Revenue Commissioners in assessing the proof whether it is in the form &ldquo;are of the opinion&rdquo; or that the person &ldquo;must prove to their satisfaction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not interested in the form of words at all.  I am interested in the principle that if a person can satisfy the Revenue Commissioners by whatever means the Revenue Commissioners decide&mdash;and I leave them to be the judge that there was a genuine contract&mdash;we have not got the right in this House by unilateral action here to change the position without giving a person so injured by a heavy penalty the right to show that there was a genuine contract in existence which he ought to be allowed to honour as it was on the day the law took effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to make a correction in something I said the last day.  I said to the Deputy that in regard to the meeting between the Revenue Commissioners and the Incorporated Law Society, they left the Incorporated Law Society satisfied.  The Deputy said that was not his information.  His information was correct.  I am sorry. What I should have read in the note was that &ldquo;the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that they will meet any point the solicitors raised.&rdquo;  I read it too hastily and made that mistake.  I want to correct it because the Deputy was right in his information at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, as I announced on the Budget, the axe must fall on that day with regard to the 1947 companies.  I think we must stick to that; we cannot possibly depart from it.  I do not want to go over the whole ground again.  I <Col N="104" /> think that all those who were availing of the 1947 companies must have been well aware long before Budget time that something was almost certain to be done to deal with that particular form of avoidance of stamp duty.</P>

      <P>Take a case in relation to June, 1960.  I quite admit that there was no suggestion at that time that any changes were being made.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about that.  There are, of course, many cases which come under the Revenue Commissioners of the kind where the axe falls on a certain day and there is no way out of it.  Sometimes we have a hard luck case where an import duty is imposed.  Another point I want to make is that it is almost impossible to be sure that there is not fraud in some way or other in regard to concessions which have been made.  I was impressed by the Deputy's case in connection with the impressed stamps. There was an impressed stamp sent to me, dated 8th February, 1961, on a blank sheet which was bought in the post office, the position being that the Revenue Commissioners have supplied these blank sheets with impressed stamps to the post office for sale.  They are sent from time to time as they are required.  Therefore, the impressed stamp would be absolutely useless.  I only mention that to show that whatever next step we might take we would probably be up against fraud there, too.  I think that, on the whole, even though there may be more than one hard case, we will have to stick to the Bill as far as this item is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the case that in relation to many contracts for the importation of goods, the people concerned always feel that they are liable to sudden fluctuations in rates of duties and that because duties may be altered in relation to imports, that was, therefore, a precedent for stamp duties being altered in this case. If I understood the Minister, that was the case he was making.  I do not know whether I am correct in my understanding of the Minister.  He said that contracts were varied in relation to imports by duties being changed from time to time because that was an accepted situation.  Then the position was that this should follow the same rule.  I do not know whether I correctly interpreted the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not speak of contracts. I said that in other ways, you have this hard story.  For instance, if an import duty is put on and a person has goods coming in to which this duty applies, he has to pay it.  There is no way out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that is what the Minister meant.  That is the experience and the practice and that is the system that is being built up over the years.  Everybody knows that if they are going to import anything they are taking the risk that the duty may be changed.  That is their fault.  What is the situation in relation to this duty? There was only one other case in which this duty was ever imposed and that was in the Finance Act, 1947.  In relation to imports, it is always understood that anybody who imports any goods is taking the risk that a duty may be <Col N="106" /> imposed.  That is the pattern.  Anybody who does has damn well got to put up with it or lump it.  That is the precedent which the Minister quoted.</P>
      <P>The precedent here is exactly the reverse.  There was one case only in which this duty was put on before&mdash; the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947 and the precedent there was that there was a saver for genuine existing contracts. Anybody dealing with the matter up to Budget day was absolutely entitled to say the situation was dealt with before they were going to wipe out the pre-1947 exemption.  Obviously, they must follow the precedent that the Revenue and the Minister for Finance laid down in 1947 that there would be a saver for existing contracts.  Anybody who was dealing with the matter was entitled to feel and think that because it had been dealt with in that way in 1947, it was going to be dealt with on the same basis on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The Minister has the 1949 Act which deals with leases.  I have not got it to hand and I cannot remember whether the saver was put into the 1949 Act as well but it certainly was put into the 1947 Act dealing with conveyances.  It is certainly putting it back in the only part of this legislation that is in any way relevant at all.</P>
      <P>I want to put this to the Minister. It is not worth the ha'porth of tar involved to get the name of being a person who breaks an honourable arrangement.  It is not worth it for any Government coming to this House and to the country to say in relation to the whole law of property: &ldquo;It does not matter a hoot what the law is at any particular time; if it suits me, I am going to break it and I am going to break it in such a way that I am going to put retrospective taxation on the people involved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in this section which makes it worthwhile to break that principle.  The Minister and I had immense arguments two years ago in relation to retrospective taxation on certain other aspects.  We went on for days and days on the subject.  Eventually, <Col N="107" /> the Minister saw the force of the argument that Governments should not do that sort of thing.  This is not going to mean anything in the shape of a revenue.  It is not worth a hoot.  However, it will mean a great deal from the point of view of an honourable precedent.  Without injuring himself in the slightest, the Minister could take steps to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners would call for all the proofs which they, in their absolute discretion, think necessary. Then, if they get all the proofs they think necessary they would pass it and if they do not get the proofs, they would reject it and make the person pay the extra 22 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot add very much more.  I do not agree with the Deputy that this is retrospective.  It was brought in on the day the Budget was introduced.  If, for instance, I had said in the Budget that the 25 per cent. will now be increased to 35 per cent. from this on, that would not be looked upon as retrospective because it applied to any transaction that took place from that time onwards.  I do not think this is very much different from that type of proposal.</P>
      <P>In the 1947 Act, the putting of heavy stamp duty on the purchase of property was a very novel proposal, especially as it was to achieve a certain purpose.  For that reason, the Minister at the time felt he should insert some saver for cases that were in course of completion.  In the 1949 Act, that was not repeated. The 1949 Act was a strengthening of the 1947 Act, making some changes both on the retrospective and liberal side but there was no saver in the 1949 Act.  I do not think a good case can be made that there should be a saver in this Bill in this case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 25, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the Revenue Commissioners are of opinion&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that on or after the 1st day of August, 1961, or the date of the passing of this Act, whichever is the later, lands, tenements or hereditaments have passed into the beneficial ownership, possession, occupation or control of any person (in this section referred to as the occupier), and</P>
      <P>(b)  that the passing has resulted from any arrangement or arrangements the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which was the avoidance or reduction of liability to stamp duty under the Stamp Act, 1891, at the rate provided for by subsection (5) of section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, or subsection (5) of section 24 of the Finance Act, 1949,</P>
      <P>the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)(I)  the Revenue Commissioners may by notice in writing require the occupier to deliver to them, within thirty days after the date of the requisition (or, in the case of an appeal under paragraph (vi) of this section against a decision of the Revenue Commissioners not to cancel the requisition which is decided in favour of the Revenue Commissioners or is withdrawn, within thirty days after the <Col N="109" /> date of the decision or withdrawal, as the case may be) a statement in writing containing such particulars as they may require in relation to the passing, and</P>
    <P>(II)  the occupier shall comply with the requisition,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the statement shall&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  be charged with the amount of stamp duty with which it would be charged, and</P>
    <P>(II)  be subject to the statutory provisions to which it would be subject,</P>
    <P>if it were a conveyance or transfer on sale of the fee simple interest in the lands, tenements or hereditaments, free from all incumbrances, made to the occupier for a consideration in money equal to the value of such interest and executed on the date of the passing, due allowance being made for the amount of any stamp duty already paid in relation to the passing: provided that if, within thirty days after the date of the requisition under paragraph (i) of this section, the occupier shows cause to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners why the requisition under paragraph (i) of this section should be cancelled, the Revenue Commissioners shall cancel the requisition and the statement, if any, delivered pursuant thereto,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the provisions of subsection (8) of section 31 and subsection (8) of section 32 of this Act shall apply in relation to the statement,</P>
    <P>(iv)  where the occupier has not complied with the requisition under paragraph (i) of this section and has not shown cause to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners why the requisition should be cancelled, the Revenue Commissioners may prepare a statement in writing of the particulars in relation to the passing as they <Col N="110" /> appear to them and deliver a copy thereof to the occupier and, upon delivery of the copy, the statement shall be deemed to be the statement delivered in accordance with the requisition under paragraph (i) of this section: provided that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  if, within thirty days after the date of the delivery to him of the copy aforesaid, the occupier shows cause to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners why the statement should be cancelled, the Revenue Commissioners shall cancel the statement, and</P>
    <P>(II)  if, within thirty days after the delivery to him of the copy aforesaid, the occupier shows cause to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners why the particulars contained in the statement should be modified, the Revenue Commissioners shall modify them,</P>
    <P>(v) (I) subject to clause (II) of this paragraph, if, at the expiration of thirty days after the date (being, in case an appeal is brought under paragraph (vi) of this section, a date after the date of the determination or withdrawal, as the case may be, of the appeal, and, in any other case, a date after the date of the expiration of the time for any appeal which may be brought under that paragraph) on which the Revenue Commissioners have notified the occupier of the amount of duty chargeable on the statement, the statement is not stamped in accordance with paragraph (ii) of this section, a sum equal to twice the amount of the duty unpaid shall thereupon be a debt due to the Minister for Finance for the benefit of the Central Fund by the occupier,</P>
    <P>(II)  clause (I) of this paragraph does not apply to a statement delivered in accordance with the requisition under paragraph (i) of this section the cancellation <Col N="111" /> of which has been effected by the Revenue Commissioners or directed by the Court on appeal under paragraph (vi) of this section and, in the case of a statement the particulars of which have been modified by the Revenue Commissioners or have been directed by the Court, on appeal under the said paragraph (vi), to be modified, clause (I) of this paragraph applies to the statement subject to the modification effected or directed as aforesaid, and</P>
    <P>(vi)  where the occupier fails in showing cause to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners why the requisition under paragraph (i) of this section should be cancelled or why the statement prepared by the Revenue Commissioners should be cancelled or why the particulars contained in the statement prepared by the Revenue Commissioners should be modified, an appeal shall lie to the High Court from the decision of the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a new section which it is proposed to insert.  Although it is a long section, I do not think there is any difficulty in understanding it.  I shall just run through the section.  First of all, it lays down the conditions on which the Revenue Commissioners can interfere.  Where they have reason to believe that a transaction went through that should have been submitted to them for adjudication in the ordinary way, they may ask for particulars. They may ask for a statement from the purchaser or the person who has the property and they may ask for a statement to be submitted to them within 30 days.  If there is an appeal in the court against this and if the appeal is lost, then the Commissioners will operate the 30 days again, or if there should be an appeal put down for the High Court and the appeal is withdrawn, then the Commissioners will operate the 30 days from that date. That is as far as subparagraph (i) (1) is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> Then it goes on to say that the occupier shall comply with the requisition to submit the statement as requested.  If and when the statement is received by the Revenue Commissioners and they believe it should have been assessed at the 25 per cent. stamp duty, then they will charge the stamp duty on the statement, the same as they would on a conveyance of any kind, unless, in the statement which is submitted to the Revenue Commissioners, it is obvious that it is not a case they should stamp.  Then the Revenue Commissioners can cancel their proceedings and that is the end of it.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph says that if any false statement is made by the person concerned, he is liable on conviction to a fine of £500 or six months' imprisonment, or both.  Then we come on to subparagraph (iv).  If the person does not reply within 30 days, then the Revenue Commissioners may themselves prepare the statement that he should have prepared and may send this statement, with the assessment for stamp duty, to the person concerned. He will be liable for payment of this duty within, I think, 30 days, unless, again, he shows reason why he should not be assessed at this high rate of duty.  Alternatively, he may point out that the assessment should be modified as it is too high.  That will be rectified, if it seems it should be rectified, by the Revenue Commissioners. If there is no reply within 30 days, then they can send him a demand for twice the duty assessed on the property and he is liable for this duty at that particular rate.</P>
    <P>Subsection (II) of paragraph (v) just points out that the Revenue Commissioners will not assess the person on any statement that was cancelled by them or rejected by the courts or on any statement that was modified by them.  It should be modified accordingly in the assessment they make.</P>
    <P>The last paragraph gives the person the right of appeal to the High Court against the decision of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said&mdash; I do not think he meant it&mdash;that in any <Col N="113" /> case where it was perfectly obvious to the Revenue Commissioners that there was nothing in it, they would cancel the requisition.  The Revenue Commissioners will act in a semi-judicial capacity and assess the merits of the case.  It is not a question of whether it is perfectly obvious or not but whether they <i>bona fide</i> come to that decision.</P>
      <P>I am not clear about certain matters &mdash;&ldquo;that the passing has resulted from any arrangement or arrangements the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which,&rdquo; paragraph (b) in the second paragraph.  Does that cover the case of the mortgagee going into possession in the manner I indicated?</P>

      <P>The Minister must think I am a very naïve person.  I do not think he is so naïve that this section was put in without his knowing what contributions were going to be <Col N="115" /> allowable.  Sections just do not wander into a Finance Bill like that, without somebody knowing something about them.  I admit the Minister for Social Welfare does not make the certificate until after the Bill becomes an Act, but I am sure everybody from the Revenue Commissioners down&mdash;and I will take a bet it is in the Minister's brief&mdash; knows what the approximate effect of this is going to be, that in relation to cards stamped at the industrial rate, the allowance will be so and so and in relation to cards stamped at the agricultural rate, the result will be so and so.</P>
      <P>I refuse to accept that there have been no discussions, no tentative conversaziones as between Social Welfare, and Finance and Revenue, and even perhaps that the Minister might have had a whispered word with the Tánaiste about this on some occasion. Not merely do people know what it is going to be at the top but the information has percolated down to the bottom. If the information has percolated down to the bottom, it is not unfair that members of this House should ask what is going to be the effect of this section before they are asked to pass the section blindfold, because that is what the Minister is asking should be done, that we pass Section 9 without any indication from him of the amount involved.  That is not the way to deal with this or any other Bill.</P>

I do not know what the aggregate is going to be but I remember one time when I was Minister for Social Welfare that the figure was 1/6d. at that time.  A sum of 24/- or 25/- altogether, or something of that nature, was involved.  I do not know what it would be now but half of that would be put on the insured person.  It would be a comparatively <Col N="116" /> small amount.  I do not think it can make a great deal of difference to our receipts from income tax for the year.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Bill was discussed earlier, I came across a case in respect of which the Bill itself covers certain matters, but the amendment that I put down for today was ruled out of order on the grounds that it was not discussed as such on Committee Stage.  I came across the case of the livestock corporation which is financing certain farmers in just the same way as banks finance farmers, but doing it slightly differently by reference to hire purchase.  The position in relation to hire purchase is that they are properly <Col N="117" /> allowable as a deduction from Schedule D assessments but not allowable from either Schedules A B or E.  The position therefore is that if a person who is stocking his farm borrows from the bank, he is allowed his bank interest for the purpose of an offset against his tax.  If he borrows from the livestock corporation for the purpose of stocking his farm he is not allowed because the loan is taken on the basis that the payments that he makes to the livestock corporation are payments of a consideration for hire rather than interest as such.  The payment would be allowable under Schedule D but is not allowable under Schedules A, B or E. Quite frankly I think that is a mistake remembering that the payment is made for the purpose of increasing agricultural credit and the Minister said several times that he is very anxious to ensure increased agricultural credit. Yet, in this particular instance, credit is not allowable as an ordinary deduction in the way that other deductions are.</P>
      <P>On the Budget and on this Finance Bill I have made it clear that, in my view, the proposals of the Government fail in relation to several matters.  One of the things in which they fail is that they have no inducement whatever in these proposals towards helping people to achieve the increased productivity so urgently necessary if we are to compete at all in the world of tomorrow. I recently came across some figures for increased productivity since 1955 in other countries.  We must accept that we have not had as much success in increasing productivity here as other countries have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, we have had to make up a good deal of leeway.  Since 1955 productivity has increased in Italy by 33 per cent.; in France by 26 per cent.; in Holland by 22 per cent.; in Western Germany by 20 per cent. since 1955, and the productivity increase in Western Germany from 1950 to 1955 was absolutely phenomenal and startling. Since 1955, productivity has increased in America by 16 per cent. and in the United Kingdom by 9 per cent.  These figures are based on some recalculation that was made of statistics prepared by the Deutsche Bank of Germany, <Col N="118" /> starting with 1950 as a base level and then recalculating to 1955.</P>
    <P>We are inclined here to measure our productivity on Britain and it is significant that her productivity has increased by only 9 per cent. as compared with 20 per cent. for Western Germany, 26 per cent. for France, not to mention Italy with 33 per cent.&mdash; more than three times that of Britain. There may be certain circumstances in relation to which the Italian figure is not properly comparable because of the position in Southern Italy.  Be that as it may it is clear that on those figures we have a long way to go.  We have a position in which it is absolutely essential we should speed up if we are to keep our place, much less improve it, for our exports in the future.</P>
    <P>This Bill introduced by the Minister on behalf of the Government does nothing by way of inducement towards the desired end.  In fact, it has already been stated on Second Reading and on the Committee Stage, the amendment in relation to corporation profits tax in Section 6 can act as a deterrent.  We must remember, too, that in this Bill we are incorporating into our taxation code a structure of direct and indirect taxation that does nothing to make it easier for our people to compete on reasonable terms with the member States of EEC and in the European Free Trade Association.  The figures given in Appendix 5 of the division of direct and indirect taxation show that there is considerable room for us to mend our hand and to provide that our people will not be put in a worse position by Government taxation than their competitors abroad.  For these deficiencies, the Minister must accept responsibility.  The Bill, because of these deficiencies, is not up to the standard the people had a right to expect.</P>
    <P>In an earlier discussion the Minister referred to the levies and said that, when they came in in 1957 and since, they had abolished most of the levies. I had not then the figures to my hand, but the fact is that in the Minister's first year, 1957-1958, he collected <Col N="119" /> £2,490,000 in levies and £692,000 in customs duties which he had substituted for levies, making a total of £3,182,000.  In 1958/1959 he collected in levies £1,788,000 and in customs duties that he substituted for levies £1,535,000, making a total of £3,323,000.  In 1959-1960, he collected in levies £1,586,000 and by customs duties that he substituted for levies, £1,855,000, making a total of £3,441,000.  In 1961, the financial year just ended&mdash;I have not got the exact breakdown between the two&mdash; on the Minister's own figure the total is approximately £3,000,000 as between levies, which were estimated originally as being £1,120,000, and customs duties which were estimated at being £1,855,000, making a total estimate of £2,975,000, which, in fact, works out at virtually the same total, though there may have been some slight change in the individual breakdown of the figures for that year.</P>
    <P>In the four years, therefore, the Minister has collected over £13,000,000 by way of levy or by way of customs duty which he substituted for levy.  I ask the people who are going around canvassing in the shops for Fianna Fáil to remember that their Minister for Finance collected £13,000,000 though canvassers told the shopkeepers in 1957 that if they elected a Fianna Fáil Government they would not have to pay any more levies.  Only the other day I heard a shopkeeper reminding his customers of that, after the discussion in this House.  Thirteen million pounds' worth of duties had been collected by broken Fianna Fáil canvassing promises.</P>

      <P>With regard to hire purchase, the instalments are not regarded as interest though, strictly speaking, they are supposed to include an element of interest.  The position would require analysis and consideration before anything could be done.  I do not know if it would be wise to touch it in the manner advocated by the Deputy.  I do not think it is right for the Deputy to say there is no inducement whatever to help productivity. There is, first of all, of course, the very, very substantial inducement <Col N="120" /> of the reduction of 8d. in income tax, which is a very good incentive indeed to workers and salary earners of all kinds.  Then, of course, there are the other things like the increase in earned income allowances and a few smaller items dealing with income tax which should be helpful also.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the more we are up against competition with other countries the more important it is to see that our taxation is kept down to the level that they have, if we possibly can, but it is not an easy matter to compare one with the other. A good advocate could certainly make the case that we pay more but an equally good advocate could make the case that we pay less.  It is very difficult to arrive at the truth or what would be a just appraisal of that particular question. On the whole, I think we are not paying any more taxes here than they do in most European countries and, on that score, I do not think we will be prevented from competing with other countries if we drift into an association of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we reported progress I said that we need a general election to put life into housing.  When the present Government were elected the then Taoiseach said that the completion of the housing of the people was the first duty of the Government. Within 12 months of his making that statement, Deputy Childers, who was Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time, attended a Chamber of Commerce dinner in Kilkenny and said, <i>inter alia,</i> that too much money had been devoted to housing, that he regarded it as slush-money, that he felt that if that money had been invested in industry in general it would give more dividends and more return to the country, that in housing people we were wasting the resources of the State.  I would rather support the Leader than Deputy Childers at that time.  Apparently Deputy Childers was voicing the opinion of the Government, that they were going to close down on housing.  Figures have been quoted this evening which show that, in 1956, 7,000 people were employed on local authority housing alone and in the last year there were 2,200 so employed.  As I have mentioned, there was no sanction for any houses in Kilkenny or practically any other urban district.</P>
      <P>The only thing that saved local authorities during the past four years from a housing crisis in their various areas was emigration, not only of single people but of families who vacated houses and made them available to people who were very badly in need of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to a circular he issued to advise housing authorities that where the needs of the priority categories had been or are in course of being met, proposals could be submitted for persons eligible for and in <Col N="122" /> need of houses qualifying for one-third subsidy where such persons are not able to rehouse themselves with the aid of grants and loans, etc.  Take the ordinary working man.  What hope has he of rehousing himself?  Take the man who has been married for the past eight or nine years and is rearing a family and living with his father and mother or with his wife's father and mother in a corporation house.  Under the regulations as laid down by the present Minister he has no hope of getting a corporation house.  It is a disgrace that a man who is rearing a family, just because he is living in a corporation house and was married before 1952, has no hope of being rehoused.</P>
    <P>By a change in that regulation the Minister could allow all those people who have been married over the past number of years and who are living with their parents, to be rehoused.  They have been debarred for a number of years from getting houses.  These people deserve houses.  If we want to encourage these people to stay in the country or if we are to have any hope of maintaining our population, why not rehouse them?  They are fully entitled to a two-thirds subsidy house. The rent of a one-third subsidy house is out of the question for these people.</P>
    <P>The rent collection in our local authority was 100 per cent, during the past year.  If we go according to the Minister and house those people at one-third subsidy, deficiencies will occur every day because these people will not be able to meet the demands made on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am carrying on until he arrives.  That is an aside.  During the past year a change was made in respect of grants for roads.  For the improvement of main roads we paid 100 per cent, grant and for the improvement of county roads 40 per cent. grant.  On main roads there is a 40 per cent. maintenance grant; on county roads there is no maintenance grant. That is what is pushing up the rates in the county.  In practically every county, <Col N="123" /> roads have been tarred during the past years and are now coming to the stage when they have to be resurfaced every four or five years.  They must be maintained in proper condition.  That is a great burden on councils and they are getting no help whatever.  A person living on a county road pays rates and motor tax.  Is he not entitled to get the same facilities as a person living on a main road?  A number of county roads have been improved and people living on other roads want them brought up to a reasonable standard. To Kilkenny County Council the cost of maintenance of county roads amounts to close on £100,000 a year.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the Road Fund had increased by £2,000,000 this year.  Considering the increase in taxes and the way lorry-owners have been bled this year by the Government in increased motor duties, it is no wonder that the Road Fund increased by £2,000,000.  Even if there had been no increase in the number of vehicles on the roads, the Road Fund would have increased by £2,000,000.  There are still people living on county roads who are not getting the facilities to which they are entitled from the Government. The rates have been pushed up simply and solely because no grant is given for the maintenance of county roads.  I appeal to the Minister to give a grant for the maintenance of those roads because, as I say, every year they are being developed and there is still no grant for their maintenance.  The county roads should at least be given the same grant as the main roads, that is, 100 per cent. improvement grant and 40 per cent. maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt with the Government's proposal with regard to regional water supply schemes.  I welcome regional water supply schemes so far as they are required.  The Castlecomer area is very densely populated.  It is essential that the people in that area should have running water in their houses and it would be reasonably economical to provide.  The Minister assessed the cost of the regional water supply schemes at 5/- in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was Minister <Col N="124" /> for Health when the Health Bill was introduced and he estimated that it would cost 2/- in the £.  It is now working out at 9/- or 9/6 in the £. I trust the Minister for Local Government will be found to be more realistic in his estimate of 5/- in the £, and that in a short time, it will not be £1 in the £, taking it on the basis of the estimate of the Minister for Finance what it actually worked out at.  We know that water is essential in any house that can be serviced at reasonable cost.  There are other schemes such as joint schemes under which people get E.S.B. pumped water. That scheme should be used wherever possible and especially in thinly populated areas.  Certain facilities, and if necessary, increased grants, should be given to people who have the enterprise and the courage to install water under those schemes.</P>
    <P>With regard to town planning, I have been to the Department several times trying to get a decision on certain points and I found it nearly impossible. If a man thinks of changing his business or erecting a petrol pump, it takes six or 12 months to get a decision as to whether or not he will be granted permission to erect a petrol pump in a certain position in front of his premises.  There is no point in that long delay of six or 12 months.  People say that Governments always take a long time to decide anything, but there should be some way by which a decision could be made within at least three months.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Healy, I welcome the grant for swimming pools.  People in the country took it&mdash;and I heard it said at meetings&mdash;that the grant would be 60 per cent., but tonight the Minister has piped down and said the grant will be 50 per cent., and in exceptional cases, 60 per cent.  I hope the Minister will facilitate these people who are thinking of the good of their fellow citizens in providing facilities such as swimming pools.  I hope the Minister will not go back on his original statement that the grant will be 60 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies this afternoon referred to the fact that there has been a serious <Col N="125" /> falling off in the building of local authority houses in recent years.  The Minister appears to draw some solace from the fact that there is some slight improvement to report in comparison with last year, but the House must recall that the figures for last year and the year before were extremely low.</P>
      <P>It has been said in other places&mdash;and it does not bear close examination&mdash; that our housing needs have been pretty well satisfied, outside the major centres of population.  As Deputy Crotty has just remarked, there is no doubt that the problem has been eased not by the erection of houses but by the emigration of families.  We all know that in Ballyfermot at one period as many as 400 houses were vacant. They were abandoned by their occupants who had left the country.  In that situation, there is no doubt the demand for houses was considerably eased.</P>
      <P>In the rural towns as well as the cities, and in the rural areas, many people are clamouring to their public representatives for advice and assistance to procure a home.  We know of many young couples desiring to establish a home who are awaiting the possibility of securing a home before entering into the married state.  Apart from that, we know of the very serious conditions in which many young children are being reared in some condemned houses.  While that situation exists, we cannot ease up on the housing drive.  Last year, the Minister circulated a letter to local authorities indicating his desire that they should forge ahead with their proposals, but it has been our experience since then that there has been no dramatic improvement in the facility with which sanction has been procured for the erection of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Minister refers to advances under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I was a member of a small committee appointed from Cork County Council to examine this matter.  We recommended to the Minister that the ceiling should be raised. I am glad the Minister has done so in relation to incomes, which are now increased from £832 per annum to £1,040, but it is astonishing that the <Col N="126" /> Minister completely ignored the recommendations in relation to increasing the ceiling limitation on farm valuations. In that respect, he has left the level unchanged.  The increase in cash incomes was reasonable, but I should like the Minister in reply to explain why he did not raise the ceiling in regard to the limitation on the poor law valuation of farmers seeking assistance under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  That was the point I wished particularly to raise with regard to S.D.A. loans.</P>
    <P>The emphasis we have given down the years by way of 100 per cent. recoupment to local authorities in respect of main roads has served a good purpose, but we cannot forget the people who have to live, work and travel on the terrible bye-roads that still exist in the country.  We know progress has been made but it has not been made as rapidly as we would wish.  These people are being asked by all parties to increase their production.  They are told about the importance of their industry, but it is frustrating for them to find that the conditions of the roads are such that they have to suffer additional expenditure beyond their neighbours in the towns and villages and on the side of the main roads in respect of the vehicles they use to bring their produce to the market, to bring their milk to the creameries or to bring their families to Mass, to town or to school.</P>
    <P>There is also the movement for the improvement of roads, which have not yet been classified as local authority roads, under the assistance given by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Throughout the country many hundreds of people are co-operating to get the roads servicing their homesteads improved through that means.  We know where money was expended in the past on these roads that deterioration occurs with usage on them and that, after the elapse of a few years, their condition is no much better than before the money was expended on improving them.  It is vital that there would be proper liaison between the local authorities, the Department of Local Government, the Special Employment <Col N="127" /> Schemes Office and the people who succeed in bringing such roads up to standard.  There is continual pressure on local authorities to take responsibility for such roads, but due to the charge which would be incurred in bringing these roads up to standard, only an infinitesimal number of them have been accepted by local authorities for maintenance.</P>
    <P>Where roads have been brought up to standard, the Special Employment Schemes Office should notify the Department of Local Government. We have an arrangement in Cork now whereby that is done.  We believe we can reasonably maintain such roads at no great additional cost inasmuch as they have been brought up to the required standard by the combined grants from the Special Employment Schemes Office and the local contribution of the people living on the roads.  If the possibility of the local authority being subsequently responsible for the maintenance of the roads were held out to them, more people would contribute to the improvement of such roads.  At the moment it appears to be rather optional, but the lead should be given by the Minister, in collaboration with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, to see to it that these roads were maintained once they were brought up to standard thus ensuring that the Department would not be called upon to rehabilitate roads which had deteriorated because of usage.</P>
    <P>I do not see any provision in this Estimate for the considerable sum of compensation which Cork County Council will seek from the Minister if the process of elimination of the railways in the county is proceeded with. Possibly, the reason there is no provision this year is that the Government were of opinion that the legal action which has yet to be heard in relation to the closure of the West Cork line will fail, that they believe they are on a sticky wicket and that as a result of these proceedings there may be no demand for the huge amount of compensation sought to compensate the county of Cork for <Col N="128" /> additional traffic the roads will have to bear in consequence of the transfer of such a formidable amount of traffic from railway to road.</P>
    <P>We are strengthened in our claim by adverting to the comparable amount of compensation which has been made available, particularly in Donegal where compensation was made to the local authority to permit it to bring the roads up to the standard where they would be capable of carrying the volume of vehicle and additional traffic they had to carry in consequence of the closure of the railway line.  Those of us who travel the roads between Bantry and the city of Cork since the transfer of traffic from railway to road are only too conversant with the necessity for the elimination of bridges, bad turns, the improvement of the foundations of many of these roads to carry these huge vehicles, the difficulty of traversing these roads and the huge transport vehicles which make travel extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>As outlined by the Cork County Engineer, it will be necessary to expend a very considerable amount of money on the improvement of these roads so they can carry this traffic if and when the case is resolved in relation to the challenge by the people of West Cork in an effort to prevent C.I.E. from proceeding with this policy of transferring so much traffic on to the roads.  I regret if the Government feel they will come out winners in this effort and, therefore, did not include any sum.  On the other hand, if it is the belief of the Government that it may not be necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, Sir.  The consequence of the closure has been that much traffic that formerly traversed these main roads has been diverted to alternative roads; and even those roads which had not much traffic on them up to recent months have now to carry many vehicles forced off the main roads because of the difficulty of getting to their destination and because of the increased dangers on the main roads.  It is from that point of view we feel in County Cork that there should be special consideration for the problem existing there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> There is one other point to which I wish to refer, and I do not make any apology for being repetitive in referring to it.  Even within recent weeks land owners have approached me on a deputation regarding the flooding of their land consequent on the silting and development of overgrowth on small rivers.  The local authority is also seriously affected because roadways are flooded by this river.  There is one objector to this drainage under the land project.  To my knowledge there was only one scheme and there is only one scheme in existence which gives power to go in and clean such a river or such a stream irrespective of objections from local land owners, and that was the Local Authorities (Works) Acts.</P>
    <P>That scheme, we understand, is in a state of suspension.  There is no money voted in this Estimate for resuming operations under that scheme and I do make the earnest appeal to the Minister, now that some time has elapsed since the scheme was suspended, that there must be a good case for resuming the works under it when Deputies, members of local authorities of all Parties, including the Government Party Deputies, are so vehement at local authority level in relation to resuming the works under the Local Authorities (Works) Acts.</P>
    <P>Far from there being a saving to the Exchequer, as we were told at the time, we had to find unemployment assistance for many of the workers who were engaged in such work. However, I am not referring to it as the useful source of employment which that scheme presented but as a necessity in relation to the abatement of the flooding problems that exist in regard to very many rivers and streams consequent on the complete elimination of the operations under that scheme.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have to find an increased amount of money to meet many commitments today.  We know that general taxation has increased but I doubt if there is any impact bearing as heavily on our people as the burden of rates which at the moment are being collected by local <Col N="131" /> authorities.  It is quite some time since the Party which is now in Government advanced the view from these benches that local taxation had reached the point beyond which the people could not meet the bill.  Some years have passed since then but with each year we have growing demands on the ratepayers to meet the increasing bills presented at local authority level.</P>
    <P>Very many ratepayers believe that the local authorities are being called upon to pay many expenses that should be borne by the Exchequer. There was quite some interest in a recent announcement that somebody or other was going to undertake an examination of local taxation.  That is very desirable.  Many people are looking to this body for relief when it reports, relief from the burden they have to carry today by way of rate demands. Those of us who are on local authorities, some of us for the first time, know of the very many worth-while schemes that could be implemented if we had the money to pay the piper. We are restricted in the operation of these necessary schemes because we realise we cannot overburden the ratepayers.  We find it frustrating that charges are loaded upon the ratepayer in connection with very heavy expenses under health legislation, which preclude councils from embarking upon many other schemes because they feel they cannot add to the load the ratepayer has to meet.</P>
    <P>There has been close examination by many councils of the question as to how the collecting authorities could ease the burden on the people who have to pay this sum which has been increasing with such rapidity.  One of the big questions which have been concerning local authorities in recent times has been the Minister's examination of the problems that have to be met in the improvement of the supply of water to those people resident in rural parts.  With the near completion of rural electrification, there is no doubt that the provision of adequate water supplies is the major need of the people in the rural areas.  The Minister's proposals disrupt the work <Col N="132" /> of local authorities to some extent, because of the formidable surveys having to be made to make an appropriate assessment of the needs of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the scheme costing £2.06 million in my own constituency of North Cork which extends over into the former adjacent constituency of East Cork, entailing a gross expenditure of about 3/- in the £.  Very much of this area is a type of limestone land where it would be impossible for the residents to secure water from the sinking of wells adjacent to their homes and they have been precluded from availing of the water supply scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture.  I readily admit there is no solution to the problem of making adequate water supplies available in such areas other than giving people access to regional piped supplies.  However, in a country with the rainfall we have and where we have had such success in the provision of individual supplies to so many farms throughout the country, we should proceed with that scheme without overlapping it with the suggested piped supply.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of a piped supply where it is practicable and where the other supply is not to be secured, but many people, by their own industry, have availed of the grants for the provision of water supplies to their own homes, have paid 50 per cent. of the cost from their own pockets, have secured the State grant in respect of the other 50 per cent. and are pleased with the result.  I do not know of any other Department's assistance which is forthcoming for any aspect of development which is regarded as being so successful as the water supply scheme.</P>
    <P>It would be grossly unfair to require those people to pay this service of the loan to provide piped water supplies, to pay a third time.  It was desirable to continue the existing scheme and provide the piped water supplies where sunken wells could not operate.  The group scheme is working well where it has been organised but we should be circumspect in embarking on an extremely expensive, diversified scheme such as was originally presented but <Col N="133" /> which, may I say without being facetious, was watered down quite considerably by the Minister since his first launching of this proposal.  I consider that the servicing of such piped water supplies would be extremely difficult and expensive.</P>
    <P>The water rate necessary to meet the cost of maintenance and provision of supply could entail a considerable burden on those availing of the scheme. Whatever is proposed in relation to the provision of this scheme in areas where the normal pump sinking is not adequate, I think nothing should be done to divert people from the efforts they may embark upon in relation to the provision of individual supplies for themselves in their own farms.  With the increase in usage of heavy machinery and the cost of making connections to the remote farmsteads, far remote from the areas that one would expect these piped supplies to traverse, there is no doubt that the number that could possibly avail of the facilities from piped supplies would not be near so great as that envisaged in the Minister's proposals.  We should content ourselves with the utmost encouragement for the continuation of existing schemes in relation to individual grants for the provision of water, particularly to farmers.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the encouragement given for the provision of swimming pools.  I agree with Deputies Healy, Crotty and others who say that this represents to us in Ireland one of the very great backlogs in development that we have.  Anything that could assist local groups and local authorities in the development of proper swimming pools, particularly inland, should be availed of.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to something discussed quite recently at local authority level in my own county. That was that with the increase in the number of vehicles now on the roads, there are serious crowding and parking difficulties at very many seaside resorts. Some attention should be given to the provision of adequate parking at our seaside resorts because, during the fine weekends we have fortunately experienced recently, the confusion was incredible at the many places where in <Col N="134" /> former years one could easily procure a quiet location.  It is something which I feel would be very helpful if that problem could be abated by the provision of adequate parking at such places.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to repeat myself, my final duty is to make yet another appeal to the Minister to resume the operations of the Local Authority (Works) Act.  I think I am not being unfair in saying that I am speaking for very many of the Deputies who support the Government as well as Deputies of my own Party in asking the Minister to review his decision not to resume operations under that scheme.  The work is there to be done.  The men are there to do it.  It is a scheme that will assist many people to overcome the legal difficulties in many instances and the physical difficulties in others.  It is something that would be well worth a trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is natural, when dealing with local Government, that our first remarks should be confined to the problem of housing.  It seems that we and the people as a whole are expected to be convinced by the Minister for Local Government that the housing problem is really solved.  I believe it is about time that we face <Col N="136" /> the problem regarding housing and admit that it is anything near being solved.</P>
      <P>It is an extraordinary situation if we look back over the years.  In 1948 the local authorities were encouraged to build houses.  So we did in every county of the Twenty-Six, thanks be to God, but the hands of the local authorities, their officials and members were then free to allow them to face the problem of providing decent homes for the people in their areas. As the years moved on, we arrived at the extraordinary situation where the Department and the Minister for Local Government are a real hindrance to the progressive views and desires of the staff and the members of many local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary.  The unfortunate man, without a decent home, applies to become a tenant of a local authority cottage.  First he must pass the local test.  The county housing superintendent will report on his housing conditions.  The county medical officer of health will do likewise. The engineers will be brought into it.  Then he must go through a further test.  Will he be passed by the Department of Local Government under the presidency, as it were, of the Minister?</P>
      <P>Surely, if any Minister for Local Government insists that the reports of the responsible officials in a local government area are in themselves not sufficient, that must cast a reflection on local authority members and on the staffs?  A few months ago, we heard the Minister object to members speaking of officials in local authorities.  Now it is my turn to draw attention to the fact that officials are being castigated, because of the efforts by local authorities to rehouse people, by none other than the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is about time the Minister realised that local authorities have, on the whole, been prepared to meet their responsibilities in a fair way. It is about time they were given a little freer hand in trying to rehouse these unfortunate people rather than be stymied by the Minister.  Yes, I know what I am speaking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> I know of many instances where honourable men, members of the staff of the Department of Local Government, because they were instructed to do so, had to go down the country and examine and re-examine the applications of people who by now should be housed by the local authorities but, because of the policy of the Local Government Minister, are held up.  It is about time that stopped.  People may wish for a change of Government. Parties may differ.  Different Parties may believe their policy should be the one in operation.</P>
    <P>The one policy connected with the Fianna Fáil Government I strongly condemn is the policy on local government which is the greatest hindrance I know in South Cork to the building of the many homes we wish had been built long before now.  I will go further I am sorry the Minister for Local Government is not here now but perhaps my remarks may be conveyed to him.</P>
    <P>Schemes submitted by the Cork County Council, Southern Committee, for the building of a cheaper type of cottage were held in the Department for 18 long months.  All the queries that came to the surface were amazing.  As soon as some objections were dealt with by the responsible county architect, who got his position because of his high qualifications, some further miserable, petty objections were raised.</P>
    <P>It was over 18 months before they could give sanction.  Then, when a few of these houses were built, when it was shown they were built at lower cost than the conventional type, when it was proved they were a superior type of house, we had many officials from the Department of Local Government and many officials from all parts of the country coming to see these houses.  What an awful pity that sanction was not given earlier for the building of this new type of house?</P>
    <P>It is about time some of the petty objections were ended.  God be with the time when a man believed that, as Minister for Local Government, he was the boss there.  God be with the time when a Minister for Local Government, <Col N="138" /> the late T.J. Murphy, God rest his soul, not alone was Minister for Local Government in name but was also so by his actions.</P>
    <P>At present, again, there are requests from the South Cork County Council area for sanction for the acquisition of sites for building&mdash;compulsory purchase orders.  What has happened? Why are they in the Custom House for so long?  Is anything being done about them?  Does the Minister realise that the applications sent up in these instances deal with the problem of people without decent homes?  What pleasure is there in holding these applications for such a long period and doing nothing about them?  It is about time something were done about them.</P>
    <P>It is about time the Minister for Local Government understood that these applications are not made in a frivolous manner.  A little speed is needed in his Department to deal with the problem of housing.  I am sure what applies in South Cork must equally apply in many other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Then we have the problem of reconstruction grants.  Over the years, different Governments have seen fit, in so far as they could do so financially, to encourage people to carry out reconstruction work.  A fair amount of work has been done by the grants availed of through the Department and through the local authority.  An extraordinary situation now seems to emerge again.  It did arise some years back.  There was a little easement in it but now we are at the stage of applications being in the Department for months without being cleared.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to blame any official in the Department in the Custom House who is dealing with reconstruction. I should say here and now, wishing to have it on the record, that my experience of these officials is that they are most helpful and most anxious to be of assistance in every way possible. However, the bottleneck in connection with reconstruction is again a problem for the Minister for Local Government.  Why not have enough inspectors?</P>
    <P>The application, when received in <Col N="139" /> the Department, is sent down to the local inspector and then, as I know to my grief in many cases I have been dealing with, it is many months before it is cleared by him.  It may not be his fault and I know of cases where it was not the inspector's fault.  It was simply a case of the Minister demanding of an inspector in some areas far more returns than any one man could give in a fair time.</P>
    <P>Nobody should know better than the Minister that if he is desirous of speeding up these reconstruction grants, he will have to put on the field sufficient inspectors to deal with the original applications and with the final clearance of the application for grant.  That is essential.  Very many applications are made at a time when the applicants hope to get the work done during the spring and summer months.  Unfortunately, from their experience, by applying in the spring they have as little hope of doing any reconstruction in the summer period as they would if they applied at the start of June and July.  It is unreasonable to expect these people to wait so long.</P>
    <P>Naturally enough, costs are bound to increase when it comes to the period of the year, from October, for building work.  There is another angle to the reconstruction problem.  I have in mind the case of an unfortunate woman who carried out work which, as far as she knew, was to the satisfaction of the inspector.  There was one problem which the inspector could not straighten out without the woman carrying out extra work.  That work was done and he informed the Department that the work was done.  She then expected that she would get the grant from the Department to which she was entitled but, strangely enough, another report came in pointing out that there was further work to be done before she could get the grant.  That happened a third time.</P>
    <P>From my inquiries I discovered that in that area the Minister for Local Government, over a short period of time, had three different inspectors. The result was that the approach of one man varied from that of the man before him.  The approach of the <Col N="140" /> third man varied from the approaches of the first two.  The third man pointed out that there were a few window fasteners missing and also a sash cord in a window.  Surely we must have some regularity in inspections. The tragedy in this case is that the woman, in order to meet her commitments to the builder, had to borrow the money from the bank. Then we are told of the benefits of the grants from the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that the problem of inspections should be completely overhauled, that sufficient inspectors be provided, and also that inspections should be based on some recognised standard.  We should not have each man varying his inspections according to what he may wish. Adequate allowances should also be made in the case of the valuation of the costing of the work of reconstruction. I know that there are no cases in which the estimate of the Department will compare favourably with the estimate supplied by contractors to a would-be applicant for a reconstruction grant.  Of course the Department of Local Government is gaining by this.  The person may have to spend £500 on reconstruction and cannot have the amount reduced by one penny under that amount, but the inspector, on behalf of the Minister, in his valuation of that work may assess it as roughly £360 or £370.  Of course the Local Government reconstruction grant is based then on the lower valuation of the work being done by the applicant.</P>
    <P>Again, there is another joke in connection with reconstruction.  When he is submitting the original application, the applicant must also get a form signed by the local authority to verify that the house is fit for reconstruction.  What a waste of time! Where would you find a man or woman in the Twenty-Six Counties who would be lunatic enough to spend money&mdash;because they have to provide their own share&mdash;for the reconstruction of a house if it is not suitable for reconstruction?  It is a waste of time and money to require local authorities to have their <Col N="141" /> engineers inspect such houses and verify them as being fit for reconstruction. There is, of course, this other fly in the ointment.  It is the case of a person applying for a new home, who is living in bad housing conditions, and who is told through the Minister for Local Government that the house is fit for repair.  That of course would mean there would be no new home for that person.  In many instances the landlord will not repair such a house.</P>
    <P>I have in mind some cases of men living in houses belonging to farmers, but not working for the farmers in question.  In one case, when a man applied for a cottage, the house was not condemned because the engineer's report was that the house could be repaired.  Certainly the house would be fit for repair at a cost of £300, or perhaps more, but nobody could compel the owner to repair that house.  I know the Minister can say that the local authority can do it and that the law provides that the local authority can arrange to get the rent from that tenant until the cost is cleared.  That may appear well on paper but it does not work out in practice.</P>
    <P>All that the farmer has to do, after the house has been repaired, is to tell the tenant that he wants the house for a workman working for him. Then the unfortunate man is out on the road.  I believe where local government is concerned the first important item to be dealt with is housing.  As I said, it is far from being clear in South Cork and I am sure in many other areas.  There is no use in the Minister for Local Government issuing statements saying that the housing problem has nearly been dealt with while we are still in the midst of this problem and while we still have the acute problem of young people who want to get married and for whom there are no homes.  Instead of spending money in other ways we should realise that far more money could be utilised to the benefit of our people in rural Ireland as well as urban Ireland if the Minister would endeavour to solve these problems as regards the housing of these people.</P>
    <P>There is another problem and I do not know how far the Minister can <Col N="142" /> go to solve it.  It is of the utmost importance to many cottage tenants. This is the problem of tenants of vested cottages.  Originally when these people became vested tenants it cost the local authority the very large sum of approximately 10/- to have the cottage registered in the tenant's name.  With the death of the tenant, be he farm worker or road worker, while there is no difficulty as regards the transfer of the cottage to the next of kin, whether it be his widow, son or daughter, there is great difficulty as regards the legal fees.</P>
    <P>I have come across cases where the cost was anything up to £15.  Such a sum is far beyond the means of a son, daughter or widow of a farm worker or a road worker.  I am convinced, if it only cost 10/- in the first instance to have the cottage registered in the name of the original tenant, that these legal fees could be avoided if the Minister for Local Government would examine the situation.  It is one problem that is affecting a large number of people.  It is one problem that will ultimately create many more difficulties because these people will not be able to have the cottages legally vested in them on transfer and, in years to come, there will probably be more trouble and more difficulty in relation to the legal ownership of council cottages and houses than there will be in any other sphere of activity of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Many members of the Minister's own Party have expressed their view on this matter at meetings of the Southern Committee of the county councils.  I would ask the Minister to investigate the position to see if there is any way in which clearance could be given by the Minister to local authorities to deal with the second transfer in the same way as they deal with the first registration.  I am not, of course, advocating any financial benefit for people who might wish to transfer solely for the purpose of selling the cottages and making a big profit.  All I ask is that in a genuine transfer from the original tenant to a member of his family something will be done to relieve him of these financial burdens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> There is an extraordinary situation arising month after month in relation to the vesting of cottages.  So far as repairs are concerned there is a conflict between the local authority engineers and members and secondly, between the Minister and his Department, the engineers and the members, in the matter of sufficient or insufficient repairs.  I have seen cottages repaired, prepared for vesting, the tenants appealing to the Minister, an inspector coming down, reports being made, and then the cottage is vested without being put into proper repair.</P>
    <P>I have condemned that practice, I believe rightly so, at meetings of the local authority and I have condemned local officials for their irresponsibility. I now bring the matter home to the Minister.  The inspectors from his Department seem to close their eyes to the necessity for adequate repairs being carried out before these cottages are vested.  In many cases, the tenant is an unfortunate old man or old woman who knows little or nothing about the necessary repairs, until he or she is informed the cottage is vested and he or she will henceforth be responsible for all repairs.  Six months later, they find to their dismay that the cottages are in such a condition that they are faced with a bill they can never hope to meet.  I have seen cottages where slates were loose, where the local engineers refused to repair, where the Minister's inspector passed them as all right.  A few months after, the loose slates had fallen off, and more slates with them.</P>
    <P>Many members of the Minister's Party, particularly the chairman of the Southern Committee&mdash;he is now interested in another part of the county&mdash;can give the Minister the facts about an old lady who has been before the Southern Committee in the past few months begging for some assistance for repairs to be carried out to her cottage near the village of Carrignavar. The Minister has not yet given clearance because, in this instance, as in many other instances, an inspector inspected the cottage and informed the Department that a certain amount of work had to be done.  That work may be done, but what proof has the <Col N="144" /> Minister afterwards that the work has been carried out?</P>
    <P>If the Minister, on the recommendation of his inspector, notifies the council of the necessity for carrying out certain work, surely the onus is on the Minister to see that the work is carried out properly to the benefit of the tenant.  The Minister tells the local authority to do a certain amount of work.  After that, the Minister knows no more.  He assumes the local authority will do the work.  It is most unfair to tenants that they should become vested owners of cottages which are not in a proper state of repair and which subsequently cost the tenants a great deal of money to put into proper repair.</P>
    <P>With regard to roads, a great deal of money is being spent on roads and credit is due to all concerned for the many improvements made.  Sometimes I wonder why our roads are finished in the way they are?  I wonder if we will be safe on some of our roads.  After a few showers, some roads are turned almost into skating rinks.  The surface is highly dangerous.  If some crude oil from diesel lorries is deposited on the surface or there are a few showers after a long spell of dry weather, the most extraordinary skids occur.  There is no reason why we should turn our roads into glassed-topped tables.</P>
    <P>There is then the employment content in work on the roads.  Some years ago, men employed on the roads were very happy.  They knew their job would last for nine, ten or 11 months of the year.  That has all changed.  Over a number of years now, I have seen men starting work in April.  When it comes to August, it is one week in two or three for them.  That is unfair.  It is a denial of their rights because they are being denied the benefits of the superannuation scheme under which they need approximately 90 days' work in the year.  It was difficult enough to get that Bill passed here.  Only for the hard work put into it, there would have been no results.  That Bill is now on the statute book.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand a policy which denies these men the benefit of a pension <Col N="145" /> because they are denied a sufficient number of days' work to qualify for that pension.  The Minister may say that is a matter for the local authority.  I say it is not.  I have yet to see any application from Cork &mdash;I cannot speak for other counties&mdash; for the purchase of additional machinery turned down by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Back in 1953, I considered it my duty to speak about this to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Local Government.  That drew attention to the fact that even then we were approaching the stage of automation in local authority road work.  We have gone from bad to worse and now in County Cork we are paying £6 or £6 10s. a day to a man with a tractor, with a red flag in front and another behind, to cut the grass on the brow of the dykes on the road.  At one time, when a couple of men were employed on that work, at least they gave a fair return and the money they earned helped to provide the necessaries of life for a couple of families.  Now, machinery is employed on many of these jobs and a few men are engaged to attend the machines.  That is the result of this mad desire by local authorities, encouraged by the Minister for Local Government, to employ machinery. That has not arisen within the last three or four years.  The practice existed even before that.  For the last three or four years local authorities have known that they would never be refused sanction for thousands of pounds for machinery.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of machinery is necessary but it is the excessive use of machinery, amounting to almost complete automation, on county council roads, that is creating a bad situation for many families by the fact that the wage earner is unemployed from the month of August on and has to sign for the dole for another two weeks or so and is informed at the end of the year that because he had not a sufficient number of days' employment he is without the benefit of the Act for that year again.  The result in County Cork is more unemployment for men in rural areas, more <Col N="146" /> employment and greater profit for the owners of machinery and, for the men, ultimately emigration.  That is a problem we are facing in many areas in South Cork.  The local farmers who employ, perhaps, one or two men constantly, are not looking for outside help.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage, if the Minister for Local Government had a thorough investigation of the amount of money being spent by local authorities on the provision of machinery or the hire of machinery for road work, instead of holding up the building of cottages in many of these areas, it would be better for himself and better for South Cork.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the work carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The discontinuance of that important work is deplorable.  I took a natural pride in the fact that the man who instituted that scheme and got it passed by Dáil Éireann had his roots in rural Ireland, who knew the problem of people whose land was inundated with water, who realised that by encouraging local authorities by this important Act much valuable work could be done for the benefit of land owners, the general public and those seeking employment.</P>
    <P>For some years past works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act were discontinued.  The Minister, within the last 12 months, did say that any local authority may carry out such work.  We know they could, provided they put up 100 per cent. of the cost.  I ask Deputies to consider the amount of work given under this important heading, the results of which are known to everyone in County Cork.  There was no justification for the discontinuance of that important work.  If the Minister desires to improve the employment situation in County Cork for road workers, one valuable way of doing so is to reintroduce schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act which will also have the effect of improving many areas still awaiting drainage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> Deputy O'Sullivan and others mentioned the proposals for swimming pools.  As I said yesterday at a local authority meeting, it is all very fine for members of local authorities to ask for reports from their engineers.  I often wonder how long we can continue to fool the public in regard to the provision of swimming pools.  When are we going to tell them about the cost? The Minister issued a circular to all local authorities.  Were any figures submitted as regards the approximate cost?  We know the difficulty local authorities have in meeting their commitments and collecting the rates.  It is incumbent on the Minister to give some idea of the cost of providing swimming pools.  He did say in the circular that indoor baths would be very expensive.  We know that, but I also believe that outdoor baths would be very expensive.  I am not opposing it on the basis of cost.  I am anxious to know how we can meet the cost even with the proposals of the Minister to meet some of the cost through the Department.</P>
    <P>What I am most anxious about is the location of these swimming pools. Some members of the local authority pointed out at the meeting yesterday the necessity for swimming pools in seaside resorts.  I come from a seaside area.  I have lived all my life by the broad Atlantic but I maintain that we must provide swimming pools, first of all, in inland areas where the people have not the benefit of natural swimming facilities.  The Minister could help by giving guidance or suggestions to local authorities that in preparing such schemes they should concentrate first on the provision of swimming pools in inland areas far removed from seaside resorts.  We want to see our seaside resorts improved but it is of equal importance to afford to people in inland areas the benefits which they could have by the provision of swimming pools.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not go far enough in this circular to local authorities.  He did not point out the importance of starting in inland areas first.  It will take years before this problem can be <Col N="148" /> solved or nearly solved.  It is important, therefore, to start with the inland areas.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question about which we have heard so much for a long time back, the question of piped water supplies.  I am all for it, but I am all for telling the public the truth about it.  I remember a few months ago when we were expecting information at a meeting of the local authority about the programme of piped water supplies for South Cork. We could not get any information because, as the manager rightly explained, it would take the engineer in charge a long time to provide or prepare a report dealing with South Cork, and that was only part of the county.  It was pointed out how long it would take to get the necessary information and to have it documented, prepared and presented for a meeting of the members.</P>
    <P>While we were waiting for that information, and while we were satisfied that the delay was not caused by any official, the Minister was in a famous building in Dublin telling all and sundry who came on excursions to Dublin about the piped water supply campaign.  Among the exhibits was a large map of the whole of South Cork with every house and cottage, with a line drawn from one to the other illustrating the piped water supply plan, at a time when the local authority knew nothing about it.</P>
    <P>Surely we must start at the beginning and end at the end.  Surely we must give up this window-dressing of getting the people to believe: &ldquo;We have something wonderful in the Mansion House in Dublin,&rdquo; while we are still waiting for the preliminary reports in South Cork.  I do not know if that applied to all the local authorities, but certainly there was a map of South Cork when we were still at the stage of planning.  What was not explained to the people is something I think the people should know, that is, how long they may be waiting before they get a piped water supply.</P>
    <P>When these proposals were adumbrated and published by the Minister, <Col N="149" /> the people in the different areas were charmed and they got the impression that in a short time they would have no trouble except to turn on a tap.  While that would apply to some people who can afford to avail of the grants to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred, I am concerned with the thousands of families who can never afford to avail of such grants.  I told those people&mdash;and I think I told them the truth&mdash;that a tapped water supply in the rural areas will be something like the E.S.B. in the 1930's, roughly, when they started lighting up some villages, but many villages have yet to get rural electrification. I believe water in the tap will be the same.  Perhaps in a year or two some villages will get it, and perhaps in 30 years, many of them will be still without it.</P>
    <P>The southern committee of the council in Cork have offered to do their share.  I was a party to agreeing to provide £200,000 during the next five years as part of a plan, the cost of which we do not know at this stage.  I am taking a chance.  I believe that even if it is an imposition on the rates, it is our duty and the duty of everyone who carries responsibility to help his neighbour to get this amenity.  We are as far from knowing the ultimate cost or anything like it as we were at the introduction of the Health Bill in the 1952-53 period.</P>
    <P>I consider, therefore, that it should be made known to the people.  I read articles in a certain Sunday newspaper, Sunday after Sunday, by men in different spheres of life&mdash;professional men, county managers and other people&mdash;expressing their views.  With one or two exceptions, I found they all took the line of encouraging the people to believe that there would be water in the taps in a very short time.  I consider that the truth is essential.  A Minister should tell the truth, no matter what Government may be in power, whether it be Fianna Fáil or any other Government. I believe the truth is that in 30 years' time many a village in rural Ireland will still be looking for a piped water supply.</P>
    <P>We are still suffering in local government from the bugbear of the power of <Col N="150" /> the few while we know so much is the responsibility of the many.  For many years, of course, certain associations were illegal and in correspondence and discussions with the Minister on many occasions I pointed that out.  Of course we know what brought it around to the point where they were brought to the stage of being made legal.  We know what happened when they got negotiating licences.  The Minister is a member of a local authority and the people in Donegal are now having the experience which we have had.  The managerial system, I hold, to a certain degree can give benefits where we get co-operation between managers, officials and members, but we have come to the stage where the local authorities are, as it were, the preserves of the county managers.  That does not lead to the healthy co-operation we would all wish for.</P>
    <P>I know that men of different political Parties and opinions are anxious to bale out from membership of local authorities because they find so often that they are nothing more than rubber stamps in the hands of the county managers.  County managers should in their own way be county co-operators. Where the county manager is prepared to trample not only on the views but on every angle of responsibility that should be the responsibility of members, we have reached a situation at which the local authorities and local government cannot thrive in the manner we would wish in these areas.</P>
    <P>These remarks are based on hard experience and they represent the views of members of the Minister's Party as well as those of members of the Labour Party.  I would say to the Minister that, first of all, they should not have got negotiating licences.  Secondly they should have no right to go to the Custom House, have discussions with the Minister and decide among themselves what line they will take, and have the proposals of one county manager put into operation in other counties as well.  That will not help us, and if it continues, the day will come when either local government, as we know it in these areas, will be a complete failure and fiasco, in the hands of <Col N="151" /> local dictators, or the local dictators will have to move with the stream.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to contribute very much to this debate beyond saying that the Vote for the Department of Local Government, next to the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, is considered as being of the greatest possible concern to rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to the housing situation.  It is only right that in this annual review of the working of the Department of Local Government, we should make it known that the housing position is far from satisfactory.  Most of the Deputies associated with local authorities are very familiar with the many difficulties with which local authorities are faced in regard to housing.  I feel it is the bounden duty of the State to see that all its citizens are entirely properly and conveniently housed.  In many parts of rural Ireland today, there are numerous families who are not yet housed.</P>
      <P>Many families who have been waiting for a house for many years have been unsuccessful in obtaining proper housing accommodation.  There is a large number of families living either in the upstairs rooms of tenement houses or in slums.  While there has been a very great measure of progress in regard to housing our people, much remains to be done.  One would expect that the Government would have shown more concern, more drive, more interest and more energy in seeing to it that the housing position was solved to the satisfaction of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great drawbacks in regard to housing is the question of rents.  In areas where the local authorities believed the working class people were in need of housing and provided such houses, the tenants were unable to avail of them because they could not pay the rents.  We have had many cases of that all over the country.  I have often wondered why it is not possible to build a house which could be let to the ordinary working man in receipt of from £5.10s. to £6.10s. a week at a rent of 12/- a week.  I know many <Col N="152" /> workers who have to pay £1 or 25/- a week.  In many instances when they have periods of unemployment, either through sickness or shortage of work, and have to resort to social welfare benefits, they find that if they allow their rents to get into arrears, when they resume work again it is impossible for them to clear up their rent account.</P>
    <P>I have known many cases in which tenants have applied for transfers from dear houses to cheaper houses.  The managers have been sympathetic in many cases but they say it is not the practice to allow such transfers and they do not want to create a precedent. I would ask the Minister to request county managers to be generous and considerate in dealing with such applications. I could never understand why it was not possible for this or any other Government to provide small, attractive and cheap houses, with two little rooms and a kitchen, for old age pensioners, widows, and people who have no dependants.  I know it is the first duty of the Department to provide houses for married people, particularly those with large families.  But there are many old age pensioners whose families have left them.  We know from experience that the old people do not like to be living with married sons or daughters who have their own families.</P>
    <P>I often wonder why it would not be possible for every local authority, with special aid from the Department of Local Government, to provide in each urban area a number of neat, attractive houses in which the old people could end their days in happiness and comfort.  I know of many cases in which the parents have been left lonely and have to depend on very limited means, in many cases only the old age pensions.  People may say it is no use providing homes for those people but they are just as much entitled to a home as anyone else.  As an experiment the Department should seriously consider having special housing schemes in each urban area, for which special grants would be made available even on a limited scale, to provide houses for old age pensioners and widows and those unable to qualify for the ordinary dear houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the deplorable housing position in the towns of Tullamore, Birr, Portarlington and Edenderry.  A number of houses were recently erected in Edenderry, but there are not applicants for even a quarter of the houses provided.  Those of us who represent that constituency know from the volume of calls and correspondence we have that there is a demand for houses in Edenderry.  The Department should give special consideration to large urban areas like Birr and Tullamore and see to it that the local authority is helped in every way.  The present housing subsidy is insufficient to enable local authorities to erect houses and set them at a rent the tenants can pay.</P>
    <P>The whole housing policy of the Government should be brought into line with present day conditions.  It is entirely out of date.  Under the present housing regulations local authorities are unable to cope with the situation. If the Government want local authorities to build houses and set them at a reasonable rent, the least local authorities would expect from the Department is a generous measure of Government support.  The Department could do much more than they are doing.  The town of Portarlington is served by two local authorities, Leix County Council and Offaly County Council.  I know people who have been applicants for houses there for a number of years.  I know that in some council houses there are two or three families living together.  Such overcrowding is most undesirable.  I would ask the Department to make an examination of the housing situation in those two counties.</P>
    <P>Far greater progress could have been made in providing the people with houses.  Other Deputies referred to the housing of the small farmer. There are many small farmers throughout the country who have offered sites to the local authority to erect cottages but the local authority said it was not part of their functions to erect a cottage for a person with a valuation of £10 or £15.</P>

If I have a guarantee from the Minister that a local authority can erect a cottage for a person under £15 valuation, I shall be very pleased to make an announcement at the next meeting of my local authority and ask small farmers to come forward and offer sites.  Of course, the Minister knows he will not be in office by the time it comes up for sanction, but I will be very interested in the result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing of the small farmer is of the greatest importance in rural Ireland today.  The small farmer cannot be expected to erect a house for himself.  The reason you cannot expect him to erect the house for himself is that no house of any kind can be erected for less than £1,200.  It is more for an ordinary county council cottage at the present time.  When he applies for his grant he may not be successful in obtaining a small dwellings loan from the county council.  Where is he to meet the balance of the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There ought to be a special scheme for this purpose.  If the county councils have already declined to erect cottages for small farmers, why does the Minister not immediately send a circular to the local authorities saying he has had complaints from Deputies from rural Ireland to the effect that <Col N="155" /> small farmers are not being provided by the local authorities with houses, that a scheme should be initiated with the least possible delay and proposals furnished to him whereby the local authority will undertake to provide small farmers with houses?</P>
    <P>This is probably one of the greatest drawbacks in rural Ireland today, that small farmers, many of them living on holdings of under £15 valuation, live in the real old time mud-walled thatched house.  The day of the mud-walled thatched house is gone.  If local authorities have that power and authority it is the duty of the Minister to see they exercise it and to advise local authorities that a scheme should be formulated immediately to provide small farmers with houses and arrangements made forthwith to see that in all cases where such houses are required they will be provided.  The position in regard to housing is most unsatisfactory.  We are not ungrateful for or unmindful of all that has been done, but there is a great deal that remains to be done.  We have a long, winding and difficult road to travel before our entire housing needs are completed.</P>
    <P>I want to join with other Deputies in expressing my condemnation of the action of the Minister for Local Government and the Government as a whole in relation to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act was one of the greatest mediums for the provision of employment in rural Ireland.  Very valuable work was carried out under that Act and keen disappointment is now felt that local authorities are not empowered to continue works under that Act.  The value of the Local Authorities (Works) Act is only now being appreciated.  The great benefits which it bestowed on local authorities were only realised when this Government deprived the local authorities of those benefits.  I suppose it would be sufficient to say that the moment there is a change of Government one of the first steps of that Government will be the reintroduction of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I imagine Deputy O'Donnell, the former Minister <Col N="156" /> for Local Government, will agree with me in giving that undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We give that undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is two of you agree so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we agree, to the disappointment, disgust and probably to the shame of the Minister for Local Government.  We give that undertaking to all county council workers who are now out of work because of the non-functioning of that Act, to all members of local authorities and to the ratepayers who are now paying additional rates because of the lack of the generous State provision under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, that the moment the change of Government comes before the end of this year the Local Authorities (Works) Act will be functioning full steam ahead to carry out these works and to provide much needed additional employment in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>On an occasion such as this it is only right to make reference to certain kinds of roads.  Generous State grants have been provided for main roads.  We have been concentrating too much on the main roads which are being made speedways for rich men's high-powered cars and the sooner we realise that there are such things are culs-de-sac, county roads, by-roads and lanes, the better.  The big bulk of the rates comes from the culs-de-sac, from what are known as the non-scheduled roads, the laneways, the county roads and the by-roads.  The majority of ratepayers, and their children, those living down the culs-de-sac and other such places when they come out to go to the church or when the children are going to school in the wintertime are often knee deep in water.  Sometimes the children have to remain at home because of flooded lanes and county roads in wintertime.  I often wonder how they feel when they see tens of thousands of pounds being expended on main roads in order that the rich man may drive quicker and smoother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the duty of the State and of the Government to see to it that the culs-de-sac, by-roads and laneways are <Col N="157" /> properly maintained.  The many ratepayers living down culs-de-sac do not enjoy the steamrolled road or tarmacadam roads which are usually seen on the approach to all golf courses. Whether they are adjacent to the main road or off the main road, they are all tarmacadamed and properly steamrolled and in many instances have whitewashed cobblestones along them.</P>
    <P>This may be very amusing to the Minister but this is the very type of speech the Minister himself will be making in Donegal before the year is out.  The time has come when serious action should be taken to ensure that the people in the heart of the country, on the slopes of mountains and in the valleys are provided with proper ways of getting to town, of getting their children to school and getting to church on Sundays. In most parts of rural Ireland culs-de-sac have been completely neglected because too much attention has been paid to main roads.  Local authorities have not taken over sufficient culs-de-sac, laneways and by-roads because the Department of Local Government has not given the lead in affording assistance towards having them taken over and put into a proper state of repair.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to housing grants. I cannot say if other Deputies have criticised the administration of the reconstruction grants or the grants in connection with new houses, but I want to pay a very special tribute to the speed and efficiency of the section of the Minister's Department dealing with grants for new houses and with grants for reconstruction.  If every other section of the Local Government Department were as efficient as the housing section little difficulty would be experienced.</P>
    <P>It was said here that many complaints were made about delays.  If there are delays, it is because there are not sufficient inspectors in the Department to cope with the volume of work.  We know there are more people now availing of housing grants, more people building houses and more people seeking grants.  There is a greater demand upon the services of the Local Government Department in regard to housing activities.  I fail to <Col N="158" /> understand why that section of the Department is not staffed to a greater degree.  I trust that this will go on record.  While the Minister has many fine qualities, he is not noted for his courtesy.  That cannot be said about the officers of his Department, particularly the officers of the housing section.  Like a great many other Deputies, I have occasion to address communications to them very frequently and I have found nothing but the greatest courtesy, assistance, attention and speed in relation to reconstruction grants and grants for new houses.</P>
    <P>We do not expect the impossible to be done.  The impossible cannot be done with such a limited staff.  I would ask the Minister and the senior officers of his Department to see to it that if they want greater efficiency in that regard, they should increase the staff dealing with reconstruction grants.  I know that unavoidable delays may take place between the final inspection and payment.  The real fault is this matter of understaffing and I trust something will be done to increase the appropriate staffs.</P>
    <P>Deputies made reference to the piped water supplies scheme.  Like Deputy Desmond, I am all for that scheme, but, as a member of a local authority, I have sounded a number of ratepayers and I find that the people of rural Ireland are very suspicious of the scheme.  Why are they suspicious of the scheme?  They are suspicious of the cost.  Why are they suspicious of the cost?  They are suspicious of the cost because they were told in this House in relation to rates by the Minister for Health that the cost of the Health Act would be 2/- in the £. What is it today?</P>
    <P>They were told by the E.S.B. in connection with rural electrification that the overhead charges would not be increased.  They took in the electricity and no sooner was it in than the overhead charges were increased.  Faith was broken with them in regard to the Health Act and there was a breach of faith by the E.S.B.  The Local Government Department are now proposing a piped water supply scheme in every village in rural Ireland.  The main difficulty there is its cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> We have now reached the stage in this country when the rates have at last gone beyond the paying capacity of the people.  The payment of rates has now become a major problem.  I have often wondered what the position will be in a few years if the Health Act is to add to the rates again, if the cost of additional housing is to go on the rates and if the roads are to go on the rates and on top of all that, the piped water supplies scheme.  It must be borne in mind that the local authorities have a responsibility to the ratepayers and this House has a responsibility to the ratepayers.  We have now in 1961 reached the very point of exhaustion of patience on the part of the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>They find that their incomes have been dropping steadily.  If they are on the land, their incomes are dropping. If they are shopkeepers, they have fewer customers and less is being sold over the counter so that their income has dropped.  We have many instances of ratepayers finding it more difficult to pay the rates year after year.  We have editorials in the national and provincial papers in regard to the rates. We have pronouncements by the leaders of the Church in relation to rates.  We have pronouncements on the rates by the local authorities and all sections of the community.  We had pronouncements from trade unions, from Macra na Feirme and other agricultural organisations.</P>
    <P>But what is being done about the rates?  I feel the time has come when very serious action in the form of a progressive policy will have to be taken in relation to the rates.  Something will have to be done to relieve the local authorities and to pass that relief on to the already overburdened ratepayers throughout the country.  We are fast reaching the stage at which the ratepayers will be unable to pay.  It is not that they do not want to pay because there are no better payers than the people of rural Ireland.  No people pay more quickly or more readily.  A position has now been arrived at in which the demands upon them have been substantially increased while, at the same time, their income has steadily decreased.  That is a matter which the <Col N="160" /> Department of Local Government should seriously examine.  I trust no time will be lost in letting the country know what the Government have in mind providing a very substantial measure of relief for the already overburdened ratepayers in this country.</P>
    <P>As I am dealing with rates, I want to refer to one matter which is of concern to my constituency.  It is a matter of which I trust the Minister will take note.  I am not satisfied that in County Offaly Bord na Móna, who own most extensive property there, are paying sufficient rates.  I feel that the Department of Local Government has a duty to consult with the Offaly County Council and see to it that Bord na Móna are properly rated on all the property they possess in that county.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to say that the small farmer of Offaly must pay his rates, that the small man with his water-logged holding must pay his rates and that the large farmer with good arable land must pay his rates. Both the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna in Offaly are well-to-do State-subsidised bodies.  We are told they are paying their way.  They should be made to pay what is considered a proper rate.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the general public are already overrated whist people like the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna are, so to speak, getting away with murder in relation to their property in County Offaly.  The ratepayers of the county are &ldquo;copping it on&rdquo;.  There has been a discussion in the local authorities on this matter, and I feel there must be a file on it in the Local Government Department.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see to it that Bord na Móna and the E.S.B. will pay the last penny of rates upon the property they possess in the same way as the men and women in Tullamore, Birr and Edenderry must pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might get some other county to make the rate free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We only want to see that justice is done.  There are no people more welcome in the midlands than the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna, but they have to pay rates and they should be made pay rates.  I cannot <Col N="161" /> understand how the small farmers in my area are made to pay rates in accordance with their valuation.  I cannot understand how the small businessman, who puts a new pane of glass in his shop window, is made to pay an increased rate.  In my opinion Bord na Móna and the E.S.B. should be made pay their full rates.</P>
      <P>Their transport is making use of the roads and the lanes of County Offaly. If they are using the roads and the lanes and if they have houses on sites in the county, they should be made to pay in accordance with the proper terms of valuation.  I hope that steps will be taken to see that justice will be done in that area and that the small people, the small farmers and others will not be mulcted in increased valuations where Bord na Móna and the E.S.B. seem to be able to get away with it.  I leave it at that in the hope that some action will be taken.  It is of the greatest possible importance that it should.  I feel that, on inquiry, the Department will see that the rate demands both on the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna certainly in present circumstances are not commensurate with the amount of property they possess.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter which I feel I must compliment the Minister for mentioning, that is, the manner in which many of our beaches at seaside resorts are allowed to get, not only into a bad condition but into a very dangerous condition as a result of reckless people throwing about broken jam pots, broken bottles, glass, litter and dirt of every kind.  One would expect that people on the beaches and at the seaside generally would display a little more civic spirit.  I am glad the Minister has appealed to members of this House and to members of local authorities to use whatever influence they have in that regard.</P>
      <P>It is a most shocking and dangerous thing to throw broken bottles on the beaches where children in bare feet run and play.  In many cases, as the tide comes in the broken bottles are covered and children very often suffer severe injuries because of broken glass.  All that pain and misery is caused by people who do not think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> I feel that at our beaches and at our seasides there should be sufficient notices and that receptacles should be provided for refuse.  Glass bottles, jars and other rubbish that people are inclined to throw on the beach should be deposited in an orderly manner in containers or taken home.  I have seen many tincans thrown on beaches. People had brought tinned fruit with them to enjoy a meal by the seaside. Without thought, the tin was thrown away.  The open tin could probably be the means of cutting the foot completely off a child going in to swim.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in his reference to this subject.  I hope all local authorities in seaside areas and particularly in our maritime counties will see to it that the beaches are properly noticed and that there is ample provision for the disposal of rubbish.  For the safety of children and others on the beaches, the Minister's appeal must be given serious attention.</P>
    <P>I cannot see evidence of any work carried out in my constituency, at any rate, under the Derelict Sites Act. Probably it is too early yet to view the results.  In many cases in which our towns competed in the tidy towns competition, some most unsightly sights were to be seen.  I hope and trust the officers of the Department will keep an eye on the progress of local authorities in removing horrid eyesores and clearing deplorable derelict sites.  I do not propose to name any towns but practically every town has a derelict site of one kind or another and many towns have too many of them.</P>
    <P>The local authorities should take the necessary action to compel the owners to deal with derelict sites. Alternatively, I hope they will take action under that Act to ensure that derelict sites are cleared and so brighten up the appearance of our towns and villages which unfortunately possess too many unsightly sites today.</P>
    <P>I want to make a last reference on this Estimate to the growing influence of the association referred to by the last speaker, the County Managers' Association. The County Managers' Association has grown to be a very powerful <Col N="163" /> association.  The Minister may not think it is as powerful as it is.</P>
    <P>If the County Managers' Association dictate what wages are to be paid to road workers and what line of policy should be taken in relation to the supervision of road workers, I feel the association is taking matters out of the hands of local authorities and also out of the hands of the Minister for Local Government.  I am very surprised the Minister for Local Government, who is the impartial head of the Department and to whom all county managers are subject, permits the Custom House to give such a favourable ear to the county managers.</P>
    <P>The county managers usually deal with matters affecting themselves&mdash; better conditions, fewer duties and more uniform duties for county managers.  I feel their recommendations have been taken too seriously by the Department of Local Government. County managers should be made to understand that they are the servants of the local authorities.  They should be made to recognise that the Minister for Local Government is the supreme head in the Custom House and the man in charge of the county managers.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Custom House is losing its independence in so far as local government is concerned.  It would be a bad day if the Department of Local Government should lose its independence in that regard.  Matters are discussed by the County Managers' Association, such as the cutting down of a road worker's rate of pay and then representations are made to the Custom House asking the Custom House not to sanction a rate of pay beyond such and such a figure, having regard to the capacity of the people to pay.  Again, the scheme is carefully planned and carefully outlined by the county managers.  I have no regard for that association.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that the incoming Government will not view with any degree of seriousness any recommendations that come from the County Managers' Association.  The discussion of the full position in relation to road <Col N="164" /> workers by the County Managers' Association is something with which members of this House cannot agree. There are road workers today in practically every county in Ireland, but there are fewer road workers in most counties than ever before.  Reasons have been given such as more machinery.  Another reason is that on the retirement or death of a road worker, there is never a replacement.</P>
    <P>In many cases, when gangers retire the ordinary road worker is given the book and he does the ganger's work for an ordinary road worker's pay.  We have seen that in many cases.  I fail to see why some arrangements have not been made between the Minister and the trade unions to give the road worker more independence and more security.</P>
    <P>We all know very well that road workers are not paid as they should be paid.  Their rates of pay are entirely too low at present.  The tendency is for every county manager to cut them out completely if he can.  That is a matter in respect of which there should be intervention by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Proposals for increases of pay in various counties have not been considered by the Minister and have not been decided without consultation first with the County Managers' Association.  I think that is wrong. That state of affairs in Local Government should not be allowed to continue. The Minister, or any Minister in that office, should show a great degree of independence over county managers.  When the Minister issues a direction he should see that that direction is obeyed forthwith.  I know that the County Managers' Association has a lot of influence in the Custom House.  I regret that because it deprives the Minister of his rightful functions over them and it allows undue influence to trespass on the impartiality of the Custom House. It is wrong and improper that Local Government should be sponsored in that way. I hope steps will be taken in the future to see that there is less attention paid to a section of highly paid officials who are planning how they can hoodwink the Minister into doing something which they <Col N="165" /> believe should be Government policy. Government policy should be dictated by the Minister and only the Minister. Those who try to dictate Government policy other than the Minister should bet told &ldquo;where to get off.&rdquo;  The laying down of policy is a matter for the Minister and it should be laid down in this House.  I believe local government is lacking in that respect today.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy O'Donnell, for his courageous stand on many occasions in this respect.  I should also like to pay tribute to the courage and ability of his predecessor in office, the late Tim Murphy.  His sincerity and his courageous rule from the Custom House will not be forgotten. I wish that today we had a Minister in the Custom House who was the same type as the former Minister and the late Tim Murphy.  The late Deputy Murphy has left behind him a monument of constructive work.  That work was continued by Deputy O'Donnell and by the late Deputy Keyes.  What is wanting in the Department today is leadership, determination and ability, and above all the courage to &ldquo;tell off&rdquo; where telling-off is required.  Work will not be carried out and policy will not be implemented until somebody is there to carry out the obligations for which the Minister is held responsible, the whole way down from the top to the bottom.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to prolong this already protracted debate.  I suppose it is to be expected that a debate such as this would be protracted because the majority of members of this House are also members of various local authorities throughout the country.  They can speak with a knowledge and an intimacy which an outsider could not command.  From my own county we have 17 members in this House, including members from Cork City, and of those, 16 are members of local authorities, I myself being the only black sheep.  Therefore, the points I shall make are the points of an outsider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a system of local government that is very attractive and one <Col N="166" /> that is very hard to beat, provided it does not lose its democratic pattern. We have the managerial system and I believe it is well we have a system that could be rigid against modern trends. There was a great deal of criticism of the system in the past, but I think the system has outlived that criticism and has proved itself effective.  Local government is the administration that is most closely associated with the people and it is an administration in which the local people take a very keen interest.</P>
    <P>For that reason they look upon our local bodies as the guardian of their rights.  Even though local bodies have been stripped considerably of their powers, they are still the watchdogs of the democratic rights of the people. Even though, in recent years, we have built up a sort of local bureaucracy I think that was inevitable.  We have in that system magnificent officials and I think Deputies from Cork will agree with me when I say that in Cork City and county we have officials and county services second to none.  They are officials who face their obligations objectively, impartially and efficiently at all times and treat the people with the courtesy we find amongst our civil servants.  They are really on a par with the services here at national level. I have two criticisms to make.  It may be regarded as treason for me to give utterance to them, but they are my sentiments and I would be failing my own convictions and my own conscience if I refrained from referring to them now.</P>
    <P>First of all, it is a pity that members of this House are also members of local authorities.  If men get elected to this House through the prestige and patronage they built up for themselves while members of the local authorities, I think they should resign from the local authorities and give all their time to national affairs associated with this House.  Because Deputies and Senators are members of local authorities, they tend to monopolise the time of the local authorities and preclude others who would be very good local administrators, and who would take a lively interest in such affairs, from coming <Col N="167" /> into local bodies.  I have met such people who would not contest local elections because of the fact that so many Deputies and Senators were contesting these elections.</P>
    <P>It is rather tragic, I think, that local elections are fought on a Party basis. We had evidence of that during recent weeks when there was a regular Party lineup on all occasions when chairmen were being elected to the various local authorities.  The fact that these come in, brings politics immediately into our local councils.  Our local administrators are rightly objective about local affairs.  I think it is taking Party policits to the fair to introduce such matters into our local discussions. It is regrettable.  At one time the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and the Labour Party refrained from contesting these elections on Party lines. I wish wiser counsels would again prevail and men of good sense would see the futility of having a build-up of this kind, a build-up that may be dangerous in the future, that might present a challenge to democracy if we stick too rigidly to Party lines in discussions and decisions in local matters.</P>
    <P>I have heard references here to county managers.  I have heard it said that they are bureaucratic on occasions.  They have to be because of the suspicion that this build-up in local bodies engenders.  Parties are contending against one another and the officials must of necessity be careful, cautious and reticent&mdash;perhaps even uncooperative on some occasions&mdash; because of the fear they have that there is something sinister behind the motives of those who approach them with regard to certain matters.  I am not casting any aspersions whatever on the members of local authorities.  I have the greatest admiration for them. They give of their time and energy. They are self-sacrificing in their administration of local affairs.  They are at the beck and call of everybody.</P>
    <P>Of recent years these calls have increased considerably.  Health legislation and other legislation have had their impact.  Being a member of a <Col N="168" /> local authority is a whole-time job today. It is because of that that I stress the danger that politics may become a business and, the more of a business they become, the greater the danger of corruption in our local authorities. The Fluoridation Act and the Road Traffic Bill will put yet more responsibility on local authorities.  They will have to make regulations for the implementation of this legislation.  They will have to provide the revenue to cover the cost of implementation.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of rates.  Rates are a nightmare for everybody at the moment.  They are a cause of serious concern to householders. No effort is being made to keep rates at a reasonable level.  I have one suggestion to make.  It may necessitate legislation but I put it forward for consideration.  We have had a good deal of legislation in this House over the last twelve months in the way of reform.  One way of stabilising local expenditure and thereby stabilising rates would be to strike a rate for a period of three or five years.  The local authority could then plan ahead for three or five years, knowing exactly the amount of revenue they would be handling in that period.  Indeed, such a reform might create the possibility of definite progressive planning.</P>
    <P>We still adhere to a system of rate collectors.  I bear no enmity towards any rate collector but I cannot understand why we should stick to such an antiquated system.  It may have been necessary in the past but our people today have grown accustomed to paying their electricity bills once every two months, their annuities to the bank twice in the year.  There is no reason why they could not pay their rates to a central office.  In Cork a good percentage of the rates is collected in the county council offices at one-third the cost of collection by rate collectors. When the present rate collectors are pensioned off, they should not be replaced.  Responsibility for collection should be handed over to the central office.</P>
    <P>There is a motion on the Order Paper tabled by the Labour Party that rates should be collected by instalments. That will increase the cost if <Col N="169" /> collection is done by rate collectors.  If the rates are paid into a central office instalments could be taken at a minimum cost.  Strange to say, one of the powers retained by local authorities is the power to appoint rate collectors and in the past year there was some unpleasantness with regard to the appointment of rate collectors.  I do not know why that power should be left in the hands of local representatives. I am sure they would have no objection to being deprived of this power.</P>
    <P>The continued rapid increase in rates in recent years has done more to kill initiative and stop people taking progressive action in relation to their homes and farms than has anything else that I know of.  Our islanders around the coast pay rates.  They can never enjoy the amenities that the mainland possesses.  This year the people on Cape Clear have paid only half the rate.  They have held the other half.  I believe no rate should be demanded from them.  They have no motor cars.  They have no electricity. They lack many of the amenities we have on the mainland.  They have hardships and handicaps to face.  The least we might do is not ask them to pay rates remembering they can never enjoy the benefits that rates are supposed to provide.  There are two cars on Cape Clear but there are no tarmacadam roads, and there never will be.</P>
    <P>Our engineers are to be complimented on the magnificent work done on our main roads.  Like others, I sometimes thought that the work was almost of too good quality but an engineer told me some years ago that they took the long view.  No doubt, he was right.  There are by-roads in urgent need of repair.  We must be reaching saturation point in improving our main roads.  The time has come when we should do something about our by-roads.  There is a grant available from the Rural Improvements Scheme for these roads.  The objective is a laudable one but it is sometimes difficult to get all those using the road to cooperate.  I think these roads should be taken over and the work should be done by the <Col N="170" /> local authority.  They have the machinery.  The farmers could supply some of the material, such as gravel and stone, and in that way make their contribution under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Much comment was made here this evening on the subject of housing.  I put it to the Minister that a little more discretion should be allowed to housing authorities in the matter of standards required in reconstruction cases.  I have in mind a case in which the Minister was sympathetic where a farmer reconstructed a house and the rooms provided in that reconstruction did not measure up to the eight feet standard but were, in fact, only seven feet.  The house was on top of a hill and, I contend, would have as much ventilation as the most luxurious house in this city.  I do not see the necessity for rigid enforcement to the maximum degree of that regulation.</P>
    <P>Regional water schemes were referred to.  I agree with other Deputies that such schemes are very desirable but it is rather frightening when one considers the extent to which such schemes will impinge on the rates and the people may find themselves very annoyed that such a scheme was put in train at all.  No matter how desirable it may be, we must consider the people who will pay for it.</P>
    <P>In some cases, regional schemes could be economically undertaken where there is a chance of having a gravity flow but this whole question should be approached with caution because those people who, with their own capital and with grants available from the Department of Local Government, have already provided their homes with water and sanitation will be peeved on being asked now to provide these amenities for their neighbours.  That is one of the reasons this matter should be examined with the greatest care so that it may be realised what it will ultimately mean to those people.</P>
    <P>The last speaker complimented the Minister on his remarks with regard to beaches.  Those remarks should include roads and the countryside generally.  Our people have a bad civic sense in that respect.  It is detestable <Col N="171" /> that litter, old motor cars and other rubbish should be dumped in gullies beside the road or other public places.  People should have sufficient civic sense, sufficient prudence and judgment to realise that they should not use the highways for dumping matter of that kind.  I have seen dock roots thrown on the side of the road, and in some instances main roads. That is most reprehensible and should be discouraged.  I hope the remarks the Minister has made about beaches will apply to the countryside generally.</P>
    <P>The tidy towns competition has created civic pride and has helped to encourage greater effort in recent years in the elimination of abuses of that kind.  It has inculcated a realisation in the people of their civic duty and has created the ambition to have their town capable of qualifying, if not for a prize, at least for a recommendation.</P>
    <P>We are glad to notice from the Minister's statement that the total capital expenditure shows a gradual decrease, due to the progress made in housing.  That is very comforting but it is not so comforting when one realises that the Department contemplate expenditure of £59,000,000 in the current year.  That £59,000,000 must be provided by the people.  That is all the more reason why our people take such an interest in local administration. They realise that they will have to meet in the rates the cost of whatever amenities are provided for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a rural Deputy and a member of a county council, I consider this a very important Estimate. First, I should like to congratulate the Minister on giving county councils an increased amount of money for the upkeep of the roads and on giving them the option to transfer moneys from main roads to county roads.  County roads are becoming more important every day.  In 1922, when Local Government was established, we had a main road complex but with the developments and popularity of the motor car, the county roads are being used to a much greater extent.  Our arterial roads are up to a standard <Col N="172" /> comparable with that in any country of the same size and population.  If we are to make progress in providing better service for the people and creating employment, more money should be allocated for county roads. The Minister has already done that in a small way.  He has given power to county councils to direct certain money to county roads which they had not got before.  Persons representing rural areas appreciate that.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, I raised the question of the provision of houses for small farmers.  When any Minister, past or present, makes an announcement about increased grants for housing, he seems to assume that those grants will be availed of by the majority of the small farmers, forgetting that there are a vast number of people who are not able to avail of grants, simply and solely because they cannot provide the balance to the contractor.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind that an average country house today costs £1,600 to £2,000 to build.  While the Government give generous grants of up to £275, and the local authority gives a similar grant of £275, there is still a big gap for the average small farmer I am interested in to meet between the sum of these grants and, say, £1,600 or £2,000.</P>
      <P>Whether we like it or not, there are a vast number of people in the country who work hard and are still not able to make up that deficiency, and are living in bad houses.  I have no objection to going on the records of this House as saying that if grants are to be given, they should be given on valuation.  Various grants have been given by different Governments&mdash;I am not blaming the Minister&mdash;to people who could afford to sit down and write a cheque, or walk into a bank and draw money to make up the deficiency between the Local Government grant, the local authority grant, and the price of the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given a direction to the county councils to build for a certain type of small farmer.  The Minister's circular to the county councils had a specific purpose, but various county councils are reading into it that that specific purpose is that where a <Col N="173" /> small farmer with 11, 12 or 13 acres qualifies for a house, it should be built for him by the local authority.  I do not look on those people as small farmers; I look upon them as unqualified labourers.  There may be people with 25, 30 or 40 acres rearing families in poor circumstances, and they will not get any help from the local authorities or the Minister.  I am appealing to the Minister to try to put through a scheme under which those people who are not able to meet the charges involved in building a house for themselves will be helped by the Department of Local Government and the local authorities to make up the deficit in the purchase price, without the full impact falling on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In North Tipperary, there is a very peculiar position.  In the southern part of Tipperary we have a piped water supply which is working fairly well, in my opinion.  Our county manager brought a piped water supply scheme before the North Tipperary County Council, of which I am a member. I opposed that scheme fairly bitterly at our meeting, not because I believed the people did not want a piped water supply&mdash;I firmly believe the people do require a piped water supply&mdash;but because before we got a piped water supply, I wanted to find out what it would cost the ratepayers. We were never able to find out what exactly the total cost would be.  Some members put it at about 11/- in the £ but in his statement the manager could not give us even a rough idea of the cost.  I hope I am not quoting him wrongly.  He seemed to think that 9/-in the £ would cover only part of North Tipperary and that part of Lower Ormonde would not come under the scheme because there was an old gravity supply which would have to be supplemented with piped or pumped water.</P>
    <P>I opposed that in the belief that 70 per cent. of North Tipperary would get no benefit from it.  Since then, the Minister has sent down to North Tipperary an official from his Department advocating a group water supply scheme in the parishes around North Tipperary.  I ask the Minister to make up his own mind.  He is pressing the <Col N="174" /> county councils to have a piped water supply scheme for the whole country and, at the same time, he is sending down officials from his Department who hold meetings in the various parishes advocating that they should have a group water supply scheme.</P>
    <P>The position as I see it is that if in any parish in North Tipperary a group of people decide to have a group water supply scheme as advocated by the Minister's officials, who said that it could vary to as much as a £ for £ valuation, we must consider the farmer or anyone else with a £25 or £35 valuation.  After they pay on a £ for £ valuation, even if it is only £10, £20, £30 or £40, and after they decide on a group water supply scheme, the Minister then presses the county council, or the county council decide, to have a piped water supply scheme.  They are then in the position that a progressive group on their own initiative, with the help of the Minister of course, have a group water supply scheme on a £ for £ valuation and the county council or the Minister then introduces a piped water supply scheme for which they must pay separately.  I ask the Minister to make up his mind whether he will press for group water supply schemes or a piped water supply scheme for the whole country.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to what I consider is a very serious flaw in the group water supply scheme as outlined by the official of his Department.  He explained to the people that they could put through a group water supply scheme and he outlined the various charges on the £ for £ valuation roughly.  He said they had to get in a pumped water supply from the E.S.B.  When he was asked what the charge would be for the people getting the group water supply, he said it would be based on the E.S.B. charge.  The Minister knows that various groups of people have been by-passed by the E.S.B. in the rural electrification scheme because the Board said it would be uneconomic to connect them.  In other cases, people did not accept the supply when it was passing close to their house.  When they wanted to avail of the supply at a later <Col N="175" /> stage, these people had to pay a special service charge.</P>
    <P>If the group water supply is to be based on the E.S.B. charges, does it mean that those people who had to pay three or four times the normal charge for electricity will have to pay three or four times the normal charge for the group water scheme?  Those people were victimised because the E.S.B. felt it was uneconomic to link them up or because they did not avail of the supply when it was passing close by.  Are they to be victimised again in the water supply scheme because they were not able to avail of the electricity?  The Minister should at least ensure that they will not be mulcted in the E.S.B. pumping charges.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to my county in his opening statement and said that the cost of the entire scheme in South Tipperary would be 5/- in the £.  We have had experience of Ministers' statements.  I remember attending, as chairman of North Tipperary County Council, a meeting in Limerick representative of five county councils&mdash; Limerick, South Tipperary, North Tipperary, Clare and Galway.  A particular Minister was introducing the health scheme.  He told us that when the scheme was in full operation, the charge on the rates would not be more than 2/- in the £; but today, though the scheme is not in full operation, the cost to the rates in North Tipperary is over 11/- in the £.  I know the Minister has more figures than I have, and he says South Tipperary will get the whole scheme for 5/- in the £, but I should like to see the figure when everything is completed.</P>
    <P>We are in an awkward position in North Tipperary.  Except for one portion of the county, we have no gravity supply schemes and we have to get piped water schemes in other areas. While I welcome any water supply scheme for rural Ireland, we should consider carefully before going into this and try to do as much as we can for the people we represent. Rightly or wrongly, we are criticised about the increase in the rates, and <Col N="176" /> we must be wary before jumping into anything.  I honestly think we are going about this in the wrong way. The Minister should first try to get from the various local authorities what the cost of this scheme would be in the various counties.  He should then put to the local authorities what the scheme would cost and they should ask if the people are prepared to pay for it.</P>
    <P>Under the group system&mdash;I am not sure if this applies to piped water supplies&mdash;if a person received a grant from the Department of even £10 for a single tank, he would not receive any grant whatever under the group scheme.  The Minister can, therefore, understand why there is opposition to this scheme from people who have no water supply themselves but who have received a small grant.  I am only pointing that out to the Minister.  I am not criticising his scheme.  I think it is a good one. The Minister comes from rural Ireland himself.  He knows that if a man has got even a few tanks, he will not benefit under the group scheme. Therefore, the Minister knows he can expect opposition in every parish. He should make the position clearer to the people who will have to accept the scheme.</P>
    <P>In my county, there are mixed views on the vesting of labourers' cottages. County councils do not allow a sufficient amount of money per year for the carrying out of repairs for the number of people who are applying for vesting of cottages.  It is our duty in the county council to provide the money but when the various Parties comprising the county council object, it is not our fault, nor perhaps the Minister's, if the money is not provided.  In any event, sufficient money is not provided for the carrying out of repairs to county council cottages and a number of people who apply for vesting are put off from year to year.</P>
    <P>When the county councils do a certain amount of repairs and when the tenant finds the repairs are not to his satisfaction, he then has the power to appeal to the Minister for Local Government, and this is <Col N="177" /> possibly where the Minister or his officials are wrong.  In the nine or ten years since the vesting arrangement came into force, I do not think I have met one tenant&mdash;and I was not looking for excuses from any tenant&mdash; who was satisfied with the Minister's inspector who called.  I have known cases in various parts of the county where the county council have notified the prospective vested tenant that the repairs were carried out in accordance with the recommendation.  When they appealed to the Minister for Local Government and he in his own way and in his own time sent down an inspector, I have yet to find as far as my area of North Tipperary is concerned that any one of the inspectors from the Department recommended helping the tenant with the extra repairs.  The result is there are many people mumbling and grumbling and rightly so, that the amount of repairs supposed to have been done were not done.  With their mumbling and grumbling, they are stopping their next-door neighbours from applying for vesting of their own cottages.</P>
    <P>I am merely pointing this out to the Minister with a view to helping him or his successor, whoever he may be, to encourage these people to have their cottages vested and to keep them as happy homes.  If the people do not get satisfaction from the county council or from the Minister, there is no inducement to them to have their cottages vested.  I trust that the Minister during the few months in power he has left&mdash;I hope he is left longer than some people think&mdash;will make some move to remedy the situation.</P>

      <P>I was glad to see that in his statement the Minister devoted a good deal of his remarks to housing but I must confess I am not completely clear as to what he means in some cases and I wonder if the local authorities, both the elected representatives and the officials, will know exactly what he means.  I was not here when the Minister made his speech but having a copy of it here, <Col N="178" /> I see he says a circular letter issued to the local authorities in October last was designed to expand their discretion as regards the initiation of schemes to complete slum clearance. That in itself is quite clear but he goes on to say:</P>
      <P>and also to widen the scope of the classes for whom new housing schemes might be undertaken.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said on housing here this evening and certain suggestions were made by some speakers with whom I find myself very much in agreement.  Deputy Flanagan referred to the difficulty old age pensioners find in securing housing accommodation.  That is a very live issue.  In any country town, an old age pensioner has no hope whatsoever of securing accommodation.  It often happens that a father and mother who have reached the age of 70 have to live in a fair-sized house with one of their grown-up children who may be married and they are doomed to occupy that house for the rest of their days.  That is not always desirable.  Housing grants are initiated for the specific purpose of creating as much social equality as possible and of providing a form of social assistance for those who require houses.</P>
      <P>The Minister should, therefore, give an open ear to the suggestion made here by Deputy Flanagan that old age pensioners should be considered for a smaller type of house, maybe a two-roomed house with a kitchen, which could be built very cheaply. The span of life being what it is, these people might not occupy such a house for a long period but the Minister can be assured that in our country towns these houses would be taken up again as they became vacant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also referred to those living on small farms.  I know several cases in my constituency of people with a low valuation living in bad houses.  It often happens that older people have a younger member of the family, maybe a nephew or a niece, brought into a farm and an antiquated old house which is not a fit residence for the rearing of a young family.  I know of several instances where they have applied to <Col N="179" /> the local authority for housing and have been told that it was not feasible, that they should apply under the Small Dwellings Acts and build houses for themselves.  As the scheme exists at present the average cost of building any sort of reasonable house is £1,500.  The free grant is in the neighbourhood of £275.  The local authority then advances the rest of the money up to about 75 per cent, but there is always a hiatus between the amount available and the cost of the house of around £300 or £400. I want to put it to the Minister that it is quite impossible for this type of people living on small farms to find that £300 or £400.  Therefore, it is only begging the question to suggest that they should build houses for themselves when they are quite unable to do so.  A person may come on to a farm where the housing accommodation is bad.  A niece or a nephew may hope to rear a family thereon and it is not socially desirable that they should rear a family in a mud hut.  The only chance they have is to get a new house.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he had arranged with the Minister for Finance for these schemes to be financed by means of loans from the Local Loans Fund. That is a rather ambiguous statement, as far as I am concerned.  I am not quite clear whether it will be possible for these people to fill in the requisite form for £300 or £400, that they will be able to borrow it from the Local Loans Fund and that they will be able to get a grant of 75 per cent. from the local authority. Can they then borrow from the Local Loans Fund as well, with a guarantee by the Minister for Finance to cover them?  If they can, that rectifies the situation.  When the Minister is replying, I think he ought to clarify that point.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another matter which is not confined to my constituency alone: it is common throughout the country.  I had applications in these cases from outside my own constituency as well.  There is no real attempt made to cater for this in rural Ireland.  Possibly in <Col N="180" /> Dublin there may be some scheme to deal with those people but I do not know as I am not qualified to speak for the city of Dublin.  I know that in the three towns in my own constituency there are many people of the salaried class who are unable to get accommodation.  I know of one specific instance where two teachers from vocational schools were forced to emigrate because their wives would not continue to live in one room paying 30/- a week.  They were unable to get a house.</P>
    <P>No new building scheme has been initiated to deal with these people. That is not peculiar to this town alone; it is to be found in every town. It is socially desirable in every country to have a strong middle class residing in an area and wedded to that area. There is nothing that produces greater stability than to have a middle class living in such an area.  It is quite impossible for salaried people in the majority of towns in Ireland to settle down without some scheme to support them.</P>
    <P>I am not a housing expert myself and I am not a member of a local authority but I am encouraged to bring this matter up on the Estimate as a result of the Minister's remarks in which he says:</P>
    <P>A circular letter issued to housing authorities in October last was designed ... also to widen the scope of the classes for whom new housing schemes might be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not say any more to give us an indication as to what that means.  If it is meant to cover the people to whom I have referred, I am delighted to hear it.  For the Minister's information, in the town of Wexford, which is the administrative town in County Wexford, more than half the officials working there are not housed and are not likely to be housed as far as I can see in the near future.  They are not only paying exorbitant rents but they are also tending to move on. I should like the Minister to bear these few points in mind in regard to the position of housing and see whether he can encourage local authorities to do something about it. <Col N="181" /> The Minister may reply that these possibilities exist and that county managers have every opportunity of doing something.</P>
    <P>I have tried over the past two or three years, realising how critical the situation is in relation to this type of person, to have schemes initiated.  I have always been told that there are no schemes there.  When I ask the Minister a question in Parliament, he replies that no schemes have been presented to him.  I feel that unless the Minister gives a direction to county managers and points out to the housing authority that this need exists, nothing will be done about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tierney was obviously conversant with the facts about which he was talking.  I am wholeheartedly in agreement with him with regard to the vesting of cottages.  It will save the country money and the local authorities the expense of repairs if people are allowed to vest their cottages with expedition.  That is not the case in my county.  In my county, there are endless delays in putting cottages into a proper state of repair so that they can be transferred to the tenant.  It is to the advantage of the local authority to have that done.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that there are delays in having the cottages repaired, there are also delays in introducing vesting schemes.  We have some sort of antediluvian idea in Wexford of having a vesting scheme only every so often.  I think it is only about two or three years.  I know of people having to wait two years to have their cottages vested.  With all this red tape, green tape, bureaucracy&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;that exists in regard to this question, nothing is being done and nothing is likely to be done for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>If there is a shortage of funds, as appears to be the argument in many <Col N="182" /> cases, for the purpose of reconstructing cottages, the Minister could make some sum available from the Central Fund to ensure that these houses are put into a proper state of repair.  I know at least 20 houses in my constituency which the tenants would willingly take over if they could get them repaired.  In fact, although I am not on the local authority, there is hardly a week goes by that I do not have a requisition from somebody who has been waiting for two years for the engineer to come to inspect the house.  It is a serious state of affairs that cottages should have leaking roofs.  Sometimes the windows are in a very bad state of repair.  There may be small children in the house.  It is extremely unhealthy to have houses in that condition.</P>
    <P>There is another point with regard to the subject of labourers' cottages. It is more in keeping with the water supply question to which I intend to refer later on.  I do not think I will have time to do so tonight.  If we are to have any attempt to get a general water supply, it is very shortsighted policy to build cottages in the extremes of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, some Minister for Local Government introduced the idea of a cottage village system.  We were under the impression that the new schemes for cottages were to be concentrated around the more central areas where there are schools.  In such a case, a water supply could be dealt with more definitely.  Except for such places as Kilkenny, in areas where there are mines, no attempt was made to centralise housing.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Wednesday, 5th July, 1961.</P>
