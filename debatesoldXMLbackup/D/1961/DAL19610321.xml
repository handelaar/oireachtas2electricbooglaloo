      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the latest date for which the information requested is available, namely the 31st December, 1960, there was a total of 800,309 persons entitled to free general medical services under section 14 of the Health Act 1953 made up of (a) 271,247 holders of cards and (b) 529,062 dependants of such holders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of persons eligible for general institutional and specialist services and for mental hospital services is estimated, on the basis of the best information available at present, to be approximately 85 per cent. of the population, or 2,400,000.  About 800,000 of these are in the lower income group and the services are free to these.  They are free also to such of those in the total <Col N="858" /> of 1,600,000 in the middle income group as health authorities may determine not to be in a position to make any payment out of their own resources.  The remainder in the middle income group are eligible for the services at the charges specified in the legislation.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot specify the number of these persons, nor could they readily be subdivided as between dependants and others.</P>

      <P>The total cost of hospital and specialist services other than those provided under the Mental Treatment Act is estimated at £8,569,000 in respect of services pro-financial year.  This figure includes £2,881,000 in respect of services provided in tuberculosis hospitals, and in hospitals and homes for chronic sick, mental defectives and other handicapped persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the present annual cost of providing the mother and child <Col N="859" /> service under the Health Acts (excluding the cost of maternity cash grants); and what proportion of the cost is attributable to (a) medical card holders and (b) others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the domiciliary services provided directly by health authorities for mothers and infants in the current financial year is estimated at £456,000, exclusive of maternity cash grants to persons in the lower income group.  The cost to health authorities of services for mothers and infants provided by voluntary maternity hospitals on foot of their agreements with such authorities is estimated at £246,000.  Similar services are provided in institutions conducted by health authorities, but it would not be possible to form an estimate of the cost without a special examination of local accounts involving an expenditure of time and money which I feel would not be justified.</P>
      <P>Apart from the general difficulty of attributing to a particular class of beneficiary a proportion of the cost of a service available to a large section of the population, there is the added complication in this instance that a woman who received services as the dependant of an insured person might also have been entitled to them as a person in the lower income group. Consequently, it would be impracticable to maintain records or form estimates on a basis which would make it possible to supply the information requested in the last part of the question.</P>

      <P>The figures available relate to 1959 and the number of general hospital beds has been regarded as including maternity, paediatric and orthopaedic beds as well as general medical and surgical beds, but not as including beds in chronic hospitals or in chronic sections of other hospitals or in convalescent homes.  On that basis, the total number of general hospital beds available for the treatment of Health Act patients in local authority and voluntary hospitals was 14,700.  The average daily occupancy was 12,300.</P>
      <P>To the foregoing figures of 14,700 hospital beds must be added an unspecified number of beds in institutions not classified as hospitals, e.g. nursing homes and maternity homes approved for the purposes of Section 25 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach (for the Minister for External Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, we have, in the past, voted for a discussion of the question of the representation of China in the United Nations because, as I explained in the Dáil on 7th July, 1959, we believe that, if the United Nations is to be effective in preserving peace, its <Col N="862" /> Assembly must be free to discuss any situation existing in the world which appears likely to endanger the peace. I also explained on the same occasion that, whereas there are in the United Nations many countries whose form of Government we would not like to see repeated here, countries of whose policies we strongly disapprove and the philosophy of whose rulers is abhorrent to our people, we feel nevertheless that, if the United Nations is to become what we would like it to be, namely, an effective shield for world peace, then clearly it must comprise countries of that character, and that we would like to see a real United Nations whose members are pledged to peace and who are willing to accept the verdict of the other member countries in relation to any acts of theirs which might imperil peace.</P>
      <P>The matter covered by the Deputy's question is not on the agenda for the resumed Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, which opened on 7th March, and I do not think therefore that a statement on the subject is called for at the present time.  However, I may say that, if the question of seating Communist China in the United Nations comes before the Assembly, the Government, in deciding how to vote on this question, would have regard to the various considerations which arise, including such factors as the possibility of securing from that Government assurances to abide by the Charter and to accept an obligation to restore to the people of China fundamental human rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better start the ball rolling.  This is the problem of adequate representation for interested parties on a council to be set up under this Bill.  Ordinarily, this Bill might be expressed to be designed primarily, if not exclusively, for the control of dangerous drugs and the protection of human beings in danger of addiction or improvident medication <Col N="868" /> but it is sought under the terms of the Bill to extend those provisions to veterinary medicines and agricultural preparations such as poisonous substances.</P>
      <P>In the light of that, one must look at the constitution of the council.  You have five persons representing the Pharmaceutical Society; two persons representing the medical profession; one person representing the dentists but, when you come to the representatives of agriculture, who are going to be vitally affected or could be vitally affected by the provisions of this Bill, one finds there is only one person to represent farming and one person versed in the use of poisonous substances in agriculture.  Two persons are to be nominated by the veterinary profession.  Now we strenuously object to that form of representation because we believe that there should be more than one person whose main occupation is farming nominated by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Blowick's amendment stands, it is calculated to alter paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of Section 4 from one to two persons.  That would make two persons with a special knowledge and experience of the use of poisonous substances in agriculture. I think, on the whole, two would be better, but on that I am not prepared to make an issue on principle.  When we come to paragraph (f), Deputy Blowick's amendment is designed to increase the number of persons representative of farming from one to three, and I urge upon the Minister strenuously to accept this amendment. I urge it because I want to retain the confidence of the farming community in this council, and they are very apprehensive of it.  I want to urge the figure 3 upon him because I think experience will prove that it will often be very difficult to get two of the three to be present and it is not a desirable thing to have one representative of a large interest like farming because, attending meetings of a body of this character, it is of great assistance if he has somebody with whom he can take counsel in determining the proper attitude to be adopted in regard to any matter that comes up for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> Deputy Blowick's amendment goes on to delete paragraph (3).  So far as we are concerned, we are indifferent as to that proposal.  I do not know why he thinks the three other persons are desirable.  If the Minister wishes to add them to the body, no serious objection need be raised against their addition.  Our position, therefore, can be reduced to this, and the reduction is made with the desire to go half-way to meet the Minister's original proposal: I would be quite prepared to accept in paragraph (e) one person with special knowledge and experience of poisonous substances; in paragraph (f) three persons whose main occupation is farming nominated by the Minister for Agriculture; and allow paragraph (g) to stand or fall, as the Minister prefers.</P>
    <P>I want to press this strongly on the Minister.  We have an exactly similar situation boiling up in connection with the Pigs and Bacon Bill.  There the Minister for Agriculture, I think, unwisely, gave way to pressure to allow three members of that board to represent curing, whereas there are only two members to represent producers. Whether or not that will have any effect on the deliberations of that board, it makes the board suspect from the very word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  I want to tell the Minister that I am perfectly certain that if he refuses the farming community more than one person, this board will be regarded as a kind of instrument of persecution.  The Minister may naturally inquire why the farming community should be so intimately interested in the administration of poisons legislation.  The answer is that poisons as interpreted by this Bill extend almost to the whole range of pharmaceutical drugs as well as to spraying materials and similar commodities.</P>
    <P>Most farmers, will, I think, readily acknowledge the necessity for close surveillance of poisonous spraying so that those who use them may be adequately warned of the precautions requisite to take, but an entirely new principle is being introduced in this Bill.  We are trying to carry over from the established attitude of the Legislature to the uncontrolled distribution <Col N="870" /> of therapeutic drugs for human beings that same principle into veterinary treatment.  There is no analogy. If I want recklessly to kill my pig, my sheep, my cow or my bullock by the improvident administration of drugs rather than pay the vet a guinea to come and see the animal, that seems to me to be my business and nobody else's.  To impose upon the farmer, in modern conditions, the obligation of summoning a vet in respect of every minor trouble which may manifest itself among his livestock is to impose upon him a burden which is quite ridiculous and which will result in the farmer being effectively prevented from providing therapeutic treatment for his livestock altogether.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that with antibiotics, and a variety of other preparations, a great deal can be done in the way of veterinary therapeutics by any intelligent farmer.  The use of penicillin for the control of mastitis is a daily experience of dairy farmers everywhere.  The use of antibiotics for the control of other systemic infections is quite common practice.  I will not weary the House with a list of the veterinary drugs which are now regularly administered by farmers to their livestock.  It could become an intolerable abuse if, at the instance of the medical, veterinary or pharmaceutical professions, access to these drugs by farmers was unreasonably limited.  Unless farmers are, therefore, adequately represented on this board, there will be a constant bone of contention and a sense of grievance abroad.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I urge on the Minister strongly either to accept this amendment or to announce his intention of accepting another amendment in the name of Deputy O'Higgins, an amendment designed to remove from the ambit of this Bill veterinary medicine altogether.  Either approach will be acceptable.  The idea would be for the Minister to accept both Deputy Blowick's amendment and Deputy O'Higgins's amendment.  That, in our judgment, would be the wise thing to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is some misunderstanding on the part of <Col N="871" /> those responsible for these amendments as to the real purpose of the Bill.  This Bill is designed to regulate the sale and distribution of poisons for the protection of individual citizens.  It is for the protection of human life that we are proposing to replace the existing legislation which had that purpose but which, by reason of the development of new therapeutic substances, has now become obsolete.</P>
      <P>Let us consider what is the machinery we are proposing to replace. Formerly the question of whether a thing was or was not a poisonous substance was left to the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland in the first place. That College came to a decision on the matter without having any consultations with farmers or with persons directly representing the agricultural industry.  They may&mdash;I do not know &mdash;have consulted the Minister for Agriculture in relation to these matters but the final word of advice lay with the Royal College of Physicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  It lay with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh yes; the final advice was with the College.  We could not classify a substance as a poison, unless they agreed.  We had to consult them and they were the final arbiters.  That is the situation which exists today and which we are proposing to rectify.  In order that the Minister may be guided by persons of experience on the various aspects of this matter, I am proposing to establish a council which, I hope, will pool the knowledge and wisdom which they have and devote it to the consideration of regulations which the Minister for Health proposes to make.  These regulations do not go to that council as a proposal for legislation.  They are not to be discussed there by the various persons concerned on the basis that they have franchise to represent a special interest.  They are generally to be considered by them as men of wisdom, much as you have a Cabinet who will discuss the various aspect of a matter and come to a common decision on what they think is right and say: &ldquo;We think your regulation, <Col N="872" /> will such and such a modification, will meet the case and will not impose undue hardship on any person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The basis of the amendment is that this is the sort of representative body in which matters will be decided by votes.  Otherwise, why all the emphasis upon the fact that there are so many persons qualified as pharmacists, why all the emphasis upon persons qualified as medical practitioners and so on? Why the attempt made to say that the farming interest&mdash;because interest is the one note which runs throughout the speeches I have heard and the articles I have read&mdash;is not fully represented? There is nothing to prevent the Minister for Health nominating a member of the farming community as one of his three nominees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all you have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>One or two farmers who know their business and are able to make their case can convince their colleagues on the council that a proposed regulation should be modified in a certain way to meet the requirements of the agricultural industry and that would be much more effective than having seven persons representing agriculture who, under Deputy Blowick's amendment, would be nominated as of right to the council.  This Poisons Bill is designed to protect people, human beings, from the use or misuse of poisons in any form, whether such poisons are intended for the therapeutic treatment of human beings or the therapeutic treatment of animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the purpose of the Bill.  The only reason the Minister for Agriculture comes in at all is that there is a wide range of therapeutic substances being used in the treatment of animals and agriculture generally, which, if misused, would lead to the loss of human life or create serious problems for the Minister for Health. Therefore, the Minister for Agriculture, having regard to that fact, has been given the right to nominate persons to this council and there is an obligation imposed on it to consider the use of these poisonous substances in agriculture. <Col N="873" /> Let us not think that we are not dealing with a real problem here because there are substances used in agriculture which are displacing long and well established remedies and these substances can be very dangerous not merely to the ultimate consumer of the agricultural product but dangerous to the people who use them as agriculturists.  The purpose of the regulations to be made by the Minister for Health, after consultation with the council, is to ensure that these articles are not misused, that they are used safely and in a proper manner so that it will not just be an animal that may die but that no human being will die or be made ill because of the misuse of them That is the whole purpose of this council and when you come to think of that, it is absurd that in relation to a council set up to safeguard the life and health of human beings, we should accept the purpose behind the amendment to which Deputy Blowick gives his name, that in that council, established for the protection of human life, there should be seven persons representing the livestock industry in this country and only eight persons representing the whole people of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Three persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what this proposal would amount to.  Not only does he propose to nominate these three, but he proposes to deprive the Minister for Health of the power to nominate three persons representing the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not responsible for that amendment. I am sorry to see that the Leader of the Opposition has walked himself into supporting it.  If he had given some consideration to it, I do not think he would have done so. However, Deputy Dillon made one good point in support of a further change in the personnel of the council, as it is now proposed in my amendment, that is, that it might happen that this person nominated by the Minister for Agriculture as a person whose main occupation is farming might not be able to attend on all occasions.  I would be quite prepared to meet that situation by agreeing to <Col N="874" /> have two persons whose main occupation is farming nominated by the Minister for Agriculture.  But that is as far as I am prepared to go.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that as a concession to the proposition that the council should represent interests merely.  But I am yielding to the weight of the argument Deputy Dillon has made that if the power of nomination of the Minister for Agriculture is confined to one person, that one person may not be able to attend on all occasions and, therefore, the council may be without the advice of a person considered by the Minister for Agriculture to be competent to deal with the draft regulations which may come before the council and to deal with the effect they may have upon agricultural procedures to the extent that they may make them more inconvenient or more onerous.  I think that is a fair way of meeting the case.  If the Leader of the Opposition will agree to that, I am prepared to make that concession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister always try to boil things up into passionate and acrimonious argument? When you boil down all this discussion between the pair of us, there is a difference of one farmer.  When you boil down all the Minister has said with such passion, all that is between us is one person under paragraph (f). As I said, looking at Deputy Blowick's amendment, I felt paragraph (e) was not essential or important.  I would not press that on the Minister. But I thought the amendment in paragraph (f) was wise and necessary. As far as the deletion of paragraph (g) was concerned, I did not attach any importance to it and I thought it would be perfectly reasonable for the Minister to retain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Bill, it might suit my hand much better to let you stumble into this folly.  When you are dealing with the agricultural community you can very often purchase its goodwill by a gesture; but if you fail to make that gesture, you create an atmosphere of suspicion and doubt which renders them antagonistic to the whole plan. The way they read this Bill is this. They will say: &ldquo;You have five <Col N="875" /> chemists; you have two doctors, one dentist and&rdquo;&mdash;as the Bill originally read&mdash;&ldquo;you have one farmer.&rdquo;  All I want to say to them, in order that the body may function satisfactorily, is: &ldquo;There are three farmers and there is, in addition to that, a person whose primary qualification is that he knows something about the use of agricultural substances, that is, poisonous sprays and analogous preparations.  If you feel that has not adequately covered you, you can go to the Minister for Health and ask him to use one of his nominations under paragraph (g) to repair any deficiency that exists.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All that is outstanding between the Minister and myself is one farmer.  If he gives way and puts on two farmers, I think he has made some gesture. But I am warning him he is purchasing for himself unnecessarily suspicion and illwill; whereas if he put on three farmers he would be in a position to say: &ldquo;I accept the importance and great interest of the farming community in this matter,&rdquo; while he may feel in his own mind that when they sit down and examine the questions that will be submitted to this council, they will discover there is nothing very exciting here at all.  But I urge on the Minister to look at it from the point of view of the farming community. Their primary reaction is: &ldquo;There are 350,000 of us buying these drugs.  We are the people who use them.  We are the people most profoundly affected by any restriction that may be put upon their use.  We are the people who will have to pay the vets' fees if we are excluded from access to these drugs unless furnished with a prescription from a veterinary surgeon.  There are only to be two of us, but there are five pharmaceutical chemists.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely that is a reasonable attitude bearing in mind the ordinary workings of human nature?  It irritates me when the Minister tries to make a case that the existing position is that the Royal College of Physicians is the determining body.  That is not true. The existing position is that the Minister is the determining authority. <Col N="876" /> The Minister makes the order and the Royal College of Physicians is the body which, by tradition, advises him. Is that not so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The College not only advise but they move for amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They may move, but they cannot compel.  The final authority is the Minister.  If the Minister receives a recommendation which he regards as unreasonable, to add a drug to the list of poisonous drugs, he has the right to say: &ldquo;No, I will not.  That is carrying things too far.&rdquo;  Let us view this thing with reason.  There is a tendency to restrict more and more access to these therapeutic substances except through the medium of the doctor and the veterinary surgeon.  There is also a tendency on the part of the pharmaceutical chemists to prohibit more and more the sale of certain therapeutic substances by persons other than pharmaceutical chemists.  All these factors are present to the mind of the agricultural community.  They require a certain measure of reassurance.</P>
      <P>I would be prepared to accept the proposal by the Minister to leave paragraph (e) as it is&mdash;that is to leave one person&mdash;to leave paragraph (g) as it is, if he wants to, provided he substitutes the figure &ldquo;3&rdquo; for the figure &ldquo;1&rdquo; in paragraph (f).  If the Minister is prepared to do that, I think every substantial objection will be overcome; but if he is not, I am afraid we cannot accept the proposed constitution of the council in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say at the outset that I believe Deputy Dillon to be more or less unreasonable on this matter.  I shall at first refer to the end of his speech where he states that the tendency at the present time is to allow the purchase of an article only by prescription from a veterinary surgeon in the case of veterinary goods. I should like to point out at the very beginning that the number of prescriptions issued by veterinary surgeons during the past twelve months was very limited.  I am told on the most reliable authority that the students at the Veterinary College are <Col N="877" /> instructed not to issue prescriptions to farmers when they attend farmers' beasts.</P>
      <P>In other words, the veterinary surgeons at the present time bring a lot of suspicion on themselves because of their rôle as vendors of medicines and drugs.  I read the speech made by Deputy Blowick when introducing his amendments and I gathered from it, and from a very few farmers I met, that his reading of the Bill as introduced was a very casual one.  I know that a few farmers, having read the Bill, were fearful that rights which they had held and exercised over a number of years were likely to be taken from them and handed over by vote of the council, or by a decision or recommendation of the council, to veterinary practitioners.  I rather think that if they had read the Bill carefully they would see there is nothing in it which provides that any rights would be taken away from the farmers, and I should like to stress what the Minister said here&mdash;that the personnel of the council, while belonging to certain vocations, are not, on the whole, to be taken as representing these vocations but are selected for the purpose of giving the Minister advice which would be worth while and which he would be able to act upon.</P>
      <P>It is right, as Deputy Dillon has done, to run down through the personnel specifically mentioned for membership of the council.  There are two doctors and a dentist.  I do not think anybody would disagree with the nomination of such persons.  There are five pharmacists.  It might be necessary for some of the lay members of the House to know what right&mdash;and I mean right in actual fact&mdash;the pharmacists have to such a great number of representatives on this council of fifteen.  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the pharmaceutical chemists of Ireland have for many years been the custodians of the poison laws in this country.  They have had the duty of instructing students in the poison laws, the duty of examining students, and no student of the College of Pharmacy can get his final certificate without passing a very strict examination on the poison laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> All this training, apart from these facts, makes the student an ideal person to handle drugs and to sell drugs and poisons to people throughout the country.  I maintain that the fact there is such a very limited number of fatalities from poisons in this country, whether deliberate or accidental, is in the main due to the great care which the pharmacists exercise in the handling and the storing of these drugs.  I should also mention that it is the duty of the Pharmaceutical Society to enforce the poison laws in the country. The Society has to send its inspectors throughout the country to investigate complaints or cases where they have knowledge of poisons being sold by people who should not be selling them. They have also the duty of prosecuting in the courts.</P>
    <P>All these duties are carried out without the help of any Government subvention. They get no fee even for their college.  All the fees are met by the students or as voluntary subscriptions by the Society members.  Accordingly, representation of five from that body on a council dealing with poisons is just the very minimum.  I should have thought that even greater representation would be justified but the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland are quite satisfied that the representation here is adequate.</P>
    <P>There is provision for two veterinary surgeons on the council.  At the beginning I wondered why we should have two veterinary surgeons on a poisons council.  I should like to stress that the poison laws are for the protection of human beings.  A farmer, if he wishes, may shoot any animal he has or poison any animal he has, provided the chemist sells him the poison with which to do it.  A man may treat any animal.  After all, if he has the right to destroy a beast, he should also be allowed to treat it provided his treatment does not create a danger to other people's property in any other part of the country or that he is not cruel to the animal.  I came to the conclusion that since the veterinary surgeons have such an intimate association with the farming community they should be given adequate representation on the council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> We have provision on the council for a farmer with specialised knowledge of veterinary poisons.  That is another excellent decision.  There is provision also for a person who will directly represent the farming community on the council.  In this connection I should like to repeat what Deputy Blowick said.  He suggested that there were 380,000 farmers in the country.  Deputy Dillon said recently there were only 350,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>The Deputy is having his &ldquo;crack&rdquo; and he is welcome to it.  Deputy Blowick continued that in the farms between Ballinrobe and Galway there were so many sheep that, if they suffered from pulpy kidney, all the veterinary surgeons in Ireland would not be sufficient to give them treatment.  Any recommendation made by Comhairle na Nimheanna is subject to the approval of the Minister and will not be effective until the Minister makes the order.  Is it likely, is it conceivable, that a Minister for Agriculture, a Minister representing the agricultural community, the present Minister or any future Minister, would cause trouble and great expense to 350,000 farmers here in order that 500 veterinary surgeons might benefit?  It is fantastic to imagine that such a position could occur.</P>
      <P>Having the Minister as the final arbiter in this case the farmers have a representative who is worth a dozen persons on Comhairle na Nimheanna. A Minister, even Deputy Dillon if he were Minister, would not agree to a recommendation from Comhairle na Nimheanna that it was only through the vets that pulpy kidney vaccine or blackleg vaccine or a thousand other things could be distributed.</P>

      <P>This is purely a poisons measure.  The Minister also has power to nominate three persons, or perhaps, two, on account of the gesture he has made to the Leader of the Opposition.  They may be drawn from any vocation and I think he will exercise this power to ensure that there will be on the council persons whose advice and knowledge will make the council a useful one.</P>
      <P>I would ask Deputy Blowick, if he were here, to accept the Minister's gesture and to withdraw his amendment. I feel that the farming community have nothing whatever to fear under this measure.  I cannot discuss Section 15 on this section but I would say that nothing in Section 15 relates to the sale of any poison or any article. The word &ldquo;sale&rdquo; is not mentioned in the section.  There are restrictive measures in it in certain ways but, so far as the sale of poisons or poisonous substances is concerned, the chemist has been entitled up to the present and will be entitled when this Bill is law to sell anything which he has been selling in the past to the farmers unless the council decide that the user of it would be a danger to the farmer or some person belonging to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Loughman <Col N="881" /> mentioned that this is purely a poisons measure.  It is poisonous to the farming community who see that they have been ignored in the proposal to give five places to chemists and one to a practical farmer.  This proposal ignores the importance of agriculture.  That is the reason the Leader of the Opposition has spoken so vigorously against the proposal.</P>
      <P>It is intended to control the sale and distribution of poisonous substances, but when a council is set up and five chemists are appointed to it we are really establishing a vested interest because they will have a colossal influence in any decisions that are made in relation to sale and distribution, and that is the important aspect of this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I do.  In my view the effect of it will be that a vested interest will be created.  In this House we should be very careful that we do not introduce legislation which will have the effect of creating a vested interest even if that were not intended.  If there is any evidence of the danger of a vested interest being established, this is the place for us to take positive action to ensure that that will not happen and to ensure that the community will not be subjected to any kind of vested interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural community have been brushed aside in this proposal. The scientific use of poisonous substances in agriculture is expanding and farmers are becoming more and more associated with the use of these substances. For that reason they should have reasonable representation on the council.  I am not suggesting that they should have anything like a majority or more influence than they ought to have on the council.  A very reasonable suggestion was made when the <Col N="882" /> Leader of the Opposition said that the farmers ought to have at least three.</P>
    <P>A high proportion of the business of any chemist, particularly in a rural area, is the sale of drugs and medicines associated with agriculture.  Farmers are almost the best customers of chemists in rural areas.  Any chemist in the country will bear that out. Anyone who goes into a chemist's shop at the moment can see the advertisements encouraging farmers to experiment with medicines, drugs and inventions designed to improve the farming economy.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Loughman will agree that the chemist cannot teach farmers their own business.  Farmers are engaged in a practical way in the management of their farms, their livestock, the growing of crops, the killing of weeds and various activities which may necessitate the use of poisonous substances.  Apparently, the protest from the N.F.A. has been ignored.  No effort had been made by the Minister to meet them on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to know about it he ought to study the remarks that they have made on this matter and the points which they have made in relation to it.  They are a very influential body and it has been necessary for them to make positive statements in relation to what they consider ought to be done concerning this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain proposals have been made in the House and the Minister, apparently, is not prepared to accede to them.  The point is that we are setting up a group, on which there will be five chemists, who will make decisions in relation to the sale and distribution of drugs and medicines for sheep, cattle, pigs, horses <Col N="883" /> and other farm animals.  In addition to that they will be making decisions in relation to the sale of various poisonous substances for spreading on crops, weed killing and even soil treatment.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that chemists could not be expected to have a practical knowledge of these aspects of agriculture, any more than a farmer could go into a chemist shop and teach the chemist his business.  The farmer in the management of his farm knows what his problem is and what he wants when he goes into the chemist shop. He recognises the various illnesses amongst the animals on his farm; he knows the times at which weeds spread, and he knows more about the soil on his farm than the local chemist could be expected to know.  What I am objecting to is the creation of an influential vested interest which may make it more difficult for the ordinary farmer to obtain various substances which can be used on his farm for its improvement and for the betterment of our agricultural economy.</P>

Deputy Rooney, in the course of the remarks he has made, said I was ignoring the N.F.A.

      <P>I will wait until he lapses into silence.  What does the N.F.A. ask instead of this section which we are now debating?  I do not think Deputy Rooney himself knows&mdash; that paragraph (f) should read: &ldquo;Two persons whose main occupation is farming nominated by the Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;  I did not see much point in that request as baldly made. However, Deputy Dillion did make the convincing point that in the event that the person nominated by the Minister for Agriculture as a person whose main occupation is farming might not be able to attend, there ought to be some other person present whom the Minister for Agriculture had designated to put the farmers' point of view in the councils of the board.  Therefore, as I said, having heard that argument&mdash; and it was one that did not occur to myself&mdash;that this was a case which might occur and which should reasonably be met, I said I would prefer to increase the number of persons appointed under paragraph (f) from one to two.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rooney talked about a vested interest.  Deputy Dillon and myself were at cross-purposes when we were speaking about the existing situation.  The Deputy seems to think that as the law now stands it is the Minister for Health who takes the initiative in this matter.</P>

      <P>No. The Minister does not even make the order, though the order would probably be made with the Minister as a consenting party.  The position at the moment is that the several articles mentioned in the Schedule to this Bill include a wide range of substances which have been designated by an Act of the British Parliament.  Of course Deputy Rooney does not mind that.  He thinks what the British did is all right and therefore there is no need to interfere as I am interfering in this case.</P>
      <P>To return to the text of the Act:</P>
      <P>... which several articles mentioned in the Schedule to this Act annexed shall be deemed to be poisons within the meaning of the Act and the King's and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland may from time to time by resolution declare that any article other than those mentioned in the said Schedule and in such resolution named ought to be deemed to be a poison within the meaning of the Act and thereupon the said College should present the said resolution for the approval of the Privy Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it happens to be the Government.  In any event, the position at the moment is that there is a body on which there is not any farmer <i>per se,</i> not even a person nominated by the Minister for Agriculture, and they can deal with all this range of questions if they so desire. One might think it outside their competence <Col N="887" /> to administer that Act in the spirit in which it was intended.</P>
      <P>Let me return to what I said at the beginning.  That Act was passed for the protection of the citizens of Ireland.  The purpose of this Act is to ensure that whoever uses poisonous substances for whatever purpose, whether it be for agriculture or otherwise, they will be used in such a way that first, they cannot be wilfully misused to take human life&mdash;that is the fundamental importance of this Bill&mdash;and, secondly, that they cannot be inadvertently misused to injure either the user or some other person into whose hands a commodity in the production of which they may be used will fall and cause him to suffer in health or perhaps lose his life. That is the purpose of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Am I to go along and say that Deputy Rooney, for instance, considers it much more important to facilitate farmers in destroying weeds than to ensure that the poisonous substances which the farmer uses to destroy weeds will not either wilfully or inadvertently be misused to the detriment of human life?  Are we to say that Deputy Rooney, speaking for the Fine Gael Party, places higher value upon a cow or a sheep than he does upon a human being?</P>

      <P>Deputy Rooney, like his Leader, Deputy Dillon, referred to the fact that there were five persons who were registered pharmaceutical chemists, that is to say, had qualifications in pharmacy, on the Board. There are, or will be, if my amendment passes, but neither Deputy Rooney nor Deputy Dillon referred to the reservation which appears in subsection (3) of the amendment and it is a very important one because while we may talk here about five pharmaceutical chemists what Deputy Dillon and Deputy Rooney have been concerned to do is to build up a picture in the minds of the farming community of the man in a market town who keeps a chemist's shop and who sells drugs and other chemical substances.  It is true that they are to be represented on this council and represented for the reason which Deputy Loughman referred to, that is, that those who have been engaged for, I think, 76 years or over three-quarters of a century, in the sale of poisonous substances under strict statutory regulations will have a great deal of knowledge and experience to bring to the discussions of the council and to consideration of the regulations which the Minister is bound to submit to them.</P>
      <P>Each of three people out of the 25 shall be a person whose main occupation is either the carrying on of the business of pharmaceutical chemist or in employment as a pharmacist and at least two of those three persons shall be persons who, on the date of their appointment as members of the council, are members of the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland. While there must be five persons who have pharmaceutical qualifications, such qualifications as will entitle them to be registered as pharmaceutical chemists, only three of them can be actually actively engaged in the distribution by sale of pharmaceutical substances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall do so as soon as I am permitted by Deputy Sweetman to continue my speech on this matter.  I shall keep to the point, I hope.  There are three persons, as I pointed out, and not more than three, who can be actively engaged in the sale and distribution of pharmaceutical substances.  That gives a very different impression from that which Deputy Rooney and Deputy Dillon sought to convey to the House, and of course, through the House to the agricultural community.  A fourth of these five shall be a person whose main occupation is the teaching of pharmacy or a similar subject.  A fifth, who must be a pharmaceutical chemist, I am entitled to appoint, so to speak, at large from either the manufacturing chemical industry or from the medical profession, if that should appear to me to be warranted.  Nevertheless, he has to be a person who is registered as a pharmaceutical chemist and who for a period of not less than 10 years before the date of his appointment as a member of the Council had been entitled to be registered in the Register of the Pharmaceutical Chemists for Ireland.  That is quite a different picture from that presented to the House by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Rooney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the representation of this interest or that interest.  Speaking on the last occasion I said that if I thought that this council was going to be a battleground for conflicting interests I <Col N="891" /> would not establish it.  That is not the purpose of the council.  The purpose of the council is to consider judiciously and impartially the proposals which the Minister submits to them and if they find nothing to improve upon in them&mdash;which I think may be unlikely&mdash;to give them their full endorsement.</P>
    <P>If any member of it feels that the regulations should be modified in any way then it is the duty of the council to discuss that proposed modification and to come to a common agreement upon it as to whether it should be made or accepted in whole, or whether there should be a modification of that proposed modification.  If I thought, and I am sure that any successor of mine will have the same view when he comes to consider the question, that the drafts of these regulations were to be discussed and debated as if they were political issues, and that they were to be decided by a vote of the majority of the council, then I would think the council would be useless for the purpose of the Minister for Health, because that is not what he wants.</P>
    <P>The Minister administering this Act has to feel confident that whatever regulation he makes is made not for the benefit of this particular interest or that, but made for the benefit of the community as a whole.  It is to take the questions involved out of the region of politics and to have these questions considered and settled, not by political methods and not by voting on this or that proposal but by pooling the wisdom and experience of the members of the council; so that they will be able to return to the Minister his proposed regulation feeling that, having regard to all the aspects of the question, this is the right type of regulation to make.  This is what I have in mind in putting this proposal to the House.</P>
    <P>So far as the farmers are concerned, Deputy Loughman has pointed out that the great safeguard which they have is that no Minister for Agriculture is going to lose sight of their interests in respect of any regulation that may be made, that he is not going to do anything, even if only as a <Col N="892" /> politician, that would be detrimental to the interests of the farmers as a whole.  In the first instance, the Minister for Agriculture is responsible to the House but it is to the farmers that ultimately he is responsible.  Therefore, we may be perfectly certain that if this council were to act in a wrongheaded way and make a proposal to the Minister which he felt would be detrimental to the interests of the agricultural community, unreasonably detrimental without any justification, no Minister for Agriculture would make a regulation of that type.  That, of course, is the position in which the Minister for Health would be in relation to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Over and above that there is another safeguard provided in Section 18 of the Bill, that all regulations which are made by the Minister must be laid before the House and, of course, those who appear to be so zealous about representing the interests of the farming community will have an opportunity of discussing those regulations. I may not be present to discuss it, but I will make a bet that when the first regulation comes before the House Deputy Rooney will not even know about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, not only does the regulation have to be laid before the House but if the Minister, to deal with an emergency, has to make a regulation without consulting the council, the regulation has to have that fact stated upon its face so the House is then in a position to discuss any regulation which the Minister makes without consulation, in the full knowledge that anything it may do <Col N="893" /> will not reflect on the council.  That is the situation under the Bill and, having regard to the fact that the Bill is designed for the protection of human life, we should drop this pretext that the Bill is in any way designed to injure or incommode the farmers of Ireland.  Having had this long discussion, I hope we shall be able to proceed.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the Act which at present governs the sale of poisons, the Sale of Poisons (Ireland) Act, 1870.  He pointed out that, under present legislation, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland is the body which deals with the definition of poisons.  That is perfectly true.  The Sale of Poisons (Ireland) Act, 1870, was passed 92 years ago. One of the reasons this legislation is necessary is that the list of poisons that were known and referred to in that Act is out of date and completely out of touch with scientific development since then.  It is merely a debating point by the Minister to suggest that the machinery under this matter is dealt with by the Royal College of Physicians, which has no farmer representative. He is asking us to compare chalk with cheese because they are two different things.  The Minister suggested that Deputy Rooney was misquoting the view of N.F.A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say &ldquo;misquote&rdquo;. He charged me with ignoring the N.F.A.  I asked him to tell the House what the N.F.A. asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister purported to refer to the view the N.F.A. had given expression to.  With all the documentation in front of him, I can only assume that the Minister did not take the trouble to read what the N.F.A. did say.  The gloss he put upon it was quite contrary to the view they expressed.  In their document, dated 1st March, 1961, they referred to the section we are discussing.  Having dealt with the council and its formation, they say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers have a vital interest in the operation of this legislation which will clearly affect their capacity to safeguard the day to day health and wellbeing of their livestock.  This <Col N="894" /> interest can only be protected by giving them adequate representation on the council.  No single voice in a council of 15 could represent adequately an interest of this magnitude.... Additional farmer representation in the council is necessary. This would not in any way be detrimental to the interest of the community at large since farmers, as individuals, have a common stake with all other citizens in the safeguarding of human life.</P>
    <P>That is the view to which Deputy Rooney referred.  He was precise in saying that the Minister's amendment ignored that point of view.  I cannot understand why, in reply to Deputy Rooney, the Minister should misquote the document from the N.F.A.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Because he wanted a red herring and it was a pretty smelly one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the proposer of this amendment and the Deputies supporting it were apparently suggesting that in some way there would be balloting on such council, that matters would be decided by a vote, and so on.  Certainly no such view was present to any of our minds. No Deputy would feel that a council should operate or be constituted to operate in that way.  Even on the Minister's proposal, this council is intended to be representative of different minds and of different sections that can contribute to the advice that may be given to the Minister.  Even the five pharmaceutical chemists in the Minister's proposals are to be drawn in a special way.  One is to be a person concerned with the teaching of the poisons laws.  Another is to be a person on the Council of the Pharmaceutical College.  Others are to be chemists who have been engaged in the sale of poisons and dangerous drugs. So, in every way possible, the Minister seeks to get a representative cross-section in order that there should be available in the deliberations of the council different points of view.  That does not mean it is expected the council will decide matters by a vote.  They probably will not and probably it <Col N="895" /> would not be desirable that they should.</P>
      <P>What the Leader of the Opposition has said very effectively is that, with the tremendous development of all forms of chemical and therapeutic substances in the past 100 years and bearing in mind that this Bill must have an effect on the major industry, the livestock industry, there should be, as the N.F.A. say, more than a single voice in a council of 15 to represent the point of view of the farmer who is concerned each day with the requirements of livestock and animals and with the application of dangerous drugs and poisons.  That is an eminently reasonable submission when it is borne in mind that the advisory council will advise the Minister for Health and the Minister for Agriculture with regard to the sale, distribution, manufacture, limitation, control, and so on, of the different substances which will be defined as poisonous. Further, the council will advise the Minister on the making of regulations relating to the use of poisons.  It will obviously be very much present to the farmer's mind if there is a possibility that regulations may be made proscribing and prohibiting the use of poisons in the manner in which he has been accustomed to use them.  The Minister may say that that will not happen.  Deputy Loughman doubted that it could happen.  Legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas which, in operation, has been found to operate in quite a different way from what was intended.</P>
      <P>All we are concerned with, as I think most Deputies should also be concerned with, is to ensure that this new body, which is dealing with an entirely new situation, will have available to it not merely the view of a single farmer but the view of at least three farmers who know the common day-to-day problems which exist and who know what a farmer has to do and what he customarily has done in relation to various poisons and chemical substances for cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a reasonable proposition. I certainly fail to understand the heat <Col N="896" /> which this amendment has engendered in the Minister's mind.  We all know that the primary purpose of this Bill may be to safeguard human health.  Of course, it is, but you can safeguard human health in the way suggested here, without causing quite unnecessary inconvenience to other people.  All we are suggesting is that the council should be so constituted that unnecessary inconvenience, unnecessary restrictions and unnecessary controls will not be suggested by the council to either of the Ministers concerned.  That is best ensured by providing for additional farmer representation on the body to be set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of uneasiness among the rural fraternity about this Bill.  We all accept the necessity for the Bill, because in these days, when new drugs come on the market at all times, it is wise and prudent that there should be certain safeguards.  The very fact that the Minister had a document in his hand from the N.F.A. indicates quite positively that there is uneasiness.  We may assume that the N.F.A. is a body with a broad national conception and that it can speak, I think, as one of the first bodies in this country to represent the farmers organised on a national basis.</P>
      <P>Heretofore, the farmer was able to buy certain drugs on the market which prevented disease arriving at an acute stage.  Let us take the case of a farmer who has 20 cows, as many young calves, yearlings and, perhaps, two-year-olds. At the same time, he may have 20 sheep, exclusive of lambs, and as many pigs and poultry.  Hardly a day passes on the farm that one of these animals at some time does not show signs of illness.  If the farmer were to go to a vet on every occasion, when a menace of that kind appears, he would get nowhere in the end. Because of the patent medicines on the market and because of the co-operation of the pharmaceutical fraternity, he is able to get remedies that will tide him over any difficulty at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facilities heretofore afforded to the farmer may now disappear under this Bill.  The Minister has taken the <Col N="897" /> widest possible interpretation and I sincerely hope he is right in saying that no Minister will do anything either directly through regulations, or through his representatives on the board, to curtail the facilities heretofore afforded to the farming community. At the same time, there is fear and suspicion.  The best way to allay that fear and dispel these suspicions is to increase the representation asked for here.  It is not a political matter; it is an easy matter.  The Minister still has the power but if the Minister wants to make the Bill perfect and make it generally acceptable, I think it advisable that he should increase the farmer representation on the board.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister means well in what he said and that he is confident there will be no danger, but how can the farmers speak, except through their own representatives, on this council?  As individuals, they can have no say.  It is only as an organised community, through their representatives, that they will be able to have any influence on the board.  For that reason, I appeal to the Minister to be as sympathetic as possible and concede a little more than he has already conceded and widen the scope of the representation now being sought through the literature circulated by the N.F.A. and various other bodies throughout the country.  They have certain fears that, when this Bill comes into force, they will be denied the facilities they had before this Bill appeared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated that I was prepared to accede to the request by the N.F.A. that I should increase the number of persons to be nominated under paragraph (f).  If the House will agree to my amendment, I will bring in an amendment on Report Stage with certain consequential amendments to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister look at paragraph (g) on the assumption that paragraph (g) stands?  Would he be prepared to say that it would be his intention that, of those three persons, one should represent the agricultural community?  The farmers have fears <Col N="898" /> that if they go into a body of this kind, one fellow may find himself alone without anyone to consult.  It is extremely difficult for him adequately to discharge his responsibility.  He may suffer himself to be talked down for the want of somebody to consult with and determine whether an issue falling to be considered is one upon which he ought not to take a very strong line or one upon which he could compromise in the circumstances.  It is as easy as that.  If it were indicated that the one in paragraph (f) was to be two and that the Minister for Health proposed to use his powers under paragraph (g) to appoint another person in the farming interest, I think the difficulty would be largely overcome.</P>
      <P>There is no use in Deputy Loughman or any other Deputy arguing that the farmers will be satisfied with a poisons council which has on it two doctors, five chemists and two farmers.  They think that is inequitable.  I should much prefer to see this council working; I should much prefer to see a proposal of this kind get off on the right foot.  If it does, we shall probably hear nothing more about it.  It will function quite quietly, but if there is an enduring sense of grievance, I think it creates an unnecessary sense of distrust in the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>I feel that sense of responsibility.  I feel it is something grossly inappropriate to provide the present balance on the council, particularly having regard to the Minister's original proposal. When the Minister first had this matter under consideration, he proposed in the original Bill that there should be two doctors, two chemists, two veterinary surgeons, one person with a knowledge of poisonous substances in agriculture and three other persons nominated by himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He then produces an amendment in which the two chemists become five chemists and a proposal that there should be one other person with a knowledge of poisonous substances in agriculture and one person representative of the farming community. I submit that that is simply looking for trouble.  It gives rise to a resentment <Col N="899" /> which I do not think unreasonable. If the Minister thought it right to increase representation in relation to the pharmaceutical society from two to five, I do not think it is unreasonable for the farming community to say they should have three men, so that, in all circumstances two would be there to lend their joint wisdom to the council.</P>
    <P>I do not want this council to function as a combination of contending vested interests.  The best thing that could happen in respect of this council would be that we would never hear its name again, that it would function quietly and discreetly, and that its recommendations would command virtually unanimous consent.  I do not want a situation to arise in which every order made under this Bill will invite the suspicious, apprehensive attention of every farmers' organisation in the country.  I believe you will effectively avoid that if you appoint three representatives of the farming community.  I believe that if you do less, you will create the very evil I apprehend.</P>
    <P>I do not want to force the Minister to accept my words, Deputy Blowick's words, or anyone else's words.  The Minister has indicated, by putting down his amendment, that he has had second thoughts and believes now he ought to have two persons under paragraph (f).  If he does not want to go the whole way with regard to paragraph (f), would he consider under paragraph (g) availing of the services of one person who would be generally esteemed to be a person with an understanding of these problems from the farmers' point of view?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If I say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to every amendment designed to secure additional representation for certain specialist interests, I do not know where I shall stop.  There is a practical problem arising inasmuch as we should then have an unwiedly council, and we cannot have an unwiedly council.  When I was considering the council originally, my anxiety was to keep it as small as possible.  There is a belief&mdash;I do not subscribe fully to it <Col N="900" /> myself&mdash;that the smaller the committee, the more work is done and the more expeditiously the committee works.  I have certain reservations with regard to that.  However, having listened to the debate on Second Reading, I came to certain conclusions.  First of all, I decided, because of the important part the pharmaceutical profession plays in the distribution of poisonous substances, that there should be on the council some person who is not only a qualified pharmaceutical chemist, but whose main occupation is the teaching of pharmacy.  From that, other considerations arose.  The National Farmers Association have been asking for special representation for what might be described as the agricultural community.  I decided I would concede that.  Arising out of that, there was an anxiety to have a certain balance on the council and there was an enlargement of the council in other directions until it expanded from 10 to 15.  How much further is it intended we should go?</P>

      <P>No, and that is not what is being suggested.  The farmer is a very important element in our community, but he is not the whole by any means.  There are other people who have interests in this and who will claim very loudly that they also are entitled to be heard on the council.  I am not conceding specific representation, but I am saying that, because of the use which farmers make of <Col N="901" /> these poisonous substances, there should be some person on the council to detail the problems which may confront the farmer if a certain regulation is made.</P>
      <P>Do not forget that there are other people engaged in very vital lines of manufacturing, for instance, who also have an interest.  In the manufacturing industry, the use of poisonous substances is expanding rapidly.  I must also have regard to the position of those whose business may call upon them to handle these substances, not for sale to farmers but to others.  We should, as I said, think in terms of the community as a whole.  When the Bill was before the House on Second Reading, one feature of the council which received commendation from the Leader of the Labour Party was the proposal that there should be three other persons, irrespective of whether or not they had any specialist qualifications, to speak for the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to accept that I am going as far as I reasonably can, having regard to the fact that I want to keep the size of the council within limits. I may have to come in with a consequential amendment on the Report Stage to deal with the case of the medical profession, not as users or as having any interest in the drug but merely as persons who would be able to say the extent to which certain substances are therapeutic substances or have therapeutic values.  I would be prepared, on the Report Stage, to bring in an amendment to increase the number under paragraph (f) to two and I would ask the Leader of the Opposition not to press me to make a commitment which some Minister for Health might find a great embarrassment to him when he comes to set up a council.  I do not exclude the possibility that there may be a person who could be regarded as a farmer but, if he were to go on the council, that would not be the reason that he was going on it.  He would be a person with some other qualification and it would be an additional assistance if he had also an knowledge of farming.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 1 to amendment 1:</P>
      <P>To add to subsection (3) the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) At least one of the persons referred to in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section shall be a person who has special knowledge and experience of the application of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934, to hospital practice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment as much to get information from the Minister as part of a suggestion which I think might be of some assistance to him in farming this new legislation.  The reason I have suggested that the council should have a person of a specialised knowledge or experience of the operation of the Dangerous Drugs Acts in hospital practice arises from certain historic developments and personal experience in hospital practice.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister's position in regard to the increase in the size of the council.  If a Minister has any experience of councils and if he wants to ensure that a council will not work he accepts all the recommendations made to him regarding the inclusion of all possible vested interests.  It is reasonable that a council of this kind should be kept within reasonable limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I suggest that there is a case for trying to ensure that the members of the pharmaceutical profession are included on it.  The position <Col N="903" /> has changed very much since the passing of the original Dangerous Drugs Act and the amending Act and it seems to me that while the Pharmaceutical Society have taken very great pains, with considerable success, to ensure that the use of drugs will be exercised in a most careful way in order to achieve the end which the Minister suggests is the main objective of the Bill&mdash;that drugs cannot be wilfully used or wilfully misused&mdash;in that I think the Pharmaceutical Society has been most successful in regard to the ordinary use of drugs by the pharmacists themselves and by members of the medical profession.  They have succeeded in achieving a certain measure of control in the use of drugs and in that way I think the large scale abuse of dangerous drugs has been avoided to a considerable extent.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a very considerable change in the use of dangerous drugs caused by the marked expansion in hospital services, in the use of hospitals of one kind or another. I do not think that the Society of Pharmaceutical Chemists have taken that great change into account to the extent they might have.  I do not think they have extended the meticulous supervision of the storage and use of drugs to hospital practice that they have to ordinary medical practice. While it is true to say that many hospitals have introduced their own system and regulations for the control of drugs so that there is the same security in the use of these drugs in these hospitals as there is outside in general practice, I suspect that there are a number of hospitals, possibly the smaller ones, in which there is not this same respect or fear of the drugs which are used in practice particularly in regard to human beings.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the same stringent precautions are not exercised and for that reason I think that a chemist with special experience in hospital practice would be a useful addition to the council.  I do not mean that addition as an individual but that should be one of the necessary qualifications of one of the pharmacists included on the council.  I think that is establishing <Col N="904" /> no new precedent here.  The chemist primarily experienced in hospital practice is as different in practice from the chemist in ordinary practice outside as the difference between a dispensary doctor and a specialist or a specialist and a medical officer of health.</P>
    <P>Most Ministers attempt in the various commissions and councils to see that all these different interests are represented.  It could be said that any doctor could represent the specialist, the medical officer of health and the dispensary doctor; but I do not think that is accepted generally. We try to see that each different interest is represented and that they will be in a position to give their own practical experience of work of this kind in the discussion of the problems which come before them.  Consequently, I think, the pharmacist, with his special experience, would be a help to this council.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable expansion in hospital practice and a very much greater number of people go to hospital now for treatment. There is a much greater choice of drugs, dangerous in one way or another, available in a hospital.  It is more than likely that the average hospital pharmacist is in control of very much greater stores of drugs&mdash; not that that is the important point&mdash; but he certainly is in control of as large stocks of drugs as the pharmacist outside.  When the Dangerous Drugs Act was first introduced the drugs available, particularly drugs from an addiction point of view, were very limited: opium, the various compounds of it, morphia and a few of these very basic drugs.  But that has changed very much now.  One has not only the different groups of opium derivatives, but one has the new synthetic, sedative, pain-killing, soporific type of drugs, all tremendously increased and under the control of a hospital chemist.</P>
    <P>Of course, that is the operative point.  Are they under the control of the hospital chemist to anything like the same extent as they are under the control of the chemist outside?  The Minister is concerned, and has tried to emphasise the whole time that he is <Col N="905" /> concerned for the public welfare.  That must be true, and I accept that in this Bill.  But it seems to me it is important, therefore, that somebody must have ultimate and absolute responsibility. The ordering, storing and issuing of drugs should be all related, if one can put it that way, to one individual person; and I think the hospital pharmacist is that person.</P>
    <P>How that is to be done without offending the various other interests in the hospital, the matrons, the medical profession, the nursing profession, and at the same time giving them freedom of action, giving them ready access in emergencies to these drugs, is a matter with which the council should concern itself.  There are many practical points which will come up, not readily obvious to anybody who does not work in a hospital, and in regard to which, I think, a pharmacist with hospital experience could be of great help.</P>
    <P>It is a fact also that in a hospital it has been shown that&mdash;whether it is a consequence of or sequel to it or not I do not know&mdash;the incidence of drug addiction is probably highest amongst members of the medical profession and, I understand, is very high, relatively, amongst members of the nursing profession.  Obviously, this is no criticism of them at all, and it is not intended as such.  But it does seem to me to suggest that there is a case for a rather more stringent supervision and control of drugs in hospitals.</P>
    <P>It might be said by the Minister that the best judges of this whole matter are the Pharmaceutical Society, who appreciate these difficulties. If that is so, they have not, to my knowledge at any rate, drawn up anything like the same stringent regulations for the use of drugs in hospital practice as they have done for outside practice.  For that reason, I have put down this amendment in order to, possibly, improve the Bill. But it may be that the Minister will be in a position to tell us whether he is completely satisfied with the control and use of drugs in hospital practice and whether he has any information at his disposal which makes him feel <Col N="906" /> that the system under which drugs are controlled in hospitals at the moment is particularly satisfactory.</P>
    <P>This council should make as one of its first tasks the establishment of some kind of uniform system to be adopted by all hospitals for the use and control of drugs, that a uniform system of regulations under the Dangerous Drugs Acts should be extended to all hospitals and that the same system of inspection should be established by them and accepted by the hospitals who use these dangerous drugs.  The drawing up of such a uniform scheme is a very difficult matter.  It will have to cover all sorts of institutions, mental hospitals, sanatoria, general hospitals and nursing homes.  I suggest to the Minister that his council would be greatly assisted by having a person who had very considerable experience of as many forms as possible of the application of the Dangerous Drugs Acts in hospital practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Deputy not to press this amendment. I feel that, in so far as it relates particularly to the use of certain substances in hospital practice, it is rather outside the general intention of the Bill.  After all, what the Minister for Health is empowered to do is set out in Section 14.  There it will be seen, in subsection (3), that, without prejudice to the other regulations that may be made, the emphasis is laid upon the sale and keeping for sale of poisons.  It is true that under paragraph (b) of subsection (2) regulations may be made with respect to the storage, transport and keeping for sale of poisons; but I think this must be read as that it is in respect of storage for the purpose of having for sale certain poisons.  Therefore, I would ask the Deputy not to press the amendment. First of all, it does not fall strictly within the scheme of the Bill.  Is this not a matter to be dealt with under the Dangerous Drugs Act?  I do not think it quite fits into the picture on this Bill.  When we come to consider the question of appointments to the council, we might get someone who might have to possess the special <Col N="907" /> knowledge and experience to which the Deputy's amendment refers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11a:</P>
      <P>11a.  In page 6, to add to the section the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Neither section 13 of the County Management Act, 1940, nor section 17 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, shall apply in respect of any power, function or duty relating to licensing or registering of persons or premises under regulations under subsection (3) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in Section 14 subsection (3) subparagraph (d)&mdash;I think that is what Deputy Loughman had in mind.  Section 14 (3) (d) provides for the licensing or registering by health authorities of persons outside these, shall we say, specialist categories, who are engaged in selling or offering or keeping for sale poisons and of premises in which poisons are sold or offered or kept for sale.  It is intended that in future the licences to do this should be granted by the county manager in person, that he should not delegate that function, but that he should grant these licences in person so that they will be granted by a responsible person.  There is, of course, a right of appeal from any refusal on his part to grant a licence. The existing system needs to be tightened up somewhat.  I gather it is somewhat lax in its administration <Col N="914" /> and, in view of the fact that we are now dealing with very dangerous preparations, it is felt that there should be some specific person who should carry responsibility for the issuing of these licences.  At the same time, we are providing for an appeal from such a person to the Minister in the case of a refusal to grant a licence.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 14, as amended, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 15.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (b), lines 34 and 35, to delete &ldquo;and veterinary&rdquo; and in lines 37 and 38 to delete &ldquo;or veterinary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment has been put down in the sense of the earlier discussion we had on Section 4 and it expresses the concern which is felt by a large number of Deputies on our side of the House, and probably on other sides of the House also, in relation to what may be involved under Section 15.</P>
      <P>Section 15 applies to the Minister for Agriculture and under the section, as I understand it, the Minister for Agriculture on the recommendation of the council is empowered to make regulations declaring, I assume, from time to time, particular substances which may be in common use amongst farmers to be poisons for the purpose of the Act.  If he declares them to be poisons, then it is just as if they were scheduled and named as such.  However, the regulations made go on to specify and deal with the use of these substances for agricultural and veterinary purposes.  Agricultural purposes we can except at the moment because we understand that to have reference to the use of weed killers, fertilisers and things of that kind but when it goes on to say &ldquo;and veterinary purposes&rdquo; we on this side of the House query whether that is wise or proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment and traditionally there are a large number of animal maladies which are treated and cured by various bottles and mixtures which <Col N="915" /> are obtained from different chemists and druggists throughout the country and they are prescribed and given by the owner of the livestock involved.  We are concerned, in relation to the section as it stands, lest regulations may be made, as they appear possible to be made under the section, prohibiting the use of these substances in future for what may be called veterinary purposes.  It is not defined in the Bill but we assume a veterinary purpose is any purpose intended to cure an animal of a malady from which it is suffering.  We are concerned to know whether this will mean from now on that farmers keeping any form of livestock may have to engage the services of a practitioner in veterinary medicine in order to apply and administer a simple cure, which incidentally may be defined as a poison, to an animal suffering from some malady.</P>
    <P>If that is the effect of the section, we would be very much opposed to it and the purpose of the amendment which is down in my name is to exclude from the operation of the section the word &ldquo;veterinary&rdquo;&mdash;the other amendments are just consequential on amendment No. 13&mdash;and to continue the right which is traditional and which I think has been accepted in an earlier part of the debate of any owner of livestock to administer any form of cure by a bottle or substance that he thinks will overcome the malady from which his animal is suffering.</P>
    <P>This council is being set up and power is being given to it to consider all these matters, to advise on regulations, and so on, in relation to the sale, processing, manufacture and distribution of various poisons and we are now in Section 15 dealing with a chemical substance the sale, manufacture and distribution of which is pretty well scrutinised and controlled. We are concerned that a farmer who goes into a chemist shop, or wherever he goes, and buys a mixture or a bottle which he wants to administer to a beast that he has at home is not put in the position that he cannot do this in future without engaging a professional person to prescribe for him <Col N="916" /> what he always done up to this himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>If I thought what Deputy O'Higgins says would happen I would be glad to support him, but there are drugs and medicines manufactured which may be a danger to the person using them and might be even a danger to animals other than the animal which is being treated. It is proper that the council should have power to make representations to the Minister and that the Minister should have power to make regulations prohibiting the use by incompetent persons of certain very vicious medical preparations.  It is absolutely essential that this clause should be in the Bill and I do not anticipate that it will infringe in any way on the rights of farmers using any of the ordinary or even extraordinary drugs that may appear.  I regard this provision merely as a protection for the user of the drug and to a certain extent as a protection to animals.</P>

      <P>This amendment is carefully drafted: &ldquo;To delete the word `veterinary' &rdquo; while leaving in the section the word &ldquo;agricultural.&rdquo;  There may be poisonous sprays which it is necessary to control under certain regulations for the protection of personnel who are charged with the responsibility of spraying, who might by accident come in contact with such sprays with consequent detriment to the health of themselves or other persons who might inadvertently come within their range.  However, it is fantastic to say that regulations are going to be made to control the use of drugs on animals.  Why?  What is the point of it?  If a man wants to kill his own beast why should Parliament intervene to stop him?</P>

The trouble about pharmaceutical chemists and other professional persons is that they get so anxious about their neighbour's <Col N="917" /> health that they would put us all in institutions behind bars to protect us from ourselves.  I wish these interested parties would leave us alone.  We have survived so far, reared families and we have not poisoned ourselves, burned ourselves or choked ourselves. These people make it virtually impossible to carry on any activity, they are so anxious we will not burn our fingers or cut our hands.  The pharmaceutical chemists should remember they would have to shut their shops if the farmers were not coming into them.</P>

Farmers are reasonable people and they know that certain poisonous sprays of recent invention require control in order to prevent promiscuous damage being done but where you are giving a pig an injection of penicillin or acromycin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £680 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide an additional sum for the Commission on the Restoration of the Irish Language and also to provide for the travelling and incidental expenses of the Commission on Itinerancy.  The amount for the Commission on the Restoration of the Irish Language is £580 and for the Commission on Itinerancy £600, but savings on other subheads amount to £500, so that the net additional amount required is £680.  When the original provision was being prepared, it was expected that the Commission on the Irish Language would report by the 30th September, 1960.  As it is now clear that the Commission will not report before the end of the financial year, it is necessary to make provision for a full year and an additional sum of £580 is required.  The staff consists of an executive officer and a clerk-typist. I am now told that they hope to be able to bring in a final report by the end of next May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on Itinerancy was <Col N="919" /> established last June and there is no provision for it in the original Estimate.  The sum of £600 is required to meet the travelling and incidental expenses of the Commission in the current year.</P>

      <P>I thought that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach might perhaps come to the House and give us some explanation as to what is happening in respect of the Commission on the Restoration of the Irish Language.  Perhaps the Taoiseach himself will understand what is puzzling us in this matter.  The Commission was set up in July, 1958 and at least one Dublin daily paper was saying more than two years ago that we would have the report in about six months and another daily paper spoke of how urgent the matter was and said that the report would be very soon with us and spoke of the effect it would have.</P>
      <P>When we look at the figures in front of us now and the figure in front of us for the coming year, we are rather puzzled.  The original Estimate for 1960-61 was £630.  Now the Taoiseach is asking for an additional £580, but while we can understand that the Commission is running later than it was expected to run, when we look at the Taoiseach's Estimate for this year, we find that the total of £1,400 is being sought for the year 1960-61 and of that £1,400, £770 is being sought under the heading of &ldquo;Costas Taistil, etc.&rdquo; Therefore, more money is down in the Estimates for 1960-61 for travelling etc. than was asked for in the total Estimate last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We have it here under the heading &ldquo;An Coimisiún um Athbheochan na Gaeilge&rdquo; and then the figures are given for that&mdash; tuarastail agus rl.  Costas Taistil is down for &ldquo;An Coimisiún um Athbheochan <Col N="920" /> na Gaeilge&rdquo; in the Estimates for 1961-62 as £770 out of a total of £1,400.  When we put that against the original Estimate for the Commission last year of £630, something important in the development and work of the Commission would appear to require explanation.</P>
      <P>When these matters come up on the Taoiseach's Estimate, the Taoiseach will understand there will not be much room for discussion on the work of the Commission, but when we have the opportunity of discussing a Supplementary Estimate on an occasion like this, it seems to me to suggest that in an important matter like this, it is desirable that we should have a short statement as to how the work of the Commission is proceeding and what has developed in relation to this important matter they are discussing to bring about a situation in which not only does it not conclude in the way in which it was expected to conclude, but that in the Estimate for next year, the sum being estimated for is almost greater on the whole than the total sum now being looked for, even with this Supplementary Estimate. The revised Estimate for this year is £1,210 and it seems to me that the Estimate under this heading is £1,400 for next year, of which £770 is to be for travelling.</P>
      <P>The point I particularly wish to make is that so much time has now passed that the presentation of a Supplementary Estimate should give an opportunity to inform the House as to what exactly is proceeding in the Commission, what important developments have taken place in their outlook or their research that have extended it for so long and have called for the expenditure of so much money for the financial year before us as well as for the present one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point I wish to make in this connection.  We have the experience of the position in which commissions do a lot of preparatory work well ahead in preparing substantial reports but nothing is done to get the part of the report that is prepared sent to the printers or made ready in any way for distribution.  We have <Col N="921" /> the situation now in which a Commission under another Department has been six years in session.  It must have had the greater part of its report substantially prepared 18 months ago and, as far as I know, none of it has been sent to the printers yet.</P>
    <P>I feel there is a general situation that is tolerated in respect of Government and Parliamentary printing that no commercial firm would tolerate.  I do not know who is responsible for it, but, as the Taoiseach is here, I should like to mention that Government business generally in relation to printing is not being handled as any progressive commercial firm would handle it and the prestige and the work of Parliament are suffering by lack of attention to that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the work of the Commission, I cannot give the Deputy much information, as he will appreciate.  Some time last year, I met the chairman of the Commission and he intimated to me that the work was proceeding at that stage very satisfactorily, so much so that he hoped to have the report of the Commission completed some time during the year, and it was on the basis of that expectation then expressed that the Estimate for last year was prepared. Obviously, some situation must have arisen in the Commission which delayed the completion of the report and my present expectation is that it will come along some time about the end of May.  The Deputy, however, must not ask me to explain what particular problem the Commission encountered which made it necessary for them to spend so much longer over the completion of their report.  I should hope that the additional time which they gave to it would add to the value of their report when we get it.</P>

    <P>The total of these amounts is £77,000.  Of this, £27,000 is being met through savings under the other subheads of the Vote and increased appropriations-in-aid so that the net amount of the supplementary estimate for primary education is £50,000.</P>

      <P>Nor am I going to go into it in detail, but I want to refer to the necessity, which I submit does arise on this Supplementary Estimate, of providing specially trained teachers to deal with the problem of mentally handicapped children.  This Supplementary Estimate deals with the training colleges and I suggest I am entitled to refer to the work done in these colleges and the manner in which, in my view, this work should be improved.  I want to take the opportunity of suggesting to the Minister that at present there is a great need for increasing the number of special teachers who are capable of dealing with mentally handicapped children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position, as I understand it at <Col N="924" /> present, is that there is a very great lack of teachers capable of dealing with this problem.  There are a great number of children who do not get the training and teaching which their particular type of handicap requires.  I should like to see a concerted effort made to ensure that we have a sufficient number of teachers specially trained to deal with these unfortunate children.  I am quite satisfied that the teachers would come forward.  I know that one of the problems is that this is a very special type of vocation, that a very special type of people are required and very special gifts are needed to deal with children who are mentally handicapped or mentally retarded.  I do feel that among our teaching staffs at present, and outside among people who are working among these children, among social workers in other branches of social activity, there are people who would be prepared to devote themselves to this work of helping mentally handicapped children.  I feel it is necessary for us to organise on a very large scale a number of teachers who will be in a position to deal with this problem.</P>

      <P>The need for the Supplementary Estimate for £86,000 arose from the introduction as from 1 February 1960 of improved scales of incremental salaries for secondary teachers which were agreed upon as a result of discussions at the Secondary Teachers' Conciliation Council.

    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for Science and Art is merely a token Vote to enable savings for various subheads to be applied to increase grants payable from other subheads.  The additional grants have become necessary in order to facilitate the extension of the work of certain organisations concerned with the furtherance of the Irish language.  The additional grants may be classed as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  £600 for Cumann Drámaíochta na Scol.  The present provision in the Vote for this organisation is £850.  The need for the additional money arises from the growing number of Irish drama festivals in connection with schools.  The work of Cumann Drámaíochta na Scol in this regard is generally acknowledged to be of the greatest possible help in the furtherance of the spoken language.</P>
    <P>(b)  £5,500 for Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge.  Of this, £4,660 is needed for a number of schemes for the promotion of Irish, of which the principal one is a project for the promotion of the sales of books and periodicals in Irish by the appointment of special organisers for that purpose.  It is expected that, through the work of these organisers, together with the existing book-clubs and readers' circles, the market will thus be extended and both writers and publishers encouraged thereby. The remainder of the sum concerned is required to cover administration costs including increased salaries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> (c)  In addition to the grants for periodicals in Irish and newspapers publishing current news in Irish for which provision is already included under this subhead (B 7) it is proposed that a grant of £1,100 be provided for the fortnightly periodical <i>Amárach</i>, the organ of &ldquo;Muintir na Gaeltachta&rdquo;. It is expected that a total of 24 issues will have qualified for grant by the end of the current financial year.</P>
    <P>(d)  Coimisiún Béaloideasa Éireann&mdash; the Irish Folklore Commission.  An addition of £700 is needed for salary increases, with effect as from 1st October last, for the staff who had not received the cost of living increases granted in recent years.</P>

    <Title>Poisons Bill, 1960&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 15.&mdash;In subsection (1) (b), lines 34 and 35, to delete &ldquo;and veterinary&rdquo; and in lines 37 and 38 to delete &ldquo;or veterinary&rdquo;.&mdash;(Deputy T.F. O'Higgins).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will look at Section 15, he will see that subsection (1) (b) provides:</P>
      <P>In relation to the use of poisons for agricultural and veterinary purposes, including regulations prohibiting, restricting or controlling the use of poisons or particular poisons for agricultural or veterinary purposes or particular agricultural or veterinary purposes.</P>
      <P>We are prepared to agree with such regulations to control the use of poisonous materials for agricultural purposes because there are poisonous sprays which, unless used with special precautions, may cause unexpected damage not only to crops but to the health of those putting them out or, indeed, to the health of neighbours who may inadvertently come in contact with them.  When you come to veterinary preparations, however, we think power should not be vested in the Minister to control the use of particular poisons used for veterinary purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the word &ldquo;poison&rdquo; in ordinary use has a pejorative sense, but, in the context of this Bill, any substance can be scheduled as a poison and thereafter comes within the ambit of the Bill.  The Minister points out that, as the law stands, a preparation like penicillin is not scheduled as a poison. There is a wide variety of other antibiotics&mdash;acromycin, aureomycin&mdash;and the list continues continually to grow. <Col N="933" /> I can well imagine at some subsequent date a strong case being made to schedule all antibiotics.  I can well imagine Deputy Dr. Browne painting lurid pictures for us of septicaemic infection raging through children's hospitals because a resistant strain of bacilli had developed through too frequent and casual contact with antibiotics. We are all weary of the stories surrounding the staphylococcus that has grown up with penicillin and now, in the fifth and sixth generation, bids defiance to it.  It is argued that in some cases none of the newly discovered antibiotics will effectively control this resistant strain.  Very probably, there is a great deal of truth in these stories, but they have little or no relevance to veterinary circumstances. You do not keep pigs in a hospital ward.  In any case, the pig is fated to live, by its nature, for no more than 24 weeks; it is born to die and be converted into bacon.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of bringing in this power to control the use of poisons in their veterinary application? I can well understand the strict control of drugs of addiction, such as the derivatives of morphia.  I can well understand the control of drugs in relation to which casual contact can do irreparable damage.  I can understand their being controlled for all purposes.  I fail to see why there should be a restriction on the use of poisons for veterinary purposes specifically set out in this Bill and including a power to make regulations prohibiting, restricting or controlling the use of these poisons.  The apprehension rightly entertained, I think, by the agricultural community is that gradually we will be faced with regulations which will, in effect, put an obligation upon the farmer to hire a vet on each occasion on which he wishes to use one of these preparations. The cost of doing that will be simply prohibitive and the only result of it will be that the farmer will let the animal die.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say: &ldquo;But these preparations you have in mind will never be scheduled as poison.&rdquo;  That is the question.  All we suggest here <Col N="934" /> is that where they are scheduled as poisons for the purpose of this Bill, which, after all, is an omnibus Bill for the general control of poisons, there should be no restrictions where they are intended for use only with animals. If the Minister says that, apart from what are technically defined poisons, there may be other substances which are of so dangerous a character that they must be controlled absolutely, such as heroin or morphia, I would be prepared to consider a proposal that there should be a special schedule of these substances rigidly controlling them for all purposes&mdash;we ought, of course, to know what they are&mdash;but that would be a very different proposition from the general proposition that there should be power here to regulate or prohibit, restrict or control, the use of substances scheduled as poisons under the general powers of this Bill.  If we delete the word &ldquo;veterinary&rdquo; I think a great deal of the legitimate apprehension of the agricultural community will be removed.  I urge the Minister, at least experimentally, to make that deletion and see how it works.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Dillon has said, but I want to go a little further.  I go back to my youth.  In the farrier trade, poisons were used in the care and cure of horses' feet.  Some of the substances used were deadly poisons but the farrier could procure them by signing the book and stating the purpose for which he required them.  He was, of course, known to the chemist and he was able to get whatever he wanted.</P>
      <P>Even though the horse population is smaller than it was when I was there, it is still a specific for the cure of certain diseases well known to all reliable farriers.  If this Bill passes, he no longer can get it or use it and must bring a veterinary surgeon to apply it or use it.  These men, who know their business and know it well, should not be prohibited from exercising one of the arts of their trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that this is a trade secret of the farriers which they have never disclosed.  It was passed on from father to son.  It was passed from my <Col N="935" /> father to me and if we had an apprentice, it was only given to him in the last year of his apprenticeship on the solemn undertaking that he would not disclose it to anybody else.  Now it can no longer be purchased by the farrier or be used by him in his trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to correct a misapprehension under which Deputy MacEoin is labouring.  There is nothing in this section which empowers regulations to be made regulating or prohibiting the sale of drugs so that, as far as Section 15 of the Bill is concerned, the farrier or his apprentice to whom Deputy MacEoin refers can still go to the chemist and bring back the secret remedy, that is, if they still use it.  In order to put that amendment No. 15, specifically written that reservation into the Bill.  So far matter beyond doubt, I have, in as the purchase or sale of poisons which are used in agriculture or for veterinary purpose are concerned, the Deputy, or any other member of the House who has apprehensions about the matter, can rest easy in his mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing in this Bill with traditional remedies. If the only poisonous substances which are being rapidly developed were the remedies which were in habitual use by the farming community over the years, we should have no problem. This Bill would not be necessary.  The world has moved on even since the time when Deputy MacEoin was a boy and new substances are being developed with great rapidity.  It is one of the problems of modern medical practice, and, I might add, of modern veterinary practice, to keep up with the new drugs that are coming on the market. The problem with which we have to deal arises from the fact that many of these new drugs are deadly poisonous, if improperly used.  Many of these poisons find their way into veterinary products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition and <Col N="936" /> Deputy O'Higgins did not close their eyes to that problem.  They said that they had not any great objection to the section as it stands if it confines itself to substances which are used in agriculture. Deputy Dillon referred to the fact that many sprays and insecticides and other material could be poisonous to beasts as well as to humans.  Therefore, the Opposition were not prepared to deny that the Minister for Agriculture, having some responsibility for the general care and welfare of agriculture in this country, should have power to control the use of these dangerous substances when they are utilised for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>Surely, it is not very logical to say that these substances should be controlled because their use may be dangerous to the human being or the farm animal and then to say that you will not give the Minister power to regulate or control the use of perhaps the same substance, or derivatives of that substance, if used for veterinary purposes.  I cannot see the force of that.  The Opposition are prepared to allow these poisons used for agricultural purposes to be regulated and controlled in use because they are dangerous to human beings or animals. It is a secondary danger.  It arises from the fact that they might be taken orally, by inhalation or even by contact.  They are absorbed only in minute doses and their toxicity is not immediately noticeable, but it grows over time and the animal or human being falls ill or dies.</P>
    <P>If you are going to do that in relation to those substances utilised in agriculture, how can you say that it is unreasonable to try to regulate the use of these new drugs for veterinary purposes? That, it seems to me, is a question to which you cannot find a logical or reasonable answer.  It is not, as Deputy Dillon suggests, a case of a farmer allowing, by the misuse of these drugs, his beast to die.  If that were all we had to take care of, we would not be very much concerned.  The trouble is that some of these new drugs can be very harmful to human beings and when we speak of controlling the use of them, what is really intended is that <Col N="937" /> the regulations will prescribe how they can be safely used.  In the vast majority of cases, they prescribe that they should not be applied by the person without some sort of protection against their absorption in the ways I have mentioned. Take the case of medication for the warble fly.  We all know that derris powder has been very successfully used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dead?  I said it has been very successfully used. Deputy Dillon has been good enough to remind me that it has fallen into disuse and that no person uses it now. No doubt they use another substance, a substance which may be given as a drench or applied as a lotion.  These preparations contain phosphorus.  As is commonly known, phosphorus is a very deadly poison.  There is a very great risk indeed that a person applying one of these new preparations containing phosphorus may be poisoned himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait now.  It is not a case of drinking this drench or licking this ointment.  It is a case of a person applying it without taking precautions against his injury.  If a person drinks iodine, I presume he drinks it because he is tired of life or wants to make people believe he is tired of life. No person, if he is applying a drench to a beast or applying a balsam or ointment, does that for the sake of trying to commit suicide or pretending to commit suicide.  There is a danger; and the members of the Opposition, for the purpose of making debating points, ought not lose sight of it.  Not only that, but it has been well established that the meat or milk from animals which have been treated in this way may cause illness.  Surely we are entitled to try to safeguard the consumer of the meat or milk against that contingency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows as well as I do what I said.  I said that if milk or meat from an animal treated in this way is sold within a certain time, not a very specific time, those who eat the meat or drink the milk may become very ill indeed because the phosphatic poison is to be found in the milk and in the flesh of that animal.  Surely we must have regard to that fact when we are discussing this? We are not just talking about prohibiting the farmer from giving a dose to a pig.  What we are really trying to ensure is that human beings will not suffer.</P>
      <P>There are other preparations which contain antimony and mercury, both deadly poisons.  Antimony is used for treating foot rot in sheep and mercury preparations are used for treating lameness in horses.  Surely if preparations containing these deadly poisons are to be sold and put into common use, we are entitled to take, in relation to them, the same sort of precautions as we take in regard to weed killers? Deputy MacEoin was talking about the master farrier going to the chemist or druggist, buying dangerous drugs containing poison and having to sign the book for them.  Do you not have to do that if you are buying weed killer?  Does there not have to be a record?  If you make regulations prescribing that a person who wants to buy weed killer must sign the book and that he must be readily identified by the chemist, what objection can you have to enforcing the same order in respect of a person who wants to buy a veterinary preparation which contains antimony or mercury?</P>
      <P>The principal constituent of weed killer is, I understand, arsenic.  Some sheep dips contain arsenic.  Is it not necessary to ensure that in the manufacture of the sheep dip the arsenic content will be kept at a level which will not poison even the animal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not accepted that there is some justification for ensuring that the arsenic content does not rise to such a level that it may be dangerous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Do you not think, being dangerous to human life, it should be subject to certain safeguards? Go into any factory in this country and you will find that around every machine there is placed a safety fence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Any moving belt has to be enclosed in such a way as to ensure that no human being will be injured by accidental contact.  If you do that in relation to all manufacturing industry, is there any great objection or any reasonable objection to ensuring that, whenever farmers are handling dangerous substances, they will handle them in such a way that there will be the least possible risk to themselves or anybody else?  That is why this section applies to veterinary preparations as well as preparations used in agriculture.</P>
      <P>What possibility is there under Section 18 of the Bill, as it stands, that any of these things referred to by Deputy Dillon and Deputy MacEoin could happen?  Every regulation made under this Bill must come before this House and if there were anything wrong in a regulation which might interfere unreasonably or irrationally with the ordinary safe use of these preparations, it would be pounced upon immediately in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be pounced upon not only by the Opposition but by members of this side of the House as well.  Is that not the great safety of this&mdash;that any regulation made under Sections 14 or 15 <Col N="940" /> must come before the House?  What is the reason, at this stage, honestly to suggest that the provision applying these safeguards to veterinary preparations should be taken out of the Bill?  Why not give the Minister power to make regulations, which must come before the House? If the Minister for Agriculture should be foolish enough to come to the House and to find the weight of argument against him from both sides, surely he will not persist in making the regulation.</P>
      <P>I think we have a great safeguard here.  I suggest it is not wise to exclude veterinary preparations from the context of the section.  We should let the Bill go as it stands and wait to see the first regulations made.  If the Minister for Agriculture is not content to be judicious in a matter of this kind, it is quite possible for the Opposition to bring in a Private Members' Bill to give effect to the amendment they are proposing to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the necessity for controlling the poisons used for agricultural purposes because their ordinary user involves the dissemination of a spray.  That means the spray floats on the wind.  It may float back on the sprayer to his detriment; it may float over the ditch on to neighbour's crops; or it may float on to a neighbour and do him serious injury.  It is because it is of the nature of agricultural chemicals to be used as a spray that we recognise they fall into a special category.  When we come to veterinary preparations, we are face to face with the established fact that when you attach the label poison to anything, you seem to discuss it in a wholly special atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a dangerous commodity.  Then you come to discuss butter of antimony and in so far as the Minister knows, nobody in South Tipperary, for instance, has had himself sprayed with butter of antimony.  There are a variety of poisons which are exclusively used in the treatment of animals' ills, such as copper sulphate which is commonly used in the treatment of foot-rot in sheep.  If you drank it, you would poison yourself.  You could burn yourself with it, but you would <Col N="941" /> not and if you did it once, you would not do it a second time.</P>
    <P>But you could poison yourself with practically any commodity you picked up on the road if you wanted to poison yourself with it.  I cannot avoid the feeling that the Minister is sticking to his brief and there is no use wasting breath on futile argument.  Anybody with practical experience in this matter readily recognises the fundamental distinction between the use to which veterinary preparations used as sprays for agriculture are put.  Most people will recognise the reasonableness of providing for the proper control <Col N="942" /> of agricultural sprays, owing to the development of the last ten years during which new and highly dangerous sprays have come into common use, particularly in connection with tillage crops.  I do not think, however, that I am going to carry conviction to the Minister's mind.  He is certainly not going to convey conviction to my mind.  This is an amendment on which we would wish to divide.</P>

      <P>It is worth reminding the House that, having defeated the amendment proposed to Section 14, the House is now passing the section which makes it an offence for any farmer to use a remedy which <Col N="944" /> he may have been accustomed to use and which consists of a poison scheduled under this Bill.  Under this section, he will be guilty of an offence and may be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 and further penalties for a continuing offence.</P>
      <P>It is worth reminding Fianna Fáil Deputies that is the logical result of a division in which they voted a few minutes ago defeating the amendment to delete &ldquo;veterinary&rdquo; purposes from the earlier section.  Henceforth, any farmer who does not comply with the regulations which may be made regarding the use of remedies for different maladies and illnesses of a farm animal he owns and who attempts to use these remedies himself contrary to the regulations can be hauled up in the district court and fined a sum not exceeding £100.  If he does not pay the fine, he may be marched off to jail to serve a term of imprisonment because of this Bill and the section it contains.</P>

What the Deputy wishes people to believe is that a district justice will impose a fine of £100 upon a man who uses once a drug contrary to the regulations.  I doubt if any district justice would impose that for a breach of such a regulation.</P>

      <P>In page 7, to add to the section the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) When a regulation under section 14 or 15 of this Act which has been made without prior consultation with the Council is laid before each House of the Oireachtas it shall be accompanied by a statement in writing indicating that the regulation has been made without prior consultation with the Council.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Michael O'Higgins suggested on the Second Stage that some steps should be taken by the Minister, in the event of a regulation having been made as a matter of urgency, to draw the attention of the House specifically to the fact that the regulation was made without having <Col N="947" /> consulted the council.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 14, to delete &ldquo;for Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This point was introduced by Deputy Cosgrave on the last occasion.  It queries why this Board should be called the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.  It is quite clear that the Board can only refer to an institution established here. I am moving that the words &ldquo;for Ireland&rdquo; be left out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  In the first instance, I should like to point out to the House that the Bill proposes to continue in existence a Board which is already called &ldquo;The Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.&rdquo; That is the name of the existing Commissioners.  We are not appointing a new set of Commissioners but merely carrying on the existing Board.  In the circumstances it seems to me that it would be technically wrong to change the name.  Apart from that, there are very practical considerations why we should not change the name.</P>
      <P>The Board has a great number of investments, stocks and shares of various sorts, registered in the existing name. If the name were changed, the name used for all those investments would have to be changed.  The expense could be quite substantial and I do not think it would be at all sensible to incur it. Furthermore, I imagine a difficulty would undoubtedly arise in the case of property which the Board holds.  There are certain charitable lands held in the Board's name.  The change of name might not give trouble immediately but, certainly, trouble would arise at some stage in the future when the question of the transfer of these lands or investments came up for consideration. Therefore, for a number of reasons it is impracticable, technically difficult and indeed expensive to make a change in the name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from all this I should not be favourably disposed to change something that has been there for over 100 years, something which is a tradition. Unless there was an overwhelming <Col N="950" /> reason we should not lightly change a name like this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree at all that there is the slightest legal basis for the matters about which the Parliamentary Secretary is talking.  The fact that the name of the Board is changed in new legislation does not affect the way in which property is held at the moment.  If we are seeking to start a new Bill, the Board should be given a title which will be distinctive without the term &ldquo;for Ireland&rdquo; being inserted. The Interpretation Act is still outstanding and regularises the whole matter, in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputy McGilligan must ralise that, in the case of stocks and shares held in America, Canada or elsewhere, immediately we change the name of the Commissioners it would be necessary to have these stocks and shares registered in the new name?  Those technical and practical difficulties could be got over but why should we have them unless there was some real reason?  No such reason has been advanced.</P>

      <P>I really do not understand the reason for subsection (2) being there, and if subsection (2) is necessary I do not see what subsection (3) has got to do with it.

They have well-settled practices, procedure and methods of operation.  They know their own business best.  This is the way they want to conduct it.  This House should be very reluctant not to agree to that request.  As I understand it, they want a permanent chairman and, in his absence, they want the senior member to preside.  The House will readily realise that on a board of this nature a number of reasons could arise in a particular instance why the senior member would not wish to preside. Therefore, if the senior member, in the absence of the permanent Chairman, does not care to preside, the members present can elect whomever they wish to be chairman for that particular meeting.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 25, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than any suit or proceedings instituted or taken by or with the consent or authority or at the direction or on the certificate or application of the Board under sections 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27 of this Act or on any application or appeal to the High Court under section 33 or section 43 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter which we discussed at <Col N="959" /> great length on the earlier Stage.  I want to repeat very briefly what was said on that occasion.  The section reads:</P>
    <P>A Judge of any Court shall not be prevented or disabled by reason solely of his being a member of the Board from hearing and determining any case relating to a charity or any case arising under this Act, but may hear and determine it as if he were not a member of the Board.</P>
    <P>In the course of the arguments, the point was made that if there were any disturbance of this, it meant that a Commissioner, being a judge, could not sit afterwards to hear any charity case.  I concede at once that merely the fact that there is a judge on the board and some charity case comes before the judge, he should not be precluded from hearing it.  The section also says that a judge &ldquo;shall not be prevented from hearing and determining any case relating to a charity or any case arising under this Act.&rdquo;  That now is introducing this principle&mdash;I still think it is a bad one &mdash; into a whole variety of things established here.  I am referring to Sections 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27 and various applications under Sections 33 and 43.  The point is a fairly clear one. It is necessary that justice should not merely be done but should seem to be done.</P>
    <P>I decided to put in my amendment leaving unchanged that the judge shall not be prevented by reason solely of being a member of the board from hearing and determining any case relating to a charity.  I want to distinguish the new matters that are brought under this Act.  The distinction is made by putting in that he is not to be precluded from hearing any case &ldquo;other than any suit or proceedings instituted or taken by or with the consent or authority or at the direction or on the certificate or application of the Board under the sections mentioned or on any application or appeal to the High Court under the sections mentioned&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think that is quite a good amendment. A good deal of emphasis was put on the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo;.  It was suggested that we should not attempt to <Col N="960" /> teach judges how to do their business, but before I answer that, I want to point out that the side note is not a proper side note to what is in the section itself.  The side note says:</P>
    <P>Membership of board not to disqualify Judge from hearing charity cases.</P>
    <P>That refers only to the general matter of any charity but it does not refer to the particular matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to teaching the judges their business, Deputies who have glanced at two new pieces of legislation which came into the hands of Deputies in the last couple of days proceeding from the Department of Justice will see that in these Acts we teach judges their business.  We tell how the judges ought to be addressed. We broke the great line which seems to have been the strong point of the Parliamentary Secretary the last day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any great validity in the last point made by Deputy McGilligan.  I certainly do not propose to persue it now.  With regard to this matter of judges as Commissioners, I am afraid I can only repeat substantially what I have said before.  I object to writing specifically into this Bill a provision that the judiciary shall or shall not hear certain types of cases.  Discussion has taken place here, and I have made the Government's view clear. We regard it as very undesirable that a judge should sit as a member of the Charity Commissioners, hear a case and subsequently sit to determine that case.  The Opposition have made their view clear; they strenuously object to these proceedings also.  But they go further than we do.  They say that not alone should it not happen but we should provide against it. That is the only real difference between us.   Now that we have had this discussion and it has been made clear by all concerned that it would not be desirable that this should ever happen, whatever remote chance&mdash;I do not admit that there is any&mdash;there may have been that it might happen, I think it certainly cannot happen now.  I indicated earlier that if we <Col N="961" /> were to write into this Bill a provision of this nature laying down in an Act of Parliamentary protocol for the judiciary, it would be a very dangerous precedent and one which would have to be followed in subsequent Acts of the Oireachtas.  For that reason, I think that at this stage Deputy McGilligan might let the situation rest.</P>

Section 23 allows the Board, with the previous consent of the Attorney General, to sue for the recovery of any charitable gift intended to be applied in the State which is improperly withheld, concealed or misapplied.  Section 25 is in these terms:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If it appears to the Board desirable that legal proceedings should be instituted with respect to any charity by any person, other than the Attorney General, the Board may authorise ... those legal proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am taking the position of a judge who is a member of the Board.  He acts under Section 23.  A matter comes before the Board of which he is a member, and when he is present, and the Board decides, with his assent, to sue for the recovery of a charitable gift.  On a later occasion, when the judge is present and taking part in the discussion, the Board decides to institute legal proceedings.  Under the other section, the judge is then entitled to go round to his court, sit, hear, and determine the points at issue, having previously interfered as a member of the Board.  I think it is wrong even to permit of the possibility of such a thing happening.  We have been told now by the Parliamentary Secretary that this was discussed and opinions were made clear.  I rather gathered from his remarks that, because there was a discussion here along certain lines, the judges, even if they were tempted to sit in such proceedings, would not do so.  Is that the argument?</P>

      <P>One of the things no judge will ever look at is what was said in Parliament.  Judges absolutely close their eyes to seeing anything and their ears to hearing anything that goes on in Parliament.  If they were to take cognisance of things like that! Do not forget that about five Deputies took part in the discussion and one Deputy sitting behind the Parliamentary Secretary thought it was a most wise and proper and prudent thing that a judge sitting in as a member of such a Board should subsequently officiate as a judge in relation to matters that had taken place at the Board.</P>

      <P>That was Deputy de Valera's argument: Who better to try the case than the man who had been in the boardroom and heard the whole matter discussed <i>in camera</i> there?  That was the argument.  I put that only as a point against what the Parliamentary Secretary says with regard to judges paying attention to anything said in Parliament or reading anything recorded in Parliament.  They just do not do it; they will not do it. We are dealing here with general charity matters going back to the 1867 Act.  We are certainly refurbishing old powers in Sections 23 and 26.  I think it is undesirable even to leave it to be misunderstood that a judge can <Col N="963" /> sit and hear a case which he previously heard as a member of the Board.</P>

      <P>That is by the way. He clearly indicated that a judge should not be a member of the Board. The trustees of any charity who wish to take legal proceedings must notify the Charity Commissioners to that effect before they can initiate those proceedings. Every charity matter, therefore, which will come before the court will be notified to the Charity Commissioners. That fact is in itself sufficient to vitiate Deputy McGilligan's argument. If his argument were accepted, any judge who was a member of the Charity Commissioners would be precluded from hearing any charity proceedings at all in so far as every charity proceeding must be reported to the Charity Commissioners before it can go to court.  In relation to what Deputy McGilligan said on Committee Stage and so far on this Stage, he agreed that that would be ridiculous.</P>

      <P>I do now, after that explanation.  I make a distinction. If it is right&mdash;I was not aware of it&mdash; that notification of all such proceedings must be given to the Charity Commissioners, I hold that notification is one thing and active intervention is another thing.  There is active intervention in Section 25 inasmuch as the Board may authorise legal proceedings. I think it would be very wrong that Judge X, being a member of the Board, would authorise the institution of legal proceedings and subsequently sit and determine the action.  In any event, the answer is that he will not but that he should not be prevented from doing it merely because he is a member of the Board. I think there should not be the slightest possibility left in that such a person could hear such a case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 48 to 53, and in page 7, to delete lines 1 to 5, and to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  the auditor may, by giving notice in that behalf in writing to any person, require that person to attend at the office of the Board at such time as is specified in the notice to give evidence on oath in relation to any matter in question at the audit and to produce any books, deeds, accounts, vouchers or other documents in his possession, custody or control which relate to any such matter, and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  any person to whom a notice has been given under this paragraph who refuses or wilfully neglects to attend in accordance with the notice or who wilfully alters, suppresses, conceals or destroys any document to which the notice relates, or who, having so attended, refuses to give evidence or refuses or wilfully fails to produce any documents to which the notice relates shall be guilty of <Col N="966" /> an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  any person who in giving such evidence on oath wilfully makes a statement which is to his knowledge false or misleading in any material respect shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds or, at the discretion of the Court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or to both such find and such imprisonment;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to provide for the attendance as well as the evidence of any person required by the auditor.  Paragraph (c) of sub-section (4) of Section 14 provides that the auditor may call before him and examine on oath any person and it then goes on to provide for false evidence. The new paragraph proposed in this amendment covers the production of any books, accounts and vouchers required by the auditor and also imposes a penalty for refusal to attend or refusal to give evidence. The amendment will bring the law into line with that contained in Section 86 (2) and 3 (f) of the Local Government Act, 1941, as amended by Section 93 of the Local Government Act, 1946.  These provisions relate to the auditing of accounts of a local authority.</P>

      <P>In regard to amendment No. 9, this was drafted in <Col N="967" /> the light of the early draft of this legislation which made a person making a statement which was to his knowledge false or misleading guilty of perjury.  The only difference, so far as my amendment is concerned, is with regard to the phrase &ldquo;which is to his knowledge false or misleading in any material respect&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;material to the examination which he knows to be false or does not believe to be true&rdquo;.  I do not think that it is any assistance to say that a statement is false or misleading &ldquo;in any material respect&rdquo;.  A statement can be material without being material to the examination.  All that is being aimed at are statements that are material to the examination. We have the words &ldquo;false and misleading&rdquo;. I do not know what those words are supposed to cover in the Local Government Act.  I was told that this phrase was taken from some of the Army Pensions Acts.</P>

      <P>Surely that is a provision which covers a very large range of matters and I do not know why it is necessary to bring it in here. The draft I have here says that the auditor may call before him any person whose testimony, in his opinion, is necessary to the examination in the matter of the accounts.  That has disappeared from the amendment.  It said that by giving notice in that behalf to any person he may require that person to attend at any time at the office.  Apparently there is a wider power there somewhere and the auditor must have some belief that the person was necessary.  I do not know why it has been enlarged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is right to put in the phrase &ldquo;false and misleading in <Col N="968" /> any material respect&rdquo;.  If there is anything in the way of an offence committed, it ought to be only in relation to a false and misleading statement in regard to the examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the word &ldquo;material&rdquo; is in respect of the statement in our draft.  The whole of the statement need not be false and misleading, as long as some of it is. Therefore, if somebody wilfully makes a misleading statement he should be guilty of some form of offence.  We are not making it perjury.  We are merely making it a statutory offence punishable under the section.</P>

Why leave in all these words that do not mean anything?  Why not leave them out?

      <P>No order made subsequently by a Court shall have any such retrospective effect as to interfere with or impair the indemnity given by this section to a trustee, executor or other person who has acted on or in accordance with such opinion or advice.</P>

    <P>This is on Section 29.  Section 29 gives the Board power to frame schemes applying property <i>cy-prés.</i> In subsection (4) you come to a point where a scheme has been made by order of the court and in certain circumstances, the value not being over £5,000, the Board is given power to change a court order.  This is not <Col N="972" /> going to happen very often and I do not see why, if the court has made an order, it is thought some modification of it is required and the circumstances make that desirable, one should not apply again to the court instead of leaving the Board power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is simply a question of expense in the case of small charities.  I am aware of one charity at the moment where the total funds involved amount of £1,600 and an application to the court for a <i>cy-prés</i> scheme cost over £630.  This is entirely to deal with that sort of case.  It is not correct to say we are allowing for an order of the court to be revoked. We are dealing with a scheme which has been framed by the court and failed.  It is only if a scheme framed by the court fails, that the Charity Commissioners can come in.  There is no question of overriding the court or of appealing to the Commissioners against a decision of the court or of overruling an order of the court. It is simply a question of where a scheme fails and, as I said before, a scheme is just as likely to fail if drawn up by a court as any other scheme. It is a question of saving small charities the expense of applying to the court for a <i>cy-prés</i> scheme.</P>

All you have to do is go back to the court.  This is all nonsense.  I can resurrect a famous case, that of the Sinn Féin Funds, a case which the Government of the time tried to bulldoze through.

    <P>Amendment Nos. 17 and 18 are consequential on this.  The object of these amendments is to cover charitable trusts created by statute or charter. Where a statutory trust, such as the Iveagh Trust, desires to change its investment powers, it must go to the expense of promoting a private Bill. There should be no necessity for this. Such trusts ought properly to come within Section 32 of the Bill so that the trustees may apply to the Charity Commissioners to extend the range of investments authorised by the Private Act or the Charter governing the particular trust.  Amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 18 will allow for this. The word &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; in the context of the Bill at the moment could suggest that a <Col N="976" /> charter or a statutory trust is excluded.

Let me take a hypothetical case where the trustees apply under Section 33 to invest in a foreign security and the Board inform them that they do not object, as the Board seem entitled to do under Section 33 (2).

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 39, to add at the end of section 38 &ldquo;subject to the provisions of section 32 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I know I am going to be told that this is really covered.  I hope it is but I want to make assurance doubly sure, lest there be any doubt whatever.  This goes back to the section we have been discussing, Section 32, which says that the Board may invest in such manner as they think proper&mdash;I am simplifying&mdash;and secondly, that they may, on the application of the trustees of any fund held upon any charitable trust, invest as they think proper.  Then they have:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in any enactment (including this Act) ....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That clearly will refer back to those two subsections.  We come then to a completely new section, Section 38, which is the investment of proceeds of sale, a different matter in any event.  So, if here it is any sale of property to <Col N="980" /> which Section 34, 35 or 37 applies, then the Board may direct the trustees to pay the money to the Board and the Board may invest as they think fit. One is supposed to remember Section 32.  This is governed by what Section 32 says.  I wish to give a pointer to that and to make it clear and to say that this is all subject to the provisions of Section 32 of the Act.  I think it should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no necessity whatever to do it.  I am surprised at a learned counsel like Deputy McGilligan using the phrase &ldquo;one is supposed to remember&rdquo;.  The stipulation in Section 32 is quite clear.  It governs everything else.  The words are&mdash;&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in any enactment (including this Act)&rdquo;. There is no question that this governs Section 38.  There is no need for any other provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I made it clear why that amendment is required. Unless we put in Section 33 the words which amendment No. 19 puts in it, if trustees applied to the Board and the Board said: &ldquo;No, we do not object,&rdquo; it could be argued that subsection (3) (a) of Section 32 does not apply.  The Board might be said to be neither ordering, empowering, consenting to nor approving of the investment.</P>

    <P>The object of this amendment is to allow a new trustee or trustees appointed by order of the Board under Section 43 to be registered in the Land Registry where the trust property consists of or includes registered land.

We propose to follow the precedent of Section 19 of the Labourers Act, 1936, and Section 8 of the State Property Act, 1954.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  In determining whether or not a gift for the purpose of the advancement of religion is a valid charitable gift it shall be conclusively presumed that the purpose includes and will occasion public benefit.</P>
      <P>(2)  Subsection (1) shall not apply where the gift takes effect before the 1st day of January, 1960.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this new section is to provide that in the case of gifts for the advancement of religion that are otherwise charitable it shall not be necessary to prove public benefit or the benefit of the community.  The requirement of public benefit in the case of religious trusts meant that the courts had to enquire into spiritual matters in which <Col N="987" /> their competence is at least open to question.  Furthermore, the requirement of such benefit does not rest on any sound historical foundation.  In proposing this amendment, I was, I may say, very much influenced by the judgment of the late Judge Gavan Duffy in <i>Maguire</i> v. <i>Attorney General</i> reported in the 1943 Irish Reports and also by Professor Newark's article <i>Public Benefit and Religious Trusts</i> in the July 1946 issue of the Law Quarterly Review. <i>Maguire's Case</i> was followed by the late Judge Dixon in <i>In re Sheridan</i> reported in 1957: but the question at issue, namely, the public benefit element in gifts to contemplative or enclosed Orders has not yet come before the Supreme Court.  I referred to these Orders and to the English decision of <i>Gilmour</i> v. <i>Coats</i> in my Second Stage speech.  On fuller consideration I think it better that the matter be put beyond doubt by establishing a conclusive presumption of public benefit in the case of religious trusts.</P>
    <P>The category &ldquo;advancement of religion&rdquo; is a well-accepted one listed specifically in the divisions of charity contained in Lord Macnaghten's celebrated judgement in <i>Pemsels Case</i> reported in the 1891 Appeal Cases.</P>
    <P>This amendment represents a valuable and desirable restatement and clarification of the law.  Acceptance of the amendment means that it will in future be no longer necessary to argue that gifts which are clearly for the advancement of religion must rely on the dual grounds of validity at common law and the element of public benefit. The first ground will, as Judge Gavan Duffy held, suffice.  This will ensure that the Statute of Pious Uses, 1634, to which the trouble in this country in regard to public benefit traces its origin will be placed in proper historical perspective.  That Act, as the learned Judge stressed, neither codified the law nor superseded the common law of pious uses.  Professor Newark in the conclusion to the article to which I have referred points out that an insistence on the requirement of public benefit in the past has led the courts to search for and to pretend to find a public benefit in the <Col N="988" /> form of spiritual advantages which are not properly cognisable in a court of law.</P>
    <P>The proposed section will not apply to gifts taking effect before the 1st January, 1960.  This is in line with the policy in Section 49 (2) in regard to mixed trusts.  We want to interfere as little as possible with rights that people may have under existing law.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 19 to delete lines 44 to 51 and substitute&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;46.&mdash;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;fund&rsquo; means a common investment fund, &lsquo;scheme&rsquo; means a scheme for the establishment of a common investment fund.</P>

      <P>(a) for property transferred to a fund by or on behalf of a charity participating in a scheme to be invested under the control of trustees appointed to manage the fund; and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to argue that amendment No. 31 is not necessarily consequential but I would be happy to discuss the amendments together. Amendment No. 31 could stand on its own.  This rather complex collection of amendments is designed not to change the intention of the section but to change the drafting.  On Committee Stage, I indicated my pleasure at the inclusion of this section in the Bill but also my abhorrence of the terms <Col N="991" /> in which the very good intentions were expressed.</P>
    <P>I understood that the origin of this section was the Charities Act passed in England and, having looked it up, I began to see where the trouble arose. If the Parliamentary Secretary had been content to lift the section out of the Charities Act in England, all might still have been well but the Parliamentary Secretary decided to change the wording slightly, to make it a little shorter, to telescope it as he did in subsection (4) of Section 9.  By doing so, a horrible-looking mess appears.  In the Charities Act in England, the relevant section begins:</P>
    <P>The court or the Commissioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>it is quite easy to change that to &ldquo;the High Court or the Board&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;may by order make and bring into effect schemes&mdash;and then, in parenthesis, it says&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(in this section referred to as &ldquo;common investment schemes&rdquo;) for the establishment of common investment funds under trusts which provide&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and so on.  Not too content with that, to my mind, fair statement of intention, our draft is now switched around a bit and in attempting to cut it even finer the horrible effect is as set out in subsection (1), Section 46:</P>
    <P>The High Court or the Board may by order make and bring into effect schemes for the establishment of common investment funds (in this section referred to as schemes)&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>so that we have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have plurality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;something which helps to make the thing a bit more confusing to read.  The confusion continues because of the attempt to get a too tight definition to make &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; serve for &ldquo;common investment schemes&rdquo;.  I should have thought the wording in the English Act reasonable. In paragraph (a) of that Act, there was a reference to &ldquo;the fund&rdquo;.  I should have thought the paragraph would <Col N="992" /> have read better with the words &ldquo;such a fund&rdquo; or &ldquo;a fund&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;the fund&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned on Committee Stage, there is this confusion as to whether this is one common investment fund for Ireland or a series of them. Obviously from reading the section, there are a number of common investment funds envisaged from the phraseology. Why this fund should come in without any definition of &ldquo;fund&rdquo; at all seems to be bad.  I attempted to get over it by redrafting the entire section and although I say it myself, I think my effort is better than that of the parliamentary draftsman, if he is the person who is to be blamed for what appears in the Bill.  It gets further away from the wording of the English Act but, having decided to depart from the wording of the English Act, I do not see the necessity for staying near or about it.</P>
      <P>While I am not particularly advocating the words I have suggested, it would be better to go back to the English Act and to get nearer the words used there.  I cannot see that anything has been gained by way of clarity&mdash;rather the reverse.</P>
      <P>I may be particularly stupid about reading these things but I read this three times just to see what is the scheme mentioned.  I must confess of course that I had the advantage of puzzling over it before I read the English Act.  There are clearer ways of stating it and, with all respect to the English parliamentary draftsman, I still prefer my own way of defining the &ldquo;fund&rdquo; in the section to mean a common investment fund and &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; to mean a scheme for the establishment of a common investment fund.  By that definition, you get clarity and cut out a number of words. In regard to paragraph (a), Section 1, &ldquo;for property transferred to the fund&rdquo;, I think &ldquo;such a fund&rdquo; or &ldquo;a fund&rdquo; would be better.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheldon is a very reasonable man and since he raised these drafting points on Committee Stage, I have had this section re-examined.  Let me say at the outset that the parliamentary draftsman is not my creature; he is the draftsman of this Parliament and it is unfair for Deputy McGilligan or anybody else to accuse me of being weak-willed in accepting a draft prepared for me by the parliamentary draftsman.  The position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In drafting any Bill, I am advised and I accept the advice of the draftsman of this House.  It is hardly a valid criticism to level against me that I am wrong in doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I had this section reexamined and, quite frankly, I could not see any grounds for the difficulties which Deputy Sheldon sees.  I certainly think that our draft is some improvement on the corresponding section in the English Charities Act, 1960.  If our section suffers from any defects, then Section 22 of the English Act suffers from exactly the same defects. Deputy Sheldon is, as I said, a reasonable man.  I think he must admit he has nothing sounder to go on than a feeling of dislike for the wording of <Col N="994" /> the section.  I understood him to say that when he read the whole section it was quite clear there would be a number of common investment funds. There was no suggestion that there should be only one fund for the whole country.  That is not intended and that is not what is in the section.  The drafting is as good as is required.  I am quite satisfied the section will achieve what we want it to achieve. We are all agreed on the desirability of what we propose.  Deputy Sheldon will have to advance a more concrete reason than a mere feeling of dislike for the English draft&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This House has seen various Finance Bills; and I do not think we can complain that this section is particularly difficult or anything of that nature.

      <P>(i)  the value of land shall be taken to be fifty times the rateable valuation thereof,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the value of any periodical payment to which land is subject shall be taken to be fifteen times the annual amount thereof, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  the value of any other periodical payment shall be taken to be twenty times the annual amount thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is the result of a recommendation by the Board.  The proposal is to allow the Board to frame <i>cy-près</i> schemes under section 48 where the property has been given <Col N="997" /> for specific charitable purposes and does not exceed £1,000 in value.  Value will be determined in the same way as it is determined under section 29 (1) in the case of ordinary <i>cy-près</i> schemes made by the Board.</P>
    <P>Once again this is a question of expense.  I am informed that there are two small funds to which section 48 will apply.  Application to the High Court would simply mean that substantial portions of each fund would go in legal expenses.  The moneys in both cases were collected for charitable purposes.  This amendment deals with funds which are exclusively for charitable purposes.</P>
