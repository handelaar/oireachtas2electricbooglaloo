    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he can state in general terms the taxation provisions affecting industrial production in each of the six Common Market countries, and, in particular, whether they are more or less favourable than this country's in the provision of reliefs or inducements towards frequent retooling and replacement of obsolescent machinery by industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make available to members details of the customs tariffs that are at present common to the six member states of the European Economic Community; and whether the Community has as yet published the common customs tariff at which they aim in Article 2 (b) of the Treaty of Rome.</P>

    <P>15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the provisions of Article 25.1 of the Treaty of Rome would apply to the raw materials needed by Irish industry for further production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="622" />
    <P>18.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether Ireland has at present any, and, if so, what, bilateral quotas (such as are visualised in Article 33 of the Treaty of Rome) for either imports from or exports to any, and, if so, which member states of the European Economic Community or of the European Free Trade Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>19.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach what were the political considerations to which he referred in a reply of 14th June, 1961 which he said would be involved in Ireland's joining the Common Market, but which he felt would not conflict with the national interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, Sir, to take Questions numbers 1 to 19 together.</P>
      <P>Some of these questions, in particular, numbers 2,5,6,8 and 16 and parts of others, relate to matters which would be the subject of detailed negotiations in the event of Ireland applying for membership of the European Economic Community, and consequently it would not be in the national interest for me to indicate views on them at this stage.</P>
      <P>As regards the remaining questions, I have decided to have prepared for the information of Deputies a White Paper on the provisions of the Treaty of Rome and the Common Market arrangements generally.  This White Paper is in course of preparation and should be ready within a few weeks. Information on questions of fact and interpretation such as those raised in the questions under reply will be incorporated, as far as practicable, in the text of the White Paper.  It is preferable that such information should be given in a single co-ordinated publication rather than in an unrelated, piecemeal fashion.  It is intended that the White Paper, as well as summarising the provisions of the Treaty of Rome and outlining the present proposals for a common agricultural policy, will also contain informative material on Ireland's trade and other relations with the European Economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be understood, however, that it would not be possible to discuss the <Col N="623" /> implications for Ireland of membership of the Community until the terms of accession were clarified in the course of the detailed negotiations which would follow an application for membership. A further White Paper, covering these matters, would then be published as a basis for discussion by the Dáil of the decision proposed by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad, even after 19 Questions, that I have got the Taoiseach at last to do what we have been asking him to do for weeks and weeks, namely, to publish an informative White Paper.  It is about time he woke up to his job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I express my pleasure that the Deputy has at last read the Rome Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did so a considerable time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will this White Paper be purely factual or will it embody the Government's views and will time be given by the Taoiseach for a discussion on the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper will be completely factual.  As I told the Deputy before, the question of a discussion here would arise only if there was a proposition to be made to the House.  There will, however, be opportunities upon motions which are due to come before the House to deal with aspects of this matter, if Deputies wish to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach, therefore, believe it is premature for the Government to give an opinion on whether we should become members of the six European Countries of the Common Market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is premature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the White Paper be furnished in ample time before the House rises so that Deputies can, by Question, get any information it should contain and which it does not contain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="624" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be published with all due speed.  This is not a static situation.  It is changing from week to week.  The time of publication of the White Paper will be determined by the course of events in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach visualise our having to take a decision in this matter, say, before 31st July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach talking of the primary or the subsequent decision?  There are two&mdash;one in principle and the second after the result of negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first decision which might possibly be taken would be to apply for membership of the E.E.C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Or associate membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The second decision would be to accept membership on the basis negotiated.  I do not contemplate that a situation will arise which will call for a decision in the next few weeks.  This however is a situation which could change very rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, therefore, may be required to make a decision between, say, 31st July, when it is expected the Dáil will rise, and the holding of an election, say, in October. The Government may be required to make this decision during the period of the Recess when the Dáil will not have an opportunity of considering any proposed decision by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The effective decision that must ultimately be taken by the Government and the Dáil will be to accept membership of the Community, if that situation should arise. The decision to seek membership would be an executive decision, although it would be a necessary preliminary step to the ultimate decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There may have to be a special session of the Dáil to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="625" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the Taoiseach's last observation, that the necessity for a decision might arise at any time, would it not be better, pending the issue of the White Paper, that such information as is available should be made available by way of replies to Questions for the benefit of the House so that they could be studied <i>ad interim?</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Taoiseach is being quite frank with the House.  On several occasions, he made it quite clear that no decision would be taken in regard to joining the Common Market until some decision had been taken by the British Government in the matter.  So far as we are aware, no decision has been taken by the British Government in regard to joining the Common Market.  Could the Taoiseach say what has brought about this rather radical change in his own attitude in the past few weeks and, in particular, since the visit to this country of Von Brentano from Western Germany?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no change in my attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach answer my supplementary?  In view of the fact that the Taoiseach says the decision might have to be taken at reasonably short notice and that he is not able to give us any date for the publication of the White Paper, is it not better that such information as is at present available should be supplied to the House by way of replies to Questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as Deputies may want information as to the objectives which the Government would seek in the course of negotiations, I think it would not be in the national interest that the Government should be asked to publish its views now.  In so far as a Deputy may require information regarding the provisions of the Rome Treaty, regarding decisions taken by the Council of Ministers set up by the Rome Treaty or the implementation of that Treaty, I think it is better that we should try to give the House a complete picture in one document, as far as that is practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to No. 19, can we take it that whatever political considerations are involved in the provisions of the Rome Treaty will be included as part of the information which will be provided to the House in the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach whether he has taken into consideration the situation that has already arisen in one country which is in the Common Market, namely, France, where the small farmers have their backs to the wall as a result of France's membership of the Common Market?  Will the Taoiseach take into consideration the fact that if this country joins the Common Market without guarantees of protection, the small farmers will be wiped out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is, of course, that the agricultural provisions of the Rome Treaty are not yet in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as France is concerned, the impact of the Common Market has been to destroy the market for the small farmers there.  Today they are taking steps to blockade towns and so forth as a result of the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, the Taoiseach indicated the Government had under consideration opening discussions with countries in the Common Market.  Would he say if the Government have come to a decision in that <Col N="627" /> matter and when such discussions might open?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so easy to answer a question like this in the course of a reply to a Parliamentary Question.  It is true that in our discussions with the German authorities last February agreement was reached as to the total value of cattle to be exported for the year.  This agreement provided for the export to Germany of twenty million marks worth of cattle which would represent roughly from 20,000 to 25,000 animals in the year.  The Germans at that time did express the intention of breaking that up into a weekly quota for the convenience of their own trade.  Our people resisted that request as best they could at the time, because such an arrangement would not fit in with our seasonal trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following fairly protracted discussions on the issue, it was finally agreed that a joint consultative body would be set up representative, on the one hand, of traders and officials of my Department and, on the other, of importers and officials on the German side, to watch the situation as it developed and to have discussions if any problems arose.  This joint body met in Hamburg on 2nd and 3rd June and arranged, after consultation, that the weekly number of cattle to be exported should reach the 800 mark. That was the understanding of our representatives coming back here, and I believe it is not denied that it was the understanding of all those who took part.  But when the German officials went back to their Department <Col N="633" /> of Agriculture, apparently the Department were not willing to accept this arrangement and conveyed to us that as from 26th June the number of animals to be exported would not be 800 but 600 per week.  We have taken up this matter with them and are awaiting the outcome of that approach.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2) (b), page 2, to delete all words in line 29 after &ldquo;number&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;of other judges&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this matter, there is a certain <Col N="648" /> amount of nomenclature but there is also a matter that may be of some substance.  The subsection is in these terms:</P>
    <P>(2) The Supreme Court shall be constituted of the following judges&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the president thereof, namely, An Príomh-Bhreitheamh (The Chief Justice), and</P>
    <P>four ordinary judges.  Then we come to a matter of the titles by which they will be styled.</P>
    <P>There are two points I am aiming at in this amendment.  One is that I do not see why we should say &ldquo;not less than four.&rdquo;  A full court is required in the Supreme Court on two occasions only and for that reason there has to be a court of five.  That, I suppose, is why this was built up in this way&mdash;the Chief Justice plus four others.  There is no necessity to impose that on Dáil Éireann.  Dáil Éireann could make it any number it likes, so long as there are five judges.  There need not necessarily be four Supreme Court judges as well as the Chief Justice because subsection (3) says that the President of the High Court shall be <i>ex officio</i> a judge of the Supreme Court.  So that there need not be actually five members of the Supreme Court, namely, the Chief Justice and four others.  It has been built up in this way.</P>
    <P>The second thing I am aiming at is this.  There is a distinction which runs through this proposed legislation&mdash;a distinction between Supreme Court and what are called &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; judges. That phrase nowhere occurs in the Constitution.  Two or three times in the Constitution, the Supreme Court is referred to and then the Chief Justice is picked out as a particular member of that and after that, the Constitution refers to &ldquo;other&rdquo; judges, not &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; as opposed to extraordinary judges.  I aim at getting rid of this phrase for which there is certainly no constitutional demand.  I do not say it is unconstitutional to put it in but I think we might as well keep close to the Constitution when there is nothing really that turns on the matter.  Therefore, we should have &ldquo;other judges&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;ordinary judges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I also feel that we should not have this prohibition of &ldquo;not being less than <Col N="649" /> four.&rdquo;  That may not arise, because, as I say, as long as the next subsection is added, permitting the President of the High Court to be a judge of the Supreme Court, then you could have actually appointed only three members of the Supreme Court and they with the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court would give a court of five.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  First of all, on the point of the number of judges, it has been decided that the Supreme Court should consist of five, namely, the Chief Justice and four other judges&mdash;ordinary judges, as they are described.  This use of the term &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; is simply a matter of drafting procedure and it is to distinguish the Chief Justice from the other judges of the Supreme Court. I think it is easily the handiest way of proceeding.  It is purely a matter of <Col N="650" /> drafting technique.  There is no suggestion that ordinary judges are in any way different.  In the No. 2 Bill, it is clear that the term &ldquo;judge&rdquo; covers both the Chief Justice and the ordinary judges, but it could lead to complications if we were to drop this use of &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo;, because there are some instances in different Acts covering courts where, in describing membership of committees, the words &ldquo;ordinary judges&rdquo; are used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point of numbers, it is agreed that because of two points&mdash;declaring the permanent incapacity of the President and the declaring of the constitutionality of a Bill referred to the Supreme Court&mdash; on those two occasions, there must be what is called a full Supreme Court consisting of five members.  These are the only cases in which it arises.  Is it necessary to say &ldquo;it shall have a president and such number (not being less than four) of ordinary judges&rdquo;? It seems so in order that you may get five judges, a Chief Justice and four others.  Very good.  The next subsection says: &ldquo;The President of the High Court shall be <i>ex officio</i> an additional judge of the Supreme Court.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It does not matter whether he is additional, extraordinary or anything else.  He is a judge of the Supreme Court.  You have the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court.  Why then insist on having four others appointed?  The Court of five can easily be made up of the President of the High Court, the Chief Justice and three members of the Supreme Court.  Is that not right?  Why, therefore, say &ldquo;not less than four?&rdquo; That is in regard to the mere matter of numbers.  The Court of five can be achieved by having two people with titles, the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court and three others.  That is clear, is it not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only saying, that by leaving out &ldquo;not less than four,&rdquo; you do not prevent the Government from appointing four.  Why lay it down?  There might occur a situation in which, say, the business of the Supreme Court became scanty and where it would be possible to carry on, say, on the death of a member of the Supreme Court with the three judges of that Court plus the Chief Justice plus the President of the High Court.  All the time, remember, there are only two occasions on which it is compulsory under the Constitution to have five judges.  One of these occasions is the permanent incapacity of the President and that has never yet arisen.  That is the first case.  The second is the reference of a Bill to the Supreme Court. Counting the present reference, that is the third.  In other words, there have been three instances in 25 years; only three cases in 25 years on which it would have been necessary to have a Supreme Court of five.</P>
      <P>In a later amendment I am trying to secure that any constitutional question will require five judges.  I have an amendment down to that effect.  If it is accepted, and I think it should be, that will mean that a constitutional question will require five judges.  There certainly has not been one such case each year for 25 years; if there is one every second year that is probably the number of occasions that cases have come to the Supreme Court that under my amendment would require five.  At any rate you can get five.  I do not like the idea of saying to the Dáil: &ldquo;You must appoint so many people, not less than four.&rdquo; That is one point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that there is nothing in the Constitution dividing judges into one type of judges and &ldquo;ordinary judges.&rdquo;  That phrase does not occur in the Constitution.  The phrase &ldquo;other judges&rdquo; does occur in <Col N="652" /> the Constitution.  I shall give one example.  Article 34, Section 5, speaks of the declaration that has to be taken by the various members of different courts and having set out the formula to be used, subsection (2) of Section 5 of Article 34 says that this declaration shall be made</P>
    <P>...in the presence of the President, and by each of the other judges of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>In any event, you have sanction for the word &ldquo;other&rdquo; in relation to what is here called &ldquo;ordinary judges&rdquo; of the Supreme Court.  There is no sanction except in law for the distinction between ordinary and what I suppose you will have to call extraordinary judges of the Supreme Court.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary should keep as near as possible to the terms of the Constitution when there is nothing to be gained by going outside the terms of the Constitution.  There is no clarification obtained by making a distinction between the Chief Justice and the other judges.  That is all I want to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me explain why we stipulated that there should be the President and four ordinary judges.  This, after all, is a Bill to establish the courts and, as the long title says, to specify the constitution of those courts.  I am quite certain that Deputy McGilligan would be the first to criticise me if I came in here with a Bill to establish courts and specify the constitution of those courts and did not stipulate the number of judges that should be in the Supreme Court.  It has been decided as a matter of policy that there should be five judges in that court for the adequate and prompt discharge of its business&mdash;the Chief Justice and four ordinary judges.  As a matter of fact, we would prefer that the Supreme Court would always sit as five.  Indeed, the provisions in the No. 2 Bill are that it must sit as a full Court of five and only in certain circumstances may it sit as a court of three&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to visualise a situation where, when we want to have the Supreme Court sitting as often as possible as a full court of five, we will have to call upon the President of the High Court to make up that number.  I suggest that would be completely unworkable and undesirable in every way.  We want the Supreme Court to sit as a court of five as often as possible.  We specify that in these Bills&mdash;to have the Chief Justice and four other ordinary judges.</P>
      <P>As I have explained, the use of the word &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; in respect of the other judges of the Supreme Court, apart from the Chief Justice, is purely a matter of drafting technique.  It is desirable, for the purpose of the construction of the Bills, from time to time to refer to the Chief Justice and then, from time to time, to refer to the other judges, or as we describe them, the ordinary judges as distinct from the Chief Justice.  It is simply a matter of drafting technique.  From the construction point of view it is the best way of achieving what we want to do and I, for one, cannot see any objection to it.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the second Bill, the Courts (Supplementary Provisions) Bill, and possibly the section to which the Parliamentary Secretary refers is Section 7 which deals with the Supreme Court in regard to jurisdiction.  Subsection (3) states that &ldquo;subject to subsection (4) of this section, an appeal to or other matter cognisable by the Supreme Court shall be heard and determined by five judges, including judges who are by virtue of subsection (3) or (4) of Section 1 of the Principal Act additional judges of the Supreme Court.&rdquo; That brings in the President of the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, very good. There is of course a reservation in regard to what matters are to be heard by five judges including the President of the High Court.  There is another reservation which says that &ldquo;the Chief Justice or, in his absence, the senior <Col N="654" /> ordinary judge of the Supreme Court may determine that an appeal to or other matter cognisable by the Supreme Court...&rdquo; and there are two left out. The appeal or other matter shall be determined by three judges of the Supreme Court including judges who are brought in and that again includes the President.  So that the matter to which the Parliamentary Secretary refers does not impose any great necessity for having five.  The Bill refers to two Articles of the Constitution, Article 12 and Article 26.  Article 12 deals with the President and has never arisen yet and is not likely to arise.</P>
      <P>Article 26 deals with the reference of Bills to the Supreme Court.  That has arisen a few times in 25 years.  Those are the only things which even under the new legislation, in Section 7, are recognised as requiring a full court of five.  The question of the validity of the law, where a constitutional point is involved, would require to be tried by five judges but&mdash;as I say, I have not made any exact calculation&mdash;I doubt if in 25 years there were more than 12 to 15 cases of a constitutional type.</P>
      <P>To come back to the point that the Parliamentary Secretary has made, that you must state what constitutes the court, of course you must but if the amendment I propose were accepted the number of judges could, from time to time, be fixed by Acts of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Why then say something in the Act which may be changed?  This is a Bill which could be changed only by another Act.  It is not the Constitution.  Why stipulate a number of people when the number is not necessary except in certain circumstances and if five were required the number would be made up by bringing in the fifth.  Putting in not less than four does not give any real sanction to the numbers because the numbers can be changed.</P>

      <P>Why determine anything as if for all time?  &ldquo;Such number...may from time to time...&rdquo; The number actually has to be five on two special occasions and with five you do not require the Chief Justice and four other judges of the Supreme Court.  You require the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, and three other Judges of the Supreme Court.  For the limited number of occasions on which the full court of five will be required the President could easily officiate.  I do not see why we should make this distinction in terms.  The Chief Justice is singled out as President of the Court of Final Appeal by his title.  The Constitution refers to other judges and &ldquo;other&rdquo; is a sufficiently distinguishing adjective. To say there are judges in addition to the Chief Justice or to talk about the judges as &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; seems to be slightly derogatory.  The term only comes from law.  It is not in the Constitution. The Constitution makes a distinction between people who are singled out and other judges and I think we should stick to that.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan said that it was not necessary to have five judges appointed to the Supreme Court so that we may have a full court of five because we can always call on the President of the High Court to make up the fifth.  We want as a general rule, as a matter of ordinary practice and as often as possible, that the Supreme Court will sit with a court of five.  That is the purpose of the provisions of Section 7 in the No. 2 Bill.  We clearly direct that as a normal rule the Supreme Court shall sit with the full court of five and only in a case where the Chief Justice determines otherwise can you have a court of three.  If, as we must assume, the President of the High Court will normally be occupied with his own duties as President&mdash;and they are onerous enough&mdash;we cannot possibly proceed <Col N="656" /> on the basis that we shall only have four Supreme Court judges and whenever we want a court of five send for the President.</P>

      <P>We must assume that the President or any other judge is fully occupied as a judge of the High Court and only in exceptional circumstances should we have to send for him to make up the number.  I think Deputy McGilligan has gone off on the wrong track with regard to our stipulating the number.  The number of judges must be stipulated by law and that is what we are doing.  We are deciding in these Bills the number of judges to constitute the Supreme Court. I think we certainly would not be carrying out this function in accordance with the Constitution, if we did not stipulate what number of judges there should be in the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>There is nothing derogatory in the use of the words &ldquo;ordinary judge&rdquo; of the Supreme Court.  Throughout the course of these two Bills it is necessary to refer on the one hand to the Chief Justice, the President of the Supreme Court and, in a different context, to such judge of the Supreme Court who is not the Chief Justice.  It is purely and simply for drafting convenience that we distinguish between the Chief Justice and an ordinary judge.  Otherwise, if we were to adopt Deputy McGilligan's phraseology, when we wanted to indicate in the Bill later on that we were referring to a judge other than the Chief Justice, we would have to say &ldquo;such number of judges other than the Chief Justice&rdquo; and repeat some such cumbersome phrase throughout the Bill.  This is purely a matter of drafting technique, and we obviate all these difficulties by saying there will be the Chief Justice and four ordinary judges and it will be recognisable as such simply by that appellation later on throughout the Bill.</P>

I yield to their undoubtedly great talents in many respects but when it comes to deciding constitutional phrases, there must be some backing for it in the Constitution.  I believe that putting in &ldquo;other judges&rdquo; would meet all the difficulties.  I cannot argue any further for that point of view, since we both have our own minds on it.  Let us get back to the numbers.  Let us start off with the fact that on two special occasions, and on two special occasions only, the Constitution requires five <Col N="660" /> judges in the Supreme Court.  They are very rare occasions.  One is where the Court have to determine the permanent incapacity of the President.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You start off by saying that you want five but the five are to be made up either of the Supreme Court itself or such judges as they may get from time to time by calling on the President of the High Court or the judges of the High Court. There is a big reservation.  This demand for five which may be made up of High Court judges as well as by the judges of the Supreme Court is subject to subsection (4) and subsection (4) then puts it in the form that the Chief Justice may determine that any appeal or other matter cognisable by the Supreme Court shall be heard by three judges.  Even then it says that in relation to those three, you may call upon either the President of the High Court or judges of the High Court.  There is no great demand for a court of five judges in the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last point first.  There is a demand. The Government want a full court of five on all possible occasions and litigants want a full court of five on all possible occasions.  From every point of view, it is desirable.  I should say it is more than desirable.  It is necessary that where possible we should have the Supreme Court sitting with five judges.  It is only where some difficult situation arises that we would allow the Chief Justice discretion in certain cases to have a court of three but Section 7 envisages that that should be the exception.  The rule will be that you will have a court of five judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see what Deputy McGilligan is driving at.  This Bill purports to establish the courts and determine their constitution as laid down by the Constitution.  Does Deputy McGilligan want the Bill to say that the number of the judges shall be such as may be decided from time to time by the Government? Does he want the Bill to be vague on the number of judges so that the Government can come along and say they will appoint another Supreme Court judge?  That would be absurd. We must write into these Bills how many judges there shall be in the <Col N="662" /> Supreme Court.  It has been decided in the light of experience that there should be five judges and the five judges will be the Chief Justice and four Supreme Court judges.  That decision is the right one in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the normal working of the Supreme Court, these five judges will sit as a full court.  Indeed, we have provided, where one is absent or ill, that we must call upon the High Court for a judge to make up the number of five.  These provisions are there to ensure that wherever possible, you will have a fixed court of five sitting in the Supreme Court.  Purely for the purposes of workability, the Chief Justice could in certain circumstances, such as the pressure of business, secure that an appeal might be heard by a court of three but that would be the exception.  If we think that five is the right number of judges for the Supreme Court, then we should appoint five judges surely and stipulate that there shall be five.  We could not possibly visualise a situation where, in order to make up the full Supreme Court, you would have to be running to the High Court to get a judge.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan must answer two questions.  Does he want the number written into the law as a definite number and, if so, what number would that be?  The answer is that we must stipulate how many judges there shall be in the Supreme Court. The answer to the second question is that experience has shown that there should be five.  That is the simple concept we have provided in subsection (2).</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to favour Deputy McGilligan's argument. He referred to the word &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo;. With regard to the number, the Parliamentary Secretary made a mistake. He said it should be clearly laid down by an Act of the Oireachtas but that is precisely what the Bill does not do.  Earlier in his remarks, the Parliamentary Secretary asked whether Deputy McGilligan wanted the position to be that the Government could appoint another judge to the Supreme Court?  That is precisely <Col N="663" /> what the Bill permits the Government to do.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to have a precise number of judges, the Bill is badly drafted.</P>

It is not intended that it should be a permanent Bill as this Bill will be.  The number in regard to the Supreme Court judges is clearly laid down in Section 4 of the No. 2 Bill.</P>

      <P>Two questions were put to me.  I was asked if I thought the number should be stated. My answer to that is &ldquo;certainly&rdquo;, in an Act of the Oireachtas.  This is the Second Bill.  I am talking about the First Bill.  Why should you say &ldquo;such number (not being less than four)...as may from time to time be fixed by Act of the Oireachtas&rdquo; when we have a Bill running along which says four?</P>

      <P>I was asked whether I thought there should be a number stated as the proper number in respect of the Supreme Court.  I certainly do.  It is to be five.  We are coming along with an Act of the Oireachtas which says four, plus the Chief Justice.  We are told that experience has shown that a court of five in the Supreme Court was required.  That is <Col N="664" /> not the case.  I do not think there are any statistics on the matter.  Without any detailed observation, I would say that the majority of cases tried in the Supreme Court do not take five judges. It is unusual.  It is more usual than it used to be but it has been very unusual for quite a while and it is still unusual that a court of five will sit.  In the majority of cases, the number is three, and as far as experience goes, five would not seem to be required.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Government view that there should be five, when reading the Second Bill, I did not see any suggestion that there should be a court of five.  I take it, now that that has been put forward as a point of view, that the Government are saying there should be a court of five in most cases in the Supreme Court.  It is badly expressed. Subsection (4) does not say that in exceptional circumstances the Chief Justice may call on three judges. It simply says that the Chief Justice may determine that an appeal shall be heard by three judges.  When that point of view is reached, three sit in the Supreme Court.  There is nothing there about exceptional circumstances or an exception to the rule, and so on.  You may say &ldquo;five&rdquo; and then go on to say: &ldquo;But it is all subject to the determination either of the Chief Justice or the senior judge of the Supreme Court.&rdquo; The experience of the courts is against what the Parliamentary Secretary says.</P>
      <P>I did not advert to the fact that there was any strong direction to be given here for five, except in very rare circumstances. That could be better expressed. In addition, the original Bill, as given to us, had another exception and that was that if the parties agreed, then it could be a court of four.  I gather that will be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the No. 1 Bill, the Establishment and Constitution Bill, we merely say &ldquo;such number,&rdquo; not being less than four.  The Establishment and Constitution Bill does not say it shall be four and cannot be more.  The Establishment Bill&mdash;in pursuance of our suggestion that the Supreme Court should be, in so far as possible, and consist in so far as possible, of a court of five&mdash;stipulates that there shall be <Col N="665" /> not less than five judges in the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The temporary Bill, which may from time to time be amended, lays down that as for now the number in the Supreme Court will be five.  It could be six, seven or eight at any time by amending legislation.  The permanent Bill merely goes so far as to say: &ldquo;We want it always to be at least five.&rdquo;  We can make it more from time to time but we want it five.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2) (b), page 2, lines 30 and 31, to delete &ldquo;Breitheamh den Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; and the brackets enclosing the next five words.</P>
      <P>It is the same argument but a different title.  Briefly, in the Constitution the description all the time is &ldquo;judge&rdquo;. There is no question of &ldquo;Breitheamh&rdquo; coming into it.  This is all a matter of &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; not being in the Constitution at all.  With regard to these titles, I do not know where I am. There is a question of &ldquo;Breitheamh den Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo;.  Elsewhere in this measure, we find that phrase used and there is a different termination&mdash;&ldquo;Uachtaraighe&rdquo;. I do not think that is the correct genitive of &ldquo;Uachtarach&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In another part of this legislation, &ldquo;Uachtarach&rdquo; is changed into &ldquo;Uachtaraighe&rdquo;. My little knowledge of Irish makes me believe that may not be correct, grammatically.</P>

      <P>Then it provides that they shall be (a) the Chief Justice and (b) ordinary judges.  Therefore, it is crystal clear from that that the word &ldquo;judges&rdquo; includes both the Chief Justice and the ordinary judges; in other words, judges as a generic term includes both.  If we come down further to subsection (4), it will be seen that I am perfectly right in pointing out that &ldquo;ordinary judge&rdquo; refers to judges other than the Chief Justice or, in this case, other than the President of the High Court and that &ldquo;judges&rdquo; means &ldquo;ordinary judges and the President of the High Court.&rdquo;  That applies whether it is the Supreme Court or the High Court which is in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  May I deal with amendment No. 7 for the moment?  I am anxious to know what is meant by all this.  The aim of subsection (4) is to allow judges of the High Court to be brought into the Supreme Court for Supreme Court business.  The preamble to the subsection says: &ldquo;Where, owing to the <Col N="676" /> illness of a judge of the Supreme Court or for any other reason...&rdquo; In other words, the reasons are left rather at large.  First of all it was illness; then it was &ldquo;any other unavoidable cause&rdquo; and now it is &ldquo;any other reason&rdquo;.  That is not consistent with the next section, subsection (5) of Section 2.  What are the circumstances in which a judge of the High Court may be called upon by the Chief Justice to transact Supreme Court business?  It is when the full number of judges of the Supreme Court are not available.  The full number is five.</P>
      <P>When the Constitution speaks of the full number, as it does in two instances, it is the full Court of five.  It is understood that where there is any reference to the full court of the Supreme Court, it is a court of five.  That would mean, then, that if four judges of the Supreme Court are available, only then may the Chief Justice call on a High Court judge.  Suppose the Chief Justice has determined that the case be heard by three judges, as he may under the next Bill.  Is he empowered to call on a High Court judge to come up because one of the five is absent?  That is my reading of this phrase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I suggest it should not be the situation.  Instead, I would put in &ldquo;where a sufficient number of the Supreme Court judges is not available for the transaction of the business&rdquo;.  That would mean if the court wants five and there are not five, they can call on a judge of the High Court.  If the Chief Justice thinks a court of four ought to hear a particular case and there are two missing, he then calls two.  But suppose he wants a case heard by three judges only and there are four available, why should he be entitled to call on a High Court judge to assist him in those circumstances?</P>

It says that it &ldquo;shall be called the Supreme Court.&rdquo;  In addition, the Constitution says that the President of the Supreme Court shall be called the Chief Justice.  We are not carrying out the Constitution by calling the Court of Final Appeal An Chúirt Uachtarach, with a translation of three words in brackets, and calling the President An Phriomh Breitheamh, with a translation inside brackets.</P>

    <P>I also object to the making of discrimination between judges and dividing them into judges and ordinary judges.

      <P>I entirely agree with Deputy McGilligan.  The matter has been discussed in relation to two of the amendments last night. I do not think anything the Parliamentary Secretary has said can convince any Deputy interested in this matter that this form of legislation is appropriate or proper.  We must face up to the realities of our situation here.  When we are talking in English we call our institutions&mdash;our courts, the Army and all the rest of it&mdash;by what they are well known as in the language we are using.  If we talk in Irish, we refer to them in the appropriate Irish terminology; but speaking in either English or Irish, we are bound to accord with what the Constitution of this country lays down.</P>
      <P>In this section, the Minister, through the Parliamentary Secretary, breaks all the conventions.  He is asking us to pass a section which, as I said last night, is pidgin English.  In so doing, he is asking us to legislate in the teeth of what the Constitution provides. I think this section, on all counts, is most undesirable, unhappily worded and serves no useful purpose to the courts, to the Irish language or to the prestige of the State.</P>

      <P>No.  I would agree if you said that amendments Nos. 9 to 19 cover, in respect of the High Court and the President of the High Court, what was argued in connection with the Supreme Court.  With your permission, I shall take the whole lot together.  I presume amendment No. 14 will be accepted in the same way as amendment No. 7 was accepted.  Otherwise, we will have to argue the whole lot right through.  I object to calling the High Court An Ard-Chúirt.  I object to calling the President of the High Court Uachtarán na hArd-Chúirte.  I object to this discrimination between whatever the head of the High Court is to be called and ordinary judges.  I object to the President of the Circuit Court being made an additional judge of the High Court.  I think he should be made a judge <i>ex officio</i> of the High Court.  I urge the same argument with regard to the Appeal Court.  I think the points raised in relation to the Supreme Court would apply equally with regard to the High Court.  The rest then is just this matter of trying to <Col N="680" /> take away supreme recognition in the title of the members of the court.</P>
      <P>There is one last point.  I want to cut out subsection (5) because I do not know what it means.  I think it can all be carried in simply by saying that &ldquo;while so sitting he shall be a judge of the High Court&rdquo;.  There is this distinguishing feature with regard to Section 2 as opposed to Section 1. The Constitution does set up a Court of Final Appeal and says it shall be called &ldquo;The Supreme Court.&rdquo;  It leaves everything else at large.  It also says that the President of the Supreme Court shall be called the Chief Justice. There is no statement in the Constitution with regard to the High Court or with regard to any title of any person to be appointed as head of it. In fact, the President is entirely a creation of statute law, and the law that created that particular office stated that he was to be appointed by the President on the advice of the Government and he was to take precedence, or to have priority, over the judges of the High Court.  I presume that will stand.  It has not been cut out by any of the repeal sections of the next Act.  It raises a point, however, with regard to the Court of Criminal Appeal and with regard to the District Court and, because of that, points must be raised on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, as we are here dealing largely with title, we should at least observe the Constitution in so far as there is any reflection in this matter at all.  The Constitution did say, in the first instance, Courts of Final Appeal.  They gave a title in English for the Court of Final Appeal; it is to be called The Supreme Court.  I think the High Court should be called the High Court.  There are references to the courts, but they are generally to the judges and to other courts. The only distinction made in the Constitution between the Court of Final Appeal and Courts of First Instance is that they are divided into local courts with legal and limited jurisdiction.  There is no statement that the court is to be called in a particular way.  The High Court is referred to in paragraph 3 of Article <Col N="681" /> 34.  It does not say it is to be called the High Court, but it says it is the High Court.  I think we should keep to these terms.</P>
    <P>When we come to the President of the High Court, we are at large because he is entirely a creation of statute and can be called anything. Before this debate is over, he may be called &ldquo;<i>Mon Seigneur</i>&rdquo; or something. In the English version, we should keep to the English title.  If there is any Irish put in, in order to have some stereotype, then the Irish phrase should be put in in brackets.  I will not weary the House with arguments but I move to delete subsection (b) of Section 5 and to substitute a phrase similar to that which I had in respect of the High Court, namely, when a judge of the Circuit Court is called to do duty in the High Court he shall, while so sitting, be a judge of the High Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the only thing in this series of amendments is amendment No. 14.  I think the House will readily appreciate why, even though we accepted amendment No. 7, we cannot accept amendment No. 14.  The phraseology in paragraph (a) of subsection (5) is completely different from the wording of subsection (4) of Section 1.  I should point out that subsection (5) (a) states:</P>
      <P>Where, owing to the illness of a judge of the High Court or for any other reason, the full number of judges of the High Court is not available for the transaction of the business of that Court or, on account of the volume of business to be transacted in the High Court or for any other reason arising from the state of business in that Court, it is expedient to increase temporarily the number of judges available for the purposes of the High Court, the Chief Justice, at the request of the President of the High Court, may request any ordinary judge of the Supreme Court to sit in the High Court as an additional judge thereof, and every ordinary judge of the Supreme Court so requested shall sit in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of that phraseology, I think <Col N="682" /> Deputy McGilligan might agree it is not necessary to substitute &ldquo;a sufficient&rdquo; for &ldquo;the full&rdquo;.  I think all possible circumstances are covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why say &ldquo;the full number of judges&rdquo;?  The full number of judges under the next Bill is six, plus the President, that is, seven in all. This means that, although there is only work for four, if one is ill, judges of the Supreme Court can be called on. Why should one be allowed to do that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part deals with the problem where the full number of judges are not available and, on account of the volume of business, or for any other reason arising from the state of business, it is expedient to increase temporarily the number of judges.  I think that certainly covers the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes it easier to call on the Supreme Court judges&mdash;&ldquo;if, for any other reason,&rdquo; it is necessary to call on the Supreme Court judges is a very liberal allowance indeed.  The first test is there are seven High Court judges, including the President; if one is ill and you have business for only four, you can call on a Supreme Court judge under this.  That is certainly not a reasonable suggestion.</P>

      <P>Where on account of the volume of business to be transacted in the High Court or for any other reason arising from the state of business in that Court, it is expedient to increase temporarily the number of judges available for the purposes of the High Court,</P>

      <P>The section says:</P>
      <P>Where, owing to the illness of a judge of the High Court or for any other reason, the full number of judges of the High Court is not available...</P>
      <P>The full number of judges of the High Court is seven.  That would mean that if one man is ill or writing a judgement so that there are only six available, the President of the High Court can call in members of the Supreme Court. Why should he be allowed?</P>

      <P>Where, on account of the volume of business to be transacted in the High Court or for any other reason arising from the state of business in that Court, it is expedient to increase temporarily the number of judges.</P>
      <P>That gives everything.  This matter should not be poised upon temporary incapacity of one of the seven members of the High Court.  If the remaining six are capable of carrying on the business, then there should be no necessity to go to the Supreme Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more in it than that.  The section deals with the establishment and constitution of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The Court of Criminal Appeal is unknown to the Constitution and when I turn to the provision of the Transitory Section of the Constitution under which the original courts were carried forward, it is in these terms&mdash;Article 58:</P>
      <P>On and after the coming into operation of this Constitution and until otherwise determined by law,...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> This is the determination otherwise, but until that happens</P>
    <P>the Supreme Court of Justice, the High Court of Justice, the Circuit Court of Justice and the District Court of Justice in existence immediately before the coming into operation of this Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and then there is a reservation which does not matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>shall ... continue to exercise the same jurisdictions respectively as heretofore, and any judge or justice being a member of any such Court shall ... continue ...</P>
    <P>The courts that were carried forward were the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Circuit Court and District Court.  There is no mention of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  That court is in a very peculiar position; it is not a High Court proper and it is not a Supreme Court.  It is certainly not a Court of Final Appeal because there may be an appeal from it but it is a court of appeal of some type.  I do not know how it has been constituted. The amendments Nos. 21, 22 and 23 are an endeavour to make this court a High Court.  At the moment there are references to the Chief Justice and the court is to be composed in either of two ways; three judges, one of whom is the Chief Justice and the other two may be Supreme Court judges, High Court judges, or else any two may be two ordinary judges of the High Court or else a High Court judge and the President of the High Court.  It is a mixed court.  As it stands here, we shall always be obliged to have on it either the Chief Justice or a Supreme Court judge.</P>
    <P>That puts it in a very peculiar position and I cannot find where it is provided for, or even permitted under the Constitution.  Its personnel is such that it is neither one thing nor the other.  It is not a Supreme Court and it is not a High Court.  Apart from that I do not see how you can fit it in with the description or division of courts in the Constitution, where you have a Court of First Instance.  I doubt if the Court of <Col N="688" /> Criminal Appeal can be described in that way.  Certainly, it is not a Court of Final Appeal because there may be an appeal from it.  For that reason, although it does not meet all the difficulties, I want to put in, instead of having the Chief Justice summoning or being a member of the Court, that you would have the President of the High Court being the person who would take upon himself the making of the Court, the summoning of the Court and determining who is to be on the Court.  I would put that in the hands of the President of the High Court and take away this necessity for having either the Chief Justice or members of the Supreme Court on the court itself.</P>
    <P>I think we have come to the position when we must make up our mind as to whether it is to be a High Court or a Supreme Court.  It is not a Court of Final Appeal and, certainly, my amendment would not make it that.  If it has to become a High Court, which I think it should be, the Constitutional ruling is there and there should be the right of appeal and by being a High Court there would be a right of appeal.  That would be all right.  As it stands, it is a hybrid court and I think it is not fully in accord with the Constitution. That is the substance of the amendments I have down&mdash;to change the composition of the court&mdash;and I think that matter should be attended to.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 20 is the usual matter of title or nomenclature.  If we are to change the composition of the court we should have clarity to ourselves as to what we call the court.  That is the only amendment I have in regard to nomenclature. The others are concerned with its position.  It cannot be the Supreme Court; it cannot be a Court of Final Appeal and the only alternative seems to be to make it a High Court.</P>
    <P>May I say that I do not know what is going to happen with respect to determinations.  There has been a Court of Criminal Appeal of a hybrid type that has made many determinations. On the coming into operation of the Constitution, Article 58 carried <Col N="689" /> forward certain courts but they were certain named courts, the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court.  The judges of those courts were kept on as they were but there is no suggestion that the Court of Criminal Appeal was either recognised or carried forward by the Constitution.  What has happened to the determinations that were made in the Court of Criminal Appeal I do not like to answer.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 4, lines 2 and 3, to delete &ldquo;An Chúirt Dúiche&rdquo; and the brackets enclosing the next three words.</P>
      <P>Some of these amendments are much the same as those that have been discussed but there are a few extra.  Nos. 29 and 32 are different and I should like to speak on them also.  Particularly, I want to stress Nos. 29 and 32. Amendment No. 29 proposes to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>The District Court shall be constituted of such number of judges as may from time to time be fixed by Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In amendment No. 32 I want to delete the word &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; and put in the word &ldquo;Judge&rdquo;.  There is a constitutional point arising as between this and the other Bill.  Apparently, there is a desire here to appoint judges, to have a court constituted of judges but to call them justices.  The word &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; of course is completely unknown to the <Col N="691" /> Constitution.  The protection that is given to the judiciary in the Article that is supposed to protect them is all the time framed in terms of judges.</P>
    <P>The protection in regard to their not being removable from office, except for stated misbehaviour, applies only to judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court but, by law, that same protection has been given both to judges of the circuit court and to justices of the district court.  But what is the position under the Constitution?  Article 34 says that justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by the Constitution.  It then goes on to say that certain matters are to be administered in public and states the requisites for the proper handling of justicial matters in courts established by the Constitution by justices appointed in the manner provided in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>At a later stage one comes to Article 34 which refers to a person appointed as a judge who, under this Constitution, shall make and subscribe a particular declaration which is set out in clause 5 of Article 34.  The Article says that the declaration &ldquo;shall be made and subscribed by the Chief Justice in the presence of the President and by each of the other judges of the Supreme Court, the judges of the High Court and the judges of every other Court in the presence of the Chief Justice or the senior available judge of the Supreme Court in open court.&rdquo; I have not the slightest doubt that the people who are now called district justices all made that declaration in the presence of the Chief Justice or the senior judge of the Supreme Court.  That declaration is obligatory on every judge.  If he declines or neglects to make such declaration he is deemed to have vacated his office.</P>
    <P>Article 35 says that the judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and all other courts established in pursuance of Article 34 shall be appointed by the President.  &ldquo;All judges,&rdquo;&mdash; that covers the people we are talking about&mdash;&ldquo;shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law.&rdquo;  Then there is the prohibition <Col N="692" /> that no judge shall be a member of either House of the Oireachtas, or hold any other office or position of emolument.  Eventually, when you come to Article 37, there is a provision that limits the functions and powers of a judicial nature which may be exercised by people who are not judges before tribunals which are not courts. There is one great reservation in that and that is in regard to criminal matters. That means that, whatever loosening up there may be of the judicial functions in respect of the terms of Article 37, there is reserved from it everything that has to do with criminal matters.</P>
    <P>The work of the district courts has I would say, largely to do with criminal matters and their jurisdiction is mainly in respect of offences.  They may try cases summarily to a conclusion, or they may have a preliminary hearing to decide whether a person should be sent forward for trial or not. In any event, criminal matters must be dealt with by people who are judges appointed, or in courts established, under the Constitution.  In Section 5 I think there is an attempt to distinguish between how a court is constituted and what the members of the court are to be called.  We have here that there is to be established An Chúirt Dúiche and that it is to be constituted of the following judges: the President of the District Court, and such number of other judges styled in a particular way.</P>
    <P>When I turn to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill I see that Part IV deals with the district court.  Section 28 says that the number of justices in the district court shall be not more than a certain number.  That is not merely a matter of nomenclature.  They are justices there and not judges.  It is worse still if one looks at Section 29. It says that &ldquo;each of the persons who are justices of the existing District Court&rdquo;&mdash;one can not interfere with the people who, rightly or wrongly, have been called that&mdash;&ldquo;immediately before the operative date shall be qualified for appointment as a justice....&rdquo; There is no such appointment.  The appointment must be as a judge, but here it says that where a person is qualified to be a justice &ldquo;and, if and so long as there is one or more than one <Col N="693" /> of those persons who is willing to accept office and has not been appointed, no other person shall be qualified for appointment as a justice of the District Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the section says that paragraph (a) of the subsection applies only in relation to the qualification for appointment of the first justices of the district court.  One then comes on to subsection (2) which says that &ldquo;A person who is for the time being a practising barrister or a solicitor of not less than ten years standing shall be qualified for appointment as a justice of the District Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole run of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill is to have these people appointed as justices and not appointed as judges.  I do not think that is constitutional.  I suggest it is not.  The Constitution is entirely in terms of judges.  It may be said that having appointed them as judges we can call them anything we like, as we are calling one of them &ldquo;Uachtarán na Cúirte Dúiche&rdquo; but that is a matter of evasion.  On the matter of appointment there is no doubt.  They must be appointed as judges.  If that point is accepted, and I do not see how it can fail to be accepted, I think it is absurd to be demeaning this particular court group by calling them out of their proper title.  They are judges under the Constitution.  They have the fortification of the judges and they must make the same declaration as the judges.  In every way there is a similarity between judges and justices.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the importance of their work in the country, I think they deserve the title of judge equally with judges of the other courts. I raise this matter because it is the foundation matter and when we are establishing the court and saying that the court is to be composed of the following judges we should give them the title of judges.  It is noticeable that the words used in the Irish version are the same for High Court, Circuit Court and Supreme Court, and it is only the English version that makes the difference. I raise this on Section 5 and I think we should carry this forward to their title.  Having established a court as a court of justices, to be manned by <Col N="694" /> justices, it will require very serious amendments of the Articles dealing with this particular court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full agreement with Deputy McGilligan that the persons to be appointed to the district courts are judges in the full sense of that term.  It is for that reason that Section 5 is phrased as it is.  Section 5 states, in subsection (2), that &ldquo;the District Court shall be constituted of the following judges&mdash;(a) a judge who shall be styled...and (b) such number of other judges...&rdquo; There can be no question about that.  Section 5 appoints these people to be judges and in that regard the provisions of the Constitution are fully complied with. Once they are appointed judges, their styling of course is a completely different matter.  Once the basic and fundamental step of establishing the office of judges is carried out in Section 5, the section merely goes on to say they shall be styled as justices.  The fact that we style them as justices does not in any way detract from the fullness of their appointment as judges in accordance with the Constitution.  The reason we style them as justices rather than judges is quite a simple one.  The matter was considered by the Government and they decided that the traditional form by which a district justice has always been addressed and styled should prevail.  That form of address or styling has been there for a long time now, and it was simply a matter of the Government deciding the traditional styling should be adhered to.</P>

      <P>I agree.  In Section 5, the elementary, or basic, or fundamental thing is done, that is, the creation of the office of the District <Col N="695" /> Court and of the judges of the District Court.  It quite clearly and specifically says in relation to the establishment and constitution of that court that: &ldquo;The District Court shall be constituted of the following judges&mdash;(a) a judge, and (b) such other judges....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Such convolutions will be very confusing.  They must be judges by virtue of their appointment. Secondly, the leader of that court is to be styled Uachtarán na Cúirte Dúiche.  He is to be one part of the composition of the court.  With him, there are to be other judges and each one is to be styled Breitheamh den Chúirt Dúiche.  &ldquo;Breitheamh&rdquo; is the Irish word for judge and it is only in the English translation of the word &ldquo;breitheamh&rdquo; that the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; appears.</P>
      <P>When we come to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, in Section 45, we find that &ldquo;Each other judge and justice of the District Court shall be addressed in court as &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo;.  So we have three things to consider.  First the appointment; secondly, how they are styled in Irish and in English; and thirdly, how they are to be addressed.  Only in one case does the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; occur.  Only in the English translation of the phrase on how they are to be styled does the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still perturbed about Section 5 of the fundamental Bill and Section 29 of the other Bill.  There is radical objection to be taken there.  In Section 29 they are to be appointed justices, not appointed judges and called justices.  It would be rather absurd but understandable if we were to keep to this line with Section 5.  If this English phrase were wiped out, it would appear to be all right, because the appointment is as a judge, and the entitlement is breitheamh. That is entirely confined to the second Bill which must be taken in conjunction with this Bill.  That causes a difficulty and I suggest it should be looked at again.  I suggest that the translation of &ldquo;breitheamh den Chúirt Dúiche&rdquo; should be, in <Col N="696" /> brackets, &ldquo;judge of the district court&rdquo;. That is what their appointment is, and I do not see why their title should not correspond with their appointment.</P>
    <P>In the title we have given to chief justices, there is a sort of addition.  We call them chief justices or Phríomh-Bhreithimh or Uachtarán of the different courts.  We now have Uachtarán na Cúirte Dúiche.  There, there is something additional, but do not take away from the title that should be used in accordance with the method of appointment.  I suggest that might be looked at again to see whether the translation of the word &ldquo;breitheamh&rdquo; could be put down as &ldquo;judge&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind undertaking to look at it again.  I am reasonably satisfied that it is perfectly all right as it is.  In Section 5, we are establishing the office and creating the judges, and we indicate in Section 5 that after they have been created, they are to be styled in a certain way.  That is perfectly in order.</P>
      <P>In the second Bill, in Section 29, we are referring to judges who have been created and styling them justices.  I have explained that we propose to keep the form of styling them district justices because it is traditional.  Once we have created judges, established the office of judge of the District Court, the constitutional obligation is discharged, and it is perfectly in order to refer to them as justices.  We do not in any way detract from their constitutional status as judges by styling them justices.  In other words, you can call a person any name you like and he is essentially the same person.  It does not matter what title you give him.  It is the same here.  These appointments are made and judges of the District Court are thereafter styled in a certain way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I at this stage point out on a point raised earlier about the Irish form of &ldquo;Cúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; that I understand the use of &ldquo;Uachtarach&rdquo;, <Col N="697" /> instead of &ldquo;Uachtaraigh&rdquo; as in the Constitution, is in conformity with the official standard grammar and spelling adopted in 1958.  It appears that in the declension of the adjective the dative case is going out of use.  I have no doubt that gladdens the hearts of many of us.  That is the position and, indeed, I understand the current texts of the Constitution are brought up to date in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  I take it from what the Parliamentary Secretary has said that Section 29 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill is regarded as proper, and that under the next Bill, we are going to appoint people to be justices, and not appoint them as judges and call them justices.  They will be appointed justices.  That is the term used.  I must again refer to Article 34 of the Constitution which provides:</P>
      <P>Justice shall be administered in public courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution.</P>
      <P>Later on, it refers to certain limited functions of a judicial type that may be undertaken by non-judicial persons. The terms in which that provision is couched are:</P>
      <P>... limited functions and powers of a judicial nature ...</P>
      <P>&mdash;may be handed over to a person or a body of persons&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... notwithstanding that such person or such body of persons is not <Col N="698" /> a judge or a court appointed or established as such under this Constitution.</P>
    <P>The word used in the Constitution in connection with judges is &ldquo;appointed&rdquo;. It deals with appointment and not with what they are called.  Section 29 asks us to appoint people as justices and not as judges.  Even if the word &ldquo;judge&rdquo; were determined by some definition section to include the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo;, it might be better, but it would be a poor way of doing it.  The operative phrase is &ldquo;appointing as a justice.&rdquo;  We are making people judges, in fact, under Section 5 and then we are going to appoint them as justices. May I read Section 29?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the operative matter.  The establishment section establishes a court comprised of judges and under Section 29, it is to be filled.  Each person who is a district justice at the moment is qualified.  No other person will be qualified for appointment except justices of the district court.  That applies only to the appointment of the first justice. Subsection (2) of Section 29 says:</P>
      <P>A person who is for the time being a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years' standing shall be qualified for appointment as a justice of the District Court.</P>
      <P>The new district court will be comprised either of people who are already district justices or new appointments.  As far as the group who are already district justices are concerned, they are to be appointed. As far as the new ones are concerned, they are to be appointed district justices so long as they are of a certain standing.  I think that is unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>In regard to the district court, we appoint these people to be justices.  At the same time, we go on, just as Deputy McGilligan said, to a definition section and say these people are appointed judges and this is how they shall be qualified.  Section 29 of the Court (Supplemental Provisions) Bill is not an appointing section or an establishing section.  It is merely the section which outlines the qualifications for appointment.  In that section, when we want to refer to these people, we refer to them by the style we outline in the establishment section which is Section 5 of the first Bill.</P>

We are not attempting to describe the character of the person appointed.  It merely refers to the office established in accordance with Section 5 of the first Bill.

Section 30 states that the age of retirement of a justice of the district court shall be 65.  Subsection (1) of that section speaks of the retirement of a justice of the district court.  Section 31 refers to pensions of justices of the district court.  Finally, subsection (2) of Section 31 says that when a justice of the district court is removed from office on account of incapacity, he shall be deemed for the purpose of pension to have vacated his office owing to permanent infirmity. There you have the whole idea of appointment, salary, and removal in the terms of a justice.  The Constitution knows nothing about justices; it knows judges.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy McGilligan in that respect.  A possible way out of this, in order to clarify the second Bill, would be in Section 28 to have judges of the District Court rather than justices.  I do not agree with Deputy McGilligan in regard to Section 29.  In reading out bits of it, he was emphasising the appointment. What seems to be emphasised are the qualifications for appointment. &ldquo;Qualifying&rdquo; is the operative word. I do not think this argument is quite fair.  There cannot be any doubt that <Col N="701" /> they are appointed as judges in Section 5 of the No. 1 Bill.  It is very odd that the same Irish word should have two different meanings in English although that is not uncommon, I believe, in many languages.  I cannot help saying that all this business of titles and their meaning reminds me of the Republic of Ireland Act, 1948, where we purported to change the Constitution without doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It had better be defined again because it does not say so.  I thought this was comprehensive, that it referred both to the existing holders of these offices and those who may hold them in the future.  Amongst them is put in a President of the District Court who is a new person.  That ties it as far as he is concerned to the new offices.  I want to cut him out from this.  I do not think that office should be created.  I shall deal with that on the other Bill.</P>
      <P>I also want to dwell on the office of the justice or judge of the district court which would refer to the future as well as the past.  Those who are office holders in the district court at the moment are called district court justices. According to section 5, the new district court is to be constituted of judges, not justices.  How can a person hold the office of justice when the office is that of judge of the district court? There is no such thing as the office of justice of the district court.  There is the office of a judge of the district court who may be called justice.  That is all.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with what I have said.</P>
      <P>I took, then, subsection (2) to apply both ways.  I took it that the present holders or, if we are looking at this measure five years' hence, those who are then the holders of these offices or, maybe, those who hold them in the future, may vacate.  The word &ldquo;vacating&rdquo; in this piece of legislation is surely appropriate to the existing office holders.  As I read Section 6&mdash;</P>

      <P>Then subsection (3) provides:</P>

      <P>Each of the following courts, namely, the Supreme Court, the High Court and the Circuit Court, shall be deemed to be duly constituted during and notwithstanding any vacancy in the office of any judge of that Court.</P>
      <P>Again, I took that to have this objective, that judges will be vacating their office by resignation or will be appointed to office not all on the same day, certainly not the same minute, and you would not have a properly constituted court.  Subsection (4) provides, as I have said:</P>
      <P>Each of the following Courts, namely, the Supreme Court, the High Court and the Circuit Court, shall be deemed to be duly constituted during and notwithstanding any vacancy in the office of any judge of that Court.</P>

      <P>Dealing with appointments to and resignations from them in the future.  The new subsection which will be inserted by amendment No. 37 has reference more to Section 7 than it has to Section 6.  The purpose of amendment 37 and amendment 41 is to ensure that a judicial office that is there at present will be vacated by the occupant being appointed with his consent to a new judicial office under the Bill.  When that vacation has taken place by that <Col N="706" /> appointment to a new judicial office, then the office will stand abolished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to use phrases or adjectives that might be misunderstood but it comes back to this absurdity.  Section 1 says the President of the Supreme Court shall be &ldquo;An Príomh-Bhreitheamh (The Chief Justice).&rdquo;  That is what the section says.  The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that Section 6 which is, if you like, a business section, refers to the new appointments, the new holders of judicial office, that in doing so the reference is to the office of Chief Justice.  There is no office of Chief Justice created by this Bill.  It is just not being created.  In my view it should be created.  We are creating an entirely new judicial personage: &ldquo;An Príomh-Bhreitheamh (The Chief Justice).&rdquo;  That is what we are doing and we had better realise where we are going.  The same applies to the President of the High Court and all the rest of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get the contrast between subsection (3) and the proposed new subsection (4).  Subsection (3) says a judicial office held by any person shall be vacated by his being appointed, with his consent to another judicial office. That means in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the future.  Very good.  On the other hand the new subsection (4) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The office held by each person who, immediately before the commencement of this Act, was a judge <Col N="708" /> or justice of any of the courts of justice mentioned in Article 58 of the Constitution shall be vacated by his being appointed, with his consent, to a judicial office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, the purpose of Section 7 is to disestablish the existing courts.  It is proposed to go about it in the following manner. Subsection (1) defines the expression &ldquo;the existing courts&rdquo;.  Subsection (2) states that &ldquo;the existing courts shall, on the commencement of this Act, cease to exercise any jurisdiction&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, have no effective <Col N="711" /> judicial function, because the new courts will be established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  You then go on to deal with the judges.  Subsection (3) says &ldquo;When every person who immediately before the commencement of this Act held the office of judge or justice of any of the existing courts has...&rdquo;  Pause there and delete the words &ldquo;ceased to hold&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;vacated&rdquo;.  Amendment 41 would substitute &ldquo;vacated&rdquo; for &ldquo;ceased to hold&rdquo; and subsection (3) would then read &ldquo;When every person who immediately before the commencement of this Act held the office of judge or justice of any of the existing courts has vacated that office....&rdquo;  The new subsection (4) which we inserted in Section 6 shows how he vacates the office&mdash;by being appointed to a new judicial office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The court is not disestablished. It is only when every person who immediately before the commencement of the Act held the office has vacated the office that the court ceases to be established and the office stands abolished.  So, unless every one of the judges vacates the office by appointment to the new courts, the court does not become disestablished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was looking at the phrase I mentioned on the Second Reading that the matter depended on every person vacating his office.  I sought to meet that by saying in my amendment No. 40 that:</P>
      <P>When a person who immediately before the commencement of this Act held the office of judge or justice of any of the existing courts has vacated that office the office held by such person shall stand abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> As each person vacates his office, his office is abolished; whereas this holds up the disestablishment of the courts until everybody has vacated his office. I thought that was a bad situation to have.  It is met by abolishing each office as the office is vacated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be some suggestion about the constitutionality of disestablishing courts with a judge in them, as it were.  I am not saying it is a valid argument, but we want to obviate any suggestion of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I had said is that the office should stand abolished.  I leave the courts in the position that, once the commencement date of the Act has been settled, then there is no jurisdiction.  You have to deal with the personnel.  I thought the best way of doing that was to say that as each person vacated his office, that office was abolished.  That is constitutional because you are not putting anyone out of office.</P>

      <P>Take 34 district justices and seven High Court judges. I do not know how many Circuit Court judges.  You have to wait for the lot of them to throw in their hands. I thought that was a bad thing. Suppose you have one or two district judges on the verge of retirement. They may say: &ldquo;We will not retire. We will just hang on.&rdquo;  Then you cannot disestablish the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but may I suggest that the only difference between us and Deputy McGilligan is this. His amendment would propose to <Col N="713" /> abolish each office piecemeal as it was vacated, but he would not be able to disestablish the courts until all the offices had been vacated.  Therefore, effectively, there is no difference between us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing the same except we say &ldquo;Abolish all the offices together and disestablish the courts all at the same time.&rdquo;  I do not think Deputy McGilligan achieves anything by abolishing the offices step by step.  He still has to wait until they are all abolished to disestablish the courts.</P>

If the Minister says the figures are more or less of the same order, that will be sufficient for my purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There has always been a great deal of difficulty in relation to income tax from the point of view of the basis of assessment of individuals, on the one hand, and companies on the other.  From what I have been able to ascertain in relation to the six Common Market countries, the basis of taxation differs radically as between companies, on the one hand, and individuals on the other.  I was particularly anxious to know in relation to this section how the figure of some 200,000 is divided as between individual taxpayers, on the one hand, and companies on the other.</P>
      <P>The difficulties we will have in any circumstances in adjusting ourselves in relation to those problems depend to a very large extent, not merely on the manner in which revenue is collected between individual taxpayers on the one hand, and company taxpayers on the other, but also on the numbers involved in each category. Perhaps, therefore, during the course of this discussion, the Minister might be able to ascertain and advise the House what the latest figures are for that break-down.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is absolutely inevitable that there will always be a very great time lag in providing up-to-date information about assessment.  For example, between the various five schedules, it is inevitable that there will be a very great time lag in relation to collection of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last half of last year, there was the initial introduction of P.A.Y.E. and I should like the Minister to tell us in relation to this section how he segregates his tax revenue figures for income tax as between tax collected <Col N="719" /> by the P.A.Y.E. system and tax collected under the other schedules.</P>
    <P>Might I in relation to that interpolate an aside?  This year for the first time&mdash;I am not aware of the Standing Order under which it was done&mdash;the Tables normally circulated with the Budget are incorporated in the Dáil Report.  It was an excellent innovation. I am not aware of the Standing Order by virtue of which it is possible to interpolate into a Dáil Report documents that are not in fact read to the House but I am not interested in it to that extent.  It is an excellent innovation but might I suggest that it is only a halfway house that in connection with the Budget, one wants to consider, first, the Financial Statement and the Financial Resolutions that are proposed in the House&mdash;and they are always in the Dáil Report in any event; secondly, the Table explanatory of the Budget that is always circulated on Budget Day and as far as I can trace, that has not been incorporated in the Dáil Report; thirdly, the Tables that were circulated with the Budget which have for the first time, and I commend the innovation, been incorporated in the Dáil Report; fourthly, the estimates of the receipts and expenditure, which have not been incorporated in the Dáil Report.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree with me that it is a good thing to incorporate them so that everybody will have them there in handy form.  The additional cost of printing them when they are already set is negligible.  It is desirable that the whole four statements should be printed in the one volume rather than that only two should be picked out, the one we always had, and the Table.  I might suggest, therefore, for consideration in future, that it would be better to include, not merely the explanatory Tables which have been included this year&mdash;and I am glad to be able to commend the Minister on something&mdash;but also the Table explanatory of the current Budget 1961 and the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure.  Otherwise, one is looking at only half the picture.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, the Minister is including <Col N="720" /> for 1961-62 the sum of £28,350,000 as being the yield anticipated from income tax.  In the explanatory Table, the figure is reduced by £1,400,000. Therefore, it means that the Minister is hoping to get this year from income tax £26,950,000&mdash;call it £27,000,000.  I should be glad to know how much of that £27,000,000 is attributable to tax collected under P.A.Y.E.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that in asking the Minister for that figure, I appreciate that it is an estimate which may be liable to very considerable adjustment during the course of the year.  It is an estimate that may vary from a variety of causes during the year.  I want to make it clear that if circumstances change during the year &mdash;and they could, from a couple of causes, quite simply&mdash;I do not think the Minister will be subject on that score to any criticism if the estimate has to be varied also.  Such an estimate would give us a much clearer picture of the proportion likely to come from individual taxpayers on the one hand, and company taxpayers, on the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The main provision of this section is subsection (3) which extends for yet a further year the tax law in force on 5th April last.  As I have remarked on a previous occasion, in this section we are extending an archaic and antiquated tax code quite unsuited to our needs for yet a further year, a tax code which was originally invented 150 years ago by William Pitt.  As long as we continue to perpetuate it here year after year, we should prevail on the Minister to tell us something about the life and times of that great English gentleman, William Pitt.  It would be suitable that we should acknowledge our indebtedness to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The code was invented by William Pitt 150 years ago and introduced into this country in 1853, so that we are now extending it for the 108th year. Of all the archaic and antiquated provisions of that tax code, we can all agree that there is no provision more archaic than Schedule A property tax. There is sitting in this country a Commission established by Deputy Sweetman before he went out of office to reform our tax code and to recommend <Col N="721" /> the changes that should be made. That Commission, in its second Report, recommended the virtual abolition of Schedule A property tax. It recommended in particular its abolition in so far as it affects owner-occupiers of their own homes, up to a valuation of £30.  Schedule A is quite an extraordinary tax.  It is quite a legacy from the past.  In Pitt's time, when the code was invented, Schedule A was by far the most important income tax schedule.  At that time, in the early years of the present century, the industrial revolution had not taken place and it was before business or industrial profits had developed on the present scale as a proper subject for taxation.  It is now relatively an unimportant tax.  It is charged on property, on all lands, tenements and estates for every 20/- in the £ of their annual valuation.</P>
    <P>The theory is that there is a national income from this property and that the resident-occupier of his own home derives a national income from that occupation.  It was part of Ricardo's theory which has been completely discredited. The Income Tax Commission here also discredited this taxation and unanimously recommended to the Government its abolition in the case of owner-occupiers.</P>
    <P>In fact, there are two major recommendations of the Commission in respect of Schedule A.  The first is that non-business lettings should be taken as business profits and that landlords should cease to have the advantage of being taxed on notional income which does not check with their real income from their property.  It is rather extraordinary that while this tax impinges severely on the ordinary householder its secondary effect is to relieve landlords in many cases from taxation to which they would otherwise be subject.  Landlords are not taxed on the rents they receive from non-business lettings but they are taxed on notional income which is related to the valuation of the property under the Valuation Acts.</P>
    <P>The secondary recommendation was to exempt owner-occupiers of their own homes from Schedule A taxation up <Col N="722" /> to a maximum of £30 valuation and to provide a set off of that £30, in respect of houses valued at more than £30.  Notional income is not a proper subject for taxation principally for the reason that it does not create any fund out of which the tax can be paid.  It is unreal and purely fictional.  To my mind, it is extremely inequitable to tax the householder on the ownership of his home and to ignore, as subjects for taxation at the same time, the element of notional income which may derive the ownership of other durable assets.</P>
    <P>If it is right and proper to tax a householder on the ownership of his own home then, surely, it would be equitable to tax individuals on ownership of other durable assets from which it can be said they have some advantage or benefit akin to the benefit of owning a house.  If we consider it in that light, we can see how absurd the theory is.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bay is a great yachting centre. There are perhaps over 1,000 yachts in it and I understand that quite a number of those are very valuable chattels.  They are durable and long-lasting. Would the Minister consider it right to tax a sportsman on the ownership of his yacht?  Of course not; it would be preposterous.  There would be a great outcry if that were suggested. Similarly, there would be an outcry if it were suggested that the motorist who can afford a really expensive car such as a Mercedes or a Rolls Royce, should be taxed on the ownership of that car as distinct from the road tax levied for using it on the roads.  The theory would be the same.</P>
    <P>The Commission had no doubt about how archaic this theory of notional income derived from durable assets really is.  The majority of those who own their own homes are in the middle income group.  They are a dependable class who, for social reasons, it is desirable to encourage. We have a smaller proportion of home-owners than other countries and it is obviously sound national policy to encourage people to purchase their own homes.</P>
    <P>This Schedule A tax is yielding £1½ million in theory.  It is a most complicated tax.  Its effective yield in <Col N="723" /> respect of notional income on house-holders&mdash;and they are the only people who are really paying the tax&mdash;is, as disclosed in the recent White Paper, £325,000.  The people on whom it impinges most severely are a section of the community who seek little help from the State, a section who meet their own outlay, people of an independent type who usually boast that they can stand on their own feet and face their responsibilities without calling on the State for assistance.</P>
    <P>When Schedule A tax was first devised the rate was very low and the number of people who owned their own homes was very small particularly in this country.  At that time it was primarily a tax on the ownership of land.  It is no longer effective as a tax on land here and I think it is true that, as far as landowners are concerned the primary purpose of Schedule A is to convert Schedule B assessments into farm loss claims.</P>
    <P>It is an illogical tax based on false premises.  In considering it, we must have regard to the very high level of rates all home-owners are paying and particularly to the element of taxation which is included in local rates.  High rates on property are, without doubt, a form of taxation.  I think I have produced strong theoretical arguments against this tax.  I deplore the fact that the Government have completely rejected the recommendations of the Commission on this score.  The strongest argument against this tax is that the Minister will scarcely feel the loss if he abolishes it.  My grounds for saying that are that it is a most expensive tax to administer and collect.</P>
    <P>A week ago, I tabled a question to the Minister inquiring the cost of administering Schedule A and his reply was that he did not know.  He went on to point out that the overall cost of administering and collecting income tax and surtax was 3.8 per cent. of the yield.  If the Minister is labouring under the delusion that it costs only 3.8 per cent. of the yield of Schedule A to administer that tax it is time to disillusion him.  I suggest <Col N="724" /> that the cost of administering Schedule A could be as much as 50 per cent. of its effective yield and for that purpose, I am treating the yield as £325,000, as I am quite entitled to do, because £325,000 is the yield of tax levied on owner-occupiers of their own houses. The other forms of income from property taxed under Schedule A are proper subjects for taxation.  They are not, in effect, notional income or theoretical income.</P>
    <P>When Schedule A is abolished, as it must be in time, the other forms of income will come to be assessed under Schedule D.  If the Minister accepted the first recommendation and taxed non-business lettings under Schedule D, he would collect quite a lot of revenue which is not now being collected. But, as to the cost of collecting the tax, the Minister was unable to tell me what it was, which I suggest is quite preposterous.  If the Minister does not know he should have estimates made of the cost of administration and collection.</P>
    <P>Through a second question to the Minister I ascertained that there was a staff of 40 engaged in respect of Schedule A assessments for the Dublin area.  I should like to inquire from the Minister how many of that staff are engaged in the operation of establishing liaison with the Schedule D section.  How many of that staff are doing no more than advising the Schedule D section when Schedule A assessments have been made, of the amount, any changes that may have been made from year to year, and the amount paid, when, in fact, it is paid. When the Schedule D section are advised of that they duly set about cancelling the assessments.</P>
    <P>I think that is a clear example of the working of the bureaucratic machine.  It is a manifestation of bureaucracy, of the type that was pilloried by Professor Parkinson, when you consider that there are a number of clerks making assessments which are effectively cancelled by a second section of the tax administration.  It is deplorable that the Government have produced this White Paper completely rejecting the report of the Income Tax Commission.  If the Minister had said <Col N="725" /> to us that he thought the Income Tax Commission may have been half right in what they said but that for financial reasons he could not possibly accept the report at this stage, I would respect that attitude, but to suggest, in the reactionary way in which it has been done, that the Commission were effectively talking nonsense is most deplorable and reactionary.</P>
    <P>The Minister must strive to overcome the over-conservatism and fuddy-duddy approach to tax reform which is evident.  Even the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has left the door open to the possibility that this tax might be abolished in so far as it applies to owner-occupiers of their own homes.  It is paradoxical that our own Minister for Finance should outdo the British Tories in conservatism, but of course many people have come to look upon Fianna Fáil as a Tory Party, and certainly this decision is in line with that belief.  In Britain the Royal Commission has not recommended the abolition of Schedule A on owner-occupiers but notwithstanding that the Chancellor, under pressure from some backbenchers, has shown signs that he will give way ultimately on it.</P>
    <P>Our Minister, on the other hand, has a Government Commission recommending its abolition and he has completely rejected that report.  Only today, according to the evening papers, in the British House of Commons the Chancellor has been subjected to considerable pressure from his own backbenchers, Tory rebels, to abolish Schedule A on owner-occupiers.  I wish we could see some rebels appearing among the Minister's back-benchers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;what can be done in the way of tax reform when he personally puts his foot down.  Indeed, in this context one must remark on the device of establishing commissions and special committees to consider national problems as a means of stalling an awkward decision.  Only a week ago the Minister for Education in relation to the report of the &ldquo;Parity Committee&rdquo; expressed very strong views on the obligation imposed on him to accept that Committee's report, notwithstanding the fact that it was not a unanimous report.  His approach was that when a specialist committee is set up to consider a problem such as the question of parity&mdash;or the question of Schedule A&mdash;the Minister is almost compelled to accept its recommendations.  I wish the Minister for Education could persuade the Minister for Finance to accept that approach.</P>
      <P>There is a great need for a radical approach to tax reform and that radical approach has not been evident. The majority of the recommendations of the Income Tax Commission have been rejected.  We must face up to the fact that William Pitt's income tax code was never designed for the Irish economy and is completely unsuited to this country and our national needs. As far as I am concerned, I would express gratitude to the Commission for the splendid work they are doing. I hope they will not be disheartened in their future endeavours by the reception which the majority of their recommendations have received to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major need, of course, in our tax code, over the short term anyway, is relief for wage earners and salary earners.  Wage earners and salary earners are an easy mark for the income tax collectors and inspectors and because of that, they are regarded as fair game.  The amount of income tax which has been paid by wage earners and salary earners, and the increased amount they are paying over the years, is quite out of proportion to the share of the increased national income which has accrued to them. They are inequitably treated in regard to expenses, but we shall have more <Col N="727" /> to say about that at a later stage of this debate.</P>
    <P>The yield of tax paid by wage earners and salary earners in 1955/56, was 26 per cent. of the total income tax collected.  In 1958/59, it was 33 per cent. of the total income tax collected&mdash;a very significant increase&mdash; and in 1960/61, the amount of tax collected has shown a startling increase. In general, it can be said that the amount of tax paid by wage earners and salary earners is out of proportion to, and in excess of, the proportion of the national income accruing to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman mentioned the question of statistical information a few moments ago.  I want to ask the Minister to consider the desirability of establishing some type of small statistical section in the tax administration. There have been too many Parliamentary Questions put down in this House on which it has been impossible to provide simple and fundamental information.  As I said a few moments ago, if the Minister had that information before him in making a decision on Schedule A, it would enable him to say what the cost of the administration of that tax was.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the cost of the administration of Schedule A is about 50 per cent. of its effective yield, taking its effective yield as £325,000. There are 40 clerks in the Dublin general district and while Schedule A is assessed and collected by the general inspectors and collectors in other parts of the country, there is no doubt that a lot of time must be taken up in that process.  If a small statistics section were set up, it would be an advantage. There is need for more information about our tax code, and it is impossible to appraise it, unless we have the necessary information.  We would hope that the recently formed Economic Research Institute will get around to looking at many aspects of our tax code, and no doubt they will need information.</P>
    <P>A few years ago, I commented on the lack of information in the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners. I am happy to say that as a result there was a certain improvement in <Col N="728" /> that report and the yield in respect of various companies is now shown. That is only a beginning.  I would ask the Minister to consider the question of having more information made available to those interested.  It would serve a very useful purpose for himself and this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about 7,000 companies paying tax and they contribute about 35 per cent. of the total. The total in respect of this year is something like £27 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirty-five per cent. Under Schedule A, we collect £1.5 million and that is not inconsiderable. Deputy Byrne has suggested that it costs 50 per cent. to collect.  If £1.5 million is collected under Schedule A and it costs 50 per cent. to collect, there is practically no cost in collecting the rest of income tax, so it is ridiculous to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested 50 per cent. of the effective yield, £325,000&mdash; the yield from owner-occupier&mdash;in other words, the cost of collecting would be about £150,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will cost just as much to collect under Schedule A, whether it is owner or occupier.  If the Deputy is right in saying that it costs 50 per cent. to collect, the cost would be £750,000 which would mean the collection of the other income tax is very low indeed.</P>

With regard to the Deputy's suggestion that more information should be given in the Official Report, I suppose that <Col N="729" /> could be done.  If the Deputy puts down a Parliamentary Question, the answer could be in the form of a tabular statement and circulated with the Official Report.  Personally I believe the little booklet is easier to handle for tables and figures than the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of convenience, I suppose.  It is true that to a certain extent recommendations were made by the Commission that Schedule A tax should be abolished, and the Government rejected them.  I must say that when the arguments were put up for and against, I was rather convinced that the arguments against its abolition were strong.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer Deputies to paragraph 25 of the publication <i>Direct Taxation:</i></P>
      <P>It could scarcely be said that a person who has savings of, say, £2,000, invested in Government stock and lives in a rented house is less deserving of consideration than a person who has invested an equivalent sum in a residence for himself.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the person who has £2,000 in Government stock is drawing, say, £100 interest and paying income tax in full on that.  If a person buys a house, he probably gets a housing grant and other things and his income tax will be assessed on a sum of, say, £150 a year.  Taking one against the other, no great hardship is involved.  I would go further and ask Deputies to look at paragraph 30 which says:</P>
      <P>In present circumstances, therefore, the Government are not convinced that owner occupiers should be relieved of income tax where there is a liability under existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the difficulty of considering all these reports as they came along, without having any co-ordinated information, as it were.  I think that when the remaining reports come in, we will be bound to go back over them again and look at them in a co-ordinated way. I am not saying that we will change <Col N="730" /> our minds with regard to Schedule A, but there may be other circumstances to be taken into account when all the reports are submitted.</P>
    <P>It is not true, as Deputy Byrne suggested, that the majority in this country are tenants.  A very big proportion indeed under Schedule A are owner-occupiers, but all these things must be left aside for the time being.</P>
    <P>We have not yet got the full returns under P.A.Y.E.  Some employers have not yet made the final returns but as soon as we get them, we shall be able to produce some better statistics with regard to P.A.Y.E. than appear at the moment.  Indeed, I should be very glad to supply these whenever we are in a position to give them.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is anything else I want to say with regard to the questions that were raised on this section.  I would not like to allow the Deputy to get away with the point that the Governement had rejected most of the recommendations of the Commission. That is not true.  We have accepted quite a number of the recommendations. If the Deputy will read <i>Direct Taxation,</i> he will see that in some cases the decision was only postponed.  As I said already, we wanted to wait to have all the reports from that Commission which, I believe, will reach us in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>I should also like to know&mdash;I have the figure somewhere but I cannot put my finger on it at the moment&mdash; whether the Minister can tell me in relation to last year or the estimate for this year what is the percentage of tax revenue provided by direct taxation, on the one hand, and indirect taxation, on the other?

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>Has the Minister given any consideration to the percentages <Col N="732" /> of the revenue collected in direct taxation, on the one hand, and in indirect taxation on the other, in any of the Common Market countries? I am quite amazed to see certain information on that aspect of the situation, bearing in mind our current problem in relation to the Common Market.  The last information I have been able to get is something that was published in respect of the current position as known in those countries on 30th June, 1959, and I have not been able to find any up-to-date information.</P>
      <P>As far as I can find there, the percentage of direct taxation in Belgium is 47 and of indirect taxation 53; in Western Germany, it is 53 per cent. for direct taxation and 47 per cent. for indirect taxation; in France, it is 40 per cent. for direct taxation and 60 per cent. for indirect taxation; in Italy, it is 30 per cent. from direct taxation and 70 per cent. for indirect taxation; in Luxembourg, it is 59 per cent. for direct taxation; and 41 per cent. for indirect taxation; and in the Netherlands, it is 60 per cent. for direct taxation and 40 per cent. for indirect taxation.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat interesting to note that in anything I could find it was suggested that the highest country for direct taxation, that is the Netherlands. had the simplest tax code of them all. Those figures are pretty illuminating in the light of our problem here in relation to the Common Market: whether we are going to be completely free in Common Market conditions to maintain our own percentage and our own trend of pushing from direct to indirect taxation, and having regard to the necessity to approximate to the conditions in the other member countries, this is a question that poses very serious problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might, perhaps, add that not merely am I told that the Netherlands has the simplest taxation system but I believe it has the smallest number of taxes of any of the member States of the European Economic Community.  If it has the smallest number&mdash;and I admit I was considering company taxation primarily rather than individual taxation&mdash;then I am afraid that we surely are going to be in the situation of having the greatest number and there does seem to be <Col N="733" /> very considerable room for rationalisation and simplification.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that <i>Direct Taxation</i> at the time of the Budget was only representative of what I might term interim decisions and that, in fact, it represented the announcement of the deferment of decisions rather than the announcement of decisions themselves. I do not think that anybody reading through it could fairly be said to get that impression.  There are certain cases, I agree, where such and such a recommendation was not considered. I think the Minister is hardly fair to <i>Direct Taxation</i> when he suggests it is merely in many cases a record of a deferment of decisions rather than a record of decisions themselves&mdash;decisions in certain cases, I agree, contrary to the recommendations of the majority report of the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>I want to say quite clearly in that respect that while paying tribute to the immense amount of work, energy and thought that members of the Commission put into their job, I do not subscribe to all the recommendations of the majority report.  I have said on more than one occasion, in relation to the third and fourth reports, that it seems to me that the views adumbrated in the minority report of Dr. James Meenan approximate in certain respects more to my view than those of the majority report.</P>
    <P>The examination they have given to our whole code has been well worth while.  I think it is undoubtedly true that were it not for the weight of their recommendations, we would not have got the promise of one tax, one charge. We would not have got the promise of the amalgamation of all the tax-payer's various interests into one return&mdash;I think promised to come about 1964-65 when certain electronic computation machinery is available. Nor, I think, would we have got the undoubtedly desirable reform of having surtax computed from some simple return as income tax is computed. There are many other reforms which can be put into effect and which would never have been given any weight at all, if it were not for the Commission's report.  These two come <Col N="734" /> prominently to my mind.  We must thank the Commission for them.</P>
    <P>I think that to have very substantial changes in a pattern of taxation and a pattern of administration in relation to that taxation that has existed over a long number of years is something that will not be undertaken lightly by any Government without the backing of the impartial report of a commission.  That does not mean that Governments or Oppositions are bound completely to sign on the dotted line when a commission brings in a report.  The commission examines the evidence and forms a view, but we have not yet come to the stage of everybody having only one view on anything, though I know that the Fianna Fáil idea is that only their view is to be considered as appropriate on any step.  However, we have not got to that stage and we will not get to it at all.  Therefore, so far as commission reports are concerned, in the same way, they are matters to be considered in the light of the informed opinion they put forward but not necessarily merely to be implemented by signing on the dotted line.</P>
    <P>As we are on this subject of income tax, I think the Commission should advert to two wider questions before they complete their labour.  I think they should advert to whether it is not desirable to change company taxation to an entirely different basis from that of individual taxation.  As far as I know, only Great Britain and ourselves in Western Europe assess income tax on individuals and on companies in virtually the same way. Of course, there is both in Great Britain and here the difference in their profits tax, on the one hand, and our corporation profits tax on the other.  However, the pattern of income-taxation in these two islands is exactly the same for companies as for individuals and I think we are almost alone in that respect.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that in commenting on the position of taxation in other countries, as I have done and as I do, I am not purporting in any way to be an expert.  Over the past 12 months, I have been <Col N="735" /> endeavouring to pick up what I could in relation to what other people's brains think about the matter.</P>
    <P>I think the Commission ought to consider specifically our system of taxation <i>vis-á-vis</i> and compared side by side with the system of taxation in existence in each of the other six member states of EEC.  Even if no question of any Common Market were involved, I believe that in so doing, they would get certain useful suggestions of where taxes could be changed so as not to press in an unfair way on any one section of the community.</P>
    <P>All of us know that taxation has to be raised and collected to run the State.  We may differ on whether the Minister is collecting too much and on the manner in which he is collecting tax in relation to individual duties. However, all of us would equally, I think, welcome an authoritative investigation of the position as it is in other cognate countries to see whether they might not have something which we could, with advantage, borrow and, by borrowing, enable us to ease the load in any respect.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the reduction in the rate of income tax this year the Minister proposes to collect in income tax, even after that reduction, more than he collected last year by, very roughly, £750,000.  I must confess that at the time of the introduction of the Budget, I did not appreciate that the buoyancy in yield of income tax was such that those were the figures. By and large, the Minister proposes to collect, after the reduction in rate, the sum of £27 million this year.  Last year, the amount so collected was only £26¼ million.  The Minister has from time to time suggested that things were going so well that he was taking far less out of the pockets of the people. It is interesting to note that that figure of £27 million compares with a figure of £22 million&mdash;£22,045,000&mdash;for 1956/57, when the Minister himself and his minions were complaining bitterly about the amount of direct taxation being collected.  However, there is the fact that, notwithstanding the Budget concessions, we are going <Col N="736" /> to have to pay, all in all, another £750,000 in income tax this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question of direct and indirect taxation, a question on that subject was answered on 26th April last by the Taoiseach.  It gives these figures: 28.2 per cent. collected in 1960-61 from direct taxation and 71.8 per cent. from indirect taxation. That was the highest percentage attained for some years in direct taxation.  As the Deputy has just pointed out, the yield from income tax and corporation profits tax has been going up, so the percentage is higher. The reason I think the percentage of direct taxation in these European countries is higher than ours is because they are more highly industrialised and the aggregate incomes are higher; therefore income tax and profits are very high in these industrialised countries. That would account for the percentage being higher than in this country.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is true to say I ever claimed I was taking less out of the pockets of the people.  I did point out we were taking many millions more than four or five years ago but I did claim it was possible to reduce the incidence of taxation.  When it is possible to do that and at the same time get more money it is a very happy position to be in.  In regard to the Commissioners' reports, I have asked the Commissioners to give me their views on company taxation and as to whether it should not be on a different basis from that of ordinary personal taxation.  I expect to get a report on that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before section 5, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subsection (3) of section 21 of the Finance Act, 1920 is hereby amended by the substitution of &lsquo;one hundred and twenty pounds&rsquo; for &lsquo;sixty pounds&rsquo; (inserted by subsection (2) of section 2 of the Finance Act, 1955).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is quite clear.  Under the present legislation for income tax purposes the child allowance is £120 per annum.  If, however, the child has an income in its own right in excess of the £40 per annum the parents or guardians concerned lose the entire benefit of the present child allowance.  I do not know how long that figure of £40 has been effective.  I do know that in 1920 the figure was £20.  I suggest to the Minister the time is now opportune to raise that ceiling to £120 to bring it into line with the dependant's allowance of <Col N="739" /> £120 per annum which he introduced this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it not increased from £40 to £60 in 1955?  I think I increased it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is a very good case for this amendment. Where children have no incomes of their own, children's allowances are fairly generous but where the child has an income in its own right a limit has to be fixed.  What we have to decide is where shall that limit be fixed.  If a man has, let us say, £1,000 a year and three or four children he does not pay much income tax but anyway £120 of his salary is free of income income tax in respect of each child.  This means less than £40 income tax saved to him. In this case, the child has an income of, say, £60 before exemption is removed. Therefore, he has the net £60. Taking the comparison in that way, the £60 is more generous than the allowance we are giving to a man for his child.  I do not think the Deputy can make a very good case for an increase in this allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be very few cases involved.  I am basing my case on the argument that that figure of £60 was regarded as equitable a number of years ago.  As the Minister has made other adjustments, particularly in regard to the question of dependants' allowances, I considered it only equitable that this figure should also be adjusted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that if £60 was equitable in 1955, it should be about £80 now, as the equivalent in terms of present-day values.  That is a nice round figure&mdash; it means exemption in respect of 30/- <Col N="740" /> per week.  I suggest the Minister and Deputy Russell should do a deal and compromise on £80.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 6, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The proviso to subsection (2) of section 53 of the Finance Act, 1920, is hereby amended by the addition of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1) where in any accounting period a company incurs a loss in any trade or business carried on by it, that loss may be carried forward and deducted from, or set off against, the profits of that trade or business for the next accounting period or any subsequent accounting period.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to permit losses forward in a business to be set off against corporation profits tax in the same manner as they are at present allowable against income tax losses.  I put down this amendment because in his Budget speech this year the Minister changed the provision whereby corporation profits tax could be charged as an allowable expense in assessing a company's profits.  I felt it would be only a fair <i>quid pro quo</i> that losses forward should be allowable against C.P.T. as they at present are allowable against the ordinary profits of a business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did say when speaking on the Budget that I thought the Minister had made a mistake in making that alteration.  I said I thought it was a retrograde step.  I should like to reiterate that.  I think the Minister should have allowed C.P.T. to stand as an expense against company profits. <Col N="741" /> The Minister did not accept the argument at the time.  I suggest it is only equitable now to allow losses forward to be charged against C.P.T. in the same manner as they are charged against normal profits in a business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not a bit kinder to the Deputy on the last amendment, but I might say posthumously that I shall consider it.  I think, however, that this is a much more serious one.  The argument against it is that corporation profits tax is charged only after the first £2,500 are exempted.  If we were to consider a matter of this kind, the carrying of losses from one year to another, we would certainly have to charge corporation profits tax on the whole profit, whatever it might be.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Sweetman asked me about the Income Tax Commission, I should say the Commission are considering this matter activity at the moment.  It is quite possible they may make a recommendation that may mean one tax instead of two, corporation profits tax and income tax. For that reason, I think it would be better to postpone this issue for another year to see how we stand.  I may say that if we compare our position with the position in Great Britain, we find there is no exemption on the first £2,500 there.  I do not know if any other country exempts the first £2,500 as we do. That makes it more difficult to consider a matter of this kind.  The whole question will be much clearer by next year as to what the future will be in regard to company taxation. Therefore, I think we should postpone the matter until then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the point about the first £2,500, it would be unfair to expect the Exchequer to cover all the losses, if we cannot get all the profits.  Corporation profits tax would have to come from the very beginning with no exemption at all.  While I have no idea of what the Commission may recommend, it is possible that there may be a change and that there may be only one tax.  It would be better, therefore, to leave this over until we see what the recommendations of the Commission are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at the moment is simply this.  If a company loses £5,000 in one year and brings it forward to the next year and if it makes a profit of £5,000, it is set off against the losses forward for income tax purposes, but it must pay corporation profits tax on the excess over £2,500. Is that not correct?  It should be quite simple to set off the losses forward against that, too.  The mechanics of the thing should not involve any great difficulty.</P>

In these two countries apparently on the face of it&mdash;when you dig down, it may not be the same&mdash;there is this minimum provision.</P>

      <P>Question Proposed: &ldquo;That Section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for advocating in relation to this section an argument I was going to put forward.  Section 6 is an entirely new concept.  The Minister himself suggests that the Commission is considering this whole problem and he suggested that, since that was so, Deputy Russell should not press his amendment.  If the argument the Minister has just made against Deputy Russell's amendment is valid, it is equally valid against this section.  What is the sense in bringing in this section for one year if, as the Minister says, we will know much more about the whole problem next year?  Dealing with the matter in this way, when the whole question is under discussion, is obviously an attempt to jump the gun.</P>
      <P>I confess I thought the Minister's reply to Deputy Russell a reasonable one&mdash;the matter was being considered at the moment and should be left until next year.  If that is so, is this section not an attempt to get in before the Commission finalises its report and have it there as something requiring change, instead of taking the appropriate line of referring it to the Commission as a specific matter upon which the Government and the Minister wish to have adduced some evidence and recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, the section is bad in itself.  We had some discussion on the Budget and on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill in relation to this matter.  Quite clearly, the Minister did not on either occasion understand the case I was making.  I evidently failed completely to put my argument in clear terms.  Suppose, for the sake of example, 100 people agree to put £100,000 between them into a &ldquo;kitty&rdquo;<Col N="744" /> to start some new common venture.  If they start an industry here and they believe they can earn seven per cent. on their money, that means the earnings of those 100,000 people would be £7,000.  That would be taxed, first of all, at 10 per cent.  on £4,500 and on £7,000 at 6/4d.  The Minister will be just as good as I am in calculating what £7,000 at 6/4d.  would be.</P>
    <P>Suppose they used that £100,000 in buying shares in England, they could get a return of £7,000&mdash;the same seven per cent. return&mdash;and they will have to pay on that return, after the effect of double taxation relief, income tax at 6/4d.  on £7,000 but they will not have to pay the extra £4,500 C.P.T. they have to pay here under Section 6.  That reduces the argument to its simplest form.  I agree it is most unlikely there would be a case as simple as that.  When one goes out, however, from the elaborations of an ordinary business deal in that respect, one will find exactly the same differential. That means that there is, in fact, a penalty on a person investing money in an Irish enterprise as compared with investing money outside the country.</P>
    <P>That is bad fiscal policy, very bad fiscal policy, and that is the effect of Section 6.  I agree that if these people went into the export market, they would get certain other things.  If they went to Foras Tionscal and the West, they might get certain grants. But these alleviations are beside the point where this section is concerned. This section imposes a penalty on people who are willing to invest money in the country to produce goods for the home market and give employment. Anybody who does that will have to pay more in taxation than will his brother who invests in British securities.  That is a wrong approach. No matter how one takes the section, that is the inevitable result.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to befog the issue, but his argument was not relevant at all.  I agree that by virtue of the change in relation to subsection (1) of Section 1, even with Section 6, unless it is a very big company, a person may be paying less than he paid last year, but he will still not pay <Col N="745" /> less in taxation than he would if he invested the money outside the country at the same rate of interest.  That is bad policy.  I think the Minister did not advert to that aspect of the situation when he introduced this change in the Budget.  Now that it has been emphatically brought to his notice, he should do something to remedy the position.  He can consult any firm of accountants in Dublin and they will tell him exactly what I have been telling him.  I know he will be told by the Revenue Commissioners and his own officials: &ldquo;On that net issue, yes, but that does not arise&rdquo;.  But it does arise. It arises directly on Section 6 that, in the very rough and ready simple case that I gave, the company concerned, out of an income of £7,000 would pay £450 more in taxation than if the same people, instead of forming a company to promote an Irish industry, decided to invest their money at 7 per cent on the other side, without coming into a company at all.</P>
    <P>I agree that in present circumstances you want to try to get all Irish manufacturing companies into the export market as far as possible.  Certainly we do, but, at the same time we do not want to use a means of doing that which provides an incentive that will operate against anyone starting an industry here in circumstances such as I have outlined.  That is the last thing anyone of us wants to do and I am sure it is the last thing the Minister wants to do but it is the effect of his section.  If he were a wise man and were anxious, as I think he is genuinely anxious, to promote Irish industry rather than give a tax incentive to foreign investment, he would amend this section very substantially indeed before the Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I want to be quite clear that I am not trying to make the case that the Minister with his eyes open went out to provide an incentive to people to invest money outside the country.  I do not think he did.  It is a result of his section that he did not visualise at the time because he was comparing what an Irish company would have to pay this year with what it had to <Col N="746" /> pay last year.  That is not the effect. What one must consider are two new aspects, both in this year.  Undoubtedly, if people want to come together and put down a certain amount of money for the purpose of starting an Irish industry for the home market, because of the employment it gives we should ensure that they get encouragement. The effect of this section is that the same people, by neglecting to form a company here and investing at the same rate as they anticipated, across the water, will pay 10 per cent. less in tax.  I do not think anyone would desire that position.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy is stating a fair case at all. He takes an Irish company that has a profit of £7,000 and he assumes that the ten people who have £10,000 each will just sell that company and invest their money in England at seven per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing the Deputy has £10,000 and that I have £10,000 and I invest my £10,000 here at seven per cent. and the Deputy invests his £10,000 in England at seven per cent. we will see how we will get on.  Here we are talking about a company and, therefore, we must take a company in England.  That is the only fair comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely you must take a company in England and compare it with a company in Ireland.  It is the only fair comparison.  If you take that, you will find the taxation on the company in England is 53¾ and here it is 41? per cent.  There is a vast difference between the amount that is left after taxation in England and the <Col N="747" /> amount that is left here.  That is the only fair comparison.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the example the Deputy takes could equally be quoted against any Minister for Finance in the past ten years, that if instead of putting money into an Irish company, a person invested it at seven per cent., of course he would do better.</P>

      <P>What difference does this section make as far as that goes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes very little difference.  It makes the difference of income tax of £2,500 on £100,000 and that is very little difference when you add it all up.  No, I am wrong.  It makes a difference of income tax on 10 per cent. of £2,500.  That is the difference it makes.  That is a very small difference in this whole calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  Anyway, my point is that we should compare one company with another, an English company with an Irish company.  If you do that, you will find that the taxation taken in England is very much higher on the company than it is here.  In addition to that, of course, you have all the other benefits here of relief on exports and relief under Section 7 of the Act of 1932, and so on.  In every way the person who puts his money into an Irish company, provided, of course, the company here is equally competent with the company in England, is very much better off on his investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is bark ing up the wrong tree, if I may say so. We will assume for the purpose of this argument, but no further not otherwise, that the Minister and I have each <Col N="748" /> £10,000 to invest.  I do not know about the Minister but I should not like to say that I had.  The Minister's case is based entirely on whether there is an equal likelihood of our forming a company here for the purpose of developing an Irish industry and of our forming a company in England for the purpose of developing an industry there.  Of course, that is nonsense.  The Minister knows perfectly well from the pattern of investment that there are two possibilities.  One possibility is that the money will be used here for the formation of a company for a new industry.  The other is that it will not, that the Minister and I will not form a company if we are going to invest it in England, but we will invest it individually in England.  Because of the very proper provisions of the Double Taxation Agreement, we will get back the tax suffered at their rates and will only have to pay at our standard rate here and will not in that case have to pay Corporation Profits Tax.</P>
      <P>The whole trend of investment is precisely against the case that the Minister makes.  If Irish <i>enterpreneurs</i> were just as prone to form companies in England as they are to form companies in Ireland, for the development of industry in either place, then the Minister might argue that he was comparing like with like but the Minister knows very well that the person who has money to invest here considers whether he will put it into an industry to develop something here or whether he will invest it, not as a company, but as an individual, across the water and, if he invests it as an individual across the water, he will pay less tax and that means that this section is providing an incentive to investment outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister his reasons for introducing this section.  If my recollection is correct, during the Budget debate he said he thought he was doing pretty well for companies by reducing the standard rate of income tax.  That is quite strong as an argument but he is taking back a substantial part of that reduction by this new device of not permitting corporation profits tax to be a chargeable expenses against profits.  If <Col N="749" /> my calculation is correct he is taking back approximately 50 per cent. of the reduction he is giving in income tax.</P>
      <P>I think he has said on more than one occasion that it was his endeavour to reduce as much as possible, or to continue to reduce, costs, particularly of industries.  I suggest this is a step in the opposite direction.  I should like to appeal to the Minister to delete that section altogether and allow the industries concerned to enjoy a genuine reduction of eight pence in the pound in the standard rate of income tax.  He is not doing that here; he is giving on one hand and taking half of it back on the other.  As I said&mdash;and I think the Minister agreed with me&mdash;it is absolutely necessary that firms here, particularly with this emerging and competitive free trade area, should be encouraged to plough back as much as possible of their profits into plant and equipment.  The best way to encourage that is to reduce taxation.  The Minister is doing the very opposite.  This may not amount to a very big sum but it amounts to a figure which might, perhaps, provide a new piece of machinery or cover some reconstruction of the business.  Would the Minister reconsider it from that point of view which I think is a valid one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out to Deputy Russell that, while I have not got the figure at the moment, he must realise that the great majority of companies, about 65 per cent. or more, get the full benefit of this income tax provision&mdash;in other words, all companies with profits to £2,500.  The number is rather small but it is the most important companies, I admit, that do not get the full benefit of the reduction in income tax.  On the other hand, no company is worse off than they were last year, taking corporation profits tax and income tax combined, except to a nominal amount in the case of companies with profits of over £52,000.  I do not think companies have anything to complain of.  No doubt they would welcome it if we could do more for them but they really have nothing to complain of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>About 130 companies out of 7,000 are worse off but only to an insignificant extent.  I think the most they can lose is £300 a year and that is on a £250,000 profit.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 3:</P>
      <P>Before section 7, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In connection with any assessment for liability for income tax, where a person proves that he has incurred expenditure on the provision of necessary medical services or treatment in respect of illness or infirmity of himself or any of his dependants and that he was unable to insure himself against the said expenses, there shall be deducted from the income to be assessed the expenses so incurred.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for this amendment I am sure is apparent to many people and I feel that most members of the House would be in sympathy with it.  I <Col N="751" /> trust the Minister will be able to accept it and that he will not approach this with the mind of the Revenue Commissioners alone.</P>
    <P>We know only too well that the cost of a long illness in these days can be quite heavy.  Indeed, in the average family, recurring illnesses to which we are all subject can be quite a heavy burden spread over the year if there is only one breadwinner in the house.  In this day and age when anti-biotics and expensive drugs assist in bringing about quick cures, the cost to the individual who may have to meet the expense is almost as great as a long illness might have been in the past.  But there are cases which arise from time to time of serious hardship where people are unable to pay the chemist's bill, unable to meet the heavy cost of drugs which in some cases, as we know only too well, may be as much as £1 or £2 per day.</P>
    <P>It is for the purpose of coming to the assistance of people who incur necessary medical expenses of that kind that this amendment has been put down.  I believe it is administratively possible to operate it and I would strongly urge the Minister to give it sympathetic consideration and not to allow the dull mind of the tax collector to decide what in justice I believe is what ordinary human beings are entitled to.</P>
    <P>I have said elsewhere that I regard medical expenses, the cost of curing human beings, as quite similar to the cost of running a business.  The tax code allows a person operating a business to charge the expenses of that business against profits.  If the human being tires, he or she can no longer earn any more but if the person can be kept alive, earning capacity is maintained so that I believe it is fair, even from the purely financial point of view, to say that this is a necessary expense which the person incurs in order to maintain his earning capacity, an expense he incurs because of keeping necessity to keep going and by keeping going he continues to earn.</P>
    <P>The tax code recognises the right of certain classes of people to set off <Col N="752" /> losses in one year against profits in another and allowance is also given to make provision for the replacement and repair of capital.  Our tax code also provides for exhaustion of equipment. Where we err, and err seriously, is that we have no provision whatever for allowances for the replacement or repair of the human being.  We make no provision to come to the assistance of human beings suffering from exhaustion.</P>
    <P>All these are perhaps rather inhuman references to human beings' sufferings but I have made them in order to indicate that what is proposed in this amendment is something that is already considered acceptable and quite orthodox in relation to material things.</P>
    <P>I believe it is justifiable to defend this amendment on the ground which has been accepted as being proper in relation to our tax laws for many years past.  It did occur to us that were we simply to put down an amendment asking for allowances for necessary medical expenses and doing nothing more, it might well have the effect of discouraging people from insuring against illness.  We in Fine Gael have every reason to be proud of the success of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  We are glad to see that provision was made at that time to allow insurance contributions to be deductible before assessment of income for tax purposes.  One effect of that has been, in some cases at any rate, to encourage people to subscribe to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  We did not want to put down any amendment which would discourage people who should insure against ill-health from so doing.  There are many medical expenses which are not provided for under the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme.  One which falls very heavily upon fathers of middle-class families, who usually are outside the scope of the national health services, is that of maternity expenses.</P>
    <P>It seems unfair that where a man may have maternity expenses of £50 or £60, he will have to pay on top of that sum about £25 in tax, which would represent the amount he would have to earn to pay that necessary <Col N="753" /> expense.  That is something which is not provided for in the code.  There are other people outside the scope of the insurance because of age or some other incapacity.  Certainly we hope that in time there will be an extension of the benefits given by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  I believe they will come in time, but there are people outside the scope of the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme and who are not in an insurance scheme at the moment and who, I believe, should receive some consideration.  We have specifically phrased the amendment so as to provide that allowances will not be given to people who could have insured but failed to do so.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there might be cases of extreme hardship, of people who would find it impossible to pay £12 or £15 a year to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, or who, even to a greater extent, would find it difficult to meet ordinary medical expenses, but we feel that it would be unfair and undesirable to discourage the excellent work done by the Board.  Our amendment as it stands will encourage people even more than in the past to make provision for ill-health by insuring themselves against such contingencies as are insurable at the moment.  There are other things outside the Voluntary Health Scheme which we believe should be covered. The cost of medical treatment outside hospitals can be extremely great and on that account and as that is not something for which there is any normal health insurance available, we believe that if it can be proved that a person has incurred necessary medical expenses, then an allowance should be given in respect of such expenses.</P>
    <P>After all, there are some sections of the community who receive free medical benefit and it is not taken into consideration at all in assessing their income.  Of course, most of these people are outside the income tax bracket, but within the bracket there are many people who incur necessary medical expenses and they should receive some assistance in meeting them.  I know that the Revenue Commissioners must be well aware of <Col N="754" /> people who find it difficult to meet their income tax bills because they have had heavy medical expenses.  I appreciate that in such cases the Commissioners have not been unsympathetic and allowed time for payment, but sometimes it takes a person a considerable length of time to pull up again after heavy medical expenses have had to be met.  On that account, we believe that this concession should be considered.</P>
    <P>I understand that in some countries there is a flat allowance for medical expenses, something like £50 or thereabouts, per taxpayer.  I do not think that is the best way of doing it.  Most of us do not expend £50 per year on medical expenses.  I believe the best system is one in which a scheme would be worked out whereby necessary medical expenses could be proved and once proved, the allowance would be made in respect of the income of the people in question.  I pointed out that very few people expend money on medical attention unnecessarily.  There are, of course, the people who imagine they are ill, or the people who go to a psychiatrist for the thrill or excitement it gives them, but they are few and far between.  I feel it would be possible to prevent an abuse of the scheme suggested in our amendment. Therefore, I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment for a slightly different reason from that given by Deputy Ryan.  I feel that the inception of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, and the tax relief that was given in respect of premiums to those who insure with that Board, have been one of the greatest boons to the class of people one may roughly describe as income tax payers.  The success that has attended the efforts of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board is a matter for congratulation by all of us. The manner in which it enables people to insure against the unforeseen expense of illness, which we all know very often completely knocks out families for a generation, is something that is highly desirable as a social object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned, and I think the <Col N="755" /> Deputies named here rightly mean to cover the case perhaps more so than any other, of a person who proves he has incurred expense and was unable to insure himself.  The case I want to put to the Minister is the case of a person whose health is not too good and because his health is not good, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board cannot accept him.  It seems to be hard on that man that he should be in the position of not being able to cover himself in the manner the State advocates, by reason of the incentive it gives by the deduction of premiums from income, and of being more likely to incur heavy medical expenses for which he cannot get any income tax relief.  So far as I am concerned, I regard this amendment as covering virtually entirely the case of the man who applies for insurance of that sort and who, through no fault of his own, because of his state of health, is rejected.</P>
    <P>Once we accept that principle, we can improve the amendment slightly from the administrative point of view by providing that the expenditure incurred shall be expenditure in excess of a minimum sum.  It would creat administrative problems far beyond the advantage gained if the section were so phrased that if one had medical expenses, one would be entitled to get a refund of that sum.  We could say that where a person incurred medical expenses in excess of a certain sum in any tax year, and the proofs were satisfactory to the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;and the proofs in this connotation would obviously have to be in accordance with the ordinary tenets of the income tax law much though we may dislike them&mdash;that those expenses shall be deducted from his income tax assessment.</P>
    <P>I think the situation in Australia is that there is provision that where medical expenses are incurred in any year in excess of any certain sum, the excess is an allowable deduction from the individual's assessment for income tax purposes.  It is something on that line that I should like to urge on the Minister to include in this Finance Bill, and I would urge that that is really the basis on which the amendment should be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> While one tries on this side of the House, in so far as one can, to draft amendments as precisely as possible, the Minister will, I am sure, accept without question that it is never possible for the Opposition to draft amendments in the same precise and exact terms as it is for the Minister, with all the resources of the Parliamentary draftsman as well as the Revenue Commissioner's draftsman, behind him.</P>
    <P>During the past couple of years, several hard cases have been brought to my notice of people who applied, <i>bona fide</i>, to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board for membership and the Board had to reject them because of the existing state of their health. Unless something like this is done for them, they will be under a dual disability: the disability that their health is not good and that they are more likely to incur medical expenses, on the one hand, and on the other, that they are not getting the same tax remission as their healthy neighbours and colleagues can get by joining a voluntary scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment. Although the income tax officials and the Revenue Commissioners may look upon this as an innovation in the income tax code, I fully agree with what Deputy Ryan has said, that it is long overdue.  We must acknowledge the fact that some few years ago, when people underwent treatment for illness, the cost was relatively small compared with what it is today.  It is a well-known fact that if a family incurs expenses by reason of any type of illness, even over a short period, when the bill comes, the amount is found to be considerable. The Minister is a medical man and he must be fully cognisant of the fact that there is considerable hardship in many of these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seems to me to be reasonably well drafted.  It provides that anyone who, through no fault of his own, has no voluntary insurance, or any form of insurance, may get a remission for income tax purposes. Voluntary insurance is intended to <Col N="757" /> protect against illnesses but there are one or two illnesses of which voluntary insurance companies fight shy. One is the case of a man who has suffered from any major illness, and perhaps the most prevalent in the world today, in the rush and bustle of modern life, is coronary thrombosis. The man who has that disease cannot insure himself in any way against the expenses he may have to meet.  In fact, that disease rules him out straight away.</P>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Ryan was an excellent one, that from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners who want to get people back on the market as quickly as possible, insurance for such people is a good thing.  I know of nothing that will keep a person suffering from coronary thrombosis ill for much longer, and make him less likely to recover, than the fact that he had to face expenditure which he was unable to meet. That would give him an anxiety neurosis and keep him sick longer.  I should like the Minister to bear that in mind when he is taking an unbiassed look, as I am sure he will, at this excellent amendment.</P>
    <P>No insurance company will touch a man who suffers from mental disturbance in any shape or form.  A man who has had a mental disability will get no insurance in respect of that disability.  He will get no benefit even from the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  Those are two specific and special cases which will have to be considered in dealing with an amendment such as this.</P>
    <P>There are many other cases of hardship as well, but it is a well-known fact that mental illness is perhaps the disease which most frequently takes from people a regular ability to work. There are cases in the middle income group, and not necessarily in the middle income group but in the higher income group as well as the white collar and salaried classes and in the farming and business community as well, of a family with a mentally defective child or a child who is mentally below par.  The parents find themselves in the position for a great <Col N="758" /> number of years that they have to pay a certain sum to some institution to maintain the child.  It is not a question of having to pay for one or two years; it may carry on for 20 years.</P>
    <P>Let us take a man with an income of £1,000 a year.  That may seem a lot of money to many people.  It is what we Deputies get, and everyone knows how well off we are!  Supposing he has three or four children and he has a recurring charge to pay to some institution or home for mentally defective children in respect of one child who is unable to look after itself.  There is no real hope of recovery; it is a lifetime charge.  I know of one man who told me the other day he is paying £170 a year with no prospect of any reduction because it is fixed at rock bottom at the moment.  He cannot get 1/- relief for the sum he must pay.  Even if his income is £1,100 or £1,200, he has to maintain himself and so on and, in addition, has to pay income tax.</P>
    <P>I think this is an excellent amendment. It is something that is long overdue in our income tax code.  I would ask the Minister to think upon the arguments advanced so far.  At least if he does not accept the amendment in its entirely, he ought to give it his most full and sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise very much with the motives of those who put forward this amendment and I would tend rather to support Deputy Sweetman in his subsequent comments.  I feel that the amendment, as drafted, is one which would almost invite tax evasion of all sorts.  There are very many cases deserving of consideration but it is an extraordinarily difficult job to deal with them by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment, as it stands, refers to incurring &ldquo;expenditure on the provision of necessary medical services or treatment.&rdquo;  Even those quite simple words can lead to quite a lot of twisting and, shall we say, varying interpretations. What sort of medical treatment is absolutely necessary?  What sort of medical treatment is merely necessary or what sort of treatment is desirable? I can see all sorts of ways of tax evasion there.  Even when we come to consider the phrase &ldquo;that he was unable <Col N="759" /> to insure himself against the said expenses,&rdquo; we find that there are a number of reasons why a person might be unable to insure himself.</P>
    <P>Some of those reasons have already been given: either he is already over the age limit for voluntary health insurance or at the time of his application, his health is not sufficiently good to make him an insurable risk.  But there are also cases where people may be unable to insure themselves because they may have misconducted themselves in some way, such as by making a false declaration on the application for insurance which would disqualify them in the eyes of the insurance company. I think we would have to amend the amendment very considerably in order to tie up these loose points.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, however, that there are a fairly considerable number of people suffering grave hardship through no fault of their own.  This hardship is not only something which has to be suffered in itself but it is something, as Deputy Esmonde said, which will give rise to increasing ill health as time goes on.  I should hope that the Minister would consider the thought behind the amendment itself.  If he could give any indication that, with the expert advice available to him, he could hold out any hope of producing a more watertight amendment of his own on Report Stage, I am sure that the Deputies who put forward this amendment would be only too glad to withdraw it at this stage.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will deal with the merits of the case rather than the merits of the actual amendment.  I could not support the amendment as it is but I feel there is a very genuine case to be made for it.  If the Minister could see his way to give any indication that he would seriously and sympathetically consider it, I personally would be glad and would appreciate it tremendously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Booth's last point, we appreciate that the wording of the amendment could be very much improved.  If <Col N="760" /> the Minister can give any form of approval to the principle enshrined in the amendment and if he would consider between now and Report Stage the manner in which it might be improved to remove some of the doubtful points referred to by Deputy Booth, we should be happy to accept that undertaking from the Minister.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Booth's points as to what is necessary medical treatment, the obvious answer is that whatever treatment is prescribed by a duly qualified medical practitioner is, in fact, necessary.</P>
      <P>It is desirable to emphasise that no new principle is involved in this amendment as since 1955, provision was made permitting the premiums paid to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to be charged against taxed profits.  The precedent was created there.  At this stage, we are primarily anxious to cater for those cases not covered by existing legislation and particularly those people who may be rejected by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board as bad insurance risks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are five amendments dealing with expenses that might be allowed to an income tax payer.  I must say that I have more sympathy with the movers of this one than I have with any of the others.  I have no great sympathy for any of the others at all.  It is a case that should be sympathetically considered, I feel, but how it is to be considered is another matter.  I do not know whether it is a case which could be considered under the income tax code at all.  As I have said already, the Income Tax Commission are, I believe, going to report on expenses generally to be allowed to the income tax payer but whether they cover medical expenses or not, I do not know. Possibly they will but that would not, I think, cover the whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my experience, anyway, the worst case I came across was that of a man who was earning about £8 a week for himself and his wife.  His wife had to get insulin treatment which I was told would cost about <Col N="761" /> 10/- a day.  She had to pay for that herself until the case was brought to the notice of the county manager. After some consideration, he allowed the expenses to be paid in that case but from what I heard about that case, if that man had been earning £10 a week, he would not have been allowed the expenses.</P>
    <P>I do not think a remission of income tax would go anywhere to meet that man's problem.  I am inclined, therefore, to think that while the case I am talking about deserves very sympathetic consideration, it is really more a case for the Health Act because for one thing you can be very much more generous from the point of view of benefit under the Health Act.  It is, I think, also much more satisfactory compared with what you can do out of income tax.  It will, of course, be more costly no doubt, because bigger benefits will have to be given under the Health Act but I believe&mdash;it may be wrong; I do not know&mdash;it would be a more just way of doing it.  I think it would be a more just way of doing it.</P>
    <P>What crossed my mind also only this evening&mdash;I have not considered it in any way&mdash;is whether it would be possible to get the Voluntary Health Insurance organisation to take these cases on a certain arrangement with the Minister for Health and look after them somehow or other.  There are various ways in which it could be done.</P>
    <P>I am not at all sure that a remission of income tax is the best way of doing it.  Certainly, it would not be as satisfactory as having it done through some health organisation.  The benefit would not be as good in many cases as it would be under a health organisation of some sort.  Therefore, my general approach would be that we should consider it.</P>
    <P>If it is to be done through income tax, we should have to wait for a report from the Income Tax Commission to see what recommendation they are making generally on expenses to be allowed to the payer of income tax. Then, having received that report, we would have to see what the Government <Col N="762" /> might decide to do in respect of the report.</P>
    <P>I might add that where these expenses are allowed in America&mdash;I do not know about elsewhere&mdash;the Income Tax Commissioners have access to records of doctors in hospitals, and so on, to verify the expenses.  I think there would be great resistance here to giving the Revenue Commissioners the same powers of examining doctors' books, hospital records, and so on, as they have in America.  I am afraid it would be difficult to administer that relief without some safeguard to check on the figures put in by the payer of income tax.</P>
    <P>There is great sympathy for the amendment on all sides of the House. I have sympathy with the case, too. However, I cannot agree that we should accept this amendment for this year at any rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Minister's first objection is this.  He sees two men drowning.  He says: &ldquo;I cannot save X, therefore I will not save Y&rdquo; and both men drown.  I have never known of any person to be condemned who saved one drowning man and was unable to save the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would rather save the two, though.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am completely with the Minister but if today there are two men drowning, they may be dead before the Minister, with all this passing of the buck, gets around to giving assistance to the unfortunate people. The Minister is at least sympathetic to us.  That is a considerable improvement. We want to harness that sympathy for the sake, at least, of some of the community and certainly not to do so in such a way as to jeopardise the other people in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see an objection to fixing a floor for medical expenses.  Supposing you take it at £25 or £50.  If our amendment were to insert after the words &ldquo;expenditure in excess of £25 or £50 in any taxable period&rdquo;, what would the effect be?  Take a man whose income tax bill is only £25 per annum. If his medical expenses are £25 he <Col N="763" /> would find such a bill a considerable burden.  His income would be small enough and he would find it extremely hard to pay £25 to the Revenue Commissioners and £25 to the doctor.  That is taking a very low figure.  It could be £50 income tax and £50 to the doctor or £25 income tax and £50 to the doctor, and so on.</P>
    <P>If you fix the floor, you will be grossly unfair and you will not come to the assistance of the man who needs it most.  If a man has an income tax bill of £500 or £1,000 and his medical expenses bill is only £25 or £50, it is only a drop in the ocean of his outgoings to have to meet medical expenses of that kind.  I do not believe it is beyond the resources of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to devise some scheme which will be of assistance to people who deserve to receive it.</P>
    <P>I believe that our income tax code is based upon a taxation on that portion of a man's income in the expenditure of which he has a choice. That is a fundamental approach to income tax, or it ought to be.  If we extend that, we ought to have greater individual allowances, marriage allowances and children's allowances than we have at present.  In any event, that is the justification for these allowances.  You allow a man a personal allowance in respect of necessary expenditure over which he has no control but you tax that portion of his income where he has a choice of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Who has a choice where medical expenses are concerned, except in choosing some secondary treatment or trying to cure an illness with a cheap bottle of medicine, instead of getting decent treatment and paying for it?  In most cases, it will be necessary medical treatment.  There will be no choice.  If his income is nominally £500 and his medical expenses are £50 or £100, the income over which he has control is only £450 or £400.  That is the justification for this amendment.  He never gets into his hands this 100 per cent of his income because portion of it is a necessary expense which may as well be paid direct by the State or the <Col N="764" /> employer to the doctor.  It is something over which the man has no choice or control; it is something ordained by destiny and beyond the control of the unfortunate individual.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Esmonde said, where you have a case of illness, the cure of the illness will be prolonged because of financial worry.  In fact such worry may even do injury.  That is particularly so where the breadwinner is ill.  It is even more so where the breadwinner has a large number of dependants and where, as in the case cited by Deputy Sweetman, such people are unable to insure themselves because their medical condition necessitates heavy expenditure.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is good enough to say: &ldquo;If we cannot help all mankind, we will help none.&rdquo;  If the same theory were to apply in relation to charity, it would never have been indicated by the Almighty as the greatest of all virtues.  We must help and it is up to the Minister to help some people in the community. If, by doing so, he denies help to others which it is not within his power at the moment to give, I still think he ought to do it.  The cost to the Exchequer would be purely nominal but it would assist in the hardship cases.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is sympathetic, his sympathy is of little value.  On account of the principle enshrined in the amendment, we feel we cannot accept the Minister's sympathy.  We do not think it is sufficient.  As Deputy Sweetman said, we appreciate that we are not the Revenue Commissioners. Thanks be to God for that. Nobody on this side of the House has the responsibility of Government for the time being.  We have not at our disposal the genii of the tax offices who might be able to frame an amendment to cover every contingency and not allow any escape route such as Deputy Booth has in mind. On that account, we feel the principle is one which we must defend and that the Minister should have gone further than he did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>While I <Col N="765" /> also am grateful for the Minister's sympathy, I do not feel it is getting us very far in this amendment.  The Minister offered his sympathy and we thank him for it.  Next, he said it was a matter that would probably be discussed and that we must await the outcome of the deliberations of the Income Tax Commission now sitting.  I do not know a great deal about the working of the Income Tax Commission or in what direction their minds move but it is more likely they will give primary consideration to the existing income tax code.  I support this amendment because it is an innovation and a necessary innovation.  Since this Commission has been sitting for a considerable period and no suggestion on these direct lines has been made to them before, it is extremely unlikely they will give it their consideration.  It is poor consolation for the Minister to reply to us on those lines.</P>
      <P>The third point he dealt with was in connection with payment for insulin.  It seems to me that has no particular relevance to this discussion. That is a question purely between the county manager and the individual concerned.  It is a minor consideration in the administration of the Health Act.  The Minister further stated that it might be possible to reach some agreement between the Department of Health and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to ensure that cases that were uninsurable will be insured by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Surely that is nonsense.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Board is a non-profit-making company whose function is to give the best service they can to those who entrust the financial side of their health to them. They have certain standards and rules and if they are to accept cases such as that, they must be backed by the Department of Health.  The Minister has stated, in effect: &ldquo;Although we are sorry for these people, there is nothing we can do about it.  We will pass the buck back, first of all, to the Commission and secondly, to the Department of Health.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give the Minister <Col N="766" /> this information: I am a member of an advisory board and one of the things we recommended to the Minister for Health was that he might give consideration to this problem. We did not go to the extreme to which the Minister went in suggesting they should take uninsurable cases but that they might in some way associate the State medical health service with a Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme so that there would be a wider scope for the class for whom we are speaking this evening. The answer we got back was that it was unconstitutional for us to recommend that.  Apart from that, the Minister for Health knows the position.  Has he made any move in that direction?  Is there anything in the mind of the Government, of which the Minister is the financial controller and one of the principal Ministers, in regard to such a scheme?  If the Minister even told us that I would be more satisfied.</P>
    <P>I personally regret the Minister's reply just now.  We always welcome sympathy; every Deputy likes to feel he has the sympathy of the Fianna Fáil Government if he is sitting on these benches.  However, that is not enough, nor is it enough for the people on whose behalf Deputy Ryan, Deputy Byrne and Deputy Cosgrave have put down this amendment.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister in all seriousness to give consideration to it.  After all, Deputy Booth in the benches opposite gave it his support.  Deputy Booth is a Deputy for whom I have respect.  He is broadminded and likes to say things perfectly frankly as he sees them.  He is not particularly tied one way or the other and likes to express his opinion. He said this is a matter for sympathetic consideration.  He practically indicated to the Minister that it would be a good thing to bring in a proposal on Report Stage.  We have had no indication in that respect so far, and I would ask the Minister to go further and give us an indication, not only of his sympathy but of his intention to do something on this important question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care about the sarcastic remarks of the Deputies <Col N="767" /> opposite in regard to my sympathy.  I have sympathy for these people but Deputy Esmonde should have understood what I meant.  I did not intend that the voluntary health organisation should do this alone; I meant that if the Minister for Health had a scheme for treating these people he could ask this organisation to work the scheme for him at his expense, not at their expense.  As I said, that occurred to me as I was sitting here this evening.  There may be nothing whatever in it and it may be found to be a very silly idea when it is examined.  I had in mind very much the same case as Deputy Ryan mentioned, that of the man with £10 a week having to spend £3 10s. Od. on insulin.  The income tax relief is not much good to him.  If he is paying £25, he gets only £8 a year in income tax relief.  Of course the important thing is that we should do more for him and not so much for the man who is earning £3,000 or £4,000 a year.  More can <Col N="768" /> be done for the deserving case through the Health Act or through some scheme of that kind than can be done through income tax relief.  I am very doubtful if it is a provision that should be put in the income tax code at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with open-cast mining.  I do not know whether the Minister has received any representations in relation to the operation of these provisions.  I am not quite clear whether the case I want to make is entirely relevant under this section.  It is, I think, relevant to some extent.  When a company receives a tax remission the State, by giving such a remission, is under obligation to ensure that a company behaves reasonably.  I have received some complaints that certain mining works have been carried out without adequate regard to the compensatory provisions in mining legislation. Companies have gone in under the Mining Acts on certain lands.  The question of compensation has been submitted to arbitration.  Before that arbitration has taken place and before compensation has been fixed the companies have folded up and gone away.</P>
      <P>When we give our blessing by way of remission, we are under obligation to make sure that mining operations are carried out with due regard to the rights of individuals.  While I do not think the Minister can do anything in that regard under this section, I would urge on him that he should bring this matter to the notice of his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The law definitely requires to be tightened up and, if the Minister intends to continue giving tax concessions to those who engage in mining operations, he must ensure that adequate arrangements are made for compensating those people whose interests are damaged.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Before section 12, but in Part 1, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In connection with any assessment for liability for income tax, where a person proves that he has incurred expenditure by way of fares on public transport in travelling between his normal residence and the place where the income is earned, he shall, subject to a maximum of fifty-two pounds in any one year, be allowed such expenditure as an expense wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by him in earning such income.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is one of the fundamental principles of our income tax code that the taxpayer must not in any circumstances whatsoever be allowed to charge against his income for assessment purposes the expenses of travelling to his working place.  I do not know why that is a fundamental principle, but it is.  It is based in respect of salary and wage earners on Rule 9 of the Rules to Schedule E, a rule which goes back to the Income Tax Act of 1853.  It may go back even earlier than that.  I have traced it back to 1853.  In so far as it applies to business people, it relates to the Schedule D Rules.  I do not know how old that is but it is quite old.</P>
      <P>The question of revising these century-old rules has not previously arisen because it is not very important. Pre-war, not very many people were paying income tax.  Indeed, originally, after the rule had been laid down in 1853, it was held that income tax was a temporary measure.  For that reason, I believe the question of revision was not given very much attention at that early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> Now there are no less than 180,000 people in this country assessed to tax as wage and salary earners, not to speak of business people and others, property owners and such like.  The vast majority of our taxpayers are paying tax under Schedule E as wage and salary earners.  The Minister has already given us an advance indication that he was more favourably disposed to amendment No. 3 than to any of our other amendments.  I do not know why that is so.  I do not know why this question of not allowing expenses of travelling to and from one's place of work should be regarded as being such a cardinal principle.  I am not aware of any of the existing allowances, earned income relief or personal allowances, which purport to provide relief for the expenses of travelling to and from one's place of work.</P>
    <P>The tax code does not anywhere define taxable income but it is generally regarded as the surplus of the receipts from any classified source over the cost of obtaining the income. That is a reasonable definition of taxable income.  Nobody can gainsay the fact that in order to earn your income at your place of work you have to travel to your workplace.  That is axiomatic.  Possibly, 100 years ago one did not have to travel very far to get to work.  Even up to 40 years ago, in this city of Dublin, the greater part of the city was confined within the canals and probably very few people had to travel more than half a mile or so to get to their work place.  Travelling expenses, particularly for wage and salary earners, are now a most significant and heavy item in their budget.</P>
    <P>It is quite illusory to argue, as the Minister might argue, that the taxpayer has freedom of choice in deciding where he is to live.  In respect of many working people in Dublin, those who are now being taxed under P.A.Y.E. in a big way, they are Corporation tenants and have to go to live wherever they are sent.  The average busfare from schemes such as Ballyfermot, Coolock, Crumlin and such places is 8d. or 9d.  Taking the double journey to and from work, ignoring the question of lunch-time, <Col N="775" /> the busfare would be 1/6d. to 2/- a day per worker.  An expenditure of 10/- 12/- or 15/- a week is a moderate estimate of the busfares paid by working people.  It is an expense beyond the control of the worker who has not freedom of choice in deciding where he will live.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are familiar with the housing problem in Dublin know only too well that those who are eligible for housing by Dublin Corporation are very reluctant to go to the housing schemes on the outskirts of the city.  People will endure considerable hardship in order to retain their housing accommodation in the central city area.  It is interesting to know, for example, that many workers in the dock area live in Ballyfermot.  The fare from Ballyfermot to the centre of the city is 9d. and from the centre of the city to the North Wall is 3d.  In the Dublin vernacular, Ballyfermot is known as &ldquo;Bally-Far-Out&rdquo;.  That may be an indication to the Minister of the extent to which Dublin workers are affected by transport costs.</P>
    <P>Dublin busfares are very high.  I think busfares are high in Cork also. Transport expenses are a burden, not only on the worker but on his wife and children.  Children from many outlying areas have to travel to the city to schools.  It is significant that all our dormitory suburbs are not self-contained, not industrial towns in their own right, as similar areas in Britain may be.</P>
    <P>There are no workers' fares in the Dublin area.  Britain operates on the same tax rule in this respect as we do but in most British industrial cities the transport authority provides specially reduced workers' fares.  Despite many representations from Dublin County Council, C.I.E. have always refused to institute such a facility for Dublin workers.  Indeed, I will go further and suggest that the fact that Dublin bus services subsidise rural transport to a considerable extent has some bearing on this amendment, which I suggest is very reasonable, very restrictive and should be acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    <P>We ask the Minister to allow the taxpayer the expenditure incurred by way of fares paid on public transport <Col N="776" /> in travelling between his own residence and the place where the income is earned, subject to a maximum of £52 in any one year.  There are working people, salaried people, who live at such distances from the city that they pay more than £1 a week to travel to their work but we are ignoring that because if a person wants to live in, say, Drogheda, Kildare or Wicklow, and work in Dublin, there is an element of personal choice in it.  He can come nearer to the city than these places, but travelling expenses of up to £1 a week are, indeed, in many cases unavoidable for the average taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I shall go further and say that, for my part, I would even be prepared to accept restriction of this concession to persons taxed under Schedule E, that is, wage earners and salary earners, on the grounds that they are more deserving of relief than any other section of taxpayers in this country, that they are the one section of taxpayers who have allowed no expenses whatever and are the one section of taxpayers who have no way of evading their tax liabilities by reason of the fact that their employers are forced to act as collectors for the Revenue Commissioners. The question of providing parity of treatment between wage earners and salary earners and others is of the utmost importance.  By allowing this reasonable concession something could be achieved towards that end.  Again, we are confining the amendment to expenditure on public transport.  We are not even suggesting that the person who travels to work in his own car should be permitted to charge that expenditure for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>The amendment is therefore restrictive and reasonable.  There is great need for a strong wind of change to blow through the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance in relation to tax reform.  The Minister, as I said earlier this evening on Section 4 of this Bill, has shown us what can be achieved when he puts his foot down and resolves to face up to the necessity for revising this antiquated tax code with which we are afflicted here.  I suggest to him that acceptance of this reasonable amendment would be another step in the right direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse what Deputy Byrne has said for the reason that, whatever may have been the original arrangement under which the cost of travel was not allowed as a deductible expense, circumstances have very largely changed. So far as Dublin is concerned, the city has grown considerably and tenants of corporation houses are obliged to live wherever houses are provided.  Many of these schemes, particularly the schemes provided since the war, are on the outskirts of the existing city.  In fact some of them were provided outside the city boundary altogether, in the county, and while it may be argued that people have a choice of where they live, corporation and council tenants have no choice.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy who has had experience of dealing with either corporation or council tenants can testify to the demand which exists for houses adjacent to centres of employment. That applies whether the person represents the city or a constituency adjacent to it.  In the case of workers employed in the centre of the city or, as Deputy Byrne said, at the docks or other such place, they are in the main obliged to travel from wherever the corporation houses them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from experience that many people have to travel from Dún Laoghaire to the city to work and even in a particular locality the demand for accommodation adjacent to the pool or centre of employment is considerable. Applicants who seek the assistance of a Deputy, a councillor or a member of the corporation, as the case may be, invariably preface their applications by suggesting that they wish to live in such and such a locality adjacent to the area where they are employed and in that way convenient. It is true that some effort is being made to provide employment adjacent to these schemes but in the main the vast majority of persons living either in Dún Laoghaire, Cabra, Ballyfermot, Crumlin or Kimmage work either in Dublin or, in the case of some of these outlying schemes, further in than the place in which they reside.  While this may not have been allowed in the past as a deductible expense, workers <Col N="778" /> previously had, in the main, to travel only short distances.</P>
    <P>The growth of the city and the development of housing schemes outside the area where people are employed involves them in considerable distances.  When one considers that in the past four years bus fares have increased by over 12 per cent.&mdash;bus fares were already high but are now 12 per cent. higher than they were four years ago&mdash;one must admit that it is a very considerable burden on a great many workers.  City people are obliged to live where they can get accommodation.  That imposes on a number of people, particularly council dwellers or corporation tenants, the obligation to travel to their place of employment.  These people have no choice.  They may opt on a form for a particular district but they find that a great many more people opt for the same district.  In fact, if the majority of the tenants had a choice they would live much closer to the centre of the city and centres of employment.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the experience I have had is that people in Dún Laoghaire prefer to live nearer to their place of employment than further away, entirely on the grounds of cost of travel.  Cost is involved in two ways; either wage-earners have to travel or housewives are obliged to travel but, in the latter case at least, they have an opportunity of shopping in some centre adjacent to where they reside. I believe there is a case for considering this proposal and allowing some expenses for travelling to and from employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  Deputy Byrne wondered why something had not been done about this already.  I think the answer is that we have to a large extent taken over British legislation; one of the greatest mistakes was to retain so many aspects of it.  It would have been preferable to have retained the better aspects and got rid of those which were not so good.  A reasonable case was made for the amendment by previous speakers.  There might be some <Col N="779" /> difficulty in the administration of it if it were not for the fact that the amendment specifies &ldquo;for public transport&rdquo; only.  It should be possible for the Minister and his advisers to give this consideration.</P>
      <P>I know the Revenue Commissioners do not like accepting amendments as a result of which they would be likely to lose money nor, with their inherently conservative outlook, do they like anything that savours of change. There is no reason why we should not strike out on a completely new road.  We have our own Government and just because the Government across the channel adheres to these archaic laws I do not see why we should continue to do so here.  Lest the Minister and his advisers feel they might lose a good deal of money by this proposal, I should like to put this point to them.  If the allowances are effective on public transport it is likely that those seeking income tax relief&mdash;and, mark you, there is no one paying tax who does not seek relief in some shape&mdash;would be more likely to use the public transport than they did heretofore.  By using it, they will enable it to pay its way better and the Minister for Finance would then possibly be spared the subvention he has to make to public transport to keep it solvent.</P>
      <P>There are many types of people who would be affected by this amendment. They are mostly people of the lower income group who find themselves on a small budget trying to live from day to day and to find the wherewithal to make ends meet.  That is the state of affairs largely to be found in this lower salary group who are subject to income tax under P.A.Y.E. This would mean a considerable amelioration of their condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to stress what the two previous speakers have said in regard to distances, which are now greater than before, and the difficulty of obtaining accommodation in the city of Dublin.  These points are well known.  Deputy Byrne said that a case might be made against those who worked in the city and live in other <Col N="780" /> places, in County Wicklow, or perhaps further away from that.  In many cases through necessity they have to live there, because they cannot get houses in Dublin.  As far as I can see from applications I get from people who came from my county originally, and are now looking for houses, they just have not got a hope but have to wait in a queue.  If they have not more than two or three children, they have not a hope of getting houses in Dublin. These are the people who are being hard hit by transport and get no relief. If we grant relief to other people, we should grant relief to people who have to travel to their work.  It is not their fault that they have to travel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that it was quite obvious that if they could get building sites or living quarters adjacent to their places of employment they would live there, but they have to live elsewhere.  For that reason there is a considerable argument in favour of this amendment.</P>
    <P>There is another section of the community which comes to mind also&mdash;the members of the teaching profession. There are many people in the profession, particularly music teachers who are not employed in one particular place but very often teach in five or six different convents or schools as the case may be, in widely scattered areas. Although they get certain fees for teaching music to a certain number of pupils, those fees are very largely nullified by the fact that they may have to pay 2/- or 3/- in bus fares. Such teachers are not by any means overpaid and if the Revenue Commissioners think they receive large sums of money and are able to afford the transport fares to bring them to their work, they are making a big mistake.</P>
    <P>I am sure we shall have the Minister's sympathy on this amendment.  In fairness to him I think there might be some little difficulty in administering it. It is not as easy to operate as the last amendment which he was not prepared to accept.  It is a public transport amendment and as such it would not be beyond the ingenuity of the Department of Finance, who are so good at arranging our affairs, to evolve some <Col N="781" /> scheme by which it would be possible to give relief to the section of the community who find it hard to make ends meet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be interested to hear the Minister's argument in relation to this amendment because, although we have all heard arguments in relation to the general principle of disallowing expenses incurred in going to and from work, I do not think we have ever heard the case argued in relation to a specific allowance for the cost of public transport alone.  That is a different case from the general case. We have arrived at a situation in relation to the city of Dublin where it is desirable that there should be some extension of the surburban dormitory. The centre of the city has become overcrowded and it is inevitable, and will be much more the situation, that the building of new houses, if this city should increase &mdash; and whether it should increase is another matter but it is obviously going to increase&mdash;will take place further and further away from the centre.  If that is so and if it is not possible in future for workers to live near their work, then there seems to me to be an argument that at least requires to be rebutted in relation to this problem.</P>
      <P>Certain small towns in my constituency&mdash;Leixlip, for example&mdash;would be devoid of half of their activities, were it not for the people who perforce live there and go to Dublin to work. Because their residence is in Kildare county, they are not eligible for houses in Dublin city or county.  The number of commuters on the buses from Naas, even from Newbridge, Leixlip, as I have said, Celbridge, Kilcock and even as far away as Maynooth, are quite considerable.  By not coming to the city to live, they are assisting in avoiding the creation of worse social problems. That is the kernel of the argument. There would be worse social conditions and problems if they were to scramble towards the centre where there is no housing room.  I should like to hear the argument which the Minister indicated he would make against the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne truly said <Col N="782" /> it is almost a sacred principle in relation to income tax that no allowance can be made for expenses of travelling to and from work.  That has always been the case.  I may say it is one of the principles that one is inclined to defend because I do not know what a departure from it would lead to.</P>
      <P>Let me make this point, first of all, because it has been raised two or three times.  The Revenue Commissioners should not be attacked about anything in this Bill.  It is I want the money; I asked them to give me money to balance the Budget.  If I say to them: &ldquo;Give me these concessions&rdquo;, they will do so.  So blame me and not the Revenue Commissioners for anything of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, they are not. Several of these amendments ask for concessions.  If they were accepted and the concessions given, they would amount to quite a lot of money.  It is quite possible that they would amount to as much as it would cost to take 6d. off the income tax rate.  I think it would be better to take the 6d. off than to give these concessions.  In other words, I personally am not inclined to give concessions, unless they are absolutely necessary and unless a very good case is made for them.  The whole effort should be directed towards reducing income tax, if possible.  I think it will be possible to reduce income tax even further in the course of a few years, because, as was pointed out here tonight, the yield from income tax will be very satisfactory.  Deputy Sweetman pointed out that we are estimating a higher yield from income tax this year than last year, even though we have taken 8d. off the standard rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated increase is virtually the amount to be secured under Section 6.  By removing the C.P.T. exemption in Section 6, it is £600,000 against £750,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, if we gave some of these companies concessions, we would not get it. <Col N="783" /> That is right.  I want to make the point that we should reserve any concessions we give in relation to income tax for a reduction in the standard rate, so far as possible, and consider concessions only where a very good case can be made.  I do not think it can be made in this instance.  I am entirely against it for that reason but there would also be difficulties in administration.</P>
      <P>A person is inclined to live in a certain place.  He has a preference for a certain place.  If he prefers to live in a certain place and if it cost him a good deal to go to work, I do not think the State should pay in any way for his preference for living there.  What is more, a person sometimes lives a long distance from his work and gets a house cheaper because rents are lower, and he may actually save as much on his rent as it costs him to travel.  Again, I think there would be no equity in trying to compensate him further by giving him relief in income tax.</P>
      <P>I do not know how these costs could be checked if this concession were to be conceded.  A man may live a long distance from his work and claim 2/- a day for five days a week.  That is 10/- a week.  I do not see how the Revenue Commissioners could possibly check that the man had travelled every day, five days a week, every week in the whole year. It would be an impossible task to ask any officials to carry out.  I am not making my case on the difficulties of administration.  I do not think there is any case at all.  Therefore, I would ask the Dáil to reject it.</P>

The Minister says that if he were in a position to provide what he considers the necessary revenue to meet the cost of these amendments, he would prefer to reduce the standard rate of tax. I suggest, for my part, that in our present conditions there is great need for relief for individuals.  I will go further and say that so far as tax <Col N="784" /> concessions for industry are concerned, industry has for the moment obtained enough relief until an instalment of justice is done to individuals, and particularly to those taxed under Schedule E.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Sweetman mentioned the special need for consideration of the position in Dublin.  Unlike Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Ryan, he is not a Dublin Deputy and cannot be accused of having a special interest in Dublin constituents.  In this country now there are 180,000 P.A.Y.E. taxpayers. It would be most interesting to know how many of them are in Dublin. I believe that probably over half of them are in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Despite my opening remarks, the Minister claimed that there is a choice of where to live, or that a personal choice is exercised to suit a person's preference.  I challenge that view.  I believe it is true to say that so far as the mass of Dublin working people are concerned, they have to live where the Dublin Corporation send them.  As I said before, they frequently go to great pains to avoid being sent to the outlying areas.  They will go to great lengths to remain in the more central city areas.  Dublin Corporation have no choice in the matter.  They have to send them to these outlying areas because there is no room for development in the city centre.  I make no apology whatever for making a special plea for Dublin workers in this respect.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggests that many people live a distance from their work in order to save rent, in order to have the benefit of lower rents in the outlying areas.  I think that is largely a theoretical argument.  I said this was a reasonable amendment because we are confining it to public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's point as to how the Revenue Commissioners will check up on the individual using public transport, the answer is, what if he does?  It is the cheapest form of transport that he can use.  If he is using his car to go to work, he should be allowed the expense of public transport. Is that not the very minimum to which he is entitled?  If he uses his bicycle to travel to work, good luck to him.  It is not unreasonable to suggest <Col N="785" /> that even in such cases he should still be entitled to the cost of public transport.</P>
    <P>The time has come when this House should consider and invite the Income Tax Commission to consider the theoretical basis of the various personal allowances on earned income and see if we can instil some kind of logic into the matter.  We should ask ourselves what the expenses are meant to cover.  Are they realistic for the purposes they are intended to serve? I remain convinced, despite what the Minister said, that the reform we are advocating in this amendment is a very reasonable one.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne stated the case so well that there is not much need to say anything more, beyond endorsing it in the light of one's own experience and dispel the gloom which the Minister has created in suggesting that a person has a free election in regard to the location of his house. As Deputy Byrne pointed out, if a person's means are such that he is unable to purchase a house of his own, he is at the mercy of the local authorities and in the case of Dublin city, that means he is given a house five or seven miles away from the place of his employment.  That necessitates, without any volition on his part in the matter, an expense of, perhaps, £1 for every person in the household who is travelling.</P>
      <P>We should bear this in mind.  The rents charged for outlying houses, which may be five, six or seven miles from the city centre, will be the same in many cases as the rents charged by the local authorities and Dublin Corporation in the city centre.  It is not a question of people going to further away places in order to have lesser rents.  One half of the population of Dublin are housed by the Corporation. It is a considerable social problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are compelling them to avail of outlying houses and involving them in considerable transport expenses in order to get to their places of employment and we are making no provision <Col N="786" /> whatsoever for this.  We should bear in mind that such people as corporation tenants are taxed as to one-sixth of their income for the purpose of paying the rents of their houses. Under the differential rents system, one-sixth of a person's income is regarded as being the proper rent.</P>
    <P>While the children remain at school and are not earning, the householder has still to pay for their travelling expenses.  In many cases, the school is a considerable distance away, thus putting an additional burden on him. The Minister may say that in such cases these people are not paying income tax at all.  That, of course, is true to some extent, but as the younger members of the family begin to earn, they in many cases find themselves paying income tax, although the travelling expenses of the household are going up and up.  When the differential rents system was introduced over 12 years ago, a basic allowance of 10/- per week was allowed to each householder to meet necessary expenses, including travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>Since then, under two Fianna Fáil administrations, there have been considerable increases in transport expenses and nothing by way of a decent personal allowance has been given under the income tax code.  Deputy Byrne is moving this series of amendments because he is mainly concerned with seeing that substantial increases are given in personal allowances, marriage allowances and allowances for children.  That is what should have been done but the Minister has failed to do it.  The purpose of the amendments is to indicate that there are increased individual personal expenses for which the Minister under the income tax code has made no provision whatsoever.  On that account, we believe we are correct in maintaining our point of view in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is a social problem as well. By reason of increasing transport expenses in respect of which people are getting no allowance, sites in the city centre are now sold at what were at one time considered to be exorbitant prices.  I believe it is socially undesirable.  From the social point of view, there is something to be said for <Col N="787" /> having people content to live in the suburbs.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the social programme of the State for some years.  It has been to give building grants and other subsidies for new houses and only new houses and many local authorities make loans available under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts for outlying houses.</P>

      <P>I am refuting the argument put up by the Minister that people have freedom of choice in regard to the place where they reside. The State has deliberately given subsidies to people to live on the fringe of the city.  It has denied these subsidies to people living in the city centre.  That makes a mockery of the suggestion that there is complete freedom of choice as to where one resides.  That is one of the reasons I believe this amendment deserves support.</P>

      <P>I have answered it fully.  Would any of the Deputies listen to this point?  Do they prefer all these far-fetched concessions to reducing income tax?  I was able to reduce the income tax rate by 8d. in the £ but I could not have reduced it by a penny if I were to do all these things.  All this stuff is just eyewash.</P>

      <P>This amendment deals with a special type of person.  Nobody denies the fact that the Minister reduced the income tax rate by 8d. in the £.  The people in question here are people who had considerable charges imposed upon them.  They are finding it hard to live.  The 8d. in the £ does not compensate them for the extra expenses they have to meet for transport to their business.  The Minister stated categorically that people live where they want to live.  Deputy Ryan was endeavouring to point out to the Minister&mdash;I think he produced a good argument&mdash;that people lived where they had to live.  These are the people who are suffering the hardship.</P>
