    <Title>Central Bank Bill, 1960&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes provision for the amendment of the superannuation scheme made under Section 33 of the Central Bank Act, 1942.  This scheme applies to the Governor and its terms are similar to those which were provided for members of the Electricity Supply Board by the Electricity Supply Board Superannuation Act, 1942.  These terms enable a pension to be paid on retirement after at least ten years' service of 1/48th of salary for each year's service.  No lump sum is payable but there is provision for a death gratuity of a year's salary after not less than five years' service.</P>
      <P>These terms were considered to be the most suitable for offices of this type in which service would normally be short.  The appointment of civil servants to such posts in recent years has, however, made it necessary to consider whether the short-service pension terms are the most suitable in such a case.  A civil servant appointed to a post of this kind will almost certainly have given long service which is pensionable under the Superannuation Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of the Superannuation Acts, which are designed for the life career of the civil servant, provide a pension of 1/80th of salary for each year of service and a lump sum of 1/30th of salary for each year of service with a death gratuity after five years' service.  Under Section 4 of the Superannuation Act, 1914, where a civil servant is selected for appointment to another post, for instance on the Board of a public body, and if the second post is recognised as &ldquo;approved employment&rdquo; under the section, it is possible to preserve the pension and lump sum that he has earned for his service up to the date of transfer and to pay it to him when he finally retires from his new post.  This, however, has a disadvantage because the civil servant <Col N="1147" /> must complete a further ten years before he becomes entitled to any pension in respect of his service in the new post.</P>
    <P>An even more serious drawback is that no death gratuity would be payable if the ex-civil servant were to die in the first five years of his service in the new post.  The loss of entitlement to death gratuity for a number of years would naturally cause anxiety to a civil servant who might be selected for a post with a public body.  On occasion in the past civil servants transferring to new employment have been allowed to carry their pensionable service with them for the purpose of an award on aggregate service to be made by their last employer.  This benefit is available to civil servants who transfer to the staff of the Central Bank as well as to civil servants transferring to the service of a local authority.  In each case the final award will be calculated according to the provisions of the Superannuation Acts.</P>
    <P>This arrangement has been found to be more acceptable to civil servants who would prefer to retain their existing superannuation terms if they are asked to transfer to other employment and it has been extended in recent years to civil servants transferred to posts as Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann and the Electricity Supply Board.  Instead of the short-service terms formerly provided the civil servant continues to be entitled to the terms of the Superannuation Acts in his new employment and his final superannuation award is calculated on aggregate service on his pensionable salary in his last employment.  It is now desired to make a similar provision for civil servants who may be appointed to the office of Governor of the Central Bank.  Section 33 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, under which the existing superannuation scheme for the Governor was made, did not make any provision for amending the scheme, and this Bill has accordingly been necessary to enable an amending scheme to be made.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill empowers the Board of the Bank to amend the existing <Col N="1148" /> scheme.  Under Section 3 of the Bill an amending scheme may provide for the aggregation of pensionable service in the Civil Service with service as Governor, and for the calculation of the superannuation award on aggregate service according to the provisions of the Superannuation Acts.  As all service will be reckoned for superannuation under the Central Bank scheme, no superannuation will in future be payable from voted moneys in respect of service in the Civil Service in cases covered by the amending scheme.</P>
    <P>The amending scheme will have effect as from the 1st December, 1960, and will accordingly apply to the Governor who was in office at that date, and who would not, but for this provision, receive any superannuation for his service as Governor.  Credit will be taken, in this case, for any payments made to him under the Superannuation Acts in respect of his service in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as we are concerned, we accept the principle of the Bill which provides that the two periods of service should be amalgamated to count for pension purposes. It is obviously right that, where it is desirable to avail of the services of an outstanding personality in the Civil Service in the Central Bank, such person should not be deterred from accepting service in the Central Bank by reason of any loss of his existing rights and privileges.  I want to make only one comment in relation to this Bill by way of criticism. It has been the practice&mdash;it is a good practice&mdash;in relation to all State sponsored bodies that where pension schemes are made out in pursuance of any Act of the Oireachtas, they are thereafter tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank was founded with and operates on public moneys, just the same as the Electricity Supply Board or Bord na Móna, although there are undoubtedly specific arrangements in relation to its management and particularly to its surplus income.  Nevertheless, it is a public institution and, as a public institution, <Col N="1149" /> it is right and proper that exactly the same safeguards in relation to pensions schemes that heretofore have always been included in relation to other State bodies should be provided in the case of this body. Both in relation to the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna, there is a provision that amendments to pensions schemes and the schemes themselves must be laid on the Table of the House so that they will receive the appropriate publicity, and so that, if it is considered desirable or necessary, this House can revise, amend or reject them as the House thinks fit.  I say &ldquo;revise or amend&rdquo;, but I appreciate that the method must be revision of the scheme in <i>toto</i> and a new scheme must be laid on the Table of the House.  Therefore, I urge the Minister very strongly to conform on Committee Stage to the established practice in relation to State sponsored bodies and to introduce an amendment to provide for a similar practice in relation to the scheme or schemes made under this Bill.</P>

      <Col N="1150" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £400 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Secretary to the President, and of certain other Expenses of the President's Establishment (No. 24 of 1938) including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>This supplementary estimate is required to meet an increase in the pay of the Secretary to the President following the grant, with effect from 1st April, 1960, of flat annual rates of inclusive remuneration for Secretaries formerly on scales with incremental progression.  I believe it has been considered many times before that the Secretary's salary should be a lump sum, not a scale, and that it should be the same for all Secretaries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,700 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for the Expenses of Prisons, St. Patrick's, and the Maintenance of Prisoners confined <Col N="1151" /> in District Mental Hospitals (17 &amp; 18 Vict., c. 76; 34 &amp; 35 Vict., c. 112, sec. 6; 40 &amp; 41 Vict., c. 49; 47 &amp; 48 Vict., c. 36; 61 &amp; 62 Vict., c. 60; 1 Edw. 7, c. 17, sec. 3; 8 Edw. 7, c. 59; 4 &amp; 5 Geo. 5, c. 58; and No. 9 of 1956).</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is due mainly to pay increases secured by certain grades of prison officers under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service, and to expenditure in the escort and conveyance of prisoners being greater than expected.

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £3,730 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for such of the Salaries and Expenses of the District Court as are not charged on the Central Fund (7 Edw. 7, c.17, sec. 3; No. 27 of 1926, secs. 49, 50 and 66; No. 15 of 1928, sec. 13; No. 48 of 1936, secs. 51 and 77; No. 4 of 1946, secs. 35 and 36; No. 21 of 1946; No. 8 of 1951; and No. 32 of 1953) and for a Capitation grant.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the extra expenditure which has been caused chiefly by the extension of the period of appointment of temporary justices of the district court and by the consequent increase in expenditure under the heading of travelling and subsistence.</P>
      <P>When the Estimates were being prepared it was expected that the scheme to reorganise the district court areas and districts would come into operation on the 1st January, 1961.  It was, however, found necessary to postpone this until the 1st April, 1961 and in consequence the appointment of eight temporary justices of the district court has been extended up to the 31st March, 1961.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I should like to raise.  If one is living in the country, in the rural parts of Ireland, one appreciates how close the district court comes to the daily lives of the people, and how important it is that there should be ready access to it. In some areas, in any case, the court meets every second month, and in some places every month.  I should like to know from the Minister is there a clear and statutory duty on the district justice to hold the court on the day appointed, or is it within the discretion of the district justice to hold it or not as he thinks best?</P>
      <P>If the date is fixed for the district court it ought to be held.  The district justice should be there and hold his court.  If he is not, he ought to arrange for some other district justice to attend.  The casual cancellation of court sessions is something to be greatly deplored.</P>
      <P>Is it not fundamentally unsound to appoint temporary judicial persons? We all recognise it is not possible always legitimately to adhere to the ideal principle that nobody should sit upon the bench unless he has full judicial tenure.  We are all familiar in systems of legal administration similar to our own that where criminal lists become heavily congested commissioners are sometimes sent out to help in clearing up the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not a sound general principle that if a person is appointed to judicial office either in the district <Col N="1153" /> court, circuit court or High Court he should hold that office by the special terms of tenure laid down by our legislation which give him a high degree of independence of the Executive? I can remember this point arising on occasions when I was a member of the Government.  The general view then was that even at some expense it was better to appoint one permanent justice too many so as to have a man in reserve to fill any vacancy that might unexpectedly arise than to depend on a system of appointing temporary district justices.</P>
    <P>It was felt that the system of appointing temporary district justices opened the way to the possibility of the abuse that the Executive&mdash;whatever Executive it was&mdash;might appoint temporary justices almost on probation and that if, in that probationary period of temporary appointment, they did not bring in verdicts of the kind the Executive wanted they would be tacitly fixed with notice that they would not be appointed to such temporary posts in the future and that their prospects of permanent appointment would be remote.  That is a danger.  I believe the sound principle is that if you intend to put a man on the bench whether in the district court, circuit court or High Court he ought to be there on the terms prescribed in our legislation and under the Constitution which are designed to secure for any judicial person the maximum security of tenure so that he can do full justice to any person appearing in the court, particularly when that person is appearing in criminal proceedings where the State is a party to the proceedings.</P>
    <P>The district court is very close to the people's lives.  It is probably a good thing that the procedure of the district court should be friendly and informal and attuned to the mind of the locality in which it sits.  I suggest that can be carried too far.  Inevitably the Garda and the State Solicitor who perennially appear before the district court are more familiar with its proceedings than the average individual who may once or twice in his lifetime be called to meet a charge in such a form.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" /> It is manifestly important, in such a court which now has a pretty wide jurisdiction in rural Ireland, that the ordinary citizen should be fully reassured in his mind that the district justice stands not only as a judge but as a protector of the individual against any attempt by the Executive or its agents to trespass upon his rights. Therefore, it should not only be true but it should be made daily manifest that, no matter how humble the citizen who is brought before the court may be, the obligation remains upon the State to prove to the court that he is guilty before he can be convicted.</P>
    <P>Many people forget that under our system of law it is not only necessary that a man should be guilty in order to convict him but he must be proved to be guilty.  We all know that many guilty persons may go unconvicted because the State fails to prove their guilt.  When we get to the level of the district court, functioning in a very small social unit, it is a fact that minor crime in a small country town, village or townland rarely goes long undetected.  Within forty-eight hours most of the neighbours know who did it.  It does not always follow that the Garda authorities or anybody else is in a position to produce to a court of law satisfactory proof of guilt.  That is what our legal system requires the representative of the Executive to do.</P>
    <P>It is very important that everybody should be reassured that just as much in the district court as in the circuit court or in the Central Criminal Court, the State will be required to discharge the burden of proof that the law puts upon it.  That is something the Minister might with advantage discuss with the Garda and with the Attorney General so as to refresh everybody's mind that, even if we know that it was the itinerant tinker who stole the pair of trousers off the hedge, the obligation to prove that in court still remains before he is convicted.  Although it may be the itinerant tinker who is summarily convicted on public belief rather than strict legal proof, today, if that principle were to be generally accepted as an appropriate procedure, <Col N="1155" /> the rest of us might receive similar summary treatment thereafter.</P>
    <P>While it is urgent to ensure that that careful procedure is followed, it is doubly urgent to ensure that everybody knows and sees that it is being followed.  That, I think, requires that the district justices, bearing that in mind, will be scrupulous to avoid even the appearance of contact with the Garda before hearing criminal charges in their own courts.  Even though there is no improper discussion of cases by the Garda and the justice, the all-important thing is to preserve, clear and certain, in the minds of the people that the district justice comes to their community not only as a judge but as the protector of each individual's rights against the Executive and that a highly important part of his function as a district justice of an area is to insist on the Garda authorities discharging to the full their obligation of proving guilt before they can expect a conviction of any person brought before the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Cosgrave's query, the appointments which had to be made were made principally as a result, in the first place, of the deaths of a number of district justices.  They were not replaced by permanent justices because we were reducing the number of districts from 30 to, eventually, 23.  It was also due to the fact that a number of district justices became ill and we received notices from them, accompanied by medical certificates, saying they would be ill for a considerable time.  It was necessary, therefore, to have temporary appointments in place of these men.</P>
      <P>It would be undesirable to attempt to appoint each man permanently because eventually we would be carrying a surplus of district justices.  Two permanent district justices will be eventually required, and they will be appointed from the eight who have been appointed temporarily.  The remaining six will return to their practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question raised by Deputy Dillon concerning district justices being promptly in attendance on <Col N="1156" /> the dates and at the times arranged, I must say I am concerned about that position myself.  I took the matter up shortly after Deputy Dillon raised the question in respect of a particular individual, whom he did not name. Arising out of that, I had inquiries made generally in respect of district justices all over the country.  I was not too satisfied with the excuses I got, but they were the type of excuse you could not very well dispute.  For instance, some of the excuses were that the roads were in a very dangerous state and that when the justices started off and found the roads in this dangerous state, they decided not to attempt to complete the journey and wired the authorities concerned that they would be unable to be present. Other excuses were that they had become suddenly ill.  It is very difficult to dispute that sort of thing.  If these excuses are given, they have to be accepted, coming as they do from men respected as honourable men. Nevertheless, I took the matter up and I had it conveyed to all concerned that I was disturbed by reason of the fact that a number of courts were abandoned at very short notice.  I am hoping that that action will lead to greater promptitude and better attendances.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I could very well discuss the other matters raised by Deputy Dillon in respect of district justices, their decisions and their close contacts with the Garda, either before or after a case is heard.  The district court, as we know it, is a friendly institution, except, perhaps, for the criminal who knows he will be punished.  Otherwise, it is an institution to which the people come without any great fear or trembling or the feeling they will be treated in a manner other than is just.</P>
    <P>I should not like, for instance, to take up the question as to whether justice has been fully done or not.  I have had a number of complaints from time to time in respect of decisions taken by the court which were questioned by the individuals who wrote to me.  On the evidence given in these communications, I should be somewhat shaken and maybe a little doubtful; but when I <Col N="1157" /> got in touch with the authorities concerned. I was satisfied that one had to be present in the court completely to understand and sympathise with the situation confronting the justice and the reasons for the decision he had to take.</P>
    <P>I think I can assure the Deputy that, so far as my experience goes, justice is meted out.  Sometimes justice can be harsh and the person receiving it regards it as harsh or perhaps as being unjust instead of being just.  But that is purely a matter of opinion between the individual punished and the person inflicting the punishment.  However, generally speaking, I am satisfied that the courts do a reasonably good job of work between the people who come to them and the people who adjudicate in them.  I do not think we need have any great fear in that regard.  However, the views expressed here will be examined and if there is any necessity to take the matter further, I can assure the House that I will be prepared to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree with me that it is very important not only that justice should be done but that justice should appear to be done.  The point I am making is this: before criminal proceedings take place in a criminal court, the Garda should be as remote from the district justice as the prisoner at the bar so that all may feel that the district justice is there not only to judge but to protect the prisoner's constitutional and fundamental rights and protect him from any attempt by the Executive, whom the Garda represent, to abridge his fundamental freedoms.  If they see the district justice's familiar conduct with the Garda before the proceedings begin, they may think that there is not the detached approach to the prisoner and the Executive which they think a judicial person ought to have and which I think a judicial person ought to have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year <Col N="1158" /> ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>This Estimate is necessary to cover the anticipated cost of recoupment in the year ending on 31st March, 1961, of <i>ex gratia</i> payments by Dundalk Engineering Works, Ltd., to former Great Northern Railway Board employees at the Board's Dundalk workshops for whom suitable employment could not be found in the group of companies set up to develop the Dundalk Works.  On previous occasions, the House agreed to the provision of money required for this purpose as workers became redundant.</P>
    <P>In the financial year 1958/59, a sum of £50,000 was voted, but actual expenditure was only £8,607, the balance being surrendered to the Exchequer.  In the year 1959/60, a total of £104,010 was voted, and expenditure came to £96,597.  For the current year, owing to the impossibility at the time the Estimates were being prepared of anticipating what sum would be required, a token provision of £10 was made.  It can now be estimated that a sum of £190,000 will be required to meet payments under the scheme, which it is intended to terminate, if at all possible, before the end of the present financial year.  It it thus estimated that total payments under the <i>ex gratia</i> payments scheme will come to about £295,000.</P>
    <P>The amount now required can be met in full from savings on a provision of £1,200,000 made by way of Supplementary Estimate in July, 1960, for the purchase of shares in Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. under a new Subhead SS.  Accordingly, the Estimate now submitted to the House provides only for a net sum of £10.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware from the debate on the previous Estimates for this service that at the outset a great deal of uncertainty prevailed in regard to the prospects of ultimately establishing as viable concerns the group of industries created at Dundalk.  It <Col N="1159" /> was necessary, in order to avoid the risk of making unjustified payments, to withhold declarations of redundancy until it was reasonably certain that suitable employment would not arise.</P>
    <P>Between December, 1959 and 31st March, 1960, 167 workers were declared permanently redundant, a further 116 in August, 1960 and 218 more are now seen by the Dundalk companies to be in the same case.</P>
    <P>The principals of the companies are doing everything in their power to find new economic production openings, to safeguard the continuity of employment of the remaining workers. Deputies will appreciate, however, that this group of companies must operate on ordinary commercial principles and that they cannot afford to employ workers unless there is genuine employment available for them, which, in turn, depends on the companies' ability to place their products on remunerative markets.  In this respect the position of the workers will be no different from the position of workers engaged in any form of industrial activity.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the House should approve of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We approve of the proposals contained in this Supplementary Estimate so as to provide for the personnel who were found redundant arising out of the termination of work in the Dundalk Engineering Works.  I note, however, from the figures the Minister gave that to date a total of 500 workers have become redundant.  I should be glad if the Minister could say how many workers were originally employed there and whether he can indicate if the companies concerned have any view as to the possible numbers who in the future will become redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all most anxious that the work which was undertaken there by the establishment of new factories should be a success but I think that I am bound to say that one, if not more, of these undertakings which were established looked at the very <Col N="1160" /> beginning to have little prospect of profitable operation and while it was necessary that every effort should be made to provide employment and, indeed, to stretch to the limit the resources available in order to provide work there for those who had been disemployed, nevertheless, the establishment of an undertaking which, in view of the general trend and experience elsewhere, had little prospect of economic expansion or, indeed, economic survival, was of itself not conducive to bright hopes for its future.  I, therefore, should be glad to hear from the Minister, if it is possible for him to do so, what estimates are available as to future employment there and what are the economic prospects of the companies concerned.</P>
    <P>We know from previous discussions and from information on the situation there that many difficulties were encountered, not the least of these being internal difficulties.  Nobody has any desire to discuss these situations in order to create difficulties or to aggravate an existing problem, but it is significant, I think, that in the past 12 months or so over 200 workers have become redundant.  It is a fact, as I say, that a total of 500 persons have become redundant during the past two years.  Undoubtedly, the prospect for all concerned is one that must give rise to anxiety.  The fact that the House has accepted responsibility for making funds available indicates the concern of members of the Dáil about the situation.  Their anxiety has been expressed in the provision of this money so that employment may be provided.  I should be glad if the Minister would indicate the situation as envisaged in the light of information available to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us, of course, without question, accept the principle already laid down in the House that moneys should be made available, due to the necessity for these redundancy payments.  I want to follow a slightly different line from that taken by Deputy Cosgrave.  At the beginning, when these various factories were set up in Dundalk, I understood the first <Col N="1161" /> intention was that they would be set up for the export market, that they would not be for and were not intended to cater for, the home market in any way. Certainly those concerns in other parts of the country which engage in the same type of business were led so to believe.  That went by the board very quickly and far from confining themselves to the export market alone, the concerns, in their desire to develop, came into the home market very fully.</P>
      <P>There is not the slightest use anybody saying to me that these are private concerns and therefore cannot be discussed.  They are concerns initiated by the Government and concerns in which no private capital of any consequence whatever is invested. They are concerns which exist solely because of the public moneys which have been advanced to the parent company, and, through the parent company, to the other companies, by the Industrial Credit Company which gets its funds by subvention from the Exchequer. They are public funds without any possible shadow of doubt. This is not the time to discuss it but let me say in passing that I do not accept that the Industrial Credit Company made the loans to Dundalk purely on a commercial, business basis.  However, there will be another occasion on which we can take that up in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not challenging whether the Government were right or wrong to direct them to do it but there is a very strong case to be made, an unanswerable case to be made that when the Government deem it right that funds should be made available for a particular purpose, they should be made available openly and not under the subterfuge of saying that a board makes the money available on a commercial basis.  Be that as it may, the Minister himself is not the person who was responsible.  That was a decision taken by his predecessor, the Taoiseach, and a most unhappy decision taken by the Taoiseach in his choice of personnel to try to save the employment position for the unfortunate people in Dundalk.  However, thank goodness, that aspect is now finished and perhaps therefore it is not <Col N="1162" /> necessary for me to say anything more about it.</P>
    <P>While I have every possible sympathy with the people who are unemployed in Dundalk, I want to say to the Minister that there is no great advantage to the country as a whole, if one merely makes employment for a person in Dundalk at the expense of the employment of a person in Wexford, or in Cork or in Kildare.  I have heard a suggestion that the Government have given directions that State bodies are to give priority to Dundalk firms in relation to any material they want manufactured.  I want to make it quite clear that I believe Dundalk should be given the option of competing for tenders just the same as any other concerns, but it is entirely wrong that the sole right of offering for tender should be confined at Government request to the Dundalk series of firms.  As I said, people were led to believe in the beginning that they were set up for the export market alone. That has been departed from but at least in trying to salvage, so far as is humanly possible, the employment of the people in Dundalk&mdash;and every effort should be made to salvage it&mdash; nothing should be done that would injure the employment of the personnel of firms in other parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody underestimates the urgent task that faced the Government when the G.N.R. works in Dundalk closed down, with almost 1,000 men employed there.  Apart altogether from the social difficulties which were bound to arise immediately, unless alternative employment was found for these men, or as many of them as could be put into other employment, there was, I suggest to Deputy Sweetman, a national issue in it as well, a national responsibility and something that we had to maintain for the benefit of the national economy.  There was in Dundalk, employed in the railway works, a big cadre of skilled men, skilled in heavy engineering, and unless some effort was made, apart altogether from the social effects for the men concerned, to contain and retain that employment, the immediate effect <Col N="1163" /> would be that they would have gone to all ends of the earth, probably mainly to Britain, and it would have been very difficult to get them back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I very definitely think it was a national issue.  I do not want to be misunderstood and I do not think the Minister means to misunderstand me, but I must not have made myself clear.  It was a national problem to be faced, everyone agrees, but there is no use keeping employee X in employment in Dundalk, keeping him from going to England, if he is pushing Y out of employment in Galway and sending him to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, it was very difficult to see the impact in every direction of carrying out a major operation such as that was.  I do not think anybody tries to pretend it was not.  There were certain difficulties that would arise, some of which might be foreseen and others of which might not be foreseen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And during a very difficult time, the Minister was given every consideration from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly appreciate, since I came into office as Minister for Industry and Commerce, the help and co-operation that has been given to me from that side of the House.  I think I put it on record before and it gives me pleasure to do so again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in answer to the specific question put by Deputy Cosgrave there were something less than 1,000 employed there.  To be exact, I think it was 967 at the time the take-over was effected.  There were many of these <Col N="1164" /> in the 60 and upwards age group so it was reasonable to assume some of these would be affected by, shall we say, normal wastage.  As well as that, some of the men found alternative employment almost immediately and there are reasonably good avenues of employment in Dundalk where there are some industries employing more than 500 each.  In the meantime, in order to get the required personnel for the new activity, the other employees were taken on as well as people in an employment category who were not immediately available in Dundalk.  The net position now is that it is estimated that about 500 men as of now will find permanent employment there.  I should like to hope, if I cannot venture the guess, that the corner has been turned.  It is my hope, at any rate, that employment will continue to increase there.  I cannot say definitely, but it seems as if the company has now more or less found its feet and can look forward to expansion given reasonable opportunities.</P>
    <P>One of the major disappointments, of course&mdash;again I admire Deputy Cosgrave's forbearance in the matter, but I do not think it is necessary not to mention it&mdash;was the Heinkel Cabin Scooters, Ltd.  That seemed to be something worthwhile at the time even though, I would suggest, it was not something that was expected to be of a permanent nature.  It was expected that it would employ at least for a period of some years a considerable number of men and that in the meantime it would be possible to find some other form of activity or undertaking to which these men could be transferred, if and when the Heinkel cabin scooter operation came to an end.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, economic circumstances outside our control prematurely affected that operation.  First of all, the credit squeeze in Britain which took place over 12 months ago and the restriction of hire purchase facilities caused the demand in Britain for motor cars to ease off considerably, with the result that the selling agents of the Heinkel cabin scooters found tremendous difficulty in selling these bubble cars and ultimately found that there was no demand at all in Britain <Col N="1165" /> for them.  That was contributed to by another factor.  Another car company that had been manufacturing in a European country came into Britain, competing directly with the Heinkel and at a more competitive price by reason, first of all, of the Customs duty and secondly the lack of having to pay cross-Channel freight rates. These were two factors outside the control of the Dundalk company.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, in relation to their other overseas market in the Argentine, to which they were exporting cars in C.K.D. condition, there were financial difficulties in the company to which they were exporting and that company had to give up its orders to Dundalk. In any event, again I should like to say that the exports to the Argentine were not seen in any long-term light, because it was reasonable to assume that the export in C.K.D. condition would ultimately taper off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>C.K.D.&mdash;what is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Completely knocked down.  That form of export would taper off as the Argentine company would get into more fundamental and more basic production itself.</P>
      <P>That is the position about the Heinkel and that is the main reason why now such a big number appear to be redundant, for whom this particular sum is to be made available.  I should like to say also that there is no question of the Government directing State-sponsored bodies to place orders only with the Dundalk works.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The main customers of Dundalk are, naturally, C.I.E. and Bord na Móna but the bulk of C.I.E. business for work that Dundalk could do for them is done by another company altogether.  C.I.E. have very favourable arrangements and get very favourable treatment from that other company and there is no question whatever of trying to direct C.I.E.'s orders away from the company which treat them very favourably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of answering the Deputy's suggestion it suffices to say that there has been no Government direction to any of the State-sponsored bodies to confine orders in any respect to the Dundalk Engineering Works.  Secondly, I do not think it was ever specifically stated that the operations in Dundalk on the formation of this company, Industrial Engineering Limited, would be confined to exports.  I have made enquiries since and I have flicked through the Dáil Debates of the day and I do not think any such undertaking was given.  Certainly, most of the sales, apart from the orders placed by C.I.E. and Bord na Móna, have been in overseas markets, for instance, the Heinkel and the rotovators made by the Bonser group.  There have been certainly a very few Heinkel sales within the country but I do not think it could have affected any other <Col N="1167" /> manufacturer because the bubble car is considered to be apart altogether from the ordinary saloon cars which are assembled here.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything else I have to say in reply to Deputies who raised questions except to repeat that I hope the corner has been turned.  I have made enquiries independently altogether of the company of the position in Dundalk and I have been given to understand that there is quite good morale there now and having established good morale I hope the company can look forward to maintaining the employment that there is there and ultimately increasing it.</P>

At this stage the Department of Industry and Commerce as such will not be responsible for Dundalk any more.  It has been responsible only to the extent that there was an undertaking to recoup the company for any stand-off and severance payments that they made available to their redundant workers.

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £412,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund (No. 14 of 1950 and No. 11 of 1952).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate is concerned with the Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  As Deputies are aware, the Exchequer makes good, through Subhead A of the Social Insurance Vote, the amount by which the expenditure of the Fund exceeds its income in any year.  The revised estimate of that deficit is now £4,630,000, or an increase of £412,000.  The increase in expenditure arises in this way: a sum of £1,040,000 is required to meet the cost of the old age contributory pensions which the House is aware were introduced for the first time under the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960, with effect as from 1st January <Col N="1169" /> last; a sum of £233,000 is required for widows' contributory pensions and orphans' contributory allowances, a sum of £363,000 for disability benefit and a sum of £94,000 for treatment benefit.</P>
    <P>This makes a total increase in expenditure of £1,730,000 which has been offset by certain savings and reductions as follows: a saving in unemployment benefit of £237,000; an increase in employment contributions of £950,000 and an increase in investment yeilds of £20,000, an overdraw from the Exchequer made in respect of the Fund for last year amounting to £106,000 which is now available to meet the increased expenditure to which I have referred; and a net decrease under miscellaneous provisions of £5,000.  In consequence of these offsetting savings and economies, the net increase in the deficit amounts to the sum which is now being asked for, that is, £412,000.</P>

      <P>I note from the Minister's speech that the estimated increase in the Social Insurance Fund is a total of £970,000, of which, according to the Minister's statement, £950,000 is attributable to the expected yield from increases in the rates of contribution which became operative in January of this year.  I wonder can the Minister say if that is the total sum which will be secured from the increased contributions?  As the Minister and the House are aware, the contributions in respect of all categories of employees and employers, industrial, agricultural and domestic, increased very substantially this year.  Most of these contributions will be borne by the employers.  In some cases, they will be shared by employers and employees and the increase is undoubtedly a very severe burden on many people.  I should be glad if the Minister would say what is the total which is expected will become available as a result of the increase in contributions, whether paid by the employee or the employer, which became operative in January.</P>

      <P>Needless to remark, we have no objection to the Minister's getting this sum of £412,000 for which he asks this morning.  I do not know <Col N="1170" /> if the Minister has the information with him but I wonder could he relate, for example, the income from increased contributions and the outgoings in respect of new pensions and new benefits to the sums to which the Minister for Finance referred in his Budget speech in April last year when he announced that these new benefits would be introduced.  I note here that the additional income to the Social Insurance Fund is estimated at, one could call it, £1,000,000.  That, I assume, is for the quarter January, February, March.  I forget exactly when the new rates of increased contributions were introduced.</P>

      <P>I thought it was earlier.  There are one or two small matters I wish to mention to the Minister, not so much in connection with these increases or the £412,000 which he now requires, as in connection with the fact that some people are being inconvenienced by the transfer from ordinary old age pensions to contributory old age pensions and especially widows whose husbands died since 1st January.  The procedure apparently is this: if a man has been awarded a contributory old age pension, say, from 1st January and he dies in the month of January or February, his widow must then apply for a contributory old age pension.  I know that delays have occurred of up to about five weeks.  I appreciate very deeply the difficulty which the Minister and his Department have in that regard.  It has not been very easy to check up the insurance record of people who were insured 20 or 30 years ago.</P>

That is important to people in the country.  I merely bring it to the Minister's notice while appreciating all the difficulties he had in trying to introduce this scheme before the 1st January and I merely ask him to try to devise some different method whereby there will not be these long delays.  I do not think that is unreasonable or that I should wait until June or July to bring it to the Minister's attention when people are waiting for their money.</P>

      <P>I should like a little information about this.  I am not quite clear about certain matters. I had some questions already down for next week but if the Minister produces the information now it will save me bothering him then.  As I understand the situation, apart from the Supplementary Estimate that is really on the Social Insurance Vote, that must have its counterpart on the Social Assistance Vote in a saving by reason of the fact that people have switched over from non-contributory old age pensions to contributory pensions.  I should like the Minister to give us an indication of the amount that is there in consequence as an offset to the additional sum he now requires on the Social Insurance Vote.  I am not at all clear about it.</P>

      <P>I am perfectly aware that the Minister is deliberately trying to hide the other fact.  It does not matter in the slightest to me whether the Minister answers it now or by way of Question next week but it is quite material to this Supplementary Estimate to know exactly why the amount is necessary.  The amount is necessary because £X that would otherwise be paid on the Social Assistance Vote now comes to be paid under this Vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Could the Minister restrain himself for the next two minutes so that I may say what I want to say without interruption from him? The necessity for this Supplementary Estimate arises because as a result of the Bill that was passed recently by the House the expenditure of a certain <Col N="1173" /> part of the national income will in future be expenditure under Vote 52 instead of under Vote 53.  I think I am perfectly in order on this Vote in inquiring how much of the additional expenditure is truly additional and how much of it arises in the switch from the Social Assistance Vote&mdash;a simple question which the Minister understands perfectly but which, for purposes of his own, he does not want to answer even at this hour of the morning in a simple way.</P>
      <P>The other thing I should like to know is this, and it is material also in relation to the deficiency that there is in the Vote for the current year. I must pay tribute to the Minister's courtesy in circulating to us the draft of this introductory statement.  I was glad to note that it was headed &ldquo;Draft&rdquo; because he got considerably tired before he came to the end.  So far as I can follow this statement it does not explain how much extra is being taken from the pockets of the employers and how much extra from the pockets of the employees by additional stamps so as to counter balance on either side the increase of £2,103,000 that will be there next year and for the balance of this year which the Supplementary Estimate is covering.</P>
      <P>I am not entitled to ask about next year's figure at this stage but for the current year I am entitled to know how much is made up out of four simple figures: (1) how much extra employers are going to have to pay in the current financial year; (2) how much extra employees will have to pay; (3) how much extra the taxpayer will have to pay in the current financial year&mdash;it will not be the entire extra sum because the fourth figure comes in there; (4) how much is being saved from the Social Assistance Vote ?  These are four simple questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to endorse what Deputy Sweetman has pinpointed. The Tánaiste came into the House today dressed in sheep's clothing and he was very vexed when Deputy Sweetman took off the sheep's clothing and revealed him as something <Col N="1174" /> less kindly.  We know from the Book of Estimates for next year that £2¼ million will be saved as the Minister will no longer have to issue the non-contributory old age pensions and, in considering this Estimate, that point should be brought home notwithstanding the efforts of the Minister to conceal it.  In fact it would appear that the State is at no extra cost whatever as a result of the increased pensions that have been paid to some people from the 1st January last.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the workers of Ireland are paying for what the Fianna Fáil Party is suggesting is their gift to the Irish people.  The workers are paying considerably increased amounts week in, week out, and the State has been relieved of a considerable burden because of increased contributions paid by workers and employers each week.  It is necessary that that point should be driven home at this stage so that people will appreciate the simple truth, that the increases being given to some are being paid for by everybody. Every worker from the age of 16 to the age of 70&mdash;if still working&mdash;is paying for the increased pensions now being paid in the hope of getting the sum of £2 per week in 50 years' time when a person, now 20, might retire.  The fact is they will have paid in those 20 years far more than any pension they may subsequently draw.  It is vitally necessary this should be known, because, while we are most anxious to see contributory pensions schemes introduced, the one the Minister has introduced is no more than an attempt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Apparently he does not care to do that.  The matter is pertinent in that we are asked to allocate sums from the Exchequer for this purpose. Before we approve, it is very desirable that the Minister should tell us what will be coming into the Exchequer in another way to set off this payment. That is what Deputy Cosgrave and I want to know.  It is what the people want to know.  If the Minister does not tell us, then it is obvious the Minister is hiding something there.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see there is at last a glimmering of economic sense dawning on the other side of the House.  Deputy Ryan comes face to face at last with the fact that you cannot go on promising benefits unless you get someone to pay for them.  If we are giving increases in all social insurance benefits and introducing a new service of contributory old age pensions, the money has to be found somewhere.  How will it be found ? Will it be found at the expense of the general taxpayer ?  Deputy Ryan referred to the State.  It was a mask to conceal from those to whom his remarks are addressed that in this context they are the State.  The taxpayers of this country are the State.  The State is only a synonym for the worker on the land, for the small farmer, for the worker in industry, his employer, and eventually the consumer.  The real question is whether it is fair and equitable to ask those who are going to secure substantial benefits in the shape of these contributory old age pensions to pay a little more in order to provide the finances required to carry this scheme.  Is the man on the land, therefore, who may never get a contributory old age pension, will not get one if he does not become an employed person and so long as he is not in a position to fulfil the insurance contribution conditions, to be made to pay all?  Apparently it is the view of Deputy Ryan that a person outside the scheme, a person who does not enter into social insurance at any stage, should be taxed more heavily than he is today in order to pay these <Col N="1176" /> benefits.  Next time the Deputy is in a rural constituency I hope he will try to defend the proposition he has advanced here today.</P>

The House is concerned with one Vote only, Vote 56, dealing with social insurance.  The nett position is that while the contribution income will be increased by £4,158,000, the total increase in expenditure on benefits for the year will be £6,637,000.

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Road Traffic Bill, 1960&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one man who will have no excuse, if he is ever convicted of an offence against the Road Traffic Act, it is the Minister for Local <Col N="1179" /> Government.  Indeed, it could be said of all Deputies that, if we were convicted of an offence, after this marathon debate, we certainly could not plead ignorance of the law, or say that we had not got the right advice, so we may sincerely hope that St. Christopher will guide us and prevent us from ever falling into error on the road.</P>
      <P>If it happened that one of us was unfortunate enough to be caught in respect of a breach of the road traffic laws, I wonder whether he would think it an appropriate punishment for a statutory offence to find himself cast into a common prison with thieves, robbers, murderers and people who have been convicted of all types of sordid crimes&mdash;in the company of habitual criminals in a common jail.</P>
      <P>I think, for instance, that the degree of moral turpitude in relation to a careless driving offence, or even a dangerous driving offence, is far less than the degree of moral responsibility and blame which lies with a person who deliberately sets forth from home and commits a crime against his fellow man or against society.  Therefore, it is a great pity that in the preparation of the new road traffic code, serious consideration was not given to the establishment of what I might call a traffic prison to which people convicted of driving offences could be assigned.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of wanting one law for the rich and another law for the poor, or one system of punishment for the rich and another for the poor, because, indeed, there are many people who drive mechanically-propelled vehicles or ride bicycles nowadays who can certainly be classed amongst the poor.  If, for instance, a farm labourer or a factory worker, on pay day, has a few drinks too many in a public house and is foolish enough to ride home on his bicycle, under this Bill he may find one month's imprisonment imposed upon him because he was found wobbling on his bicycle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all in agreement that such a man must be discouraged from doing that kind of thing, but if he is unfortunate <Col N="1180" /> enough to do it, are we not imposing an appalling penalty on him, if we cast him into a common jail for one month?  We must consider the company he will be keeping for that month and the terrible mental torture he will have to endure in a common jail.  In many cases, the man will lose his employment.  One of the consequences of putting road traffic offenders in a common jail will be that our courts will bend over backwards not to convict, and people ought to be penalised for driving offences.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest, therefore, that it is still not too late to reconsider this matter.  It may well be that a separate Bill would be required which would have to be introduced by the Minister for Justice, but consideration should be given to this matter <i>in toto</i> and, if necessary, two parallel Bills should be brought in to provide a special prison for those convicted of traffic offences. If we did that, we would make people more aware of the responsibilities which rest upon them.</P>
    <P>I understand there are countries where they have a system of week-end imprisonment in relation to traffic offences, under which a man on whom a sentence of so many days in prison is imposed may serve that sentence over a period of week-ends, and thereby continue in his lawful occupation and support his wife and children, who would not then become a burden on the State.  Perhaps that is a little too liberal and would make the sentence too easy.  There may be many people who would be glad to escape into the asylum of such a prison for a week-end.  I am not suggesting that system, but I think it would help to administer the road traffic code if we had a separate prison to which people convicted of offences under the road traffic code could be sent.</P>
    <P>I do not say that all persons convicted of traffic offences should go to the traffic prison.  There are some offences of a very serious nature which would justify the ignominy and suffering of a common prison, but that is a matter which could be dealt with. We could specify a certain number of offences which would require confinement <Col N="1181" /> in the traffic prison.  In that prison, a certain amount of time could be given to instructing the convicted offenders in the rules of road traffic. It would help to improve conditions on our roads if they were given lectures and demonstrations on driving, and also if some of the shocking injuries and deaths which occur because of indifference and carelessness were shown to them.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and rightly said, as a criticism of this Bill, that it concentrates too much on mechanically-propelled vehicles.  I think the Minister's argument is that mechanically-propelled vehicles do the most damage, and are also the easiest to control.  If members of the public cross a railway track, I understand they can be prosecuted under the railway bye-laws. I think that has happened, but I know that at least the system is there.  Much as it would be a restriction on myself as on anyone else, we shall have to become more severe with pedestrians, cyclists and drivers of horse-drawn vehicles in the interests of road traffic, because they are a potential danger on every road.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we have convinced ourselves, or the members of the public, of the great necessity for constant care on the roads.  We have had costly advertising urging people to get inoculated, vaccinated, X-rayed, and so on.  That consistent advertising created a public awareness of the dangers of certain diseases.  It is a pity full use has not been made of a similar advertising campaign in relation to road traffic.  The advertising must be continuous if it is to be effective.  One reason for our bad manners and indifference on the roads is that from time to time signs are erected and white lines are painted on the roads and an effort is made for a week or so to enforce certain rules of the road.  Then everybody becomes lax and indifferent again.  From time to time our roadways have beautiful white lines painted on them but they disappear or practically disappear before a man comes along to repaint them.  It is essential to preserve the white lines in a visible condition all the time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> The third section gives us the interpretation of the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo;'.  I think the reason is that any responsibility in relation to the vehicle under the Road Traffic Acts would lie on the person under whose control it is used.  To avoid fraud in the sale of mechanically-propelled vehicles we should oblige the finance company interested in the vehicle to register their name as an interested party on the official tax book.  The purchaser of a mechanically-propelled vehicle may not be able to establish whether or not the vehicle is partly owned by a finance company.  The finance companies have a common pool of knowledge into which this information is poured but the ordinary purchaser does not realise these things.</P>
    <P>An example of the difficulty in interpreting this Bill will also be found in the third section and I urge the Minister to consider amending it.  It provides that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;registered owner&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations, 1958, but, if those regulations should be revoked, it shall have the meaning assigned to it by such regulations corresponding to those regulations as may for the time being be in force;</P>
    <P>Why have we not assigned the meaning in this Bill itself?  Other matters need tidying up, too.  If a person wants to make a claim against the Minister for Finance in respect of damage by a Government-owned mechanically-propelled vehicle we are providing that he has not to apply to the Attorney General for permission to sue the Minister for Finance. However, if damage is done by an ass and cart belonging to the Office of Public Works or by a bicycle belonging to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the person concerned must apply to the Attorney General for permission to sue the Government before he can issue the civil bill.  That situation is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>We are providing that fines, penalties and fees imposed by this Bill, or regulations made under it, may be disposed of as the Minister for <Col N="1183" /> Finance thinks fit.  We pay very heavy insurance premiums because there are so many road accidents. The good and careful driver is paying for the gross carelessness and misbehaviour of bad drivers.  It would help to keep premiums down if all fines for road traffic offences were assigned to a fund which would subsidise the general insurance fund.</P>
    <P>All our motor insurance companies are parties to the Motor Insurance Bureau which is an arrangement whereby companies will pay damages to people who suffer personal injury as a result of a collision with a mechanically-propelled vehicle which at the time of the accident was not insured provided there was a valid policy of some kind covering the vehicle in question.  That burden is borne by the insurance companies who are parties to the Bureau and, in turn, by all policy holders.  If the moneys collected in fines were assigned to support claims against the Motor Insurance Bureau, then innocent and careful drivers would be relieved to that extent of the burden they must pay at the moment by increased insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the regulations to be made with regard to the construction and equipment of vehicles. If a person has a defective vehicle and is convicted of driving it, then the offence should be endorsed on his licence.  If that vehicle is subsequently seen moving in a dangerous manner, a Garda may signal the driver to halt. He may have no reason to suspect that the vehicle is defective.  If the driver's licence is endorsed to the effect that the vehicle was defective then the Garda would realise the position immediately and cause it to be examined. If the driver was again found to be wanting in his duty in that respect, a prosecution should follow.  We need to encourage people to be careful.  An endorsement on the licence is one method of helping to bring that about. The endorsement of the licence has been one of the most beneficial things in making drivers careful, at least for the period of the endorsement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> In the same section, the Minister provides that it shall be a good defence to a charge of driving a defective vehicle for the owner to show that the use of the vehicle was unauthorised.  That seems fair enough, by and large, but suppose the owner of the defective vehicle drives it himself to some public place, leaves it parked there with the door locked or unlocked, and some other person, perhaps committing a crime, comes along and drives that vehicle. Surely some responsibility lies on the person who had that vehicle on the highway in the first place?  If any vehicle is on the public highway and found to be defective and it can be shown it was reasonable that the owner must have known it was defective, the fact that it was used at the time of an accident without the authority of the owner should not in such cases be a good defence.</P>
    <P>One of the peculiar things about the Bill is, as I have said, the different manner in which motorists and pedestrians and pedal cyclists are treated. An example of this will be found in Section 20.  Section 20, as I read it, enables a member of the Garda who observes a mechanically-propelled vehicle or combination of vehicles in a public place and suspects that there is a defect in them to inspect such vehicles and so on.  That is contained in subsection (1) of Section 20. But if you turn over the page to subsection (6), you read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may test any pedal cycle and, for the purpose of carrying out the test, may do all such things and make all such requirements in relation to the cycle as are reasonably necessary.</P>
    <P>Apparently he cannot examine a mechanically-propelled vehicle until he suspects there is a defect in it, but he can test a pedal cycle without suspecting whether there is a defect or not.  It will be very difficult for a Garda to suspect whether or not a mechanically-propelled vehicle is defective. I do not think we should have the necessity of suspicion before inspecting a mechanically-propelled vehicle.  At the same time, I appreciate <Col N="1185" /> that what the Minister had in mind was, perhaps, the possibility of a vexatious Garda deliberately halting a man a couple of times a day, day after day, to inspect a vehicle, which he could do, but for the suspicion provision. However, I think it is asking too much.  Some person might be able to thwart the inspection of a vehicle by proving to the satisfaction of the court that a Garda had no reasonable grounds for suspecting a defect, and the Garda might find himself in hot water on that account.</P>
    <P>In the case of a bicycle, and I think in the case of a mechanically-propelled vehicle, a Garda is allowed to drive the machine himself for a reasonable time and a reasonable distance in order to test it.  He may also ask that it be driven for a reasonable time and distance in such a direction as he directs.  But there is nothing whatever which entitles a Garda to make a cyclist bring his bicycle to a halt.  It may well be that halting may be included under the term &ldquo;driving&rdquo;, but if a Garda asks a pedal cyclist to drive his bicycle along the road from one lamp post to another, the cyclist may do so but the Garda would not be entitled to order him to come to a halt.  Surely, in relation to an inspection like this, what the Garda would want to find out in many cases is whether or not the bicycle had decent brakes.  Perhaps the section might be amended in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have provided, but in a very confused fashion, for consequential disqualification orders in relation to certain offences.  Unfortunately, we have confused the matter very much by mixing it up between at least 25 sections and a Schedule.  I would hope that the Minister would find some way of making this thing more easily understandable to a member of the public.  A great deal can be said in favour of consequential disqualification orders, but we should also provide for a greater number of consequential endorsement orders.  I think it would help to improve the manners of our motorists, if their licences bore an endorsement.  They <Col N="1186" /> would always be afraid of being caught in the act again and of having to expose their traffic souls to a Garda if, by production of a licence with an endorsement on it, the Garda could see they had already committed some traffic sin.  If we are providing, as we are, that a consequential disqualification order for some offence will not apply until a second or subsequent offence has been committed, we should in such cases provide that an endorsement will run as a consequence in relation to an offence before the second or subsequent offences.</P>
    <P>We provide in Section 27 for ancillary disqualification orders which simply permit a judge to disqualify a driver from driving.  The extraordinary thing in this is that we are just allowing a justice&mdash;we are not obliging him&mdash; to impose a disqualification order where a mechanically-propelled vehicle has been used in the commission of a crime.  We are confusing ourselves in regard to our moral responsibility when we impose a mandatory disqualification for some offences, but where some person commits a crime when using a mechanically-propelled vehicle, we do not compel the courts to disqualify that person from driving.</P>
    <P>We all know that the mechanically-propelled vehicle is a very useful weapon for any housebreaker or burglar.  It is also used in connection with more sordid crimes such as rape. Surely we should oblige the courts to disqualify from driving any person who uses a mechanically-propelled vehicle for his own convenience when committing a crime, whether the vehicle is his or not?  The housebreaker or burglar can remove, say, 100,000 cigarettes from a shop or factory by using a mechanically-propelled vehicle, whether it is his own or stolen.</P>
    <P>In such cases, where a car is used for theft, burglary or assault, we should oblige the court to deprive the person of a licence for a period of not less than five years.  In that way, if our burglars are going to continue their habits, they will have to walk and it will be much easier for the Garda to catch them.  A man with a <Col N="1187" /> sack containing 10,000 cigarettes on his back, who is walking along the street at a late hour of night, would give any Garda reason for suspicion; whereas a lorry, van or motor car with 100,000 cigarettes in it is not something which a Garda might reasonably suspect of being used in the commission of a crime.  Therefore, if a mechanically-propelled vehicle is used for the commission of any crime whatever, there should be a consequential disqualification order without any exceptions whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Section 52 deals with the offence of careless driving, which is sometimes used for imposing a lesser penalty than finding a man guilty of dangerous driving.  Where you have borderline cases, the courts frequently convict persons of careless driving and impose smaller fines.  Careless driving is the kind of thing which leads to dangerous driving.  It is something which leads to what we miscall accidents.  It would help to prevent careless driving if there were provision for an endorsement on the licence on conviction of careless driving.  That person would be unlikely to commit the offence again. If a man, convicted of careless driving, is fined £2, £3 or £5, the memory of the conviction is likely to pass away as soon as he has left the court room, whereas if there is an endorsement on his licence, it will arrest his attention and keep him on his toes all the time.</P>
    <P>Many of the remarks that could be made on this Bill are more appropriate to the Committee Stage.  The Minister has been extremely patient in listening to a great many detailed remarks on this Stage of the Bill.  We all hold ourselves forth as experts on road traffic.  That is one of the great problems we have.  There are very few who are humble about road traffic or the manner in which they behave on the roads.  We hope that in the future we may all be more conscious of our shortcomings on the road.</P>
    <P>The Minister provides for tests of speed on the roadway.  I am not sure what the particular section is.  We are providing for speed limits in this <Col N="1188" /> Bill.  I wonder whether speed limits would permit the Minister to make a regulation providing that on certain roads or on certain parts of a road, the speed should not fall below a fixed mileage per hour.  I am thinking of traffic in another five or ten years. We will have to have traffic lanes which will permit of a speed up to 30 miles per hour in one lane and over 30 miles per hour in others.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks yesterday evening, one of the worst menaces on the roads at the present time is the fellow who keeps to the centre of the road travelling at 30 miles an hour when he should be well in to the left.  He is the man who compels another driver to move out into the oncoming line of traffic. We will have to discourage that and if necessary, lay down that where there are four lanes of traffic, if you want to keep to 30 miles an hour, you will have to keep to the inside lane.</P>
    <P>We are today planning for road traffic for at least a decade to come. It took us 28 years&mdash;from 1933 to 1961&mdash;to do anything.  I do not believe that any member of this House expected that the problem in 1961 would be anything like it is now and we cannot forecast what it will be like in the years to come.  We have not made any provision for vehicles like hovercraft which will not be in contact with the ground, although they may well move within the hedges.  We have made no provision for contrivances of that nature&mdash;contrivances which our minds cannot imagine at the moment and the invention of which may not yet have dawned on the scientists and engineers.  We will have to review road traffic legislation time after time.  Let us hope that we will not have the same delay in the future as we have had since 1933.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious from the very interesting contribution of the last speaker that this is a Bill which is incapable of interpretation in the full sense of the word, except by a lawyer.  It seems to me that the Bill is full of technicalities and complexities of various kinds which only a man skilled in law could really <Col N="1189" /> elucidate or interpret.  The Bill has been anticipated for a long time and that long anticipation has evoked a certain interest in the Bill throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The last Road Traffic Bill was in 1933&mdash;28 years ago, as the last speaker said.  Since then, the pattern of traffic on the roads has changed completely and it is only natural that some effort should be made to bring traffic regulations into conformity with present-day requirements and present-day practices and customs.  The public are very interested in this Bill because it was prompted by the appalling increase in serious and fatal accidents over the years.</P>
      <P>When an accident occurs, there is always horror among the people who have the misfortune to witness it and among the relatives of those maimed, injured or killed.  You always hear the caustic comment: &ldquo;Why are the Government not doing something about this?  Why is there no protection for people on the roads?&rdquo;  Therefore, the people are very interested in this Bill. The more they expect, I suppose the more they look for in the Bill.  The Bill envisages certain safeguards as well as certain controls in regard to those who use mechanically-propelled vehicles on the roads.  There is nothing political whatever in the Bill.  All sides accept the need for such a Bill.  There may be differences of opinion about some of its sections but the general framework of the Bill provides the opportunity for ensuring that we will have an Act that will stand the test of time and will provide the necessary safeguards.  It will have to be very perfect, if it is to measure up to expectations and allay the fears at present entertained throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, I think all Deputies will be co-operative.  It is assumed and expected that the Minister will be equally co-operative; that any reasonable amendments will be fully discussed and that worthwhile amendments will be included in the measure which he has brought into the House. This is a most extensive Bill consisting of nine Parts, 127 sections, various subsections and innumerable subdivisions <Col N="1190" /> of these subsections.  When I read the Bill casually, I was as wise at the end as I was at the beginning.  The phrasing of the Bill is rather peculiar. The draftsmen have a certain technique of their own.  Personally, I think that there is a superfluity of words and divisions.  I think the Bill lacks directness of language and that it is couched in terms that are rather vague.  Some of the subsections themselves are rather vague.</P>
    <P>There is no possibility of making a general survey of the Bill.  We have to wait until it goes into Committee Stage when every section will be closely analysed and, I hope, fully elucidated.  We all have to agree that a good deal of litigation in our courts to-day arises from infringements of the Road Traffic Act.  There is no doubt that litigation will increase as time goes on.  It will increase because of the extra requirements now laid down in the Bill and all the extra controls provided in the Bill.  For that reason, we must ensure that there are no loopholes in it and that the law cannot be flouted in any way.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made frequently to fines and there appears to be a difference of opinion about them.  I think fines on the spot will bring the law into disrepute and disrespect.  If we adopted that system for infringements of the Road Traffic Act, people would ask: &ldquo;Why not have it for other Acts?&rdquo;  It would create a very bad impression if visitors who are not aware of our traffic code were fined. The imposition of these fines should be reserved to the courts.  I do not think it fair to ask a Guard to be judge and jury and to impose a fine on an alleged offender.  If the fines are to be enforced, at least it should be left to the local superintendent of the Garda to assess the amount of the fine and he should do that only after receiving a statement from the person involved, side by side with the report from the Garda who detected the infringement of the law.  Personally, I think we would be far better off to leave the fines to the courts.</P>
    <P>In the main, the Bill deals with licences for driving, with speed, with parking and with certificates of fitness <Col N="1191" /> for vehicles on the road.  In regard to the question of speed, we are not an easy-disciplined people and we are inclined to be reckless at times. I have seen motorists and motorcyclists drive through this city at 50 miles an hour, to the horror and amazement of onlookers.  I have seen the same thing happen in Cork when the streets were crowded.  My own conviction is that many accidents are traceable to excess speeds.  Regulations which would be generally acceptable should be made limiting the speeds in built-up areas.  The Commissioner of the Garda is empowered to make bye-laws after consultation with the local authority.  I think he should make them in conjunction with the local authority and get their approval before he brings them to the Minister.  That would help to diffuse responsibility for the bye-laws.  Through their local representatives, people will come to understand the meaning and necessity for these bye-laws.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is any provision for speed traps.  On the ordinary roads in rural Ireland we sometimes see vehicles travelling at a speed which could be characterised as reckless.  The Guards should be empowered to lay speed traps for these individuals who are only testing their own capabilities as drivers and the capabilities of their cars.  That should not be allowed on any public road. The Guards should always be empowered to have some means of checking people who travel recklessly on the roads.</P>
    <P>Parking has become one of the main problems in this country.  Local authorities can be very helpful in this regard in towns and cities where the parking problem becomes acute.  There are plenty of derelict sites which could easily be made available as parking sites with some little expenditure.  It is quite obvious that extra financial burdens will be placed on the local authorities as a result of the Bill.  They must provide parking places, weighbridges and perhaps other demands will be made on them also.  All fines collected under this Bill, while they would go to the Exchequer, should <Col N="1192" /> be credited to the local authorities and be paid back to them so that they could make provision for the various requirements mentioned in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II, Section 17, expenses of extraordinary traffic, seems very vague to me.  I do not know how that provision will be worked or whether it will be workable at all.  In the same Part, in Section 16, the statement occurs that where a police officer is suspicious of a load on a lorry he may bring the lorry to the nearest weighing station within five miles and if convenient have the load unloaded.  Why should it be unloaded at all ?  Surely if he is on duty, he will have some means of following the lorry and seeing it unloaded ?  I think there is no necessity for this inconvenience to the public through the enforcement of these regulations.</P>
    <P>In regard to the rules of the road for pedestrians, there is always confusion about them amongst the people, especially in rural areas.  I believe pedestrians walk on the right hand side at night time so that oncoming lights are reflected on them and cars coming behind see people so outlined. That is not generally known and it is because it is not known that we have so many accidents on country roads at night time.  The Safety First Association, the Automobile Association and other benevolent bodies could be very helpful in focussing attention on that. The person caught between two separate lights is in grave danger.  If he face the oncoming lights he would have some chance.</P>
    <P>This Bill while it is controversial in many sections will nevertheless do an immense amount of good.  I hope by the time it has passed through all Stages we shall have security for our road users and some confidence in the future with regard to our traffic laws.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some discussion about whether the Minister has been grossly at fault in bringing this Bill to the House only now.  While one could make a perfectly valid charge against him in that respect, there is an even more important question to be discussed in that connection.  The Bill shows clearly that <Col N="1193" /> when the Minister thought of bringing in a Traffic Bill he intended to bring in a comprehensive measure.  The delays that the introduction of a comprehensive Bull always carries are quite obvious.  The mistake the Minister made was not so much in the delay in the introduction of this comprehensive measure as in choosing to wait to take any action until he was ready to bring a full and comprehensive Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>During the four years in which he has been considering the pros and cons of the various subsidiary details which he has now incorporated in this Bill, a great deal has happened in regard to road traffic and the position has become substantially worse.  I admit frankly and freely that, so far as I am concerned, my criticism of him in that respect arises from the fact that I believe fundamentally that a vast amount of incidents arise from ignorance of what is the right thing to do.  I believe that is an overwhelming cause and that the percentage of people who deliberately take risks is very, very small indeed.  I think, therefore, it would have been infinitely preferable to have brought to the House early in 1957 a short measure dealing with only one point if that was all that was completely ready at that time&mdash;I shall not go into that argument&mdash;that is, the point of ensuring that there would be some type of tests for new drivers, a test of knowledge of the rules of the road.</P>
      <P>Every day we see throughout the country instances of what is gross, bad driving, instances of what can only be described as gross discourtesy, gross rudeness.  I do not accept and I do not believe that my country people are inherently rude and inherently lacking in courtesy.  Yet, to look at them driving vehicles along the road, if one did not consider some other aspects, one would be forced to that conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ordinary person, who would not dream of shouldering another person off the pavement if he were walking along, very often when he gets behind the wheel of a motor car in effect shoulders that motor car and pushes <Col N="1194" /> the driver of another car out of the proper lane in which he should be driving.  He does it, not from discourtesy, not from rudeness, but simply because of lack of knowledge, lack of appreciation of what he should do. The first essential towards better traffic arrangements, towards avoidance of accidents, is better education of all our people about the rules of the road, about what should be done and about what should not be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I am sure, in his home part of the country particularly, frequently looks at television emanating from the Six Counties.  Anybody who looks at television must be struck forcibly by the manner in which it has been harnessed to improve the standard of driving and to emphasise the dangers on the road and the way in which they can be overcome.  It just so happens that comparatively recently, say, in the last 12 months or so, my movements have taken me regularly through the Six Counties.  I am bound to say it has been my experience on the many occasions on which I have been there in the last 12 months that the standard of driving in the Six Counties is better than the standard of driving down here. I can only assume that that must have arisen because of the earlier introduction of driving tests there and perhaps may have been accelerated and increased because of the use that is made of television to improve the standard. Let me say in passing, if it is any balm to the Minister's soul, that while it has been my experience that their standard of driving is better, I would say the standard of our roads is better than theirs.</P>
    <P>It is an undoubted fact that more dislocation of traffic&mdash;and dislocation of traffic is one of the primary causes of accidents&mdash;arises because of drivers doing the unexpected than from anything else.  Mostly, drivers do the unexpected because they do not realise that, in doing that, they are likely not just to cause inconvenience to other people but to cause positive danger to other people.  It does not seem to be appreciated at all that a lane of traffic is a thing that should be adhered to and that if one intends to move out of one's lane, one should do so only after <Col N="1195" /> giving reasonable and courteous notice to the other users of the road.  The manner in which a person drives along the middle of the road and perhaps just slightly on the left centre of the road, thinking that he is doing all that he should do and is behaving as a good driver, is quite phenomenal.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will ensure, in any development of new roads particularly, that there will be laid down on those roads white lines for guiding lanes of traffic, not merely a single white line dividing the left-hand side from the right-hand side of the road. Personally, I have little use for those. The proper system in that respect is the Continental system where you have a treble white line or a double white line, as the case may be.  There are white lines on many of our roads in circumstances in which, when one is going in one direction, it is criminally dangerous to cross over the line and the same line is an impediment to the proper flow of traffic from the other direction.  That is inevitable as long as the single line system is used. On the Continent they use a white line which has a double edge on one side and it is a criminal offence to pass over it, but if the double edge is not on your side of the road, so to speak, then it is the equivalent of what we call the dotted white line, which is the warning line and not an absolute prohibition.</P>
    <P>In relation to road traffic, as in everything else, the aim must be to enact a series of laws which the people will recognise, realise, understand and appreciate are necessary laws and which for that reason should be obeyed.  So long as it appears in certain circumstances that a white line on a road at a particular point is useless and unnecessary then that white line will be disregarded and that will not merely affect traffic regulation at that point but will mean that there will be disregard of signals and of signs in other places where danger exists.</P>
    <P>Let me also mention in passing in that connection one thing I have seen far too often on our roads.  There is a <Col N="1196" /> dangerous bend sign on a road.  New road works are carried out.  The dangerous bend is removed but the dangerous bend sign remains.  That only creates disregard for that type of sign where it is met in other places.  That type of carelessness in the road authority failing to remove signs does not encourage the good driving sense that is necessary.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies and, indeed, people outside also, have mentioned that in this Bill there are certain mandatory penalties provided for certain offences. I want to say as strongly as I can that the provision of fixed mandatory penalties in any legislation is a bad thing. The conviction of a person no matter in what walk of life he may be is the same but the penalty on a person in one walk of life may be entirely different in its severity from the same kind of penalty imposed on another in a different walk.</P>
    <P>The easiest case to understand is the case of the lorry driver and the case of the rich person, both of whom have been convicted for traffic offences.  It is possible for the rich person to pay a chauffeur but, if the lorry driver loses his licence, he cannot maintain his wife or his family.  To say that the standard penalty should be the same in each case is to mean in effect that the penalty on the person driving the lorry, and who is thereby earning his livelihood, is infinitely more severe than on the person who drives merely for pleasure.  Fixed statutory penalties always mean grave inequality in the imposition of a penalty.  It would be far better that the extent of the penalty be left to the discretion of the Court so that the Court could determine what would be a suitable penalty to impose on the person concerned having regard to his circumstances and to the offence in question.</P>
    <P>It is my experience that if you make a minimum penalty of great severity then you make it harder to secure a conviction.  It is natural, it is human, that if there is a very severe minimum penalty for the offence in question the result is to make the judge hearing the case feel that he must be even more than normally certain before he imposes <Col N="1197" /> that conviction which compulsorily will carry with it a penalty of great severity.  None of us under any circumstances wants to do anything that will, for example, mean that lighter penalties will be inflicted on those who have been properly convicted of being drunk in charge of a vehicle on the roads but by fixing a severe statutory penalty, as in this Bill, the Minister is running the risk that it will be harder and harder to get convictions and, in consequence, the result of including these statutory penalties will be to minimise their deterrent effect rather than to create a greater deterrent as the Minister himself intends.</P>
    <P>That has been the experience of all practitioners in court in relation to any type of offence but particularly that must be the case where there is very much more room for the exercise of judgement and opinion, as in road traffic cases, than in other cases.  It is very often purely a matter of personal judgement whether in any accident the course the defendant was adopting was the right course or not.  It is a matter that it is very hard to determine. One takes a different view in the ordinary road traffic case than one does in the case where it is a question whether the accused person did or did not steal a certain article.  There is, first of all, the conflict of evidence as to what actually happened; secondly there is the conflict as to what is the right thing to do in the circumstances.  The imposition willy-nilly by the court of a very severe minimum penalty means that the court will lean towards acquittal more than it would in other circumstances, and the Minister may find that the effect of dealing with the matter in that way will be the reverse of what he intends.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I believe one of the essential things we should do was to introduce a code that would have universal support and therefore universal acceptance, thereby making it possible to keep it in effect.  That is the only reason that prevents me, and I imagine has prevented the Minister from advocating compulsory dipping of lights at night.  Such a law would be <Col N="1198" /> utterly impossible to enforce.  When a person has been blinded by lights coming against him, when the other car has gone past, there is no possible way of tracing who it is and even if one did turn round and give chase, by that time it would be too late to catch him.  However, that does not mean that the Minister is excused from providing that the manufacturer of motor vehicles will provide satisfactory dipping devices so that at least motorists would be encouraged in that way.  In certain cars these devices are not always very comfortably placed.  As far as I know, there is nothing in any statute or regulation or in this Bill&mdash;and I freely admit to the Minister he might easily catch me out in having missed something in this Bill, having regard to its length and scope&mdash;which provides that it is compulsory for a mechanically propelled vehicle to have a dimming apparatus in working order.  If I am right in that, something should be included. One of the things we ought to do in relation to the type of user, which we cannot enforce because of the difficulty of enforcement, is to provide that the mechanism will be there to the hand of the driver so that it will be as easy as possible for him to utilise it and so that the encouragement to go on the right course will be there the whole time.</P>
    <P>I have heard suggestions made that one of the things the Minister should do in this Bill in order to prevent accidents is to provide that there must be a compulsory excess of £25 on every insurance policy when there is an accident.  I think there is something to be said for that.  If people knew that if they had an accident, no matter whether the insurance company was going to pay for it or not, the insurance company would by law be bound to provide thereafter that the person must bear the first £25 of any accident, it would act as a certain deterrent and would, I think, have the effect of bringing down the cost of motor insurance premiums for good and careful drivers.</P>
    <P>I know the position in regard to motor insurance premiums by reason of my avocation.  I have always felt, in that respect, that the cure is to increase motor insurance and to <Col N="1199" /> increase very substantially the no-claim bonus and so, not merely to ensure that the charge for the careful driver keeping his car on the road would be small, but that the driver would be more careful knowing that if he had an accident, be it ever so small, it would involve his insurance company in a claim and it would mean a substantially greater premium in the future.</P>
    <P>The extension to a much greater degree of the no-claim bonus would be extremely useful in regard to the road traffic code quite apart from the cost of insurance of a careful person. The suggestion I have heard of a compulsory excess of £25 per accident is another way of ensuring that the careful driver can get the benefit of motor insurance and that the person who is reckless carries the expense of the accidents in which he is involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manley referred to Section 17, which I think is a dreadful section. First of all, it is a section that should not be included without some appeal and, secondly, some attempt should be made to define &ldquo;excessive.&rdquo;  As I understand it, it means that if the local authority decides that a particular firm is using the road too much, the authority is entitled to go to court and get a decree for the extra cost it says is involved.  So far as I can make out from the phraseology it will not be a reserved function but a managerial function.  We know, in the nature of things, that there would be from time to time differences of opinion between some heavy users of roads and officials of the local authority, perhaps differences actually in regard to tenders for the supply of road materials and to put a power such as is included in Section 17 in the hands of the local authority without any appeal, seems to be quite unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>There should be an opportunity for the person or firm concerned to appeal against the damage caused by so-called excessive weight.  I can visualise circumstances in which it is desirable to have a prohibition on carrying tremendous weights over parts of roads and bridges; industrial machinery or <Col N="1200" /> machinery for E.S.B. generation works is something that comes to mind as one occasionally meets it on the road. The section is not phrased to cover the unusual damage caused by a particular load of exceptional weight and severity.  It is phrased to cover the ordinary working of a firm using heavy vehicles.  I do not think that is right; I think the appropriate way of coping with a situation like that is to provide that the authority should have the right to say that a load in excess of a certain weight cannot be carried on this road because the road is not fit to take it, rather than that there should be the opportunity for personal assessment of an excess as is provided in Section 17.</P>
    <P>Section 78 (1) (e) is carried into this Bill by Section 76 and I want to put a question of principle to the Minister in regard to that section.  It seems that in the old Road Traffic Act and in this Bill now, that provision is asking an insurer to investigate criminal proceedings, to investigate circumstances in which in the opinion of the insurers there should be criminal proceedings but there are not.  Surely the question of whether there have been criminal proceedings and their outcome, is a matter for the forces of the State and not for investigation by private individuals, private companies such as the insurers.  It is totally undesirable that the responsibility of investigating criminal proceedings should be put upon insurers in that way.</P>
    <P>Equally, the old Section 174 of the 1933 Road Traffic Act was a very unsatisfactory section.  It dealt with the reimbursement of hospitals in connection with motor accidents.  The different approaches by one insurance company and another to that section, by one local authority and another to the obligations of the section, showed how unsatisfactory the position is and has been, and I am not satisfied that Section 119 of this Bill is going to make the situation any better.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might also suggest that we might develop here a system of motor car insurance such as they have in Sweden, where the premium is related to the distance driven, the age <Col N="1201" /> of the licence holder, and the car engine output.  In consequence, the person who uses his car very little does not have to pay the same insurance premium as the person who drives a great deal.  I gather that the average there is taken as the person who drives between 6,000 and 15,000 miles per year.  That is about the average.  The person who drives less than that has to pay a smaller premium; those who drive more have to pay a surcharge. The reduction in the case of those who use cars very little can, I believe, amount to as much as 20 per cent. That is one of the things we should, I think, consider here.</P>
    <P>There is ground for a provision in this Bill that where anybody is an accessory before the fact of another using an uninsured vehicle, he can be sued by the injured party.  That is being done on the other side of the water.  The person who knowingly permits and actively assists another to drive an uninsured car should bear just as much moral responsibility for any accident that occurs as the actual driver of the car, particularly in view of the fact that the injured person cannot recover against the uninsured driver.  Very often, when there is an accident, there is a good deal of evasion as to who in fact was driving. If it were known that it did not matter who was driving, that anybody who had been an accessory before the fact would be equally liable to the injured party, it would help considerably.</P>
    <P>I suppose this Bill is hardly the measure on which to discuss whether or not it is desirable to continue trial by jury in relation to civil actions.  In my view, there is a great deal to be said for a change in the case of civil actions to a judge alone hearing and determining the claim.  There is a great deal to be said from another point of view also, but we will have an opportunity of discussing this aspect on the next item of business to-day. I refer to the difficulty imposed by jury service on the rate paying public. I can visualise tremendous difficulty in providing any system of payment commensurate with what a juror may lose. From the point of view of the juror, therefore, the only course is to move <Col N="1202" /> towards determination by the specialist who is paid by the State, namely, the judge alone.  I am not talking of criminal cases now.  In criminal cases, a very different issue is involved.  All of us will agree that it is essential to retain the jury system in such cases.</P>
    <P>In relation to road traffic cases, there is a great deal to be considered from the point of view of whether it might not be better to adopt the other system and drop the jury system, to have liability determined by a judge alone, and damages equally determined by him.  Frankly, I am not quite clear on whether that would come within the scope of this Bill.  It can, however, fall within the ambit of the Bill in considering the difficulties that arise as a result of road traffic accidents.  Whether my suggestion should be included in this Bill or in a separate measure is a matter upon which I am not prepared to be in any way definite.  It is, however, one which we should further consider.</P>
    <P>I saw a reference in a speech recently wherein it was implied that the vast majority of accidents which come to the courts are caused by good drivers taking unjustifiable risks.  From that, an effort was made to draw the conclusion that the vast number of accidents are caused by persons who are good and skilled drivers.  It is not for me to comment on whether or not the first part of that statement is correct. Personally, I do not think it is, but I am not sufficiently experienced to state definitely.  I am told by others who are experienced that it is not true to say that the vast number of accidents that go to the courts are caused by good or skilled drivers taking chances.  But, even if it were true, it would be nonsense to draw the conclusion that the same premise holds good for all accidents.</P>
    <P>An enormous number of accidents arise through stupidity and bad driving. Insurance companies will tell you that those accidents are settled at once because the company concerned knows that there is not the slightest chance of defending an action and the sooner they get out of liability, the better.  The only cases that go to court are those in which there is some doubt as to <Col N="1203" /> liability and doubt as to liability arises almost invariably because of the possibility of saying that the driving of the person involved is good and he therefore avoided the unforeseen and unforeseeably bad driving of the other party.  Sometimes, of course, the evidence conflicts but it is because in three-quarters of the cases <i>prima facie</i> the insurance company regards the driving of the insured as being good that the case goes to court at all.  Otherwise, the company admits negligence and fights only on the issue of the amount of damages.</P>
    <P>To draw an analogy from the statement that it is the type of case in which the good driver is involved that goes to court, because the good driver was taking chances, is to draw an unreal and nonsensical analogy.  I do not think we can stress often enough that accidents are caused primarily by the other person doing something unforeseen. Sometimes we may be wrong in not foreseeing.  If one sees a child on the road, one should assume that the child may not behave in a rational way.  There are occasions, however, on which people act without giving any indication in sufficient time as to what they intend to do.  They give no warning at all to other users of the road and, in 99 cases out of 100, the person concerned is blissfully unaware that he has done anything wrong.  That is the appalling part of it, the frightening part of it.</P>
    <P>We see an amount of bad driving on the roads and the drivers concerned do not realise they are bad drivers.  The frightening part of it is that it is the cause of accidents.  Therefore, as I said in the beginning, it is essential to get the education of our drivers on the right lines in relation to the traffic code itself&mdash;and where people are proven to be bad drivers, they should be made take a test&mdash;and in relation to new drivers coming on the roads. Unless that is done, the problem will get worse and worse every year, and year after year, we will come up against more difficulties and problems with which we shall be unable to cope.</P>
    <P>When we see a driver driving on the <Col N="1204" /> left centre of the road, or the middle of the road, and say: &ldquo;That man is driving dreadfully badly,&rdquo; some people think you are just being fussy or that you are anxious to get on in a hurry yourself, but I wonder has the additional cost that driver is putting on the community ever struck those people? If everyone drove on the left side of the road, a great number of our roads would be quite satisfactory as they are at present, without the expenditure of more money on them.  People do not drive on the left side of the road; they drive on the left centre of the road, leaving a large amount of unused road space on their left, road space which costs a substantial amount of money. If people drove on the left and gave a signal before pulling out to the left centre of the road, many of our roads would be quite satisfactory as they are, and would not require the expenditure of vast sums of money, such as are visualised as being necessary, having regard to the standard of our driving.</P>
    <P>I do not believe our people, as a whole, are as ignorant, as irresponsible, as discouteous and as rude, as one would gather they are on seeing them behind the wheels of cars.  They just do not know, and it is the job of the Minister to ensure that they are adequately educated, and that the right way to drive a vehicle is brought home to them, and to pedestrians who walk out against a traffic light, or go against the flow of traffic.  Television, modern advertising, everything must be utilised towards that end.  Unless they are utilised in an attempt to improve the education of those who drive, no Road Traffic Bill will provide any real solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note that there has been a general welcome for the Bill, with certain qualifications, which were to be expected on a measure which is undoubtedly rather controversial. Many of the matters raised can be dealt with more readily, and will be dealt with more fully, on Committee Stage.  For that reason, I shall not at this stage reply to all the points raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, a number of points on which some clarification <Col N="1205" /> might now be of some help.  I hope to give an elucidation of some of the matters which I feel will be helpful, and of benefit to the members who raised them, and to members of the House in general.  Before doing so, I should like to refer to the suggestions and the absurd claims from the Opposition Benches, which I had hoped would not have been made.  I shall refer to them now in the hope that there will not be any more references to the matter.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed that this Bill was long delayed, and that it was four years coming forward from the point which it is alleged to have reached under the previous Government, and that a draft Bill was there to my hand when I went to the Department.  At no stage was there a draft Bill available to me.  There were heads of a Bill agreed on by the previous Government, and in so far as those heads go, I want to give all credit to that Government for whatever was contained in them.  Once and for all, I want to make it quite clear that it was the heads of a Bill agreed on by the Government, and not a draft Bill, which were available.</P>
    <P>I enumerated the various changes in them in reply to a Question by Deputy McGilligan yesterday, and there is evidence of how much further detailed work and drafting had to be done before the Bill could see the light.  I hope we will forget about that aspect of the matter and stop making these charges, which are not well-founded and I hope we will approach the Bill in the manner in which I feel it must be approached, if we are to have an effective Bill. There must be co-operation from all sides of the House in trying to make it a better Bill than it is now, so that it will be a better Act than Bill.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that any and every amendment and suggestion proposed by any member will get the fullest and most complete consideration possible from my Department and myself.  Full consideration will be given to every aspect.  I want to make an appeal to all sides of the House to approach the Bill in that way, because without that type of contribution, I do not think we can get the job done.  We cannot get the type of Bill we all desire if there are arguments about the <Col N="1206" /> Bill being delayed for four years, that it was prepared by the previous Government, that I had nothing to do with it and did nothing except delay it for four years.  I hope at this stage that we can regard that aspect of the matter closed, because it would be better for the final form of the Bill if that were so.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the issue of enforcement.  Some urged very rigid enforcement of the proposals in this measure; others favoured a rather lax approach to some of the matters in the Bill; and there was a middle group who felt we should take a middle course and, in the general run, were in favour of neither laxity nor absolute ruthlessness.  I can only say in this regard that enforcement is not a matter for my Department.  I do not wish to tell other Departments or other agencies of State or other people how to do their job.  We hope to lay down a framework within which they will carry out the enforcement.  I shall pass on the various suggestions to the Minister for Justice for transmission to the Garda authorities.  I had an assurance from the Minister for Justice during the preparation of this Bill that enforcement will properly and fully be carried out by the Garda.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke of employing non-police personnel for enforcement &mdash;particularly, I take it, in the city and built-up areas&mdash;in connection with somewhat minor offences.  He made a very good plea on two grounds.  In particular, he felt, possibly with reason, that, as our controls become more widespread, intervention by the Garda may tend to undermine the happy relations that exist between them and the public.  In some cities in other countries, due to the enforcement of minor safety matters, the harmony and co-operation the police enjoyed for years with the public suffered a setback. There may be a danger inherent in this Bill that the Garda may lose the good feeling which exists between them and the public and which has been built up over the years.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the recruitment of non-police personnel for this type of work was not introduced for the reason Deputy Dillon suggests.  The <Col N="1207" /> system was introduced into Britain because recruitment to the police force there had become rather difficult.  Non-police personnel were introduced to complement the available police recruits.  That situation does not arise to such a degree in this country.  I am doubtful if we would take kindly to a new type of law enforcement group, even if they were confined to traffic and infringements of a minor nature. I do not envisage that the Garda will be so active by reason of this Bill as to become the bane of the everyday life of the people and thereby lose their respect and co-operation.  I should be sorry to think that such a state of affairs would come about.</P>
    <P>Almost every Deputy mentioned the power to make regulations.  Some understood the need for it but others were critical of the general principle of making law by regulation.  I mentioned this matter in my opening speech.  I hoped that my comments would explain the reason for the situation. However, it has been queried. We are not taking the power to make regulations lightly or for the sake of giving power to the Minister for Local Government to make regulations and to regiment and drill the people into his way of thinking.  Rather is the power being taken because of the pattern of changing circumstances.  To attempt to write into the Bill what we want now might require amendment in a few years' time.  On every occasion on which amendment of the Bill became necessary, the matter would have to be brought into this House and such emendation would tend still further to confuse our understanding of the law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish instanced the situation in Britain where regulations in regard to traffic laws may get the prior approval of the Government.  I understand that the three recent Road Traffic Acts in Britain contain many powers to make regulations and that only in respect of a very limited number is prior Parliamentary approval sought or desired.  Not all the regulations are subject to prior approval.</P>
    <P>Any and all of the regulations made under this Bill are subject to annulment <Col N="1208" /> by the Oireachtas.  While we may not come along to get prior approval for any of these regulations, each and every one of them will be subject to annulment by the Oireachtas after they have been made.  From that point of view, the powers of this House are being fully maintained so far as is practicable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett queried the terms of the provisions of Section 5.  Those terms are exactly similar to the forms used in such provisions in other Acts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheldon suggested the establishment of a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad to consider all road traffic regulations.  I am not clear what his intention was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a similar committee, I think, dealing with Statutory Orders, which was set up by the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  First, let me say it seems strange that we should have a special committee to deal with the orders and regulations under this one Act.  Why should we not have a special committee to deal with the regulations prescribed under all Acts? As the Leader of the Opposition has mentioned, there is in existence a Seanad Committee which does just the type of work Deputy Sheldon has referred to, and does it in relation to all the various regulations.  At the moment, no clear case appears to have been made for a special joint committee to deal with the regulations under this Act, but possibly the Deputy may make such a case on other Stages of the Bill.  At the same time, we have a committee doing the type of work which, I think, Deputy Sheldon intended should be done by the committee he suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon stated that all regulations made under the Bill should be codified at the end of each year.  While this suggestion is one that would naturally appeal to all Deputies, it is not practicable in the circumstances. These regulations will deal with different subjects and are not necessarily suitable for codification as a group.  This work would take a considerable <Col N="1209" /> time and would, therefore, divert energies from the more urgent task of implementing the Act.  I would remind the Deputy and the House that a summary of the law on road traffic, including current regulations, is published from time to time in <i>Rules of the Road</i>.  In addition, the annual report of the Department contains a description of the road traffic regulations and the bye-laws made each year.  I will, however, consider the feasibility of having a full list of all current regulations published each year, with some helpful notes.  For the moment, I feel the House will accept that situation and that the information available to them under the existing three heads should give them a reasonable opportunity of being fully aware of what is in the regulations at any given time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish raised the issue of prior consultation with affected interests before making regulations.  I can assure the House straight away that I would be very unwise if I did not take the greatest possible care to consult the interests affected by regulations in so far as it is possible and practicable to do so; but I do not think it would be possible to give the undertaking Deputy Corish asked, that there would be an absolute obligation on me to consult all those affected by the making of all regulations.  It would merely cause delay and waste of time; and, perhaps, nobody would be satisfied when we were finished. In so far as is practicable, I certainly intend to consult the interests concerned, so long as that does not involve a multiplicity of interests resulting in such an expenditure of time that it would not be feasible to carry out the proposal.</P>
    <P>Anxiety was expressed by a number of Deputies about the time that will elapse before all of this Bill is brought into operation.  If they will study my introductory speech, they will see that a considerable portion of this Bill is to be brought into force straight away, that is, on the enactment of the Bill by the Oireachtas.  The remainder will come into operation as quickly as the necessary preliminary steps, including the making of regulations, can be taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> A number of points made by Deputies related to matters appropriate for consideration when regulations are being made.  That is particularly true of Section 11.  Their suggestions will be noted and carefully considered.  As is always the case, some points related to matters appropriate to other legislation and not to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I noted with some pleasure that Deputies in general, and for various reasons, favour the introduction of a driving test.  Deputy O'Donnell asked what the scope of the test will be. The Bill itself makes it clear that the test will cover not merely competence to drive but also a knowledge of the rules of the road.  I think that answers a few Deputies who raised various points on that aspect of the test.  The competence test will be primarily concerned with safe driving and will take account of one's duties to other road users.  That will be an important point in these tests&mdash;the regard the driver displays in the test towards other road users.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins suggested that the test might be extended to persons convicted of certain offences, and as was indicated in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill, this can be done under Section 42, and will be considered.  The courts will have power to require a person disqualified from driving to undergo a test.  That discretion will be theirs in all cases not specifically mentioned in the Bill. Deputy Corish asked about the machinery for testing.  A final decision on this, whether it will be under the Garda or some licensing authority, has not yet been taken.  If it should come to be done by the licensing authorities, the making of appointments of testers will follow the usual procedure.  Qualifications and salary are to be fixed and a competition will be held.  At this stage I do not want to and, in fact, I cannot commit myself as to the details which are at the moment being examined in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish and, I think, some other Deputies later, inquired as to the classes of vehicles to which driving tests would apply.  There will, of course, be carry-over provisions for existing drivers but the intention for a <Col N="1211" /> new driver is that his licence will cover only the class of vehicle in respect of which he has passed a test.  A new driver will be permitted to drive only the class of vehicle in respect of which he will have passed the test.</P>
    <P>That does not mean, of course, that a separate test will be required for every type of vehicle.  For instance, a test for the driving of a truck or lorry could and would cover the driving of a private car, but not necessarily, as the House will understand, the driving of a motor cycle.  The same test would not clearly be suitable in such an instance.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the age limit for the driving of tractors; in other words, the age at which persons may get a licence to drive various mechanically-propelled vehicles.  Some suggest that 16 years is too high, that it should be less and that they should be allowed to drive at possibly 15 years of age.  There was also the suggestion in regard to tractors that the age of 16 was an undue hardship on the farming community in so far as the members of their families are concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be in the best interests of road safety to reduce below 16 years the age at which a person may first qualify for a licence. Instances, I am sure, will be quoted, perhaps even within the knowledge of some of the members now listening to me where somebody under 16 years of age could, in fact, be said to be likely to be capable and fully capable but, after all, 16 years is quite a young age for the giving of a licence to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle, and for accepting the responsibility which the holding of such a licence entails, not to speak of reducing it below that level.  While you might, in some instances, have quite capable drivers under that age, there is no doubt that we must surely increase the possibility of having quite a number who would not be capable or would not have the sense of responsibility which would entitle them to inflict themselves and the danger of their driving on the general public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> I can only say this&mdash;I feel it must be said again and again; my belief is absolute in this matter&mdash;that there are few more dangerous vehicles in the hands of a young person than a tractor.  The danger has been brought to the point at which it exists by virtue of the fact that the people in the country are inclined to look on the tractor with the same disregard as they had for the horse in its day, which horse, perhaps, had more sense in many cases than many of the people who were left to care for it.  In other words, you could have the farm horse which was older than some of the children left in charge of it.  In fact, as I say, in many cases the horse could take the young person home rather than the young person take the horse home.  I am rather inclined to think that was carried over into the machine age of the tractor on the farm to-day.  Little regard is had in many cases to the deplorable accidents we read of and to the inherent dangers in a farm tractor.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that a young chap may use this tractor in the fields with very great skill.  He may use it to till the land and work the farm, but that in itself is not a sound argument for allowing that person, no matter how tender may be his years, on the public road.  When he is on the farm, he is on his own land and if he is going to do any damage, he is likely to damage no one but himself; but that is no reason for allowing persons of a more tender age than 16 years on the public road, with possible danger to the public.  In my estimation, there is very great danger in the driving of farm tractors, particularly tractors with trailers.  They are dangerous machines and are not easily handled, in spite of the apparent ease with which they may be handled.  They are not as easily controlled as we are led to believe.</P>
    <P>What these young people may do on their father's farm is one thing, but to permit them to go on the public road, on the basis of a lower age qualification, is another.  I do not think it would be a wise departure at this juncture and possibly it may not be wise at any point.  That matter, like <Col N="1213" /> many others in the Bill, is one upon which further views will be expressed. While I have given my own view, I still have an open mind&mdash;a mind open to conviction, to a change if such a change can be brought about by a good argument in favour of this, but I do not think that is likely to happen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell enquired as to the need for signing a driving licence and suggested it was too minor a provision to put in the Bill and thought that it might be a case to be dealt with by regulation.  Again, there are many matters which some members of the House feel we should not have dealt with by regulation; that as many as we could honestly put in the Bill and not leave to regulation, we should try to put in.  On balance, we felt this was one which would be more appropriately put into the Bill.  That is what we intend to do.  During the transition period, that is, from the coming into effect of the terms of the Bill, in relation to driving licences and testing for licences for certain categories stated, licences will require to be signed for identification of the holder.  This is really the reason for this provision.</P>
    <P>It may well be that in time to come, when we have reached the point where all will have been tested who are subject to these tests, the old licence will disappear.  There will undoubtedly be a period in between during which the present type of licence, with the signature as a means of identification of the holder, will have to continue to operate. Really that is the bone of contention in this section.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked about the physical and mental conditions which will render a person disqualified from applying for a driving licence.  If I may, I shall refer again to the fact that, in the explanatory memorandum, as circulated, this matter is dealt with pretty fully. Deputy Corish on the same subject asked who would be the final judge in such matters and the answer is that the final judge in these matters will be the courts.  The procedure envisaged is that a person will be required to say whether he suffers from such defects. If he says &ldquo;No&rdquo; and has in fact these defects, he will be subject to prosecution and conviction on this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> Deputy Corish also referred to the fact that a member of the Garda need not hold a driving licence.  This, I may say, merely puts the Garda Siochána in the same position as the Army under the Defence Acts.  The Commissioner, of course, will ensure that members of the Garda Síochána who are required to drive vehicles will be properly trained, &ldquo;properly trained and tested&rdquo; is the procedure at the moment, I understand.  It is for that reason that we do not require a Guard to hold a driving licence in the ordinary way that applies to the rest of our population.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy referred to the onus of proof in Section 38.  I would just say that the law would be unenforceable without it, in view of a fairly recent Supreme Court decision.  Perhaps we can deal with this point, and I think we will deal with it much more fully, on Committee Stage.  Again, the same Deputy inquired if the case for remission of driving licence disqualification would no longer be submitted to the Minister for Justice.  The answer is that, in future, such remissions will be granted only by the courts.</P>
    <P>Different views were expressed in regard to the provisions relating to consequential disqualification.  I think it is generally agreed that disqualification is probably the most effective penalty for road traffic offences.  Yet some Deputies, including Deputy Dillon and Deputy Lemass, were concerned about the consequences of disqualification. I must say I was impressed by their arguments but I was also convinced by other arguments long before, arguments with which the House generally agrees, that this consequential disqualification is an effective penalty.  We do want effectiveness in regard to offences for which consequential disqualification is prescribed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that you just cannot have it both ways.  We are going to have the effective penalty of disqualification, following on certain serious offences.  We cannot have the benefit of that, while, at the same time, giving more regard to the actual effects under this provision of disqualification. We either have the effective penalty of <Col N="1215" /> disqualification or, if we want to depart from that, we will lose its effectiveness. That is the way I feel about it&mdash; and I think there are quite a number in the House who feel likewise&mdash;while at the same time, I accept that the arguments put by the two Deputies were convincing, if taken in isolation. However, we cannot take these matters in isolation.  They are completely bound up and the matter is one which at this stage, and subject to any further convincing arguments that may be made on Committee Stage, I am prepared to let stand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan, who actually favours this consequential disqualification, even went so far as to say that we should extend it.  That, of course, is the opposite view, and it is natural that we should get such a wide variation of views, regardless of which side of the House they may come from.  It is the type of matter that will provoke all sorts of conflicting views.  Deputy Ryan felt that we should apply this consequential disqualification not merely to the second and third offences but to first offences.  I should like to remind the House that consequential disqualification would apply to the first offences only in the case of driving while under the influence of drink and in certain cases of dangerous driving, that is, dangerous driving which results in death or serious bodily harm.  For other serious driving offences&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Consequential disqualification will apply only to the second offence, and for minor offences only to the third offence committed within the same 12 months period.  That should be borne in mind, because, when talking about minor offences, we are inclined to feel that minor offences should be treated as would apparently befit a minor offence.  What is really of significance, however, is the habitual minor offender, one who undoubtedly needs to be corrected.  If he continues to be a habitual offender in the sense of having three minor offences marked up against him within the same 12 months, then I do not think you can treat that in the context of a person committing a number of minor offences.</P>
      <P>Taking him in that light, as a habitual offender, the sooner he is corrected of the habit of committing minor offences, the less likelihood there is that he will fall into more serious error, with dangerous or harmful consequences to some members of the public.  Therefore, this provision for the third offence within 12 months is a good provision and will be of very definite use as far as the habitual, could-not-care-less type of offender is concerned, who has no regard for others in the community and who does not comprehend that his small offences may be quite an annoyance and may even be the cause of more serious happenings than he might envisage.  If we can curb that type of offender, so much the better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne inquired if a booklet could be issued to every new driver setting out the rules of the road.  In reply to that, every new driver does in fact get a booklet when he receives his licence.  If he does not, he should, and my information is that he does.  Deputy Blowick wondered if a special leaflet could be got out for tractor drivers. This matter will be given consideration by my Department and I shall tell the Deputy at a later stage the results of that consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points were raised about vehicle testing.  Deputy Moloney, who has some considerable experience in these matters, felt that the testing <Col N="1217" /> should apply to vehicles irrespective of age.  Deputy Carroll made a suggestion on somewhat similar lines.  I want to say to the House in regard to these suggestions of these two Deputies that there is power to do this, but I feel that in the beginning, at any rate, this system will apply only to old cars as a start.  We cannot envisage complete overall vehicle testing starting at a given date, but we can start by doing the obvious, that is, by starting with the older ones which are more likely to have defects.  That is not denying, as has been alleged here, that there are cars which could be regarded as being in the vintage class which are in much better mechanical condition than are some that may be only a year or two old; that all depends on the care and maintenance which a car receives rather than its actual age.  That is quite true and I do not disagree with it.  Neither does the intention that the test will apply, in the first instance at any rate, to the older vehicles conflict with my belief that the younger cars may also require these tests, but one has to take the practical view of it and start where it is logical to start, that is, with the older cars.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked if C.I.E. vehicles would be exempt.  They will be.  Concerns such as C.I.E., not necessarily only C.I.E., will be exempt only if they satisfy me that their own internal arrangements for testing are satisfactory.  If we find they are not, they will not be exempted any more than anyone else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moloney also raised the question of roadworthiness.  He suggested that there should be a penalties clause in the Bill for the sale of unroadworthy vehicles.  This has been considered but it was decided that it would not be possible to get a workable solution.  I understand that the British provision on those lines has not proved to be very effective.  The testing system that I have mentioned should, in part at any rate, deal with vehicles that are not roadworthy, which Deputy Moloney would like to see brought under the heel of the law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moloney also referred to the provisions of Section 114 regarding <Col N="1218" /> excessive periods of driving.  This section replaces the 1933 Act provisions which so far as I know have not been questioned by the trade unions.  I should say that this is a matter which might more appropriately be raised with the Minister for Industry and Commerce who has power to make regulations varying the periods provided trade unions and employees agree and I think it is not quite appropriate for discussion on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the provisions of Section 20, which gives the Garda power to forbid the use of a dangerously defective vehicle.  He questioned the absence of appeal to the court.  I am considering an amendment to the section which may cover Deputy Barrett's point.</P>
    <P>While most Deputies welcomed the provisions in regard to speed limits, some Deputies queried the figure of 30 miles per hour.  The speed limit of 30 miles per hour, which is the limit being laid down in the Bill to apply to our cities and towns, is the same figure as has been adopted in other countries and is the speed at which, according to the experts, the maximum flow is achieved in densely trafficked roads in built-up areas.  It is on the basis of that information that we have come in here with a figure of 30 miles per hour rather than 20, 25, 35 or 40.  That speed limit is used in a number of European countries and the evidence generally&mdash;and I say &ldquo;generally&rdquo; designedly&mdash;shows that it reduces accidents both as to number and severity.</P>
    <P>As will be understood from the Bill, there is power to fix a higher level if experience shows that to be advisable. A speed limit of, say, 40 miles an hour can be fixed on approach roads under the special Section 46, so that while we have the general overall speed limit of 30 miles per hour laid down more or less as our basis, departures can be made from that under special sections in the Bill to meet special circumstances in any given case.</P>
    <P>On this question of insurance cover, I feel some Deputies have misunderstood the position.  Compulsory passenger insurance will be required for <Col N="1219" /> such classes of vehicles as will be specified by regulation.  I have indicated that this will apply to all public service vehicles and, most likely, to all private cars including hire drive vehicles, in the first instance.  I am glad that the Deputies who have spoken favoured this approach.  Even having regard to the repercussions that the extension of the insurance cover may have in certain directions, nevertheless, the Deputies who mentioned the matter did come down in favour of the extension of passenger cover.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish suggested relating the insurance cover to the motor tax period but it is fairly clear on examination that for administrative reasons this would not be feasible.  You just cannot tie in the insurance business with the motor tax business and that is, in effect, what we would be asking if we were to adopt the suggestion.</P>
    <P>There has been a fair number of suggestions in regard to compulsory insurance.  Of course, like the 1933 Act, the Bill provides for compulsory insurance, but leaves it to the vehicle owners to effect the insurance with companies operating commercially.</P>
    <P>General complaints about the level of insurance rates have been made here.  I agree with the view expressed &mdash;and believe it would be in the interests not only of the driver with the good record but would also help from the point of view of road safety &mdash;that the dice should be loaded against those who cause the damage which brings about the payment of big claims by the insurance companies and, on the other hand, that compensation by way of a greater no-claim bonus should be given to the driver with the long safe record.  There is a lot to commend that approach and, for what it is worth, I wholeheartedly agree with that view.  In another and more appropriate place it might be possible, if the House feels strongly on this, to give greater cognisance to it in the future than has been given to it in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned one aspect of insurance which is of prime concern, that is, the case of a person <Col N="1220" /> injured by a stolen vehicle.  In such a case the injured person can have recourse to the Motor Insurers' Bureau which has undertaken to meet claims of that type involving personal injury where the driver is uninsured and cannot himself meet the claim.  I have no doubt that it covers effectively the type of hardship case that Deputy Cosgrave mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett queried Section 39, which enables the Court hearing a prosecution for non-insurance to award damages to an injured person. This provision corresponds to the provision in the 1933 Act of which there has been no complaint whatsoever although it has been in operation since 1933.  I am not aware of any recent fundamental happenings or change of circumstances that would make it repugnant to the public to-day when they have had it for 28 years without complaint.</P>
    <P>The question of fines on the spot is really a misnomer as Deputies will understand.  However, this system, described as fines on the spot, has been generally accepted by the House although a number of Deputies felt quite strongly&mdash;I think this was the strongest argument against it&mdash;that it would bring in its train corruption in our police force.  Those who hold that view and have expressed it very forcefully must misunderstand the situation or else, understanding the situation, they imply that if corruption can happen in the future because of this, it must be happening at the moment. I do not hold with that.  Misunderstanding is far more likely in the case of these Deputies.  May I say that there is no question at any time of money passing from the hand of the person found infringing the traffic laws into the hand of the Garda who has detected the infringement?</P>
    <P>In certain specified types of infringement, the Guard fines an offending person; he does one of two things. He no longer has to wait around until that person returns to serve him with notice of intention to prosecute.  He can under this Bill affix to the car a ticket indicating that the infringement, whatever it may be, has been committed and that within a given number <Col N="1221" /> of days the driver of that car has the option of going to the police barracks and there paying over his fine and getting a receipt for it.  If the defendant as it were, feels he would not be justified in paying the fine, he does nothing at all.  Court proceedings will follow and, if he can prove his contention that he was not in the wrong, the court will no doubt agree with him.  Again if the Guard in the first instance decided that this type of infringement was one which was being perpetrated and was causing danger that had not been envisaged in the framing of the regulations or the Bill, he might decide there would be no option of a fine and would prosecute in this case.  Again it is the court which will decide; it is only in the case where the Guard has agreed to give the option to the car owner to pay the fine that the car owner can willingly plead guilty.  Then, and not until then, will the payment of money arise; that money will be paid in at a stated barracks and a receipt given for it.</P>
    <P>The Guard will not even have been seen in many cases, let alone talked to the person.  That should not give any cause for alarm that this provision will breed corruption in our police force. I think the system is well worth trying; I do not think anybody could seriously accept the suggestion that as a result corruption will be created in the force. Such a suggestion does not make sense even on a cursory examination.  The House will find that out when it comes to deal with the Bill on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins questioned the constitutionality of the provision in this regard.  I can only say I have been advised that the matter in question is in order on that score.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the offence of driving while under the influence of drink.  Deputy Dr. Browne strongly advocated blood and breath tests.  I am not at all against such tests but until these tests have proved themselves more conclusively than is evident at the moment, we do not think the time has arrived for their adoption here.  If, as things develop, a clear-cut test that is reliable emerges, I should imagine that whoever is Minister <Col N="1222" /> for Local Government will come to the House pretty quickly with an amendment to bring in such a test. Undoubtedly, if we had a reliable test, it would solve many problems in relation to the influence of drink charges that figure so largely in the courts.  It would be better for the prosecution and the defence that such tests could be taken and could actually tell the truth.  We are not aware that such a test has yet been developed and for that reason we have not included provision for it&mdash;not because we are against such tests but because those put forward do not seem to have proved themselves sufficiently to be adopted here as yet.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested a tightening of the defence of a driver while under the influence of drink or, as an alternative, the introduction of a lesser offence where a person's control was merely impaired&mdash;I think that was the word used.  I shall consider this aspect of the matter but I doubt if anything can be achieved on these lines without some conclusive test, which, as I said, has not yet been evolved or proved to the degree that would enable me to recommend its adoption to this House.</P>
    <P>The increased penalty for dangerous driving resulting in death or serious bodily harm received a somewhat mixed reception.  In its defence, I must say it is one of the provisions most strongly recommended by all those connected with the enforcement of the law and I am satisfied that it is generally welcomed by the public.  Most of these innovations are only fully and clearly understood when they come home to roost with somebody as a result of some sad occurrence.  In all the circumstances, I believe this provision for the type of offence outlined is generally welcome, even though there may be some reservations about its impact on the public generally.</P>
    <P>I was rather agreeably surprised to hear a welcome&mdash;even a modified one &mdash;for the onus of proof provision from even the lawyers in the House.  I felt this was a matter to which the lawyers might tend to take exception, but even the lawyers in the House have given the provision a modified welcome and <Col N="1223" /> of that I am very glad.  These provisions have been introduced in order to enable the law to operate, not just to &ldquo;down&rdquo; the defendants who may appear in court in the future.  It is rather a change sought and felt to be necessary, if our laws in future are to operate effectively and in accordance with the underlying intention of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think the provisions of Section 119 regarding reimbursement of hospitals have been misunderstood.  It is always open to a person injured in an accident to pay the hospital and then seek to recover that expense, with other damages, from the person responsible for the accident.  The hospital may choose to recover directly from the insurer and in that case they may use Section 119.  The limits fixed in the 1933 Act are now out of date, in view of increasing costs, and power is given to fix them by regulation as these costs and values may change again before another overall traffic Bill comes to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass suggested that the local authority rather than the Garda should make road bye-laws.  The difficulty is that such bye-laws apply not merely to residents in the area but to users of vehicles coming into the area and so there is need for a uniform approach to these bye-laws.  For that reason, we have done what is apparently regarded as slighting the competence of the local authorities by giving, in the first instance, power to the Garda Commissioner, in consultation with the local authority, to make these bye-laws, but the main fact I want to emphasise to Deputies who are undoubtedly interested in the question is that the Garda Commissioner, having made a proposal and consulted with the local authority may, if he does not agree with the local authority or if the local authority disagrees with his proposed bye-laws, submit them to my Department for approval.  Anything the local authority may wish to say on them or any representations they may make disagreeing with something in them will be received by me from <Col N="1224" /> them and I can amend those bye-laws.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned the importance to shopkeepers of suitable parking space being made available for their customers.  This Bill will help in that regard in two respects: first, through the use of modern methods of parking control and preserving parking space for short-term parking, and secondly&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;local authorities or private enterprise may be facilitated in the matter of offstreet car parks.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass suggested that bus stops should be reconsidered and resited. The Commissioner will have power to do that under the Bill and I am sure that any proposals brought to his notice through the Minister for Justice will be given full consideration.</P>
      <P>We have not forgotten jay-walkers who can be dealt with by bye-laws under Section 88.  The enforcement of those bye-laws will be another matter because it is very easy to make bye-laws that will appear to control jay-walkers but the actual application of such laws may prove quite difficult. If we can find the way, we shall be quite happy to use it because the power is in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In regard to the maximum speed in built-up areas, in view of the suggestion that there would be a 30 m.p.h. limit and the general acceptance of that proposal by the House, plus the fact that in Dublin and other built-up areas traffic regulations are being very closely considered and revised, would the Minister think it advisable to ask now for a voluntary application by motorists of a speed limit of 30 m.p.h. in built-up areas? The acceptance of the proposal would help to emphasise the more excessive speeds of other drivers.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These questions relate to a recent alteration in the pay structure of members of the Force resulting from consideration by the Garda Conciliation Council of claims relating to rent allowance.  The Garda Conciliation Council, the Garda representatives of which consisted of one Chief Superintendent, one superintendent and two members of Garda rank, is part of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme which was set up in June, 1959, to provide a means acceptable to the Government and Garda Síochána for the determination of claims and proposals relating to certain conditions of service of members of the Force up to and includ-the rank of chief superintendent.  The scheme provides that matters within the scope of the scheme will be dealt with exclusively through the machinery <Col N="1242" /> of the scheme.  The matters appropriate to the scheme are:</P>
    <P>(a) claims relating to pay and allowances and other emoluments whether in cash or in kind,</P>
    <P>(b) hours of duty and periods of annual leave,</P>
    <P>(c) standards of accommodation officially provided.</P>
    <P>(d) principles governing the payment of superannuation allowances.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the claims relating to rent allowance, the Garda Conciliation Council recommended:</P>
    <P>(a) the abolition of rent allowance,</P>
    <P>(b) the insertion in pay of additional elements in respect of rent allowance of the following amounts:</P>

    <P>(c) deductions, equivalent to four-fifths of the additional elements, from the pay of each member for whom or, if married, for whose family suitable official quarters are available.</P>
    <P>This recommendation was accepted by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice on the 21st December, 1960, and became effective from that date.  A new Pay and Allowances Order to give statutory effect to the recommendation has been made.</P>
    <P>Prior to the acceptance of the recommendation of the Garda Conciliation Council the position was that where suitable official accommodation was available it was provided free for members and their families; otherwise a taxable and non-pensionable allowance was paid.  In the case of Sergeants and Guards the maximum amounts payable ranged from £27 4s. 6d. to £61 17s. 6d. per annum, depending on outgoings and location. Of about 2,100 members, paying for rented accommodation, more than 600 were receiving an allowance of less than £32 and more than 1,100 were <Col N="1243" /> receiving an allowance of less than £37 10s.</P>
    <P>The position, as a result of the acceptance of the recommendation of the Garda Conciliation Council, is that these allowances have been abolished and that, instead, every Sergeant and Guard receives a taxable and pensionable pay-addition of £65 per annum, but those who are provided with free quarters are required to pay back £52 of the addition.  Apart from the substantial increases in pay which a large proportion of the members of the Force are in receipt of as a result of this change, the superannuation grants for every member have been considerably enhanced. For instance, a Guard with 33 years' service retiring to-day will receive £32 10s. more in his annual pension and £108 more in his gratuity than he would have received had he retired prior to the change.</P>
    <P>Some appreciation of the cost to the State of the acceptance of the Garda Conciliation Council's recommendation in relation to rent allowance may be gathered from the fact that, whereas a sum of £180,000 in the Estimates for next year would have been sufficient to meet expenditure if rent allowances had continued to be paid, the net sum now to be provided in the Pay Sub-head is £314,000, while the extra provision for pensions and gratuities will be in the region of another £50,000.  Pension charge is a recurring burden and it is estimated that in eight years' time the annual increased cost for pensions and gratuities will have risen to £150,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to the accommodation provided for members of the Force, the question of &ldquo;standards of accommodation&rdquo; is, as I have stated, a matter which comes within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme and falls to be dealt with exclusively through the machinery of the scheme.  No claim or proposal relating to the matter has been submitted by the Garda side and pending the determination of any such claim or proposal questions as to the suitability of official quarters will be <Col N="1244" /> decided on the same basis as heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does the Minister appreciate that, in operation, the alteration in the pay structure in respect of unmarried Gardaí for whom accommodation is provided, resulted in a net decrease in their annual salary, and is a source of grave resentment on the part of many of these young unmarried Gardaí?  The Minister will be aware that, heretofore, accommodation was provided free of charge and that these men now have to pay £52 per annum for a room.  The £65 salary increase, which was supposed to offset that £52, because of its liability to income tax, has resulted in a net decrease of some pounds in their annual salaries.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that as well as paying £52 per annum for the room in the station, they also have to pay 8d. per unit for electricity used in the room, in the hallway or on the staircase to the room?  They have to pay out of their own pockets for having the room cleaned, and where washing facilities are provided&mdash;and in some places they are not provided&mdash; they are absolutely and totally inadequate. I wonder if the Minister has visited any of these provincial stations recently.  If he has, I am sure he will agree with me that, while in many cases they are structurally sound, in the matter of furnishing, flooring and washing facilities, they are absolutely and totally inadequate.  Would the Minister undertake to have an investigation carried out into these matters, because they are a source of what I regard as quite genuine and rectifiable grievances on the part of young unmarried Gardaí?</P>

      <P>From now on, all these matters will have to be discussed and settled through the medium of conciliation or arbitration, or both.  In respect of the matters to which the Deputy has referred, that was a question the Garda Representative Body took up specially themselves.  That was discussed at conciliation level.  They were so satisfied themselves with the equity of the decision that it never <Col N="1245" /> went to arbitration.  It was agreed to at conciliation level.  I would have to presume that, while some Gardaí might be affected to some degree in the manner the Deputy refers to, in the main, the Garda have succeeded in a considerable betterment of their conditions.  There is now a flat rate. Previously the rate could be as low as £17 odd, graduating upwards to, I think, £60 odd.  Now there is a flat rate for everybody, for rural as well as for town Gardaí, of £65.</P>

If the Minister is satisfied about that, I am satisfied.  However, if the Minister inquires into it, even as superficially as I have done, I think he will discover that some of the beds are not big enough and that many Gardaí can feel the slats of the bed through the mattress on which they are required to lie.  May I recommend the provision of a Dunlopillo mattress?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>None of these can be regarded as likely to cause substantially increased expenditure.  Any additional cost involved should be met by an increased contribution, which will be payable by future entrants and by the fact that these future entrants will be eligible for widows' and orphans' pensions only if death is due to an injury sustained in the course of duty and not, as at present, in respect of death in service, whether due to injuries or not. <Col N="1256" /> The fact that, in future, fees will be payable to all registered medical practitioners will not affect the total amount disbursed.  It will merely mean that the money will be distributed over a greater number of doctors.  That is the reason for this Money Resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 proposes to amend Section 108 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide for the transfer of patients who become chargeable patients during a period of detention in hospital.  At present, by Section 19 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, a mental hospital authority is obliged to provide mental hospital assistance for persons being chargeable patients who require such assistance by reason of mental illness and who are ordinarily resident in the mental hospital district.  Normally, chargeable patients are received into a district hospital for the district in which they ordinarily reside.  Occasionally, when people are received into a hospital, it transpires they are ordinarily resident in a different district.  The purpose of the amendment is to regularise that situation and make it much more flexible than it is under the 1945 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which provides for the making by all or one or more mental hospital authorities of payments to patients in respect of work done.  Speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, Deputy Corish seemed <Col N="1257" /> to be concerned that patients would be used to displace tradesmen.  In most hospitals, patients are and have been accustomed to work with tradesmen in carpentry, gardening, farming, etc.  It is a form of occupational therapy which it is essential should be carried on in a hospital of this sort.  That situation is clearly visualised in the original Act which makes provision for special superannuation terms for persons such as tradesmen who for portion of their time have charge of patients.  I do not imagine that the Deputy would want that practice stopped.  I think I will suggest to him that where patients are employed, it is desirable in their own interest that they should be employed on useful work.  In fact, I am advised it is very important from the patients' point of view that they should be made feel they are doing something useful.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely with what the Minister has now said, but I think it must be said that, when the Second Stage was being discussed here and in the Minister's opening speech, there was just a mere reference to the fact that patients could now be paid. When speaking on the Second Stage, I assumed that this was part of the treatment side of occupational therapy and was engaged in for very many years.  I do not think I was, as the Minister described me, very annoyed or worried.</P>

The mental hospital nurses to any extent engage about money.  The Minister, as Minister for Social Welfare, knows that in respect of their allowances, whether pension or sickness benefit, the authorities are very careful about the <Col N="1259" /> persons to whom they should give this money and in what amounts.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Section 163 of the Mental Treatment Act provides that an application for a recommendation for reception must be made in the prescribed form and the authorised medical officer is obliged to visit and examine a person to whom the application relates within 24 hours after the receipt of the application.  I have some reason to believe that the general practice is that the doctor examines the patient first and the application form is completed afterwards.  We have no objection to that procedure but, as the law stands, the examination must be made after the application and the purpose of the amendment is to obviate the necessity for further examination if a doctor has examined a patient within 24 hours before he is presented with a formal application for the recommendation for reception.  If the doctor who receives that application happens to be the authorised medical officer, he is obliged to visit and examine the person if he has not done so before in the previous 24 hours.  No <Col N="1261" /> such obligation, however, is placed on the private practitioner, but the reason why the obligation to see the patient within 24 hours is there is that he is under a similar obligation at present. It is desirable that some registered medical practitioner should see the patient in respect of whom the reception order is being sought and the placing of the obligation on the authorised medical officer to act when he is presented with an application of this kind will preserve the existing position whereby fees paid in respect of the examination of such persons are classified as pensionable emoluments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point I should like to raise on that.  Again, it may be a drafting matter but under the section as it stands the practitioner who makes the reception order, acting on the application, has now carried out a statutory function.  He is protected in relation to what he does but he is concerned with the medical condition of the person he is examining.  That is his primary duty and his primary concern but, in the reception order which he makes, he has to decide first of all whether the medical condition is such that the reception order should be made and, secondly, he has to decide whether the person concerned is or is not a chargeable patient.  If, in fact, he has not come to any proper opinion with regard to whether the patient is a chargeable patient or not, and later on a question arises in relation to that and the doctor had not made proper inquiries in that regard, it might be suggested that the reception order which he made should not have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned under subsection (1). The reception order can be made only if the doctor is satisfied that it is proper to make it and is of the opinion that the person concerned is a chargeable patient.  A chargeable patient is defined as a person who cannot meet the entire cost of maintenance.  I think that is the definition in the 1945 Act. If, in fact, the medical practitioner concerned certified a person who was in a position to meet the entire cost of maintenance, and did so <i>bona fide,</i><Col N="1262" /> being of the belief that the person's mental conditions were such that he should be certified, but did not make proper inquiries as to his chargeability, that medical practitioner might subsequently be in some difficulties. Perhaps the Minister can satisfy me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can. Section 260 of the 1945 Act provides that no civil proceedings shall be instituted in respect of an act taken in pursuance of this Act, except by leave of the High Court, and such leave shall not be granted except the High Court is satisfied there are substantial grounds for contending that the person against whom the proceedings are to be brought acted in bad faith or without reasonable care. I think that meets the point.</P>

      <P>It says &ldquo;reasonable care.&rdquo;  I know the safeguard that is intended by the Oireachtas, and would be intended in this measure but, in another place, good intentions are irrelevant and regard must be had to what is written down.  Under Section 7 of this Bill the recommendation order can only operate if the medical practioner is of the opinion that the person is a chargeable patient.  I am only taking an improbable case, but if the doctor is faced perhaps with a raving lunatic and can get no clear information as to background and means, but is satisfied that medically this person should be committed straight away, he does not make any inquiries because he cannot and it might be held afterwards, in regard to whether the person was chargeable or not, that he had not exercised reasonable care.  I am concerned as to why that duty should be cast on the doctor.  The doctor's concern initially is a medical one. Obviously the person concerned has to be got into a mental hospital quickly; let him be brought in and let the question of chargeability be discussed subsequently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a point there and I shall look into it but I think if we refer to the wording of the proposed amendment itself, in subparagraph (a) (i) of subsection (1) it <Col N="1263" /> reads: &ldquo;If he is satisfied that it is proper to make the recommendation.&rdquo; That is the point&mdash;as to whether the person should be admitted to a mental hospital&mdash;&ldquo;and is of opinion that the person to whom the application relates will, if received, be a chargeable patient.&rdquo;&ldquo;Is of opinion&rdquo;&mdash;that does not impose a very onerous duty upon the doctor.  He does not have to make any investigation beyond that of the circumstances, shall we say, in which he finds the patient.  But, I shall look into it.</P>
      <P>We do not want to complicate the situation further and if we can simplify this procedure and ensure that the medical practitioner concerned is not likely to be faced with legal proceedings, we shall try to do what we can but it would seem to me that it is fairly fully covered by the words &ldquo;is of opinion,&rdquo; having regard to Section 260 of the Principal Act.  I assume that if legal proceedings were taken, unless they had some evidence to show that the person was not <i>bona fide</i> of the opinion necessary to commit the person as a chargeable patient they would not hold him liable.  I mean, would it not be incumbent upon the person taking proceedings to show that the doctor had acted in bad faith and contrary to the circumstances as they were plain to be seen?</P>

      <P>I do not like to keep pressing this matter.  It may be an improbable set of circumstances but I can imagine a doctor saying: &ldquo;There is only one thought in my mind.  Here, we have a raving lunatic. I made no inquiry as to who he was, what his means were or anything like that&rdquo;.  A doctor may be asked: &ldquo;How then could you form an opinion as to whether or not he was a chargeable patient?&rdquo;  The protecting section says: &ldquo;acted in bad faith or without reasonable care.&rdquo;  It might be contended that the words &ldquo;without reasonable care&rdquo; would suggest and imply a duty to the medical practitioner that he had to have regard both to the medical condition and the question of means.  Everybody knows that the concern is to get a <Col N="1264" /> person, whose medical condition is such that a recommendation order has to be made, under medical care as quickly as possible.  That is clearly the intention in the Bill and in the original Act.  I think that can be achieved if we remove this question of chargeability from this section and provide for it otherwise.  Once the person is in, then the question of chargeability can be considered properly and carefully by those who have the responsibility.</P>

      <P>I have looked at the original Act.  Therefore, you have an undefined escort but the only right the Guard or the R.M.S. has to imprison the person concerned is the right laid down in Section 12 that he must do it by means of an escort, such escort as may be necessary.  If in fact it were subsequently alleged that he got 12 nurses where in fact only two were required, the question might be raised as to whether he was acting within the authority laid down in the section.  I know how these phrases come into a section of a Bill or an Act of Parliament.  I know also how frequently it arises that the words laid down here are the words that have to be interpreted subsequently.  I have personally very grave objection to imposing on an unfortunate officer, whoever he may be, the obligation of defining for himself what his duties are to be, unless he is protected in that way.  I should like to see the words &ldquo;arrange for such escort as in his opinion he shall consider necessary.&rdquo; I think that should be in and it was obviously intended it should be in.</P>

      <P>The member of the Garda Síochána concerned, because in this case the R.M.S. has refused to provide an escort or says he is not going to and the onus is on the member <Col N="1268" /> of the Garda Síochána to provide an escort.  The amendment here is designed to ensure that not alone will the escort be adequate, that is in numbers, but that it will be a competent escort as well.  I believe the member of the Garda Síochána can enlist the aid of anybody in the pursuance of his duty. If he has to accompany or provide an escort for a mental patient to a mental hospital, he can take anybody from the side of the street.  I suppose the usual practice will be that he will get another member of the Garda Síochána.  This amendment seeks to ensure that it will be a competent escort and, as Deputy O'Higgins suggests, that it will be adequate in numbers.  How that can be provided for in words I do not know, but the word &ldquo;competent&rdquo; before escort is suggested as a safeguard.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins had a point when he proposed to make the opinion of the resident medical superintendent the determining factor, but in everything we do, must we not proceed on the assumption that the courts will interpret the law with a feeling for what is practicable, that they will make a rational approach and will not endeavour to construe what is done by the Oireachtas, the Legislature of the State, in such a narrow way as to make it impossible to enact any statute?  I am afraid that is where we are tending to go, particularly in relation to the point which is being made by Deputy Corish. We would have to assume if this <Col N="1269" /> matter did come to the courts that where a resident medical superintendent had provided an escort, and that is the first thing we have to consider, he would have to provide an escort of competent persons, persons who, in his view as a person qualified to determine such a question, were competent, and I do not think we need worry very much about what the courts would say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>Yes.  It can be any person who&mdash;I am proposing to give effect to the suggestion which Deputy O'Higgins has made&mdash;in the opinion of the competent medical authority is capable of being an efficient and suitable escort for the patient concerned. I do not think we have to worry very much about that and we will have to leave it.</P>
      <P>The other case arises where the medical superintendent indicates that he does not intend to arrange for an escort and then the member of the Garda Síochána must himself arrange for such an escort as may be necessary. There we must assume again that the medical superintendent, having all the facts before him, will decide that this particular person does not require an escort of the special type which he would propose to send and that the patient would be quite safe in being brought to the mental hospital by any escort which the member of the Garda Síochána could himself arrange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we would have to leave it at that.  Do not forget that an unfortunate person may have been wandering around suffering from amnesia or under some hallucinations.  The first consideration is not as to who will bring him there but how he will be brought as speedily as possible to a place where his condition may be treated by some experienced and expert person.  These are the considerations which must guide us in coming to a conclusion as to what type of <Col N="1270" /> escort should be sent and who should provide the escort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree we may be pinpricking somewhat, but I do not think anybody visualises a situation where a question of law will be raised here.  I am prepared to accept what the Minister has said.  I am prepared to assume that when a certificate is handed to a member of the Garda Síochána, he will consult the R.M.S. and will give him the general details of the case, the certificate for which he has.  Then between the two of them they will decide whether or not the R.M.S. should provide an escort or whether it would be sufficient for the member of the Garda Síochána to provide that escort.  I suppose I would also be safe in assuming&mdash;although it is not right to assume too much in respect of the law&mdash;that the Garda Síochána and the R.M.S., in consultation, will try to ensure that there is a competent and capable escort, whether it is a member of the force or somebody who is experienced in handling people of the kind we deal with in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I know there are two parts to this amendment and I want to treat of the second part.  We may well do that as there will not be a division, either on the whole amendment or on any part of it, but I should like to consider the suggestion in the second portion of the amendment.  I notice in the section that when a certificate is presented to a member of the Garda&mdash;and I quote Section 12 (b)&mdash;&ldquo;thereupon that member shall (i) request the resident medical superintendent of the district mental hospital mentioned in the recommendation to arrange for such escort as may be necessary.&rdquo;  Then it says: &ldquo;or (ii) himself arrange for such escort as may be necessary.&rdquo;  I wonder if it is desirable to give a member of the Garda that discretion. He may either consult with the R.M.S. and ask him to provide the escort or he may decide not to consult&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If so, he does that on his own responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if we should <Col N="1271" /> give him that responsibility and that discretion?  To go on, if the R.M.S. decides he will not provide an escort, the Garda may then provide the escort themselves and this amendment asks that in such a case where the escort is a Garda, the uniform should not be used.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the necessity for the use of the Garda uniform in certain cases&mdash;one might say in many cases. I appreciate the necessity for it in respect of Section 9 of the Bill, the section which gives a Garda right of entry, in a situation in which he must enter a premises uninvited, so to speak. He must have some authority, apart from the fact that he announces himself as a member of the Garda and the uniform does have the effect sometimes of bringing people to heel.</P>
      <P>But here is the situation where the proper procedure has been carried out in order to have a person admitted to the mental hospital.  The certificate is made out and the whole thing is voluntary, so far as relatives are concerned. I do not say that the patient is willing or that he submits to the hospital without any fuss, but here we are providing for a case where an escort is necessary and I think it would be safe to assume that there would be quite an amount of annoyance to the patient concerned and to some extent some embarrassment for the relatives where a Garda or two appear at the door of a house and proceed to take forcibly&mdash; in most cases in such a situation as is envisaged under this section&mdash;some person from the house.  If a Garda or a civilian in ordinary clothes, or even two of them, go to a house, there is not much risk of a scene but if, in a street of a provincial town or of a city two or three Gardaí appear in full uniform, it is inevitable that a crowd should gather.  They may not know there is a mental patient there.  They may suspect robbery or violence or something like that and all this serves to embarrass relatives and annoy the patient who may become much more violent as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there should be any difficulty here.  It is not an emergency situation but one in which time has <Col N="1272" /> been taken to consult the R.M.S., to enlist the aid of an escort and, because it is not urgent, time could be taken to recruit a Garda who is not in uniform for the reasons I have stated.  It is not a very important part of the whole question, but I know from experience&mdash; not my own, but from what has been told to me by mental nurses and members of the public&mdash;that it would be very desirable, in cases where an escort has to be provided, if the escort comprises members of the Garda, they should be in civilian clothes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this whole matter, we must remember that there will be a great variety of cases to be dealt with in which the circumstances will be different and we could not possibly cover these by statute. The section as now worded is designed to put a great deal of responsibility and discretion upon members of the Garda and upon the medical superintendent and upon the authorised medical officer or the registered medical practitioner who issues the certificate, in the first instance.</P>
      <P>On the question which seems greatly to concern Deputy Corish, the unpleasant implications, shall we say, of having a patient escorted by men in Garda uniform, I can say that I propose to ask my colleague, the Minister for Justice&mdash;and I have some assurance that he will agree&mdash;that, where possible, the escorts of mental patients or of persons being brought to mental hospitals will be in civilian clothes, but I think it would be undesirable that we should write that in as a specific statutory requirement because cases may arise in which, for instance, immediate action may have to be taken and in which a Garda himself will have to act upon his own authority and with whatever escort or persons are available to him, without even consulting the R.M.S. and may have to bring the patient along.  We want to provide for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, he may be called upon to bring a patient to a mental hospital where the certificate states that the certifying practitioner feels that an escort should be provided but that might be because some unfortunate <Col N="1273" /> individual suffers from a loss of memory to the hospital, he might walk on to the railway lines, in front of a bus or over the quay side.  That is the purpose of the provision and I suggest we should make certain that whatever happens under Section 12, there will not be undue delay in getting a person to a mental hospital, when it is certified that he should be admitted and that his condition is such that he should have somebody to take him there, to act as his guardians on the journey&mdash;that is the real meaning of the word &ldquo;escort&rdquo; used in this context.  I can assure the House that I shall try so to arrange, and I am sure everybody else will too, that the people are taken to hospital with the least possible public advertisement.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I should like to say I am in agreement with this matter in relation to the quality and attire of the escort.  It is wiser to leave this to the discretion of the Garda.  The Minister has announced his intention of asking the Minister for Justice to co-operate.  It might be that the appearance of a uniform would cause unnecessary distress. There are also cases in which the appearance of a Garda in uniform sometimes simplifies this delicate operation.  From my experience of rural Ireland, I can say it can be left confidently to the discretion of the Garda who will discharge this duty in whatever way is least distressing to the patient, his relatives, and himself.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To add to paragraph (c) a new subparagraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iii) where the resident medical superintendent decides to provide an escort, such escort shall consist of registered mental nurses whose conditions of employment shall be determined in relation to this special duty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to secure special consideration for registered mental nurses who are required by the R.M.S. to do escort duty.  I have an idea that this is a matter which might best be resolved between the trade unions and the hospital authorities.  I raise it because it has been represented to me that mental nurses who are sent on escort duty in the middle of the night are required to turn in to work at the usual time next morning. I do not know what substance there is in the complaint or whether or not it is widespread.  I assume, if the complaint is well-grounded, time off would be the solution.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider the desirability of having two male nurses in each mental hospital whose sole duty would be escort duty.  I do not know whether they would be fully occupied but it must be admitted that escort duty can be very tricky in the case of violent patients.  I certainly would not be competent to handle such a patient.  I assume most mental nurses are competent to deal with violent cases.  I assume that those who act as escorts are trained in the giving of sedatives.  I do not know if there is a case for special treatment for nurses who act as escorts because I am not sufficiently conversant with the duties and I confess that, if there is to be special treatment or compensation for escort duties, that could best be achieved between the trade unions and the authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  This amendment would seem to be directed towards conditions of employment. From that point of view, the matter is clearly one to be resolved through the accredited representatives of the nurses <Col N="1275" /> concerned.  I should like to say that we are labouring under a misapprehension if we think the majority of mental patients are violent.  They are not.  Violence is the exception rather than the rule.  Most are very docile and can be handled and we should not, therefore, base our case for special consideration on the assumption that the majority of the patients are violent. That could create a wrong impression in the public mind and I would prefer that we did not discuss it on that basis. The R.M.S. must carry the responsibility and we must leave him to determine the suitable escort.  It need not necessarily be fully trained mental nurses in every case.  I am perfectly satisfied that if a qualified mental nurse is essential in the opinion of the R.M.S., he will provide such an escort for his own protection, if for no other reason.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 7, to insert the following subsection after line 24 as a subsection added to section 184 of the Principal Act:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Where a request for a certificate for the purposes of subsection (4) of this section is made to the authorised medical officer, that officer shall examine the person in respect of whom the certificate is requested and shall give the certificate if he is of the opinion referred to in that subsection.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to place an obligation on the authorised medical officer, that is, the dispensary doctor, to examine the patient whose reception is being sought as a temporary chargeable patient and, where appropriate, to issue a certificate. Under the Bill as drafted, no obligation was placed on the authorised medical officer to examine a person in those circumstances.  That was a continuation of the existing position. No such obligation exists under the present law.  In the past, fees paid to the authorised medical officer in respect of an examination of persons desiring to enter a hospital as temporary chargeable patients and as voluntary chargeable patients were reckoned for superannuation purposes because they were paid by virtue of his office as district medical officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future, these fees will be paid to him as a registered medical practitioner, and not as a district medical officer, unless, as proposed in the <Col N="1278" /> amendment, we place an obligation on him as district medical officer to examine these patients.

      <P>The position is that at the present time the only person who can issue a recommendation for reception or a certificate in respect of a chargeable patient whether for a person of unsound mind, a temporary patient or a voluntary patient, is the dispensary doctor.  For issuing that certificate, he would be paid a fee of, I think, two guineas, and that, naturally, would rank for superannuation. The change that is being made is that if, for any reason, the patient himself, or a relative of the patient concerned, does not want to go to the dispensarry medical officer of the district, and would prefer to go to the <Col N="1280" /> family doctor, to take a case in point, a psychiatrist or a specialist, the certificate can be issued by the family doctor or the psychiatrist.  To the extent to which that alternative may be availed of, the dispensary doctor will lose his fee.  I do not think there is anything we can do to remedy that situation.  It means that he is not called upon to discharge his duty and, therefore, does not draw a fee in respect of it.  What we are endeavouring to ensure, and what we will secure, is that wherever he does issue a certificate and draw a fee, the fee will rank for superannuation.</P>

    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  In the section as it stands a chief medical officer is given power to grant extensions up to 18 months in the case of a temporary patient other than an addict and up to six months in the case of an addict.  This extension is in addition to the period during which, under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of Section 186 of the Principal Act, he may be detained.  This means in effect that he may be detained for the original six months plus any extensions granted by the Minister.  If, therefore, the Minister had granted three extensions, and the <Col N="1282" /> patient is near the end of the two-year period at the time, as this Bill stands the chief medical officer, in the absence of this amendment, could I think grant three more extensions, thus making the total period of detention up to three and a half years.</P>

      <P>We test these things by the improbable.  When an objection is made by the patient himself, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals must give a report.  What does he do?  Sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph (b) provides:</P>
      <P>on being required to give such report, the chief medical officer shall give it forthwith and, on consideration of the report, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals shall take such steps as he considers necessary for ascertaining whether or not the detention of the person to whom the order relates should be continued.</P>
      <P>What would the Inspector of Mental Hospitals do?  He has got the report from the chief medical officer.  He has a complaint from the patient that he should not be detained.  Does he carry out a medical examination himself or does he have the patient examined by some other medical practitioner? What exactly is done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what exactly is done but I know what he is obliged to do.  He must ask for the <Col N="1284" /> report from the medical officer.  On receipt of that report&mdash;this is all set out in the memorandum&mdash;he must take such steps as are deemed necessary to satisfy himself of the propriety or otherwise of the continued detention of the patient.  It means that he himself must either have the patient examined or his assistant must have him examined. If he has any doubt about it he can call in another consultant.  I take it the onus is on him to satisfy himself on this matter.  What steps he may take to do that, I do not know.  As well as that, he may have to visit the patient, possibly several times.  There may, in some cases, be no way in which he could arrive at a conclusion on any patient except by this personal examination.</P>
