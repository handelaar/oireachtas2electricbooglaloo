      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I opened my remarks on this Estimate by objecting, first of all, to this Department having been set up at all.  There was no necessity for it.  It must be a rather humiliating experience, I think, for the Minister to be put in charge of a series of companies which, according to today's paper, are described as either solvent or tending towards solvency.  The limited information we have got shows that they are all in a very definite position of not paying their way.  We were supplied with over 60 pages of typescript as between the two documents circulated to us in connection with this Department. Yesterday we had 38 or 39 <Col N="868" /> pages of typescript which the Minister read; the rest is taken up with notes he supplied over the week-end, with a warning that this might be the last time these notes would be supplied.</P>
      <P>In all the 60 pages there is not the information that would be required from, say, the chairman of a group of companies addressing a shareholders' meeting and trying to get them to understand how the companies under his control were doing.  In the first page of the notes supplied the Minister speaks of the groups for which he has responsibility.  He states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A great part of the work of the Department is concerned with the State-sponsored bodies for which the Minister for Transport and Power has overall responsibility. These are&mdash;</P>
      <P>He names them.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;the Electricity Supply Board, Bord na Móna, Córas Iompair Éireann, Irish Shipping Limited&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and the three air companies, as well as the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.</P>
      <P>The next sentence swerves away from the overall responsibility which the Minister states he has for these State-sponsored bodies.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under the relevant statutes these bodies enjoy a very wide degree of autonomy in their day-to-day administration&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is then a zig-zag back again:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They are, however, subject to certain statutory controls, particularly in relation to finance and are also responsible to the Minister in matters of general policy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the experience of this House over the past couple of years, since this Ministry was founded, that we more often hear about the autonomy of these companies than we hear of the Minister's responsibility for them.  There is scarcely a question that has been addressed to the Minister that has not met with the evasive reply that the matter is one of day-to-day administration for which he has no responsibility.  Even when questions on matters which I would assume would have been accepted as policy <Col N="869" /> have been put to the Minister, he has disclaimed responsibility.  Nevertheless, he has made many journeys abroad and up and down the country, exploiting himself as the person who is responsible for these State-sponsored bodies while, at the same time, in this House he fails to give the information that should be supplied so that people could understand how his Department is progressing with the bodies that are under it.</P>
    <P>Let us start with the principle that he does control a great number of the State-sponsored bodies.  I notice in this morning's paper the word &ldquo;solvency&rdquo; is used with regard to C.I.E.; it is approaching solvency.  I suppose the Minister would agree with me that these various bodies mentioned in the first page of his notes are bodies no longer in the promotional stage; possibly an exception might be made with regard to Aerlinte, thought it is now in its third year.  The rest are outside the promotional stage.  It is a well-known practice with regard to these State-sponsored bodies that they are provided with State capital and credit from the community and they are given a certain time to get their financial feet under them before they are asked to remunerate that capital.  But they are asked in the main, and they should be asked, first of all, to service any capital while it is outstanding and to ensure by sinking fund devices, and otherwise, that repayment will be made within a reasonable time having regard to the assets the particular State-sponsored body controls.</P>
    <P>With the possible exception of Aerlinte&mdash;and I do not make that a real exception&mdash;all these other bodies are in the position that they should be meeting their accounts in the way in which an ordinary commercial body would be meeting its accounts.  There is a delusion current amongst certain people in this country, and even amongst certain Deputies in this House, that what is called the public sector of our economy is progressing and that it is virile, active and successful, when, all the time the contrast that is so often made with what private enterprise does in this country is opposed to that illusionary situation.</P>
    <P>I am putting it that these bodies are <Col N="870" /> all now in the position, again with the possible exception of Aerlinte, in which they should be on the same footing as any ordinary commercial concern.  That is to say that they should, in the course of their operations, draw in as much revenue as will meet ordinary operational expenditure and that they will have enough money to replace their plant and machinery if it goes out of order and to keep their premises in good condition.  It also means that if they have to borrow money from a bank or from private subscribers they will be in a position to pay off some of the capital and, while any of that capital is outstanding, to pay the interest on it.</P>
    <P>That sort of comparison should be made with this group of State companies. It is not an unfair comparison that at this stage of their lives these bodies should meet that standard and that they should successfully compete in private enterprise conditions.  State sponsored bodies are better off than private companies.  Private companies have to meet their running expenses and make sufficient profit to enable the people associated with them to live and to keep up an ordinary standard of living.  The State sponsored body has no profits to make.  All it has to do it to pay the interest on the capital advanced to it and to repay that capital.</P>
    <P>In connection with this matter of capital I asked questions yesterday to find out what was the overall situation of the State in regard to the moneys lent out to these various enterprises.  I was told that the gross return for the year ended 31st March, 1961, was about £10 million.  Of that the interest was £3.5 million.  That is the interest paid to the State by these bodies out of which £2.9 million came from the E.S.B.  The overall return was 3.2 per cent. and the return from the E.S.B. was 4½ per cent.  If the overall return is only 3.2 per cent. and if the return from the E.S.B., with nearly £100,000,000 invested, is 4½ per cent. then the other bodies cannot be paying three per cent. between them. The calculations cannot be made exactly because one would want to know the amount invested in each body but it is quite clear that if the <Col N="871" /> overall return is 3.2 per cent. and if the E.S.B. supplies 4½ per cent., the return from the others must be under three per cent.</P>
    <P>I asked then what we were paying for money we got in by way of National Loan and otherwise.  I was told that the average rate of interest on long term debt was 4.3 per cent.  If State-sponsored bodies other than the E.S.B. are only paying interest at less than three per cent., they are not paying what the State ought to get on the money which it borrows and passes over to them.  These State-sponsored bodies are not merely getting money at low interest rates but they are even depriving the State of the interest they ought to pay.  They are getting money under exceptional conditions such as the easy provision of credit and they are not able to pay the interest that they should pay.</P>
    <P>On first reading of the Minister's speech it emerges that C.I.E. are losing and that their losses will be cut down this year to £250,000.  Shipping is running at a loss this year of £460,000, Shannon airport is running at a loss of £307,000, Dublin airport at a loss of í232,000 and the Aerlínte operational losses are expected to be in the region of £80,000 this year.  The full total of those is £1,330,000.  That is not anything like the true picture but, taking it at first glance, all the companies about which the Minister boasted are costing the community £1,330,000 if the losses do not run any worse than is estimated.  That is nothing like the true picture and I want to go through the various companies and see what the true picture is.</P>
    <P>To get the true picture we must know what capital is invested in any of these concerns, what interest they pay on the capital put into them, what sinking fund arrangements are imposed on them.  We would also want to know whether the revenue they are receiving is better or worse than the expense they have to incur in providing the service.  We would also have to inquire into the treatment of the employees, how their wage rates compare with outside employment and what are their superannuation arrangements.  After <Col N="872" /> all that, one would want to inquire what service these concerns are providing, whether it is efficient and whether it is one that the public are looking for and are entitled to expect.</P>
    <P>I shall take C.I.E. first.  The Minister has told us in his notes that capital has been written off to the extent of £24? millions.  In addition to that there is a later £10,000,000 which was put into the various companies that form C.I.E. and that has been written off also.  I do not believe that is anything like the total of the money originally put into these concerns but let us start with that.  In addition to it there is a sum of £6.6 million, the payment of which has been waived. Those three items total nearly £41,000,000.  It is quite clear that in ordinary business capital commitments sometimes have to be written off.  The business gets into the position that it cannot meet its capital commitments, it goes bankrupt, pays so much on each share and then starts all over again.  In that way it gets rid of the dead weight of debt.</P>
    <P>This is a significant sum of nearly £41,000,000 which has been wiped off the capital originally put into the services that are now tied up with C.I.E.  An article was published on 24th June of this year in a journal which is described as the official organ of the Road Transport Organisation. After a good deal of criticism, and they are entitled to criticise, of the whole railway system, because they are definitely being put out of the running in competition against the rail system they wind up in reference to road services in Britain, which, they say, make a profit of from £35 millions to £40 millions a year, by summarising the C.I.E. position rather well, I suggest, in the next two or three lines. They say that surely the State-sponsored transport undertaking, Córas Iompair Éireann, with over £20 million losses written off to the tax-payers, with Government responsibility for pensions and gratuities to redundant staffs, with an annual State grant averaging £1 million, plus many lucrative monopolies both overt and hidden, at the very worst should be able to break even or to show a paper profit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> I have searched through the Minister's speech to find out some of these things.  It is quite clear that the redundant employees are now a burden on the State, at least to a certain extent, £250,000, and that is going to go on for a long, long time.  In addition to that, the State has taken on itself the burden of paying the interest which was waived in favour of C.I.E. and that the Minister's speech put at £632,000.  If I add these two together it means that the State at this stage, when C.I.E. is described as almost becoming solvent, is bearing £880,000 a year.  Whether the £1 million that we are supposed to give to C.I.E. by subsidy is in addition to that or covers that, I do not know.  It should emerge from the speech but it does not.</P>

      <P>The Deputy agreed to the writing off of the capital in the various Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some part of it but £632,000 is not the return on £40 millions. It is not the interest waived on £40 millions; it is the interest waived on one part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing has happened since the 1958 Act that is being concealed from the Deputy in the way of writing off of interest.  The Deputy knew it all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1958 Act is the basis on which the whole C.I.E. rests.  It is by reason of the fact that certain advantages were given to them under that Act that they are able to be in the position where some persons can describe them as approaching solvency. I am approaching it from the reality. Under the 1958 Act the State took on certain commitments amounting to £880,000 a year.  In addition to that, there is a possibility of having to pay £1,000,000.  Whether what the taxpayer is being asked to shoulder for the benefit of C.I.E. is £1,880,000 or whether it is some difference between £880,000 and the addition of another £250,000, I do not know, and it does not emerge from the speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister in relation to C.I.E. should have set out to clarify that problem, or does he suggest that it is clarified?  Are we not entitled to <Col N="874" /> get from the Minister a statement of how much of the capital was completely wiped off, that is to say, that people simply had to abandon their hopes of getting any return on capital previously sunk in the railway system? We should know what was the capital that is now regarded as the live capital in C.I.E.  We should also know how much they are paying per annum by way of interest on the capital outstanding and what they are doing in the way of repaying some part of this capital.</P>
    <P>In any event, I say any chairman of a railway company, let alone a chairman of so many companies as the Minister presides over, would have made clear to the shareholders what the situation was, instead of merely hiding behind these evasive phrases, speaking of C.I.E. as approaching solvency. The Minister would surely agree with me that no ordinary company in this country could be described as solvent unless it was paying superannuation moneys to its employees when they retired, more particularly when they were made redundant by the operations of the company itself, and were meeting capital charges.  Whatever the situation is, it is known somewhere or another and an analysis of the figures would show what the real position is. I would suggest that some of these 1,000 staff &mdash; 200 generals and 800 technical and professional people &mdash; could have been better employed, than giving us all this mass of detail, in giving a simple balance sheet for each of the six or seven concerns for which the Minister speaks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The balance sheet is available to the Deputy in the C.I.E. report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister standing for C.I.E.?  Does he want to explain what C.I.E. stands for? Could he give a summary of all that? Does it emerge from the C.I.E. report what the taxpayer is paying by way of subvention to C.I.E. this year&mdash; £880,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>C.I.E. is approaching solvency.  I say that a company is not solvent if it has to get £880,000 from the taxpayer to meet interest payments and to meet moneys that are paid to redundant employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shipping is simply thrown at us here.  As far as shipping is concerned the Minister has changed his stand from last year.  Last year, the Minister came in here gaily to announce that Irish Shipping had made a profit over the year.  Deputy Dillon asked at what rate of interest were they paying on their capital and how were they repaying capital and the Minister explained that that was not any part of his business to know.  Pressed by questions as to whether it was not something that the Minister in charge of a Department having charge of shipping would be able to tell the public, he again said he had not asked them.  It required a Parliamentary Question to get the reality exposed. The reality was that there was some operational improvement, some operational profit, of about £150,000 but that interest and depreciation amounted to nearly £500,000.  So that the company that was represented here in a gay fashion as being a success, as making a profit of £150,000 a <Col N="876" /> year, turned out in the end to be running at a loss.</P>
    <P>This year, however, we have got the figures.  The operational profit on shipping this year is stated to be £238,000 and then, instead of a calculation being made as to what depreciation and interest this year are, we are told that last year the depreciation was £695,000.  Let us assume that these payments by way of interest and sinking fund and all the rest of it will not be worse than the £695,000 of last year, although that is, of course, an optimistic statement; there has been more capital invested in the ships; there must be more expenditure by way of depreciation and interest and all the rest of it.  However, take it as being merely £695,000, that leaves this shipping company in the red to the extent of £450,000 for the year.  In any event, there has been this amount of candour about the Minister this year, forced out of him by the exposure that occurred last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows a loss of £457,000.  The E.S.B. is clouded with mystery so far as this statement is concerned.  It is dealt with at a later page and we are told: &ldquo;It is gratifying to have to record that the provisional results show a reasonable surplus&rdquo; and this, the Minister says, &ldquo;is welcome news after the deficiencies of the three preceding years.&rdquo;  The E.S.B. accounts are drawn up as at the end of March <Col N="877" /> in a year.  We are now in July.  Is the Minister not in a position, with his behind-the-scenes access to the E.S.B.  Board, to say anything no better than: &ldquo;I understand that the provisional results for the year ended 31.6. '61 show a reasonable surplus&rdquo;? What is the surplus called reasonable?

      <P>They could have been put forward here as a provisional account and we would then know what the Minister's view is of a reasonable surplus.  I want to know what that surplus is.  I have not got it yet.  I doubt if we are going to get it during this day.  We are told this heartening thing:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The improvement is due almost entirely to a saving on fuel costs made possible by the phenomenal <Col N="878" /> increase in output from hydro-electric stations in what was an abnormally wet year.</P>
    <P>So, if there are reasonably good results this year, it is because of the shockingly bad weather of last year which put plenty of water in the three lakes and in the canal and brought about a better situation in the hydro-electric stations.  It was because of that fortuitous circumstance that the Minister was able to say in the evasive way he has said: &ldquo;The provisional results show a reasonable surplus.&rdquo;  What, I wonder, is called &ldquo;a reasonable surplus&rdquo;?  How is it arrived at?</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Deputy O'Malley, who apparently is so young in the Party that they are afraid to let him know what the economic facts of life in this country are, talked a lot about the Shannon and tried to deny that the Party to which he belonged was against the whole Shannon project. He said, in fact, that the only difficulty Fianna Fáil had long ago about the Shannon scheme was that it should have been built on the Liffey and if that had happened, if the then Taoiseach's good ideas about hydro-electric development had been encouraged, there would be no difficulty whatever.  The Deputy did deny these famous phrases with regard to the &ldquo;white elephant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It took me some little research last night to get these old cuttings out again.  I want to refer to one or two of them.  In the notorious speech with regard to this matter, defaming what even in its earliest stages promised to be a very good development, the denigrating phrase had to come from the man who is now Minister for Health.  In the Seanad in March, 1932, he spoke about the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and said it had as its programme the hydro-electric development of the Shannon, the reconstitution of the dairy industry of this country on a new basis and the establishment of a sugar beet factory.  He since added another thing to that&mdash;the Drumm Battery.  This comment was made by him:</P>
    <P>The success of that Government's practical policy was expressed by <Col N="879" /> the four schemes&mdash;the Shannon Scheme, the Dairy Disposal Board, the Drumm Battery and the Beet Sugar factory...</P>
    <P>I just want to pause there to reflect on those four things.  Three of them are still going concerns and very strong going concerns.  His comment was:</P>
    <P>... as precious a collection of white elephants as ever drove their unfortunate owners to the verge of insolvency.</P>
    <P>That was then possibly regarded as good politics in those days.  Whether it was good national politics, there is not much mistake about what the public comment would be on that.</P>
    <P>I always felt that the most foolish comment ever made in regard to the Shannon Scheme was made by the present Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan.  He is quoted as saying in 1930:</P>
    <P>It was claimed that when the Shannon scheme was got going it would promote industries in the country, but he had been speaking to people who were thinking of taking in the Shannon Electricity for power purposes and they said they could get results cheaper with crude oil.</P>
    <P>That was the comment made by a man who rose to the heights of being Minister for Finance here recently&mdash;that people had told him they could get better results with crude oil than the Shannon power.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach was afraid that:</P>
    <P>... if the Free State got involved in war, a successful air raid on the headquarters of the scheme would leave the industries in every city and town paralysed and a reign of darkness all over the country.</P>
    <P>That was the then Mr. Lemass in May, 1927.</P>
    <P>I have many other quotations I could give here, but I am just replying to what Deputy O'Malley said yesterday. A journal called <i>Irish Truth,</i> which had no political liking of the <Col N="880" /> Government I belonged to in those days and was fostering Fianna Fáil as a new Party, had this comment to make in an editorial in April, 1927:</P>
    <P>The present scheme for the Electricity Board bids fair to develop into a crazy, overgrown, megalomaniac enterprise whose financial foundations are from the very outset unsound.</P>
    <P>That was the mood in which the enterprise now known as the E.S.B. was brought into being.</P>
    <P>There was a series of articles in the <i>Irish Times</i> running from April, 1925, to April, 1927, which wound up by saying that the whole business was a gigantic gamble.  They said that &ldquo;the country as a whole was afraid of it&rdquo;, that capital was &ldquo;a very shy bird&rdquo; and that when this scheme would break down, as it was bound to break down, there would be no capital for sound development.  They asked the Government to cut their losses, to throw this £5,000,000 aside, and get on with something else.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley yesterday made a contention, backed to some degree by the Minister, with regard to the subsidy that used to be given for rural development and which Deputy Norton, as Minister for Industry and Commerce and Tánaiste, with the complete accord of the Government to which he belonged, removed at one time.  Deputy O'Malley is apparently under the delusion that it is because of that electricity charges have had to be increased over the years.  Deputy O'Malley thought that matter had been referred to here in the House. Finally, he said that it was referred to in the report of the Board in 1957. The Minister spoke of the report of 1960.</P>
    <P>I asked, and I want to ask again, if what we did in removing that subsidy and putting the burden of meeting the expenditure previously met by the subsidy on the E.S.B., was a crime and something harmful to electricity development here.  There is a Government in power for four years since. Why did they not restore what we had taken away?  Let me put it in a different way.  Why do they not undo what <Col N="881" /> it was alleged we had criminally done? The Minister referred to the 1960 E.S.B. report but after vainly endeavouring to back his colleague Deputy O'Malley he swung away from that. Deputy O'Malley tried to make the House believe that the subsidy had been restored.  The Minister did not entirely agree with that.  His phrasing was not very clearcut and I want to make clearcut what happened.</P>
    <P>The annual report of the E.S.B. for the year ended 31st March, 1960, says at page 10:</P>
    <P>At the 31st March, 1958, when subsidy at the 50 per cent. rate was reintroduced in respect of the balance of the areas remaining to be electrified&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quote again:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Board had spent approximately £23 million on rural electrification of which the State had borne only £1,980,000 or 8.6 per cent. of the money spent, instead of 50 per cent. as originally planned.  The effect of the loss of almost £9,500,000 in subsidy is to add a continuing annual burden of more than £500,000 on the Board's finances in respect of rural electrification, a burden which has to be borne by the Board's urban and industrial consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all that was done in 1958, that the subsidy at the rate of 50 per cent. was reintroduced in respect of the balance of the areas remaining to be electrified, but the Board was left to bear what they say amounts to an annual burden of about £500,000 a year, and that was not restored.  In the days when Deputy Norton, with the full approval of the government to which he belonged, took that step with regard to the subsidy, the finances were in excellent shape.  The finances were under good management in those days and quite handsome profits were being made.  They are not supposed to make profits.  They are supposed to carry their expenditure under statute and we fill in the gap.  We filled in the gap by asking the Board to bear the whole burden of rural electrification <Col N="882" /> which on their accounts as they then stood they were perfectly well able to do.  That position has not been restored. I think the subsidy for the remaining areas was restored, but what happened in the meantime?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any dangerous ground would the Minister put a mine under it and explode it? If he does that in his concluding speech, I shall wait to hear it but I have not heard anything explosive from him yet.  I want to state what happened to the finances of the E.S.B. I have here the book called <i>Economic Development,</i> the document which this Government got a group of able civil servants to produce to help to explain to them what our policy was in regard to the financial development in this country.  It was produced in November, 1958, and I wish to refer to the fourth paragraph of the chapter dealing with electricity.  Earlier paragraphs deal with the investment in the development of electricity.  They say it is now in the region of £100 million which includes £23 million for rural electrification.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 4 on page 182 says:</P>
      <P>In recent years the provision of generating capacity has run ahead of the country's requirements, and the E.S.B. has surplus capacity, over and above a reasonable reserve for contingencies, which would enable it to supply current of 400-500 million units a year in excess of the present demand of about 1,775 million units.  This alone would suffice for almost four years of growth of demand at last year's rate. The period of excess capacity will be prolonged by the completion of new generating stations now under construction.  The heavy excess investment in plant adds to fixed charges and represents a deadweight burden on the E.S.B.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 5 points the moral of that paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heavy investment by the E.S.B. <Col N="883" /> without a commensurate rise in revenue has meant a steep rise in the proportion of capital charges (interest, sinking fund and depreciation) to revenue.  In 1951-52 capital charges represented 30 per cent. of revenue and likewise 30 per cent. of working expenses; they now represent about 50 per cent. in each case, or over £6 million a year, and will continue to rise.</P>
    <P>That was the folly that caused the electricity charges to be raised: heavy excess provision for generating plant.</P>
    <P>At the time Mr. Whitaker wrote this pamphlet it represented almost four years of growth of demand at the rate of the previous year.  That was in 1958. Although there was excess capacity representing four years' growth of demand there were new generating stations in commission and we have more generating stations in commission now.  We have now reached the amazing point that in order to subsidise peat development the electricity consumers are being asked to pay heavier charges.  In introducing one of the recent Electricity Supply Bills the Minister explained that.  It was not very clearly explained but the information was dug out of him by questions afterwards.</P>
    <P>What is the position nowadays? There is a desire on the part of the Government to stabilise and to subsidise peat development.  That is being done by the provision of generating stations which run on peat fuel, either milled peat or sod peat.  The engineers of the E.S.B. notably and notoriously had always very grave doubts about these peat-fired stations.  It was not that they were unnational; it was just that as engineers they understood there was a considerable risk in having stations which depended upon peat in any form as a fuel.  After several years' trial this conclusion was drawn by the engineers: in a bad year one would expect turf not to be too easy a fuel to manage but experience showed that, even in a good year, the peat became very friable and did not supply the boiler capacity it was supposed to supply.  The E.S.B. engineers at length <Col N="884" /> prevailed.  Of course, in a technical matter like this it was proper that they should prevail,</P>
    <P>What it means now is that the E.S.B. are being made build stations, about which they have no real desire themselves, to be fired by peat produced in the country.  The engineers have got to this point that if peat-fired stations are erected they will be run in conjunction with a station fired by other fuel.  The fuel the Minister has outlined as likely to be used is oil and not coal.  We have a situation in which in order to subsidise peat we are supplying certain generating plant fired by peat.  Then to prevent a breakdown which the engineers apparently think is likely to occur at any time with the peat stations, we are running up, in conjunction with the peat stations, a station which can be fired by oil which is more dependable and in the end cheaper.</P>
    <P>The capital cost of double-capacity stations is very heavy if they can be remunerative only by full use.  If an attempt is made to have the capital remunerated by half use, clearly there is going to be very heavy extra charges to be borne.</P>
    <P>I have been looking through the Board's accounts over some years and, as far as I can see, the use that can be made of these stations varies from time to time.  They are not really required to any great extent as last year.  There is a considerable water flow and even at the best I cannot see that these peat stations will develop more than half the capacity at which they are rated.  What we are doing is building stations and getting the finance of these stations arranged on whatever is the full load and then sliding backwards and trying to get the capital remunerated by the half use of a station.  In the meantime we are building new stations as reserves which are to be fired by oil or, least, they are so arranged that they may be fired by oil.</P>
    <P>The E.S.B. have made a reasonable surplus this year.  They have made it against considerable difficulties &mdash; difficulties not of their making.  I have always suggested that it is right and proper, and if there is a national mood <Col N="885" /> to that effect, that peat should be subsidised but it should be done openly by some subvention brought in on behalf of Bord na Móna instead of using half-powered peat stations against the considered technical views of the engineers of the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>Let me return back to the matter of interest.  The E.S.B. are one of the few concerns paying interest on the moneys lent to them at such a rate that the State is at no loss.  I know from my own experience with regard to the Board, and when I was in the Department of Finance, that the E.S.B. give a profit to the State in interest rate on the money invested in it but they have to pay a rate which is about 4½ per cent.  The overall rate is only 3.2 per cent. and what is required is 4.3 per cent. in order to remunerate the State in a proper way. Under the statute founding the E.S.B., the E.S.B. was put under an obligation to do certain things which are not required of any other company in this country, as far as I understand, private or public.  The E.S.B. have to meet their running costs.  That does not merely mean paying the employees and opening up new areas for development but it means also repairing the main part of the Shannon works as far as they go out of commission or get into disrepair during the years&mdash;in other words, put the plant in first class condition.  At the same time, they are expected to repay the capital investment in such a time as is appropriate according to the life of the various assets under the Shannon Board of Control.</P>
    <P>No company in this country has to do that.  Notwithstanding that heavy burden and notwithstanding the fact that they must pay interest at a rate to give the State a profit, they may show a reasonable profit this year even though they have to bear the further extra expenditure in relation to excess generating capacity and capacity that can only be half used.  They are easily the most successful of all the State enterprises and they would be more successful still if there had not been Departmental interference in connection with the technical operations of the Board.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to say one <Col N="886" /> thing which is not personal.  The Chairman of the Board, recently retired, is replaced by a civil servant from the Department of Industry and Commerce. That is a shockingly bad development. First of all, if a civil servant was put in at all he was put in for a temporary piece of work.  The intention was not to have that position obtain. I think it is wholly wrong to have what is called an independent Board put under the control of a civil servant who had been attached in a very important way to a Department which should have the least interference with the Board.  That is a situation which I hope will be rectified very early.</P>
    <P>The next of these concerns over which the Minister presides is Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna, we are told expect a loss this year.  The Minister says:</P>
    <P>Last year was not a very favourable one for Bord na Móna.  Owing to the bad weather during the harvesting season, output of sod and milled peat at about 1½ million tons, was more than 25 per cent. below target and the Board expect therefore to show a loss for the year, after paying interest and depreciation, of the order of £100,000 approximately as compared with a profit of £35,000 in 1959/60.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister speaks on the wise provision made with regard to having a stock of milled peat.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to ask a few questions. The Board expect a loss of £100,000? Does the Minister know what the loss is?  Is the Minister not in any better position than to say that the Board expect a loss of about £100,000?  He says it is a loss of £100,000 after paying interest and depreciation.  What interest and what depreciation does Bord na Móna pay?  Are they still at the stage where they are not remunerating the capital fully?  What is covered by depreciation?  What amount goes in respect of depreciation?  What is the field, so to speak, that that word covers?  The Minister can easily supply those details and then we will know whether this £100,000 loss is the only loss we may expect from Bord na Móna or whether it is something substantially more.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> Two years ago, Bord na Móna had a very bad year climatically.  That year naturally emerges as a bad one for the Board's operations.  Nobody can blame them for that.  They did show a certain loss, £500,000.  I do not believe there is any interest and depreciation covered by that £500,000. That should be cleared up.  Bord na Móna is out of the promotion stage. We can make allowances for bad weather.  Is the £100,000 a real figure? How much included in that goes to interest and depreciation?  When we know that and when we are told what capital is invested in Bord na Móna, we will be able to see whether the depreciation is correct or whether the interest and sinking fund payments meet the capital requirements of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The Minister next turned to another matter which is and will be an astonishment to the public to realise just how bad the situation is.  He divides his remarks into those that are appropriate on Shannon airport, those that deal with Dublin airport, just a mere reference to the Cork airport and then he goes on to Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.  The amazing situation about Shannon airport is that they had a surplus on what was called their operational account.  They had a surplus; the revenue was £728,000.  The expenditure was just short of £600,000. They showed a surplus of nearly £150,000.  But then, of course, interest and depreciation have to be taken in and they amount to £456,000.  So, not talking about any of the aircraft that use them or anything else, Shannon airport alone shows a loss of £307,000.</P>
    <P>Dublin airport, even in its operations, lost money.  The revenue was £340,000-odd and the expenditure was £343,000-odd.  There was a slight loss &mdash; £3,867.  But, again, interest and depreciation come in to a total of almost £230,000.  Dublin airport is indebted by £232,000.  The two airports, between them, are costing the country over £500,000.  That is surprising&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that in my speech.  I gave all those particulars. The Deputy is only repeating&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="888" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A loss of £500,000 That is not the full total.  We are told that total expenditure on the airport in Cork up to 31st March was £457,000.  We are left to speculate if that will join the other two in showing an annual deficit because that appears to be expected with complacency as being the proper situation.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus, as we are told, has a surplus of £180,000.  We are not told that exactly: we are again in the mood of expectation.  The financial accounts are not yet available but I understand from the company that the airline will show a surplus of £180,000 for that year&mdash;that is what the Minister says.  Is that operational?  Does that include anything with regard to depreciation of the aircraft?  Does it include anything of interest on whatever moneys have been put into the Aer Lingus business?  I take it that it does not.  So, the £180,000 surplus will probably disappear, like the revenue surplus in Dublin Airport, amongst all the charges that have to be brought into account as well.  It is time we were told in precise terms what is the capital that is invested in Aer Lingus and whether the surplus of £180,000 expected is an operational surplus only and what will that go down to in the way of a loss when appropriate account it taken of appreciation and interest.</P>
      <P>Aerlínte is dealt with later.  Aerlínte is very meagrely dealt with.  I think one page is given to it.  We get the familiar phrase on page 33 that the provisional accounts for the year 1960-61 show a probable deficit of £80,000. What does that cover?  Is that deficit in operations only?  I imagine it is. Supposing we add on interest and depreciation.  Are we in again for another heavy deficit under this affair?</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley yesterday talked in terms of prestige and of the necessity to protect Shannon Airport and to add in these things to counterbalance any significant debt that might be shown in the operations of Aerlinte.  On 15th July, 1959, speaking on the Air Navigation and Transport Bill, 1959, as reported at Column 1304 of the Official Report, the present Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> We are going into the development of the transatlantic air service in the confident expectation of making a cash profit as well as conferring other benefits directly or indirectly on the country.  Our expectations are based upon estimates prepared by very shrewd people who know this business thoroughly and who rarely have been wrong in similar estimates before.</P>
    <P>Referring to me he said:</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said I had justified this development on grounds of prestige.</P>
    <P>That is put aside.  He continued:</P>
    <P>I never mentioned the word &ldquo;prestige&rdquo;. I have no interest in prestige in this regard.  The decision to proceed with this transatlantic air development, which had been pressed on me by the Board of Aer Lingus, was taken on hard, cold commercial facts and nothing else.</P>
    <P>About a week later, under question from Deputy Dillon, the Minister admitted that Aer Lingus had never pressed anything, but Aer Rianta: Aer Lingus had nothing to do with it.  However, some board, composed of shrewd men who made no mistakes in their calculations in similar estimates before, investigated the whole circumstances and assured that there would be a cash profit.  There was no question of prestige in it.  That decision was taken on hard, cold commercial facts and nothing else.</P>
    <P>As reported at Column 1305 of the Official Report for the same day, the Taoiseach continued:</P>
    <P>The expectation that, after the initial development period has passed, a substantial cash profit will be realised is based upon a conservative calculation of the traffic available.</P>
    <P>At a later stage, at Column 1307, the Taoiseach, who was still speaking, said:</P>
    <P>First of all, that the number who want to travel to Ireland will be the same percentage in future as it has <Col N="890" /> been in the past and, of that number, Aerlínte will get the same percentage as it has got up to this.  Is not that a reasonably conservative basis of estimation and, on it, the experts available to the board of management of this company have calculated that they will make a substantial cash profit?</P>
    <P>At a later stage, he asked leave to clear up any misunderstandings about the Aerlínte operations to date, that is, to July, 1959.  At Column 1308, the Taoiseach expressed the view:</P>
    <P>The experience of every airline shows that it takes three years to get a new service &ldquo;out of the red&rdquo;. A substantial loss in the first year, with heavy development expenditure inevitably arising, a much smaller loss in the second year and practically level in the third year is the established pattern, and into profits then in the fourth year.  That has been the experience of Aer Lingus.  It is the experience of most airlines.  It is assumed it will be the experience of Aerlínte.</P>
    <P>He came back again to his advisers:</P>
    <P>As I have said, the accountants and experts of the company sat down in advance to calculate what the receipts and outlay would be.  Up to the present they have been shown to be extraordinarily accurate.  I was at one time disposed to contest the reliability of their estimation.  I have certainly withdrawn from that position. They have shown themselves to be able to forecast these matters with considerable skill and accuracy.  It is these same experts who, projecting their calculations into the future upon the assumptions I have given the Dáil, have given us this expectation of a cash profit which will enable them, over some period, to repay these initial deficits and then commence to earn profits.  These calculations assume the complete writing-off of the investment in the aircraft in a period of ten years.</P>
    <P>Later he spoke of the capital that Aerlinte requires.  The first item was the purchase of aircraft and the second was <Col N="891" /> the training of personnel.  There is the position as disclosed two years ago. Cash profit was the expectation and not the writing-off of the investment in 10 years.</P>
    <P>What did the three Boeings in operation on the trans-Atlantic service cost? I understand they cost over £2,000,000 each with spares&mdash;an investment of £6,000,000.  Of course, Aerlinte has not one shilling to put into the purchase of these aircraft.  It had to be supplied. The money was partly supplied out of the profits I made on the sale of the Constellations many years ago. Now the £6,000,000 investment has to be written-off over 10 years and in the third year there is to be a possible deficit of the order of £80,000 on operations only.</P>
    <P>How long do the Boeings last?  Apart altogether from the question of being outmoded, when have they to be taken out of service?  After how many years? I have heard that they have as short a life as three years but I do not know what it is and I should like to be correct. Have we to face this position, that we engage in an investment of £6,000,000 for three Boeings every &ldquo;something&rdquo; year, say, every third year?  If so, we know where we are. The State are putting up, for the purchase of the aircraft, and their spares, something in the neighbourhood of £1½ million to £2,000,000 a year.  Are they to continue to do that, even if the company gets to the point of making only a profit, say, of £100,000 a year?</P>
    <P>This is a matter which should be clarified.  The Taoiseach was completely confident some years ago of a cash profit &mdash;&ldquo;a substantial cash profit&rdquo;, were his words.  Our whole investment is to be written off in a ten-year period.  As I understand it, the investment is about £6,000,000 and I do not know when that has to be repeated.  I want to get the matter into the framework of the ten years in which the whole investment is to be written off.  I suppose it will be written off as the capital in C.I.E. was written off, simply abandoned.  The taxpayer will shoulder this debt again.</P>
    <P>Most people are very happy about Aer Lingus.  It has all the appearances <Col N="892" /> of being a very well directed company. They certainly receive great tributes from those who travel on Aer Lingus and there is no criticism of them in regard to efficiency and courtesy.  Most people had the belief that Aer Lingus was working at a profit, a profit which included the airports.  Of course, the airports are part of their assets.  It is only to be expected that the air services themselves will get whatever losses there may be in relation to the capital involved in the two airports, and there may be a third airport one of these days.  I should like the chairman of the Board when he is addressing the shareholders to say what is involved in the whole air business, Aer Lingus and the three airports. Then there is this terrible handicap to be put on operations that otherwise might be profitable, of Aer Lingus being in conjunction with Aerlínte.</P>
    <P>In the background there is another thing which ordinarily is passed over. In the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;it may be transferred now to this Estimate&mdash; there is quite a substantial sum for meteorological services and for some reason in the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs there is another item of expenditure&mdash;a substantial one also&mdash;for meteorological services.  No aircraft could operate safely without the provision of these services and they benefit the people using these services.  Has any apportionment ever been made, even notionally, of what the air services, if they were making reasonable profits, might be expected to pay to relieve the tax-payers of their burden for meteorological services?  As far as I know, they are simply a charge on the taxpayer for the benefit of the country and the people visiting it.  I do suggest that in any business calculation with regard to air services there should be an item included in the accounts of some apportionment of the expenses of meteorological services against these concerns.  Yet they do not pay anything in respect of these services.  If only notionally the account should be built up to see what the concerns should pay if they were run under business control.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the <Col N="893" /> Verolme Cork Dockyard Company, generally referred to as the Cork Shipyard Company.  The Minister said he was hopeful that this company, with its magnificent equipment and up-to-date management, would be able to do everything with regard to the repair of ships and possibly the building of future ships for Irish Shipping.  I want to know where we are with regard to this company.  When the Verolme enterprise was being inaugurated the present Taoiseach took with him to the Netherlands a group of journalists, and quite a following of Party supporters, and they had a great day out in the Netherlands, at the end of which the Taoiseach&mdash;he was then the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;spoke of the great gesture that this Dutch company was making in investing their capital in this country and developing their enterprise.</P>
    <P>We have since tried to find out, from the Minister for Finance, how much Irish money was put into this project and how much foreign money was put in.  He has refused to answer.  Yesterday I asked if he would state the amount of external capital involved and he referred me to a previous answer and did not reply.  I further asked whether the commitments of the Industrial Credit Corporation had increased beyond the figure of £4.6 millions which was stated to be the commitment of the Industrial Credit Corporation on 31st March, 1959.  That was stated by Dr. Beddy in his address to the 26th annual meeting of the company. So the great gesture which Mr. Verolme made was that he came across and got £4½ million of our money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister praised the company and conveyed the impression that it was a great concern, with magnificent techniques and so on. In a great concern with a great reputation, I think we should find that as well as Ireland having £4½ millions in it, they should have an equal amount, £ for £, in it, too.  We do not know.  That information has been denied to us.</P>
      <P>One of the last things the Minister dealt with was the Shannon industrial area.  I asked him a question about that and the information I got was that after a number of years the greatest employment given at any time was the employment of 724 people.  That is the highest employment that has been given in manufacturing, processing and the production of goods for export.  I also asked the Minister for information on the production of goods for export taking place in the Shannon industrial area which was set up, and has been very much boosted, to encourage firms to start factories in that area.  Great incentives were given for the production of goods for export.  From the Minister and the manager of the concern, we have heard many ecstatic statements about the terrific employment which would be given there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I addressed a question to the Minister asking for the figures in regard <Col N="895" /> to exports from the Shannon Industrial Zone.  In his reply, the Minister stated that records were commenced on 1st July, 1961, and such figures will be available in the future.  Whether it is relevant or not, we are then afforded the information that: &ldquo;In the 12 months ended 31st March, 1961, 753,350 lbs. of goods produced by the factories were exported by air.  I await correction but from that I calculate that in 12 months, the production so far as exports are concerned amounted to 300 tons of goods and we employed 724 people.  Yet, reading the speeches of the Minister, one would have thought there would be a revival of the Irish industrial community.  The Minister tells us in this answer about the variety of goods being produced there and the number of firms.  That that concern will be a success is everyone's wish but the prospects do not appear to be bright.</P>
    <P>I also asked the Minister what was the State involvement in all this.  I know we are building factories and supplying industrial bays and apparently we are now embarking on the provision of houses for workers.  Up to date the amount of money involved is just short of £1,000,000.  There are over 13 bays and one factory engaged in manufacture for export.  I understand that very good incentives were given, that the provision of the site was free and that the erection of the factories was assisted to a great extent by the State.  I do not suppose they get any remuneration from the people occupying them, at least not any such return as would remunerate them for the money involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what exactly is the burden the taxpayer is bearing. We could then get some approach to a decision as to whether or not it is worthwhile.  If we take the figure at £1,000,000 between loans and grants in aid, leaving out depreciation and everything else, and if we take the number of workers at 700, it means that our investment is equivalent to about £2,000 per person employed.  I wonder is that correct?  I wonder what are the prospects for the future of this whole concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> In that connection, it will be remembered of course that although we were promised 100,000 new jobs under a get-cracking Government, the reality has been that we are 51,000 jobs down between the employment figures for this year and 1956.  There are 51,000 fewer people in employment now than there were in 1956. Taking the figure of 724 people employed in the Shannon area, it will take far too long for any Government to catch up on the other 50,000 jobs. All the extravagance in the industrial area resulted in 724 as the maximum employment given there.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad yesterday, Senator O'Brien gave as a calculation that he thought we might get 7,000 new people into employment in a year&mdash; 7,000 new jobs from a Government who start, as I say, with a deficit of 51,000 jobs.  Even if that estimate by Senator O'Brien were not too optimistic and even if that continued year by year it would be seven years before the Government caught up on the missing workers, on the 51,000 people who were in employment in 1956 and are no longer in employment.  We can suppose that the 724 are counted in Senator O'Brien's 7,000 jobs to be occupied this year.  That is a poor contribution but let us not deride any contribution that brings employment. The country requires every man-jack who can be kept in employment in any way in the new circumstances that face us.</P>
    <P>It is very wrong to have such a hullaballoo about this area.  It makes thinking people afraid for the future when they hear the Minister getting ecstatic over the new development in the Shannon area, and when they read hysterical articles written about it.  The truth emerges in the answer to my question of December last, which is that the highest employment was 300 but that it was expected it would be 724 by the end of the year.  That is the contribution to the people who are looking for a fulfillment of a promise of 100,000 new jobs, starting with a deficit of 51,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister stands over all these State-sponsored bodies.  There is a line of thought in this country that the <Col N="897" /> State-sponsored bodies are a great thing, doing magnificent work, that they are almost a model for and a challenge to private enterprise and that the private sector is sadly lacking in enterprise, development and everything else in comparison with these State-sponsored bodies.  The picture the Minister's speech gives is entirely different from that.</P>
    <P>I am not at this moment to be taken as criticising these bodies and the work they are doing.  I do not know what handicaps they are labouring under, but I do know that the results are disappointing. I am particularly concerned over a really good organisation, the Electricity Supply Board, which, by bad management, mainly due to interference by a Government Department, has been brought to the point when it is no longer holding pride of place amongst State-sponsored bodies and is certainly no longer in its old position of being able to remunerate all the capital given to it because of the heavy obligations under which certain statutes have put it.</P>
    <P>There is room in this country for private enterprise as well as for the State companies, but the comparison should be made on a proper basis.  If we are going to compare State-sponsored bodies and private enterprise concerns, then we ought to put the same standards on both and we ought to demand from those who are in charge the same clarity in regard to their operations as one would get from the chairman of a company addressing his shareholders.  We have not got that in the 60 pages of notes or in the Minister's opening statement yesterday. We have not got all the information we asked for.  We have not got all the information a shareholder would be entitled to get from the chairman of a company or a director on the board. I hope that the Minister will give us this information before the debate closes.  Even though it is depressing, let us have the figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked recently had any examination been made as to why Irish industry&mdash;that is private industry&mdash;was not competitive.  We got no <Col N="898" /> answer to that except that it would not be accepted that private industry in this country was not fully competitive. I would ask now has any examination been made as to why these companies, which have got tremendous advantages over private enterprise companies, have not made a better hand of their work? It may be that there is an explanation. It may be that they are worthy of support. It is a good thing for the country that most of them were started because private enterprise would never have availed; but, in all the circumstances of their establishment, they ought to show far better results than they have shown.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond read out here a statement made by the Minister at a meeting in Cork in April of this year. It was a fantastic lot of nonsense saying that this country was almost running on noiseless wheels as far as heavy coaches were concerned and there would be buses on the road which would stop at a few intermediate points only.  Deputy Desmond asked, quite reasonably, where would they get the passengers? He said he did not know.  We are to have roomy, well padded, luxurious, well lit equipment and, at the end of all that, the Minister looked forward to the day when there would be a whole lot of flying fields all over the place so that private flying could be indulged in.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought really to come down out of the clouds in which he placed himself in the speech Deputy Desmond read.  Any social occasion goes to the Minister's head.  He is affected by society and dinners in the same way as the Priestesses in Delphi used to be affected by the vapours that came up out of the caverns.  The Minister indulges in similar utterances.  But the Priestesses were a rather peculiar crowd.  They depended for their reputation not so much on what they said but on gifted interpreters who made some sort of sense out of their nonsense. I do not know whether the Minister has such an interpreter.  I certainly do not aim to occupy that post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNJByrne" hpid="Mr. T. Byrne Mr. T. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present when the Minister introduced his Estimate yesterday but I see in this <Col N="899" /> morning's paper that he is hopeful that, within a very short number of years, C.I.E. will be a solvent concern. In so far as that may be brought about by a reduction in the losses hertofore incurred on uneconomic sections of C.I.E. operations, I welcome that forecast. In so far as the forecast may be based upon an expectation of continuously increasing profits from road passenger services, and particularly from those operating in Dublin city, I suggest we can pay too high a price for the solvency of C.I.E.</P>
      <P>I want to know from the Minister when will the fleecing of the Dublin public by C.I.E. cease?  When will the state of affairs cease under which the Dublin public are financing the uneconomic operations of C.I.E. in rural areas?  The spiral rises too high.  If one looks at C.I.E. accounts over the past four years one sees a continuously increasing profit from road passenger services, both rural and city.  Everybody knows that the really profitable services are those operated in the city where there is a heavy demand.  C.I.E. does not break down its passenger services as between rural and city areas.  It goes without saying that rural services catering for isolated areas cannot run at a profit.</P>
      <P>The last available report for C.I.E. is that for the year ended 31st March, 1960.  In that year there was a profit on road passenger services of £860,000. I venture to suggest that Dublin city services are yielding a profit of as much as £1,000,000 per year to C.I.E. That is too much money for C.I.E. to make out of the Dublin public.  Fares in Dublin are outlandishly high. Services in may cases are inadequate. We must strive to avoid a situation which has developed in certain European countries in which there is a clash of interests between town and country.  It would be most undesirable that such a clash should develop here. But there are signs that it is coming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If State organisations like C.I.E. and the E.S.B. continue to fleece the Dublin public that clash of interests must inevitably ensue.  Such a clash would be socially undesirable.  It <Col N="900" /> would not advance the national interest.  Fares to the Dublin Corporation housing schemes on the outskirts of this city average 9d.  Most of our industries are located in the centre of the city.  These dormitory suburbs of ours are not as self-contained as are similar suburbs in England and the people living in them have to travel considerable distances to work.  Many a Dublin worker is paying more than £1 per week in bus fares travelling to his place of employment. If the services provided were fully adequate the grounds for complaint might not be so considerable.</P>
    <P>Despite numerous representations to C.I.E. by the Dublin Corporation requesting workers' fares, reduced rates for old aged pensioners, special seaside services from Corporation housing schemes, no satisfaction has been obtained.  The fact is most Dublin people are grossly dissatisfied, first, with the services provided by C.I.E. and, secondly, with the outlandishly high fares they have to pay.  One sometimes hears it said that if one broke down the fares on a mileage basis, it would be found that we are providing transport at a lower rate per mile than any of the British municipal bus services. I am not at all convinced that that is a valid or fair comparison.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely valid and it is a fact.  The fares are reasonable in comparison with any British municipal service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNJByrne" hpid="Mr. T. Byrne Mr. T. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fair comparison? I think it is not.  Any profits earned by British municipal concerns usually go to the relief of rates.  That is not so in Dublin.  British municipal concerns provide services on a very large scale.  The average British bus company has much of its fleet tied up and inoperable for the greater part of the day.  These fleets are used mostly for the purpose of providing services to vast industrial estates in the mornings and bringing workers home in the evenings.  C.I.E. have not got to face up to that heavy expense.  I doubt if the wage rates are comparable.  It is well known that British transport concerns find it extremely difficult to obtain <Col N="901" /> labour.  They operate recruiting offices in Dublin and they obviously have to pay a very high rate for the services of their workers.  No one can claim that the staff of C.I.E. in Dublin are getting a princely scale of wages.  It is further a fact that British municipal concerns provide free transport for old age pensioners.  They certainly provide for old age pensioners and disabled persons at very reduced rates.</P>
      <P>Primarily the reason the comparison is not valid is that profits are retained within the ambit of the local authority. I say to the Minister that the time has come when a halt must be called to the C.I.E. continued fleecing of the Dublin public.  We have not got the report of C.I.E. for the year ended 31st March last and it is unfortunate that we have not got more up-to-date figures in dealing with this matter.  Perhaps the Minister has been informally advised of the result of C.I.E. working for that year.  On the basis of his forecast yesterday, it would appear that he has been so advised.  If that is so, I want to know the result of the working of the Dublin services for that year.  Has the profit continued to increase and is it going to increase next year and the year after?  In 1957, the profit was £600,000; in 1960, it was £868,000.  Is it going to top the million pound mark for the year just ended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This business of Dublin carrying the rest of the country on its back in these matters is again obvious in the case of the E.S.B. Dublin consumers of electricity are carrying to a considerable extent the burden of rural electrification.  I think that is bad economics.  Rural electrification is a good thing, but, if it must be subsidised, it ought to be done out of the national revenue and we should not expect Dublin workers, middle-class people and people on social services to pay the outlandish and fantastic meter rents demanded by the E.S.B. It is completely out of proportion and I would ask the Minister if it is not possible to devise a scheme whereby a consumer could buy out his meter. The meter would hardly cost more than £5 or £10 but many consumers <Col N="902" /> pay relatively high meter rents and pay the cost of the meter two or three times over in the course of the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned the matter of meter rents. It has struck me that in many aspects of our life a Garda comes along checking us.  A weights and measure inspector comes and checks our scales but I wonder who checks the E.S.B. meters, or have we to accept the meter as O.K. because it belongs to the E.S.B.?  Deputy Byrne also mentioned the fact that there is discontent among the clerical staffs of C.I.E.  I do not wonder at that when younger men are being promoted over the heads of men who have given a lifetime of service. It is unfair that that should be so. C.I.E. have grandiose schemes in view, but if there is discontent amongst the workers, they will come to nothing.</P>
      <P>In the matter of aviation, I would like to say that our transatlantic services are a credit to the staffs.  Our ground staffs are very efficient and courteous and they leave a very good impression on travellers.  They call it the friendly airline and they can lay good claim to that title.  I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the staffs.  I did have doubts about the advisability of opening the service and I have certain doubts about it still, but if it is a success, it will be the result of the work of the staffs in this country and America.</P>
      <P>In regard to airports, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that we intend to see that the airfield at Oranmore is developed.  The Minister has attended to the needs of Dublin and Cork, but the greatest claim of all can be made for the tourist centre of Galway.  We would have many more travellers and visitors here if we could get over this business of transferring from train to train or from boat to train, as the case may be.  I hope the Minister will come to our assistance, both technically and financially.  We may not ask for £400,000 as was asked for in Cork, but we will be expecting something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the development of Galway <Col N="903" /> harbour, I would direct the Minister's attention to the need for better facilities there for transatlantic passengers. The Minister may indicate that there is a scheme for the development of Galway harbour but in the interim period something should be done to meet the needs of Galway as a port of call.  Galway is half a day nearer to the United States than any other port, a fact which the Minister should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest to the Minister the provision of a suitable tender service to cater for liners coming into Galway harbour.  Cork has got its airport and also a tender service.  It is about time that the Minister directed attention to the need for the provision of tenders at Galway harbour.</P>
    <P>Meteorological services are referred to in the Minister's speech.  There is a meteorological station in one of the wettest points in north-west Connaught. Naturally, the reports from that station, at times, give the impression that the area is very wet.  The station is far removed from Galway and people in Galway are often aggravated by reports that give the impression that the season is very wet.  I should like to see a station set up in Galway city or the immediate vicinity, the reports from which would more accurately describe the weather in Galway city. People running guesthouses are inclined to believe that bad weather reports militate against the attractions of the district.</P>
    <P>On the question of guesthouses and grandiose hotels, I consider that first consideration should be given to people who started such establishments in the west without State aid.  They would not consider it fair that the Government should come in and pick the plums.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be brief in my remarks on this Estimate simply because of that fact that I know from my experience in this House that the Minister has no function or control in regard to the State companies which have been the subject of comment in the course of this debate.  A number of State bodies, namely, C.I.E. E.S.B., Irish Shipping, Aer Lingus, and <Col N="904" /> so forth, have been discussed at length by a number of Deputies and it would appear from their remarks as if the Minister were in a position to alter the workings, the policy and the administration of any of those companies. In fact, the Minister has no more power than I have to interfere with the workings of State bodies.</P>
      <P>Questions have been asked in this House, since this new Department was created and the present Minister was appointed, on matters of national or public importance regarding State bodies and the Minister's reply invariably has been &ldquo;I have no function whatever with regard to the matter raised&rdquo;.  Not alone was that his answer in regard to questions which reached the Order Paper but for every question that appeared on the Order Paper five were turned down on the grounds that the Minister refused to handle them at all.  Yet, this very same Minister can appear at Chambers of Commerce dinners in Cork, Galway, Limerick or elsewhere and give more information at those functions on the workings, administration and activities of State bodies than he can give to this House, where he should give it and where daylight would be brought to bear on his statements.</P>
      <P>It is a disgraceful thing to try to hoodwink the people by setting up a Ministry allegedly responsible for transport and power and to find that the Minister appointed has no say whatever over the State companies which are supposedly under his control. I do not see much point, therefore, in delaying the House in dealing with the aspects of the various companies which have been mentioned in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing struck me very forcibly listening today to Deputy McGilligan and reading this morning's paper, that is, that there would appear to be a concerted attack being launched on State companies.  I find that very difficult to understand.  The statement was made here by Deputy McGilligan this morning that these bodies have a tremendous advantage over private enterprise.  Let us be quite clear that as far as private enterprise is concerned, <Col N="905" /> if they were asked to handle what it is the responsibility of some of these State companies to handle, we would be in a worse mess than we are in today.  It was quite open to private enterprise, for instance, to develop our bogs.  I wonder was there any great attraction to private enterprise to move into that particular field? To my mind Bord na Móna has not moved fast enough but it is only now, when Bord na Móna has proved that it has done a tremendous job, that all the jackals and carrion try to move in to attempt to dismember this State body.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary situation is that the Minister who is in this House allegedly to defend the work of such bodies, has no responsibility for these bodies, has no responsibility whatever for these bodies.  The greatest worshipper of private enterprise in the Fianna Fáil Party today is the present Minister for Transport and Power.  He must find himself in a rather extraordinary situation when he has to face a skilled speaker and first-class brain like Deputy McGilligan, who probes the weaknesses&mdash;and there are many &mdash;in the statement of the Minister. The Minister must find himself in a very awkward position in having to defend these companies when he himself believes, as Deputy McGilligan seems to believe, that private enterprise is the be-all and end-all of everything in this country.</P>
    <P>I can go back over speeches by the Minister in the last ten years and give quotation after quotation where he has pointed out that Fianna Fáil's policy for the development of this country is based on private enterprise. There is no greater believer in private enterprise than the Minister.  Surely, then, it is an extraordinary situation to find an unbeliever in the value and advantages of State enterprise forked out into the position as Minister for Transport and Power of having to defend State bodies.  If he does defend these State bodies, he does so with his tongue in his cheek.</P>
    <P>The ideal method of dealing with any of the State or semi-State bodies referred to in the course of this debate <Col N="906" /> is through the medium of a separate debate in this House.  We had an example not so long ago when time was provided for discussion of the affairs of C.I.E.  I believe these State or semi-State bodies must be brought to a greater extent under the control of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is sad to find that the public are not in a position to know the great work being done by many of these bodies, that the people get a wrong slant with regard to that work, that they get only half the information they should get.  These State bodies are not given the confidence of the public, with the result that an opportunity is given to those worshippers of private enterprise to slander them.  Instead of criticising the work of many of these bodies, we should be making an effort here to increase their number, so that fields for development and expansion, which in the past have been in the hands of private enterprise, will be given the proper consideration.</P>
    <P>As future events unfold, it will be shown that this country can make no progress and there can be no safeguard for our limited population unless we order our economic development in a disciplined fashion.  Private enterprise is never disciplined.  The only groups that can bring about an orderly and disciplined expansion are the State and semi-State bodies.  We have had the example of the Committee set up by the Government to inquire into the possibility of agricultural expansion.  That Committee was composed to a great extent of men who were believers in private enterprise. Yet, in the five different fields they explored, they came to the conclusion that only State-sponsored Boards could make the necessary progress. They found that if any progress was to be made, it would have to be through these organs of the State rather than through the existing system of &ldquo;dog eat dog&rdquo; and every man for himself.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in-so-far as these companies are concerned, our aim should be not to try to destroy them or take away public confidence from them, but to improve them by bringing them more under the control of the Oireachtas.  One of the most frustrating <Col N="907" /> things that can happen to the man in the street is to know his Deputy has no functions, cannot interfere, cannot raise a Question in this House in regard to these companies&mdash; cannot, shall we say, bring the autocrats to heel.  If more power were given to this House, so that the public could let off steam, so that these companies could be questioned here, that would get rid of a lot of the criticisms levelled at these State companies.</P>
    <P>I know there are two points of view on this.  There is the argument put forward by the bosses of these companies that they could not function properly if this House had more control.  I do not accept that at all. That is an attempt on the part of some of these semi-State bodies to become completely dictatorial.  I do not want to say too much about it to-day but it is quite evident that public confidence in many of them has been shaken due to back-door methods of recruitment &mdash; the question of &ldquo;I scratch you and you scratch me&rdquo;&mdash; and it would appear that the Minister and this House are not in a position to interfere and see that normal fair play is given in those appointments.  I do not say this House should make those appointments but I do say this House should be in a position of control to see that they are made fairly and that not alone is justice done but that it is seen to be done.</P>
    <P>Sometime ago the Taoiseach said that if there was a volume of opinion in this House which asked for a regular debate on the activities of the State companies, he would be prepared to make time available.  I hope Deputies, especially Deputies in the major Opposition Parties, will accept that offer by the Taoiseach.  That is one way in which we can deal in a fair manner with these companies.  In such a debate as this there are too many State companies involved and it is not possible to deal properly with them in such a varied discussion.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I should like to refer to the Irish shipping industry. Here we have what is described as a semi-State company.  It is an extraordinary <Col N="908" /> thing to find that a number of the ships we own, or are alleged to own, have never yet seen an Irish port. We have them on what I can only describe as hackney work on the high seas, plying between New Zealand and Australia and all over the world.  If we wanted tomorrow to engage in trade with the Middle East and African countries, we would not be in a position to do so.  We are not in a position to carry our own goods.  If we wanted to send Irish eggs to Ghana or any place else, they are transhipped at Liverpool.  We have no direct service to deal with our own trade.</P>
    <P>It is absolute nonsense for us to be plying the seas of the world, making a few shillings here and there by carrying other people's produce, when we have not ships at home to carry our own goods and build up a trade with the Middle East and African countries which would give us at least some independence and bargaining power if we have to face the spectre of joining the Common Market.  The Minister should examine that matter very closely, as I understand Irish Shipping suffered a very heavy loss last year.</P>
    <P>I have one other point, which is in connection with this new dockyard in Cork.  Would anybody suggest that the Taoiseach has been taking a long-term view of developments?  He talked very glibly here the other night about the rationalisation that would have to take place in Irish industry. He said it was essential that it take place.  It is extraordinary that he can make a statement like that in view of the serious position in Belfast, which is on its way down.  In spite of that, he has decided to give at least £4½ million of the taxpayers' money to a foreign company in Cork.  I do not think there is any sensible rationalisation about that.  I do not think it is a sensible approach towards ending Partition either.  It was done purely on an opportunistic basis.</P>

      <P>I mentioned it only in passing.  I have said everything I want to say.  I notice that the rose in the Minister's lapel began to wilt today after the criticism levelled at him here by Deputy McGilligan.  In conclusion, I say to him he should have the honesty at this stage to tell Deputies bluntly that he is no believer in State enterprise, that he hates it, that he is a lover of private enterprise in its most reactionary form and that it is sheer bluff to have him in the position of being Minister for Transport and Power and allegedly in control of the development of some of the most important State bodies. The sooner the Taoiseach removes him to County Monaghan and leaves him there for good, the better.</P>

      <P>It has been an interesting debate on this Department, some of it very destructive and some of it constructive.  I think I ought to begin by saying a few words about the functions of the Minister and my Department in relation to the State companies.  A number of Deputies appear to be confused.  Some say I have no power and some make use of the refusal of the Ceann Comhairle to allow certain questions to be answered as a proof that I have no power over the State companies.  The powers, of course, which I have are conferred on me by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to make clear to Deputy McQuillan that I have never said I was in favour only of private enterprise.  Where private enterprise fails to play a useful promotional part in the life of the community I believe in the creation of State companies and I have always so believed.  Therefore I can perhaps dispose of that interpretation of anything I have said in relation to State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many varying views expressed in democratic circles as to what constitutes Ministerial and Parliamentary control of State companies. Very different views are held by people of the same political party both here and in other genuine democracies.  In my view the only way to ensure a reasonable control is on an empirical, practical and reasonable basis.  It is <Col N="910" /> utterly impossible to devise a set of philosophical or legal rules which would precisely define the relations between a Minister of a Department, the members of the Oireachtas and a State company.  I do not think it has ever been done successfully.</P>
    <P>In relation to the powers of the Dáil I would mention that on the Bills which are initiated governing the general activities of these companies varying points of view can be expressed and on the introduction of amending Bills the conduct of the companies as they have existed up to that time can be fully examined and discussed in the Dáil.  There is also the debate on the annual Estimate on which a number of matters can be raised.  Complaints can be voiced and the Minister, in all suitable cases where he has not the time to reply in regard to each complaint, will refer the complaint to the company concerned.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach proposed during the course of the present Dáil that Deputies, if they wish to discuss the operations of a State company, can move a resolution to discuss the annual report of that company.  That has already been done in the case of C.I.E.  This enables Deputies to bring forward really serious criticisms of the conduct of a company or of its financial operations.</P>
    <P>Finally it is always possible for the Government, if they suspect that a company is not being properly directed, to form either a commission or a committee to inquire into its workings and to report back to the Dáil.  An example of that is the Beddy Committee Report on Internal Transport which related largely to C.I.E.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's duty to stimulate debate in the Dáil by speeches he makes in between Estimates and by answering as many questions as he can that will not give rise to undue interference in the day to day affairs of the company.  He has to rely on the Ceann Comhairle in that regard and I think a reasonable balance is being preserved.  Since July, 1959, I have answered numerous questions covering a very wide range of activities in regard to these companies.  A great <Col N="911" /> deal of information has been given but the fact remains that a balance has to be struck.  If the tradition grew that it would be possible for the Minister to interfere from day to day with the operation of a particular bus or train service or an electricity service, the staff of the Department would have to be increased by many hundreds to undertake all the investigations. The whole purpose of creating a State company, which is a combination of private enterprise and Government directed enterprise, would be completely lost if the directors and operatives of the companies felt that from week to week they could be constantly interfered with.  All this has been discussed many times.  As I have said, there is no perfect solution in regard to the degree of control by a Minister over a company and the degree of privacy of that company. It is a matter for practical evaluation.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have suggested that we do nothing in regard to these companies, that they sail along year after year without the officers of the Department or the Minister taking any responsibility. It should be recorded that the Minister exercises very definite control through the appointment of members of the board and through all the detailed examination that takes place when these companies engage in short or long-term borrowing, where a guarantee by the Minister for Finance is required or where the capital has actually to be raised by the Minister for Finance.  Again the audited accounts of each of these companies are subject to scrutiny in my Department and questions arising from increases in costs are examined in very great detail with the boards concerned because of the fact that these companies have either already borrowed State capital or are likely to borrow more capital.  Therefore, from week to week and from month to month there is very close contact between the Minister, his Department and the higher officers of the boards of these companies.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, the Minister has the duty, again directed by the Dáil, to make sure that the policies <Col N="912" /> of these companies are consonant with State policy as a whole.  Frequently new directives have to be given to them as to the part they should play in the national economy, and conferences have to be held in relation to new legislation not only in regard to the raising of capital but also in regard to the general character of the companies and the work they perform.</P>
    <P>Equally, it is the duty of the Minister to ensure that, as the State has advanced very large sums to these companies, in a general way, the service performed by these companies is adequate and efficiently operated and that it bears a favourable relationship to the promotion of the national economy.  That involves very frequent contact, first of all, between the Minister and the chairman of the board of each of these companies, which is conducted on a regular basis, and, secondly, between the officers of the Department and the higher officers of these companies on a great many matters, including those I have already indicated.</P>
    <P>Next, I come to the more difficult problem of the supervision of these companies when it comes to day to day activities.  That is a no man's land about which a great many words have been written but nobody has made any final pronouncement.  I am only going to give a very brief description of my attitude towards it, which I do not think differs very much from that of my predecessors, except in this regard, that this Department has been set up because of the multiplicity of activities involved in the operation of these companies and in the other activities of the Department which were fully outlined and given to Deputies.  Because of the growth of industry, it would be quite impossible for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to deal with these bodies and at the same time do his own work.</P>
    <P>First of all, in regard to the supervision of these companies and apart from the matters which I have already indicated, there is the question of the charges made to the community by these companies.  They are directed <Col N="913" /> to pay their way.  It is a policy which has been established and accepted by this House that these companies should pay their way.  Some of them are not required to repay their capital under the law.  Most of them are required to pay their way and be efficient.</P>
    <P>Occasionally in relation to some particular company, there may be some element of subsidy introduced for a specific purpose.  When companies raise their charges, it is the duty of the Minister, while ensuring that under the Acts of the Dáil concerned these companies should pay their way, to make sure that the charges are equitably distributed, to enquire in a general way whether in estimating the increased charge regard has been had to all the reasonable factors involved and that the company is not being wildly over-pessimistic or optimistic in assessing what increased charge is necessary.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I should make it clear that the E.S.B., C.I.E. and other companies are directed to pay their way and are permitted by this House to increase their charges without any leave from the Minister or the Deputies in this House.  That is being done by common agreement between the principal parties in this House since the establishment of the State.  In the case of the E.S.B. the relevant legislation was passed in 1927.  The reason is surely clear to everybody.  If this House could control the charges made by these companies, they would become eventually the prey of political interference of the grossest kind.  As a result, they would lose more and more money and more and more subsidies would be required until they ceased to serve any purpose.  The fact that they would lose more in larger and larger amounts would simply involve a very heavy burden on the taxpayers of this country.  For that reason, although the Minister may inquire into the equitability of the charges, it is very important that the companies are left free to make the charges they think are right in the circumstances in order that the charges made may be as low as possible.</P>
    <P>The next matter in which the Minister <Col N="914" /> has some indirect control is in regard to the charges made against these companies of inefficiency.  When one considers the huge turn-over of these companies, over a period of a year the number of complaints is very very small.  These companies are, on the whole, very well run and the public are quite willing to testify to that even though one reads complaints in the newspapers and even though complaints are rightly raised in this House during the course of the Estimate and at other times through Parliamentary Question.</P>
    <P>If serious complaints are made, these are discussed with the companies concerned and if complaints of a repetitive nature take place, then they are collected over a period and the matter is given special attention. Routine complaints made by Deputies or other people in the community in the ordinary way are sent to the companies concerned for attention and reply direct by them.  If that was not done and if the impression was given that I, as Minister, or the officers of my Department had the duty of dealing with every single individual complaint in relation to the operation of every single company, then we could treble the size of the Department.  You would get the kind of inevitable political interference with the operation of these companies, which is very, very undesirable and so we look after these complaints according to their seriousness. If they happen to be repetitive, then the matter is raised in the usual way in the course of periodic conferences held with the officers of the Department and these companies in regard to their general progress and in relation to their capital requirements.</P>
    <P>Finally, as far as State companies are concerned, in the end they depend for their success on the character of the Chairman and Board of Directors and on the efficiency and zeal of the staffs.  I think we are fortunate in that matter in this country.  Taking the companies as a whole, we are very fortunate in the character of the staffs, the Executives and the Chairmen. Much depends upon the ability of the officers of the Department to have useful exchanges of views and useful discussions <Col N="915" /> with the higher officers of the Department so that the atmosphere can be preserved in which the companies themselves operate without interference; but that liaison can be maintained which is so valuable.  The Minister can then be satisfied that there is efficiency, or if there is inefficiency that it is being remedied.  When the Minister provides further capital, he can be reasonably certain that the capital already provided is being properly used.  A great deal of this depends on the right character of personal relationships.</P>
    <P>I think I have given the House a fair description of the work of the Department.  I have issued on the working of the Department notes.  In that connection, I should say that the reason I thought that that need not be repeated next year was the fact that a great deal of the material in the notes relates to the activities of the marine section, the meteorological and other sections of the Department.  The notes are of a very detailed character.</P>
    <P>I wanted to make sure that everybody in the House knew exactly what the Department was doing because many of its activities receive very little publicity.  I wanted to have a record of the very vital operations that continue from year to year.  I wanted Deputies to know all these activities and have some idea of the relationship between the Department and State companies in the formal sense. If there should be some request for a modified set of notes prior to the next Estimate, I should be glad to assist the members of the House in the best way possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan made a number of observations on the operation of these State companies.  I am afraid that it would be quite impossible for me to reply in detail because it would take several hours.  What it really amounts to is this.  Deputy McGilligan wanted me to give in detail a great many figures in relation to the operation of these companies for the financial year ending 31st March, 1961.  I simply am not able to do that.  I asked the powers <Col N="916" /> that be to postpone this debate until as late as possible so that the provisional results of the operations of the companies for the last financial year would be available and so that I could give some idea of the progress of the companies.</P>
    <P>I do not think the date of this Estimate could be postponed any further. The accounts of the companies are not ready and, therefore, it is quite impossible for me to give detailed replies to all the questions put to me by Deputy McGilligan.  I can, however, make certain observations in regard to the suggestion he has made that many of these companies would appear to be shaky financially and that the public are not being told what the true financial position is.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy McGilligan wanted to shake the confidence of the people in these very well-run State companies or what his purpose was.  He seemed at one point to be questioning the whole value and idea of peat-fired power stations.  As far as I can gather, the Fine Gael Party as a whole would like to close all the peat-fired power stations.  It is quite clear from what Deputy McGilligan says that he is not prepared to justify any extra cost that may arise from using a native fuel in this country instead of importing either crude oil to be processed here or importing coal.  That definitely appears to be Fine Gael policy.  It is just as well that everybody should know it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan clearly suggested that the benefits to be derived both from the wages of the workers and the whole of the set-up of Bord na Móna were not worthwhile because the electric current might cost a little bit more, particularly in certain years if the weather was bad and the peat stations were not paying their interest.  I think that can be left to the country at large to decide.  I know what the answer will be.</P>

      <P>First of all, Deputy McGilligan referred to the losses sustained at Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport.  I should say in that connection that with the growth of the turn-over of these airports the position is becoming more satisfactory.  In the case of Dublin Airport, for example, the operating deficits during the years of the Coalition Government were in the neighbourhood of £55,000 to £65,000 and they have now gone down to £3,867, in spite of the change-over to jet planes and the difficulties which were forecast.  Everybody prophesied that Shannon Airport would experience grave financial difficulties but the operating surplus went up from £74,000 in 1959-60 to £148,000 in 1960-61.  I should make it clear to Deputy McGilligan that the meteorological navigational services performed by the State are regarded as part of the normal infra-structure of the State operation both in this country and in every other country.</P>
      <P>I should also again repeat that no airports pay in Europe.  We have made a very complete examination of the efficiency of Dublin and Shannon Airports.  We have compared them as far as we possibly could with airports of similar size in Europe.  The results have been shown to be satisfactory. Our airports are run as economically as possible, consistent with safety.  If you work out the figure of the cost per transportation unit in terms of landing costs, administration and navigational costs for Dublin and Shannon Airports you will find they compare very favourably with other airports of the same sort or size abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises as to whether it would be possible for us to raise landing fees in this country so that these airports, in addition to paying their way on the operational side, taking them all together, could also pay depreciation and interest.  I do not think it is possible.  I suppose that the Minister in charge of aviation in every country is looking around at his neighbours and saying the same thing. In the modern world where the aeroplane is becoming an ordinary feature of travel, unless everybody decides that the public should not be expected <Col N="918" /> to pay losses on airports, I do not think we can afford to go any further than we have gone.</P>
    <P>We have raised the landing charges at Shannon Airport very considerably recently.  We are examining the position at Dublin Airport.  Landing charges affect not only Aer Lingus and Aerlínte but also the many foreign air services coming into our country.  They would also militate against our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan suggested that my report on C.I.E. was cloaking the true facts.  I know Deputy McGilligan is a very busy man.  It is a curious thing that apparently he has never read the speeches I made when I first took charge of the Department and when I made it absolutely clear to everybody that C.I.E. had made an enormous loss up to the time of the 1958 Act.  I several times said, and gave the figures, that even if C.I.E. at the moment &mdash; as of the post-1958 period &mdash; were completely to wipe out its losses, there would remain a very large amount to be paid by the taxpayer in the shape of interest and sinking fund on the capital that could not be remunerated by C.I.E.</P>
    <P>I made it clear that one of the basic reasons for putting the 1958 Act into operation was to end this appalling drain upon the community, that it was utterly wrong, in a country with our national income, for a railway enterprise to lose £24 million in ten years. I gave the figures at that time of what the additional imposition on the taxpayer was besides the subsidy of £1,175,000 now granted for a limited period of five years.  I made it absolutely clear that it would take a great many years before the whole of the past losses were wiped out, so far as the taxpayer was concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan is quite right that the amount paid in compensation by the State will, even after C.I.E. begins to pay its way, as I hope it will, represent a contribution to C.I.E. and, as the pensioners pass away, this amount will diminish until finally it vanishes. Therefore, Deputy McGilligan cannot possibly say that, when I refer optimistically to the accounts of C.I.E., I in any way try to hide the position <Col N="919" /> from the people.  The whole purpose of the 1958 Act was to end these colossal losses.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the present financial position of Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.  He wanted to know whether the surplus of Aer Lingus was simply an operating surplus or whether it included depreciation.  I referred to the surplus for the year ending 31st March, 1961.  We announced that the surplus of Aer Lingus was £180,000 and the deficit of Aerlínte would be £80,000 and the two taken together would be paying their way.  Deputy McGilligan wanted to know whether the £180,000 included depreciation.  It does include depreciation and also the superannuation services.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy McGilligan need worry about the financial structure of Aer Rianta.  Aer Lingus is gradually developing financially and its general financial prospects seem to me to be bright.  In regard to Aerlínte, Deputy McGilligan suggested that the Taoiseach was in some way deceiving the Dáil when he prognosticated the possibility of the transatlantic service making good cash profits.  Deputy McGilligan should be reasonable.  It was very hard to predict the first year's loss, the second year's loss and the third year's financial position. Although the losses were slightly greater than those predicted, the fact remains the loss has been successfully reduced from £800,000 and £500,000 down to £80,000.  I can assure Deputy McGilligan if he thinks he is going to cry out and deride the Minister for Transport and Power, and his predecessor, because of the loss in the current financial year, I predict he will be making a mistake because Aerlínte is carrying something like 74 per cent. more passengers than last year and is doing extremely well.</P>
    <P>I think the promoters of any private company, by the time four years have passed, would agree that the predictions made by the experts who provided the information for the Taoiseach, allowing for all the variations that could occur, were well calculated. It would have been very difficult to predict more accurately.  He need not suggest that there is something hidden <Col N="920" /> or wrong going on.  Of course Deputy McGilligan loves to act like a gadfly stinging all around him, trying to create a feeling of suspicion that something is wrong somewhere with the services that are promoted in this country in order to develop its economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also mentioned Irish Shipping.  All companies dip into reserves when freight rates go down. Freight rates have shown a cyclical tendency for many years, both in between the World Wars and since the last war.  The actual position is that the financial stability of Irish Shipping is very sound indeed.  The company has assets of over £13,000,000 in which the State has invested £8.8 million.  The rest of the assets have been earned by the company itself. The position now is that Irish Shipping Limited is expected to finance the replacements of its ships out of its own reserve and depreciation funds and the Department of Finance will provide capital for the expansion of the fleet beyond the figure at which it stood a year ago.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my Estimate speech, the two new vessels being built are reckoned to be able to earn both depreciation and interest on the capital invested, taking freight rates as they were last year.  In other words, they are reckoned to be extremely efficient ships and able to pay their way.  Any ships built in the future with money for which I have responsibility with the Minister for Finance, will be of the most modern type and will not be built unless there is a prospect of their paying their way.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan asked if Bord na Móna paid depreciation and interest or repaid its advances.  Bord no Móna has been repaying interest and principal. There is no need for Deputy McGilligan to suggest there is something wrong financially with Bord na Móna, or that the company is not really working well.  Operating surpluses of Bord na Móna in the past few years have been as follows: 1955-56, £637,000; 1956-57, £671,000; 1957-58, £781,000.  There was a loss in 1958-59, because of bad weather, of £408,000 and in 1959-60 there was <Col N="921" /> a surplus of £969,000 and last year there was a surplus of £835,608.  As I said, Bord na Móna is regularly paying its interest and depreciation and as long as the weather remains reasonably normal and average it should be able to do so in the future.  There is no need for Deputy McGilligan to cast these doubts on its efficiency.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also said a lot about the E.S.B.  I want to make one thing absolutely clear, and that is that the reason for the recent increase in charges has almost nothing to do with the fact that for a period there was some excess generating capacity.  The excess generating capacity arose because consumption did not increase in the manner predicted by all concerned before certain stations were put into commission.  The consumption did not increase because of the crisis for which the Coalition was almost entirely responsible.  For a time, the E.S.B. was paying certain sums in interest and principal on stations that were not operating economically.  Then, very quickly, the consumption increased and at the moment the consumption is ahead of what was predicted three years ago.  The E.S.B., without any prompting or pushing from me, has had to revise its programme of generating capacity upwards.  There was no suggestion whatever that at the moment the E.S.B. is, or in the last two years was, losing money because of generating stations that were not earning their way.</P>
    <P>The increase in charges is due partly to the growth of the rural electrification network and as I have already indicated there is a deficit in the accounts of £529,000 a year arising from the failure of the Coalition Government to pay the subsidies on rural electrification construction during their period of office.  I have been asked why did we not simply restore that annual payment and put it on the current Budget.  That was a matter for the Government as a whole in relation to budgetary policy.  We felt that as the increased charges for electricity would be only very small, particularly in the case of the very small householders &mdash; amounting to 2d. or 3d. a week &mdash; that we would be setting a bad <Col N="922" /> precedent in giving State companies the impression that they could do without subsidies and then quite suddenly that a whole round of subsidies should be paid to cover past deficiencies.</P>
    <P>We want to encourage State companies to be as efficient as possible.  We felt that if we wanted to spend £529,000 in the current Budget, representing a contribution on interest towards a capital deficit, it would be much better to spend the same amount on greater social services, on educational facilities and, above all, on agriculture.  All those factors together would enable the people who felt the charges impinge upon them to raise their incomes.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGilligan failed to mention, the amount spent on agriculture in the current year is nearly two and a half times what it was in the last full year of the Coalition Government. Social services have been increased steadily during the past four years.  We felt that was the way to do it and not to put this added impost on the taxpayers which would be non-effective in a general way and would have no effect on the rest of the economy.  So we decided it was best to allow the charges to be increased.</P>
    <P>I should also make it clear that the people on the Fine Gael side of the House talk as if this were the only time electricity charges were increased. Electricity charges were increased in 1956, when the price of cattle had plunged, by a very large percentage in a very short period.  They were increased after Deputy Norton, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, had been solemnly warned in 1955 that if the subsidy for rural electrification were removed, increases in charges were inevitable.</P>
    <P>I have not got the reference here but it could easily be found that Deputy Norton, the then Minister, was asked by Deputy Lemass whether he would be willing to publish whatever comment the E.S.B. made on this decision not to continue the subsidy. Deputy Norton declined.  He was quite entitled to refuse this information if he so wished, but he said he believed the charges need not go up, and a year later they went up by eight or ten per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> I think I have dealt fully with the observations made by Deputy McGilligan.  I want to assure him that these companies, taken as a whole, are successful undertakings, and that the capital invested by the State can be fully justified from the economic and social standpoint.  I do not know if I have time to go into all the points which were raised.</P>

He said the Ceann Comhairle had disallowed a question on the price paid by the E.S.B. for land in County Mayo. Of course the Ceann Comhairle, in his wisdom, always disallows these questions because if the price of the purchase or sale of land were published in the Dáil in relation to the State companies, it would be quite impossible for the State companies to conduct their business efficiently, as everyone knows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies also to contracts.  By Acts of the Dáil, these matters are left to the discretion of the companies concerned and have been for many years, and there is no change in the procedure I refer to. Deputy Lindsay implied that somehow or other the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Transport and Power were concealing something because of a transaction which was alleged to have taken place between the E.S.B. and a relation of the Minister for Lands.  That is typical low-down propaganda.  In actual fact, the Minister for Lands and I have had absolutely no consultations whatever in regard to this matter.  This matter is simply a day to day transaction by the E.S.B.  What Deputy Lindsay may like to know is the fact that the transaction did not take place.  The sale of the land did not take place at the figure he mentioned, or at any other figure.  So perhaps we can now dispose of another of these allegations.</P>

      <Col N="924" /> Deputy P. Byrne referred to the Dublin bus fares and implied that they were at an extravagantly high level in order to subsidise C.I.E. as a whole.  I am glad to tell him that in comparison with London and English provincial fares, they are quite reasonable. I am also glad to tell him that while I know the C.I.E. bus service in Dublin is not absolutely perfect &mdash; and there may be complaints from time to time &mdash; I have had very few complaints of a justifiable character.  If Deputy Byrne goes to any other capital city in Europe and observes the proportion of people who travel to their work standing up in buses or trams, he will find the general standard here &mdash; inevitably with some exceptions &mdash; in which our people are conveyed to and from work is fairly high in relation to the national income of the people as a whole.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Russell referred to the effect of the closing of the West Clare railway and to the general transport position in Limerick and Clare.  I am glad to tell the Deputy, and Deputy Murphy from Clare, that not only have there been commendations of the substitute service published in the <i>Clare Champion</i>&mdash; I shall not read them <Col N="925" /> but they are certainly pleasant commendations &mdash; but on the buses replacing the railway, some 50 per cent. more passengers were carried in April, 1961, than in April, 1960.  More passengers have also been carried on the Tralee-Cahirciveen bus route because the bus offers a more convenient service and the journey takes very little longer than the train did.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the closing of the Derry-Lough Swilly railway.  Railways in scattered mountainy areas are closing in many countries.  As the Deputy knows, a sum of £375,000 was provided by the Government for the improvement of the roads in that area.  Road grants over a four-year period in areas where railways have been closed are under consideration at the moment. Reasonable amounts have already been contributed to meet the immediate needs of the other areas concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the compensation of workers in areas where railways have closed.  I have had very few complaints in that regard. The compensation paid is very reasonable. Where workers find their conditions worsened there are arrangements for arbitration.  In actual fact all this is really a matter for C.I.E. and the trade unions concerned.  I am sure Deputies would wish that it should be left to C.I.E. and the trade unions rather than that I should interfere. I should not interfere unless some general public principle were involved. However, where matters can be satisfactorily settled under the 1958 Act negotiations are best conducted by the trade unions and C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were asked about C.I.E. workers' pensions.  Workers who retired before 1956 contributed 1/- a week and C.I.E. 4/9 per week since 1956, the rates of contribution are 3/-to 6/9d. by C.I.E.  Various alternatives were offered such as a pension for a larger amount for a certain period and a reduction thereafter or a definite rate of pension for life.  Those arrangements <Col N="926" /> have not been changed as a result of the Social Welfare Act.  The pensions are paid on a strictly actuarial basis, ranging from 30/- to 68/- contributory old age pension according to marriageable status and means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless the pensions from C.I.E. drop when they get the £2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an arrangement made by C.I.E. with the unions at the time.  There has been no economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>But the £2 per week was not envisaged at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. To give an example: a worker who retired at 65 on 12th December, 1960, whose income was £10 10s. 4d. per week has an income now, including C.I.E. pension and disability benefit &mdash; the particular worker I cite is entitled to this benefit &mdash; of £5 3s. 9d. per week. When he reaches 70 his income, including old age pension and disability benefit, will be £4 8s. 6d.  That represents a marked improvement on the position heretofore.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde referred to the state of the rolling stock on the Wexford line.  The replacement of out-of-date stock is a slow and expensive business.  It is, however, regularly undertaken.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Esmonde because the Wexford line appears to be rather badly served.  I shall approach C.I.E. again to see whether some new rolling stock might not be provided on this line.  Rolling stock has improved very much on other lines.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch asked that privileged tickets should be restored on the Waterford bus route to Tramore.  That is surely a matter for negotiation between C.I.E. and their staff.  I could not be expected to interfere there.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked about an Order published recently in relation to C.I.E. hotels.  That Order will come before the House for confirmation. Its purpose is to provide a separate company to run the hotels and catering sections of C.I.E.  The intention is that there shall be a special board of directors and an entirely separate administration for the purpose of better promotion and greater efficiency.</P>
      <P>While I have had a certain number of complaints of an isolated character with regard to substitute services, I must admit that the complaints have been very few.  A great many people have told me that the substitute services are operating very successfully. It always takes time to perfect a new service.  I will certainly refer to C.I.E. any complaints received for immediate attention.  Should the complaints be of a serious character I should naturally take the matter up with C.I.E. myself in the course of the regular conferences held in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>The position is constantly under examination by Aer Lingus and I have no doubt that they will continue to examine it.  Deputy Russell also asked about the taxi service at Shannon.  The position is that taxis are licensed to operate from Shannon because of the difficulties experienced when there was free competition which resulted in some people being grossly overcharged and others being undercharged.  There is a waiting list kept and it is operated on a strict priority basis.  When further taxis are required those on the waiting list are notified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should give me that information if he has it. One hint was given to me about one case.  If there is any suggestion of restrictive practices by the licensed taxi drivers the Deputy should give the information to me and I will have the matter investigated.  At the moment I have no information that the number of taxi drivers is insufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond suggested that there was a plenitude of cement at <Col N="929" /> Cork airport.  He was incorrectly informed.  There was a scarcity of cement and that is the sole reason for the postponement of the opening.  I am more than distressed that there have been two successive postponements. One was caused by the unfavourable weather and the other by an industrial dispute which caused a hold-up of cement supplies.  I am one who likes to get things done in time and the new jet runway at Shannon was opened a month in advance of schedule. Although weather conditions were bad there, they did not have the same effect on construction as they had at Cork but if we were able to get one runway opened a month in advance of schedule we should have been able to get Cork open in time, were it not for unavoidable circumstances.  We have been pressing for greater progress and we have had meetings of all the sub-contractors who have to operate together in the provision of the electrical, communication, radio navigational, and telephone systems and other technical facilities of all kinds.  This is an immensely complicated operation and we have had all these contractors together to co-ordinate their activities.  Under the circumstances we have put the 16th October as the earliest possible opening date.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell asked about housing in the Shannon area.  The position is that the Shannon free airport company have been provided with capital to erect 250 houses at Shannon.  That is the number which is considered the absolute minimum required for workers who do not wish to live away from the area.  An enquiry is being held to see what future requirements will be.  That is an involved matter as it takes in the examination of town planning facilities and an examination of habits of working people in a new town area.  The matter will be examined by experts from all the departments and a decision will be made as to future progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Deputy Lynch questioned the size of the vessels in the Irish Shipping fleet.  He suggested that the vesesls were too large.  It is intended to have a fleet of reasonably balanced vessels so that there will be ships of a lower tonnage and ships of higher tonnage.  The size of vessels is being increased all over the world.</P>
      <P>Deputy Russell asked a number of questions about cross-Channel freight services.  I do not think I have anything more to add to what I said in the Estimate.  The matter is constantly being studied.  The Deputy will remember that the cross-Channel Tribunal reported that they could see no evidence of excessive profits being made, that the British Transport Commission were losing heavily on freight services, but they did say that the existence of a monopoly in itself was not favourable either to this country or to the British.  They said that they could find no evidence of grossly excessive profits being made.  One of the difficulties is that if a firm pays £100 for the transport of its goods from the time they are dumped in the North Wall to the time they are taken up by lorry at Liverpool £40 of that money is spent on shore and only £60 of it at sea.  That fact makes calculations as regards shipping costs very difficult.  People tend to calculate the cost of transport from Dublin to Liverpool or to Rotterdam forgetting the fact that much of the cost is incurred ashore.  However, the matter is still under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information to give about that at the moment. Deputy Esmonde spoke about the cross-channel service.  When I thanked Sir Reginald Wilson for what he had done towards securing improvements I made it clear to him that there were other directions in which there was also need for improvement.  One of these would be better catering facilities for travellers.  Another matter is that of more punctuality in regard to these services and there is also a need for an improvement in the character of the seating and accommodation aboard the vessels.  We are examining the vessels to see if the accommodation could be altered to make it more comfortable for passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde also mentioned the question of oil pollution and I want to assure him that we are doing all we can through the international body concerned to improve the position. The main reason for oil pollution is that a number of the largest tanker-owning countries do not subscribe to the conventions governing this matter, including some of the most <Col N="932" /> respectable countries.  They have not engaged themselves to clean their tanks in harbours using the special apparatus available to them.  I should also tell Deputy Esmonde that oil pollution can come from oil released into the sea 100 miles away and not necessarily from tankers close to the coast.  We have had chemical evidence that a good deal of this pollution may come from oil spreading for a hundred miles or more.</P>
    <P>I have dealt now sufficiently with all the observations made in this debate.  I have dealt with a large number of queries by individual Deputies.  Perhaps I might just mention one point raised by Deputy Sherwin.  He implied that the E.S.B. could terminate supply of power to a household where the hire-purchase instalments to the E.S.B. had not been paid.  That is not the case.  Even although the hire-purchase fees have not been paid, as long as the bill for power and lighting purposes is paid, the current cannot be cut off.</P>

      <P>The total net estimate for 1961/62 at £16,145,160 shows an increase of £3,894,360 over the original figure for 1960/61.  The Supplementary Estimate of £4,647,360 granted by the Dáil for 1960/61, however, raised the total net provision for that year to £16,897,710, which is about three-quarters of a million pounds above the net provision sought for 1961/62.</P>
      <P>The increase in the Estimate for 1961/62 compared with the original Estimate for 1960/61 is accounted for mainly by increased provision for the following services: Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme (Subhead K 11): Lime and Fertilisers Subsidies (Subhead K 8); Marketing of Dairy Produce (Subhead N); Farm Buildings and Water Supplies Scheme (Subhead K 6); Land Project (Subhead K 7); Losses on Disposal of Wheat (Subhead K 15); An Foras Talúntais (Subhead I 5).</P>
      <P>I have circulated to Deputies a memorandum entitled &ldquo;Notes on the Main Activities of the Department&rdquo; which gives a great deal of detailed information on the operations of my Department and, on various trade and economic matters with which it is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite variable weather conditions and a difficult wheat harvest, the year 1960 showed a further increase in the value and volume of agricultural output. The value of gross agricultural output for that year is estimated at approximately £195 million, that is, £13½ million above the 1959 figure, <Col N="935" /> if stock changes are left out of the reckoning; or £2 million above the 1959 figure if stock changes are taken into account.  This welcome improvement in output was contributed to both by the increases in guaranteed prices for milk and pigs which came into effect in the spring of 1960, and by increasing agricultural productivity which is being substantially assisted by the Fertilisers Subsidies, the Land Project, the Farm Buildings and Water Supplies Scheme and other projects, as well, of course, as by the steadily expanding advisory services of the County Committees of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Agricultural exports in 1960, including products whose content is mainly agricultural, were valued at £89 million, which is an all-time record and £11 million above the 1959 figure. It is interesting to note that our second-largest export market in 1960 was the U.S.A., which took £8½ million worth of our agricultural products &mdash; mainly meat &mdash; as compared with £71¾ million worth imported by Britain and the Six Counties.  All other countries combined imported from this country agricultural products to the value of about £9 million.</P>
    <P>Trends in production and exports during the past year have been encouraging, but this does not mean that there are no serious problems confronting our agriculture.  One of our problems &mdash; and it is by no means confined to this country &mdash; is the maintenance of a reasonable measure of price stability in the face of constantly fluctuating export markets.  This country exports a bigger percentage of its agricultural output than does any other European country except Denmark, and access to export markets on reasonable terms is, therefore, of very special importance to us.  The Trade Agreements with Britain, of which the latest was negotiated in 1960, are the main basis of our agricultural trade.  They give us duty-free access to the British market for most of our products, and in some cases a preference over non-Commonwealth countries, and they link the price of our store cattle and sheep fattened in Britain <Col N="936" /> with the guaranteed prices for British bred animals.  These trade arrangements are valuable, and they are balanced on our side by the import preferences granted to products of British origin.  It is, of course, true that, in our opinion, the high level of price support granted by the British Government to their farmers has had some eroding effect, apart from store cattle, on our position in the British market, particularly in the case of pigs, eggs and milk products.  But this is just one example of marketing difficulties which have been brought about all over the world by the policies followed by most Governments, especially the Governments of the stronger industrial countries, in protecting and expanding their agriculture. These trends naturally cause great anxiety on the part of smaller countries which depend largely on the export of agricultural products for their livelihood.  Better international collaboration appears to be necessary if this serious problem is to be effectively tackled.</P>
    <P>Since the House has recently had a full discussion on developments in relation to the organisation of European trade and economic affairs and the Government's attitude in this regard has been made clear, it is scarcely necessary for me in this statement to reopen the subject in any detailed way. I shall therefore confine myself at this stage to saying that it would certainly appear to be a very useful thing if nations collaborated in devising a really fair and mutually beneficial system of trade in agricultural products which would eliminate the major price fluctuations that have become such a chronic feature of this trade in recent years and do away with the many irritating devices which at present obstruct the free flow of agricultural products internationally and thereby cause serious difficulties for agricultural countries such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>Coming now to more detailed aspects of our agricultural policy, I should like, first, to mention the very considerable progress made in the past year with the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme, as a result of which about 80 per cent, of the store cattle so far exported <Col N="937" /> this year have been attested and thus qualified in full for the British Price guarantee.  Last December, we declared the first attested area, namely, Counties Sligo, Mayo and Donegal, and a few months later we added Counties Clare.  Galway, Leitrim and Roscommon. These seven counties contain approximately 25 per cent. of the total cattle in the country.  We expect that Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Longford can be declared attested before the end of the present month.  Last April we declared a new clearance area consisting of Counties Meath, Westmeath, Kildare, Louth, Offaly and West Wicklow, and it is intended to declare Counties Carlow, Wexford, Laois, and East Wicklow to be a clearance area on the 1st August of this year.</P>
    <P>The present position, therefore, is that the whole country except for Dublin, Kilkenny and five Munster counties is either attested or in an advanced clearance area stage of development, or is just about to become a clearance area.  Before the end of 1962, we have every hope that the Midlands clearance area and Counties Carlow, Wexford, Laois and East Wicklow will have been attested.  In that event, apart from Dublin &mdash; which because of market and shipping factors is a special case &mdash; the only counties which would not then be attested would be Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford, Kilkenny &mdash; that is the southern dairying area where particular problems exist in regard to eradication.  Appreciating, as I do, the difficulties of making marked and rapid progress in this southern area, while we confine ourselves mainly to the removal of cow reactors, and at the same time having to face the fact that the situation in these counties has not yet developed to the stage where full clearance area measures can be applied, I decided recently to take what I might describe as a step in the direction of clearance measures.  As already announced, my Department will, as from 1st October next, be prepared to purchase store reactors from herdowners who have earned a second re-test under the existing scheme by disposing of 50 per cent. of the cow reactors in their herds after the first retest. This new measure will, of course, be in addition to the existing arrangements <Col N="938" /> for the disposal of cow reactors and the payment of a clear herd bonus in the southern area.  My real ambition is to reach the full clearance area stage in the south as soon as possible. While I realise that the problem in this area is a serious and difficult one, I am not unhopeful that this new arrangement for the purchase of store reactors will bring nearer the time when, given the full co-operation of all concerned, full clearance area measures will be possible.</P>
    <P>In County Dublin, also, from 1st October next my Department will purchase store reactors from farmers under certain conditions, provided they have already disposed of all their cow reactors under existing arrangements and undertake thereafter to purchase only stock which have passed the test.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of bovine tuberculosis eradication, I think that there is hardly any other subject to which I and my officials have given such full and unremitting attention.  I think that the progress made in the past year is striking and encouraging. At the same time, I recognise that a lot still remains to be done and that the whole process of eradication is necessarily a gradual, and even slow, business.  The fullest co-operation by all interests concerned is vital if the pace of eradication is to be speeded up.  We have, in fact, been given very good co-operation throughout the country, but it must be 100 per cent. in each and every area in order that we may reach our goal of attestation for the whole country at the earliest possible date.  The net cost of the eradication scheme from its inception up to 31st March, 1961, was about £12½ million, and we are going to spend a further and very considerable sum in the future.  I am, therefore, appealing for the highest possible standard of performance in every parish and townland in overcoming our remaining problems.</P>
    <P>As to the market situation for cattle and beef, there has been a marked recession in prices in recent months, due to weakening of prices in Britain which set in at a time when one normally expects a seasonal increase. Many reasons have been advanced for this, such as increased marketings of <Col N="939" /> cattle in Britain in an early grass season, increased imports of beef into Britain, competition from broilers, the effect of the recent hot weather on consumption and so on.  No doubt, all those factors operated, but if one adds them all up I am still left with the strong impression that they are not sufficient, in comparison with previous years, to account for anything like the full extent to which prices have fallen in Britain in recent months.  It looks, therefore, as if there may be a factor or influence of some other but more obscure nature operating in Britain which has had the effect of making the decline in prices mush steeper than most people could have expected.</P>
    <P>All this is not to say that the long-term outlook for beef is not fundamentally sound.  I believe that it is sound and that is why I am all the more anxious that, if there are any factors of an artificial nature operating to depress prices in Britain, they will be eliminated without further delay.</P>
    <P>There have been some complaints about the numbers of cattle sent in here from the Six Counties on which the British deficiency payments have been made.  Under the Trade Agreements with Britain, we have no right to interfere with this trade and we, of course, have full access to the British market for our cattle.  While these imports must have some effect on our cattle economy, I do not think that on balance the effect could be as serious as some people contend and our net exports of cattle to the North are of course substantial.  I must admit, however, that it does seem rather strange that a Six County beast can pass through the certification centre and qualify for the British deficiency payment in the North and can then be marketed in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>Complaints have also been made about imports of broilers from the Six Counties.  I shall deal with this rather different matter later in my speech.</P>
    <P>As regards the pattern of our export trade in cattle and beef last year, a slight fall in the number of store cattle exported in 1960 as compared with <Col N="940" /> 1959 was much more than compensated for by a big increase in exports of fat cattle and by a further appreciable increase in carcase beef exports.  Exports of fat and store cattle in 1960 amounted to 537,000 head compared with 482,000 in 1959, and exports of carcase beef amounted to 944,000 cwt. in 1960 as against 695,000 cwt. in 1959.  Cattle slaughterings at meat export premises have steadily increased from a figure of about 180,000 in 1955 and 1956 to about 320,000 in 1959 and 380,000 in 1960. In the first quarter of 1961, slaughterings were about 112,000 cattle as compared with 104,000 in the first quarter of 1960.  Exports of both fat and store cattle also increased appreciably in the first quarter of 1961 as compared with 1960.</P>
    <P>On the breeding side, special attention continues to be given to progeny testing for milk and beef.  I referred last year to the arrangements in operation for the progeny testing for milk of the dairy bulls at A.I. stations, and I also expressed the hope that an integrated milk-recording scheme could be introduced fairly soon.  It has been a disappointment to me that the task of getting the agreement of all the interests concerned to an integrated recording scheme, available to all farmers, has been a more protracted one than I had anticipated.  It is vital that such a scheme be introduced, and I am glad to say that definite progress is now being made towards this end.</P>
    <P>As regards beef, a number of calves, the progeny of Shorthorn and Friesian bulls at the A.I. stations, have been weighed monthly up to the slaughter stage, and then graded and measured before and after slaughter in order to obtain as complete data as possible on their performance and quality.  The aim is to assess fully under normal farm conditions the ability of the A.I. dairy bulls to produce thrifty highclass beef progeny.  In the case of the beef breeds, some preliminary information on the weight-for-age performance of Hereford and Angus bulls has been obtained by weighings at the principal shows and sales, and this work will in future be extended to all approved shows and sales.  The work <Col N="941" /> will be done with mobile scales which will also be used for on-the-farm recording in pedigree herds.</P>
    <P>I may mention here, too, in regard to the only remaining A.I. main station which is operated by my Department &mdash; that at Ballyhaise Agricultural School &mdash; that arrangements have recently been concluded for its replacement by a new station, now being established in County Cavan by a group of co-operative creamery societies in the north-eastern counties.</P>
    <P>Sheep and lamb production, which was increasing steadily on a profitable basis for many years up to 1960, has shown signs of levelling off during the past year.  This may have been partly the consequence of the unfavourable market conditions following the drought of 1959, but, while the position of the industry is basically sound, the export market is also becoming a more competitive one.  Exports of both live sheep and lambs and carcase mutton and lamb were appreciably higher in 1960 than in 1959, but have been somewhat lower in the early months of 1961 than in the corresponding period of 1960.</P>
    <P>Pig production has continued to increase during the past year and is now at a level which has not been reached since the early 1930s.  Producers in general have greater confidence in the price assurance for quality bacon pigs, and standards are improving steadily.</P>
    <P>In addition to the schemes of litter recording and progeny-testing already going ahead on the breeding side, an accredited pig herd scheme was introduced last autumn with the object of assessing the overall performance of breeding herds from which boars are selected.  I am glad to say that the response by breeders to this scheme has been very satisfactory.  These schemes for the quality improvement of pigs are of a technical and specialised nature, but they bring considerable benefits to the ordinary producer by way of the breeding stock supplied from pedigree herds.</P>
    <P>As export marketing was discussed during the debates on the recent pigs and bacon legislation, I need not now refer to the position in detail.  While <Col N="942" /> conditions on the British bacon market were appreciably better during the first quarter of the present financial year, the general outlook is one of keen competition.  Hence, the reorganised Pigs and Bacon Commission &mdash; which is to take up office on 1st August &mdash; will have no easy task to perform but I am sure that they will discharge it efficiently.</P>
    <P>Our poultry and egg industry has been suffering for some years past from the effects of rapid expansion of British home production, which has developed to a growing extent in large low-cost units.  The comparatively high level of support for British egg prices has been a factor in that development.</P>
    <P>Improvement work in the quality of our poultry breeding stock is continuing to receive close attention by the Department and the possibilities of the broiler industry, especially for export, are being actively pursued.  I would like to see a vigorous development of the broiler industry for export as such an industry, if it confines itself to the home market, cannot be expected to become a really significant one.  Table poultry are not subsidised in Britain and the cost of feeding stuffs here is not unfavourable relatively to costs in Britain and the Six Counties.  Such an industry should, therefore, be able to hold its own in the very competitive export market.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the imports of broilers from the Six Counties.  We have an obligation under our Trade Agreements with Britain to admit such imports, and to tell the truth I cannot see any special reason why we should be afraid of these imports.  I would prefer to see our people capturing export markets than complaining about moderate competition in the home market.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of poultry, I might mention that a significant trade in day-old chicks has been developing.  The number exported was about 700,000 in 1960 compared with less than half that number in 1959.</P>
    <P>Nineteen-sixty was one of the best milk years we have had.  Weather <Col N="943" /> conditions for milk production proved favourable, and there was a fairly substantial increase in exports of milk products compared with the previous year.  A considerable proportion of these exports took place in the early months of 1961 and are, therefore, not reflected in the trade returns for 1960. The market position for milk products, especially butter, has not been an easy one, but, as milk is the keystone of our agriculture and we cannot have a really intensive agriculture without milk, it is the policy of the Government to ensure, as far as practicable, that producers receive a reasonably stable return.  If this were not done, the violent fluctuations in prices in international markets could disrupt the dairying industry.  It is for such reasons that the price of creamery milk has increased by 1.3d a gallon last year.  I consider that the present price is a fair one though it is by no means inordinately high in relation to European prices generally.</P>
    <P>Because it is obviously unwise to depend on one milk product &mdash; butter &mdash; we have taken positive steps to encourage greater diversification of production. I would like to say how pleased I am to record the establishment of milk powder factories at Mallow and Killeshandra and the cheese factories at Wexford and Limerick for the manufacture of these products for the export market.  While making special reference to these projects because they have only come into the picture here recently, I would like also to pay tribute to the efforts made by some of our own creameries and manufacturers who took the initiative in the past in diverting milk from butter to other products, such as chocolate crumb, baby food and cheese.</P>
    <P>With this increasing trend towards the production of milk products other than butter, the question of the standard of the milk and of the general level of dairy husbandry became more and more important.  Special steps have been taken by my Department to provide closer co-operation between the creameries, the advisory services and the milk producers in relation to improvement of standards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> As the House is aware, An Bord Bainne was established on 17th May last.  This Board has wide functions in relation to the diversion of milk to the most profitable uses and the orderly marketing of all our dairy products.  It has not yet got into full operation.  It takes time to find offices and staff and so forth, but I understand that these problems are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible. The Board have a difficult task before them but I am very hopeful that they will prove successful in tackling it.</P>
    <P>The area under wheat in 1960 was almost 30 per cent. greater than in the previous year.  As it seemed likely in July last that the quantity available for flour milling would be much more than the 300,000 tons which the flour millers would use for milling, a levy of 4/6d. a barrel on all wheat marketed was fixed after consultation with the interests concerned.  However, due to prolonged bad weather, the quality of wheat turned out to be much worse than could have been anticipated and special arrangements were made to have the wheat taken up from the growers at the prices for millable wheat.  The yield from the crop was well up to average but only a relatively small proportion could be included in the flour milling grist.  I arranged to have independent tests carried out as to the extent to which the wheat could be included in the grist and as a result it was finally agreed with the flour millers that about 110,000 tons would be used for flour milling leaving a quantity of about 240,000 tons to be disposed of by An Bord Gráin either by export or by sale on the home market for animal feed.  This quantity will have been disposed of well before the harvest.  The State, of course, must underwrite the losses on disposal of this wheat.</P>
    <P>The quality of the 1960 oats crop was affected by the weather and it was necessary to permit the import of limited quantities for racehorses and oatmeal milling.  A cry went up that there was enough good quality oats at home to meet these requirements but a house to house effort to locate suitable oats failed to reveal its existence except in very small quantities, which were taken up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> Detailed statistics are not available so far in regard to the area under cereals this year but preliminary indications are that the area under wheat will be only very slightly less than last year; that the feeding barley will show an increase on last year; and that there will be a further decline in the oats acreage.</P>
    <P>There has in recent years been a welcome upward trend in the production of feeding barley and about half the crop is retained on the farms where it is grown.  Some growers who are primarily interested in feeding barley as a cash crop have asked that the guaranteed price of 38/- a barrel be increased.  To them I would say that, while this might seem a simple kind of proposition it is in fact bristling with complications.  Not only must the interests of the pig feeder be fully considered but barley marketing difficulties can be aggravated in a year such as 1960 or 1958 when a large quantity of unmillable wheat has had to be sold for feed.  I am very much in favour of our growing a large quantity of feeding barley, which is a good feedingstuff and a useful and high yielding crop, but we should not close our eyes to the aspects I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>Land reclamation and drainage are proceedings at an active pace under the Land Project.  Last year, despite the fact that the weather hampered the progress of work in the fields, over 118,000 acres were reclaimed or improved by farmers with the aid of grants.  There is still a fairly substantial backlog of applications awaiting investigation in quite a few counties but the arrears are being steadily reduced as a result of the special measures which I initiated some time ago, and I have good reason to hope that during the coming year the waiting period between the date on which a farmer makes his application and the date he gets approval will be considerably reduced. As I periodically supply Deputies with statistics showing progress made with Land Reclamation it is not necessary now to go into the position in more detail.</P>
    <P>An important development under <Col N="946" /> the Farm Building Scheme was the substantial increase in piggery grants in February, 1961.  The new grants are on a graduated scale and are weighted in favour of the small producer, but the raising of the maximum grant to £750 enables a useful contribution to be made also towards the cost of large-scale piggeries erected by farmers' co-operative organisations.  The response to these increased grants has been highly satisfactory; applications received since February have been averaging 530 per month, as compared with 150 per month previously.  The expectation now is that the cost of piggery grants will exceed £70,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>As announced in the Budget, grants for new cow byres and for the repair or improvement of farm buildings generally have been increased by 50 per cent.  The new grants came into effect on the 1st June.  It is estimated that the aggregate cost of these increases will be £185,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>In the long run the best way of assisting farmers is to help them to reduce their costs of production and to increase their productivity.  The Fertiliser and Lime Subsidy Schemes have this end in view and the Government attaches very great importance to these schemes.  Since the introduction of the Phosphate Subsidy Scheme almost three years ago the use of phosphatic fertilisers has increased by about one-third.  But this is not enough. Most of our grassland is urgently in need of phosphates and cannot give satisfactory production until this need is satisfied.  It is of vital importance that we should have a greatly expanded use of phosphatic fertilisers especially on our grasslands.</P>
    <P>In emphasing the need for the use of more phosphates I would not like to be taken as under-estimating the other important elements of fertility &mdash; potash and nitrogen.  The Potash Subsidy Scheme which I referred to in my speech last year came into effect on the 1st September last and since then subsidy of £4 per ton has been paid on 50 per cent. muriate of potash with adjustments for other <Col N="947" /> grades.  As an additional incentive towards the use of potash, in which so many of our soils are deficient, the recent Budget provided for a further increase of £1 per ton in the subsidy and this will take effect from the 1st September next.  The use of this fertiliser has been increasing and with a higher subsidy I look forward to a further and substantial rise in consumption in the coming year.  As farmers whose lands are adequately supplied with phosphates and potash can get further worthwhile increases through the use of nitrogen, I am happy to be able to say that there has also been an increase in the use of nitrogenous fertilisers, the prices of which have been showing a downward trend in recent years.</P>
    <P>While there has been a pronounced increase in the use of phosphates, the use of ground limestone has been showing a downward trend in the past few years.  This may have been due in some measure to the fact that phosphates have been cheapened as the result of subsidisation and that farmers have tended to spend money on them rather than on ground limestone. It has been suggested that the reduction in the transport subsidy on ground limestone may have contributed to the present position.  In view of the importance of lime in relation to soil fertility the recent Budget provided for an increase in the subsidy so as to cover the full transport cost. I hope that as a result there will be a substantial increase in the use of lime.</P>
    <P>Last year, I referred to the Freedom from Hunger Campaign of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.  A contribution of $10,000 to this campaign was approved by the Dáil in a Supplementary Estimate which was voted during the financial year 1960/61.  The campaign is relying largely on voluntary contributions and collections for its finances, and the Irish Red Cross Society have kindly agreed to organise a national collection in 1962 in aid of the campaign funds.  This is a most deserving cause, aimed at lifting the living standards of the seriously underdeveloped countries, and I am <Col N="948" /> grateful to the Irish Red Cross Society for their co-operation and help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If I were the Minister for Agriculture coming into the House today, I would be ashamed of my life.  I refer the House to <i>Economic Statistics</i> issued prior to the Budget of 1960, compiled by the Central Statistics Office.  In Table 10, the national income is set out.  In 1957, the profits derived from agriculture, forestry and fishing amounted to £108.6 million out of a total national income of £467,000,000. I make that to be approximately 25 per cent. of the national income.  In 1960, the last year for which we have figures available, the profits on agriculture, forestry and fishing amounted to £105,000,000 out of a national income of £528,000,000, which is 20 per cent.  The share of the agricultural community in the national income has dropped by 5 per cent. from approximately 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. in the past four years.</P>
      <P>I refer to Table 6 of the same publication where the net output of the agricultural industry, including livestock changes and turf, amounted to £157,000,000 in 1957.  In 1960, they are recorded as yielding £156,000,000. I want to remind the House that, over that period, farmers, whose incomes has actually declined since 1957, have had to meet all the increases in the cost of living that other sections of the community have had to bear, increases which amounted to something approximating to 14 per cent.  They have had to meet increased rates; they have had to meet increased electricity charges; they have to meet, directly and indirectly, increased transport charges. They now represent the only section of our community which demonstrably have had their standard of living substantially reduced in the past four years.  Yet, I venture to say they are one section of the community who are probably working longer hours today than they were working four years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think many Deputies forget that the actual value expressed in terms of <Col N="949" /> money of the net output of the agricultural industry has fallen from £157,000,000 to £156,000,000; and that £157,000,000 in 1957 was worth £157,000,000, because the pound was worth a pound in 1957.  But, of the £156,000,000 the farmers got in 1960 each of those pounds is worth 17/6. Over and above the actual decline, therefore, in the money income they have had, the value of the money they have got has declined over the same period.  They are getting less pounds and less value as compared with 1957. That slow process of erosion of the farmers' standard of living has been attempted in other countries and the result in other countries has been to bring the farmers of France out on to the roads in open rebellion, with the consequence that the Government there have inaugurated a shock programme to redress the balance so as to bring the agricultural community more or less back into line with other sections.  The same process was attempted in Denmark.  Within the past three months, the farmers of Denmark downed tools and simply said: &ldquo;We will work no more.  We decline to be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water in our community.&rdquo;  Within a week, the Government of Denmark produced £24,500,000 of extra subsidy.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Agriculture, it was perennially cast up to me that I was always looking for subsidies for the farmers, and there was Denmark and they had no subsidies at all. That was all eyewash.  The Danish Government subsidies their farmers by a series of subtle and concealed operations that it is very hard to track down.  When a situation developed in Denmark closely analogous to the situation that is developing here over the past four years, the farmers in Denmark downed tools.  The result was that the Danish Government at once acknowledged that the process must cease.  But that process has been going on here in Ireland for the past four years.  The Danish Government decided that process was intolerable in Denmark.</P>
    <P>The tragedy in our condition is that something is happening here which I do not profess to understand.  In every <Col N="950" /> past generation, the farmers were prepared to stand their ground, defend their rights, cling to their holdings, and say: &ldquo;We are determined to get justice for ourselves.&rdquo;  I have seen with consternation in Monaghan, in the Minister's county of Cavan, and in the western counties, hundreds of farmers closing their doors, abandoning their holdings, and migrating to the industrial cities of Great Britain.  I deplore nationally and economically that evolution in this country. Economically, it means that these small holdings are ceasing to be part of the economic structure of the country.  These small holdings in their time were some of the most productive land in Ireland.  They are now being set in conacre for the grazing of store cattle.  Where in the past you had a family prosperously reared on a holding of 20 to 25, or 30 acres, and a comfortable home maintained, you will now see a closed house and five or six thin store cattle grazing land that is gradually going back to rushes.  That is an economic consequence this country cannot afford.</P>
    <P>Apart from that economic diminution in our output, some of the best people in the country are being driven out.  There is a good deal of misunderstanding of that situation.  You will hear people from other parts of the country, notably the city of Dublin, talking with contempt of the small holdings in the West of Ireland, in Cavan and Monaghan, and saying: &ldquo;Sure, people could not live on them.&rdquo; They lived on them in the past.  They reared bishops and politicians and Cabinet Ministers on them.  Some of the finest people this country ever produced came off holdings of that size.  It is quite an illusion to believe that, given a fair chance, the small farmers of this country cannot make a decent living on their own holdings.</P>
    <P>It is a great tragedy that this Government appear to have made up their mind to write off the small farmers of this country.  I do not believe that, socially or economically, this country can afford to do that.  If present policies are persisted in, we will lose something of infinite value and, having <Col N="951" /> lost it, we will never be able to get it back.  I do not think there is a Deputy here who does not know as well as I do the straits to which the small farmers have been driven, with the consequential disastrous exodus that is going on from the small holdings and the consequential repercussions on the small towns that served these small farmers, parts which have been a prosperous mainstay of the rural economy of Ireland and which are now perishing because the people who dealt with them and traded with them are being driven not only off the land but out of the country.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that all that is unnecessary. If we went about it in the right way, these small farmers could be restored to the prosperity they had. It was not an extravagant level of prosperity but all I ask is that the agricultural community of this country should not have their share of the national income whittled away.  I would not make such a dire complaint against the Minister if he and his collegues were not largely responsible for that worsening of the conditions of the agricultural section <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other sections of the community.  It was this Government who forced up the cost of living by 15 points, without making any corresponding provision for the small farmers who had to bear that burden.  It is squarely on the shoulders of the Government that rests the responsibility for the disastrous social problem now arising throughout that whole part of the country where these small farmers get their living.</P>
    <P>I read with astonishment today the Minister's proposal regarding the circumstances in which the broiler producers of Monaghan and Cavan find themselves at the present time.  It is rather typical of his whole approach to the problem of the small farmers. Speaking of that situation, he says that there has been some criticism of the importation of broilers and he says that we have an obligation to admit them under the terms of our trading agreements with the British. He says that he cannot see any special reasons why they should be afraid of these imports and says that they would be better occupied in looking <Col N="952" /> for export markets than in complaining about moderate competition.</P>
    <P>I think that is a crazy approach to this whole problem.  What is the problem?  The problem is that a considerable number of small farmers in Monaghan and Cavan have gone into the broiler trade.  This broiler production business has largely become industrialised in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.  Quite suddenly, these producers of broilers on a small scale find that the Dublin market on which they depended is completely flooded and they are confronted with the problem that they have the chickens ready for sale and cannot sell them.</P>
    <P>The broiler trade is an extremely difficult trade.  If you have a bullock and bring it to the fair and do not get what you expect, you can bring it home again.  If you have a sheep at the fair and do not get what you expect, you can bring it home and keep it for another day.  Even if you have a pig and you bring it to the fair and do not get what you expected, you can bring it home and put it on a ration and keep it below a certain weight.  You cannot do that with broiler chickens. The difference between profit and loss in the broiler trade is a matter of three days' feeding.  If you get rid of them on the critical day, you have a profit. For the next three or four days, they eat your profit and if you keep them beyond that time, you are accumulating your losses.</P>
    <P>I realise that we cannot control imports of fowl from Northern Ireland, in consideration of which we have unlimited access to the British market, but I do not think it is a proper approach, when the farmers find themselves in this difficulty, to say to them that it would be better for them to go out and look for export markets than to complain about moderate competition.  Can you conceive the feelings of a small farmer in Monaghan who has 250 broiler chickens?  He is told that he cannot sell them at any price and then his own Minister for Agriculture tells him that it would be better to go out and look for export markets than to be complaining about moderate competition. <Col N="953" /> Can you imagine any rational Minister for Agriculture getting up and saying that to a small farmer who finds that he has no home market for his products?</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am wrong but I conceive it to be the duty of the Minister to do all in his power to find a market for those chickens and, if necessary, to send for the chief agricultural officer and tell him that he must take steps to get these farmers to combine and find an export market for their chickens or else direct him to tell his poultry instructresses to tell the farmers to damp down on production because the domestic market cannot absorb the supplies.  Am I wrong in that or is that the function of the Minister for Agriculture?  Or is it to tell them to take a running jump at themselves and that it would be better to do something about finding an export market than to be complaining?</P>
    <P>That is the mentality I complain of.  In that regard, the Minister has a clear and obvious duty to help these people to get their fowl marketed and if the circumstances are such that there is no prospect of the domestic market being able to consume the supplies, he has a duty to try to do for them something corresponding to what I tried to do when the problem was the disposal of fowl and turkeys around the Christmas season.  I remember that at that time the difficulty became pretty acute and I had reason to believe that the dealers were taking advantage of that, that the small farmers were being told that the market was saturated and that they would have to sell their fowl for the price of the feathers.</P>
    <P>I got the co-operative societies in County Cavan to form a co-operative society in Cootehill.  That society went through very difficult times and it is due to the great work of the late John Daly, God be good to him, and of his son Brian, that that co-operative was able to struggle through that difficult time.  As a result of the devotion of a few public-spirited men, there is now a thriving co-operative society dealing with the bulk of the table fowl produced <Col N="954" /> in Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim and North Longford.  That is a more constructive thing to do than to tell people that they would be better employed in looking for an export market than in complaining of moderate competition on the home market.</P>
    <P>I want to raise some questions in regard to the sale and purchase of wheat and the sale and purchase of pollard processed contemporaneously which deserves careful examination.</P>

      <P>I presume that the question has reference only to local authority services.</P>
      <P>I accept that an adequate number of promotion outlets is a factor of importance in the maintenance of an efficient and contented nursing service but the Deputy must appreciate the limitations imposed upon me, apart altogether from the fact that, due to historical causes, some promotion outlets are not available to lay nurses.</P>
      <P>The creation of senior nursing posts is normally a matter in the first instance for health authorities and a Minister for Health, in the examination of any proposals for the creation of such posts, must satisfy himself that they are necessary to ensure the proper and satisfactory operation of the particular service concerned.  In dealing with such proposals, however, I have never taken the narrow view that money should be saved by refusal to agree to the creation of a new senior post or to the upgrading of an existing post where I was reasonably satisfied that by reason of the change the service available to the public would be improved.  Further, I have from time to time whenever it appeared to me that circumstances warranted it, suggested such changes for the consideration of health authorities for adoption by them if they saw fit.  In fact, in recent years, the number of senior posts available to lay nurses in the local service has been substantially increased.</P>
      <P>It is, however, quite a different matter deliberately to embark on a policy of creating senior posts merely in order to make promotion outlets, as seems to be suggested in the question. This I am not prepared to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had made abundantly clear, in reply to a supplementary question by Deputy McQuillan on 6th instant (Dáil Debates, Col. 442), the essential difference between what the Deputies who put down this question are now asking me to do in relation to the St. Kevin's Hospital nursing staff and the action which I took in relation to the revision of the salaries of certain medical officers.</P>
      <P>The action taken by me in every case of a medical officer was taken in relation to the individual appeal of the officer concerned under Section 10 of the Local Government Act, 1941, against the decision of the local authority concerned regarding his remuneration.  No such appeals have as yet been made to me by the nursing staffs mentioned.</P>
      <P>Further, as far as I am aware, the Dublin Health Authority has not yet considered the merits of the several claims put forward on behalf of the nurses concerned.  I understand that at a recent meeting the members of the Authority accepted the point of view expressed to them by the Chief Executive Officer that it would be premature to consider their attitude to such claims until the claims of a very much larger body of nurses, which are at an advanced stage of negotiation, had been dealt with.</P>
      <P>The Deputies are, I am sure, aware that the present claim does not relate to salary only but that a number of wide and complex issues are involved. It is not unusual in such cases to operate retrospectively the settlement ultimately reached.  I have little doubt that this practice will be followed in this case.  In the light of this, I would hope that the nursing staff in St. Kevin's will not resort to a course of action which could cause grave hardship to the consideratble number of patients who have been entrusted to their care and to the relatives of such patients.</P>

      <P>The possibilities of the air cushion type vehicle, known as the hovercraft, for use on the cross-Channel services between here and Great Britain has been kept under review in my Department over the past two years.  A member of the Department's technical staff will shortly be visiting Britain to see an experimental hovercraft recently completed by a British firm.  I myself have had an opportunity personally to discuss with the authority in Britain which is responsible for the development of the hovercraft the prospect of its use on cross-Channel services.</P>
      <P>Hovercraft are still at the experimental stage and it will probably be some years yet before we can expect the development of a hovercraft which might be suitable for operation on the cross-Channel routes.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> My Department has also kept in touch with the development of the vessel known as the hydrofoil with a view to its possible usefulness on the cross-Channel services.  I have had enquiries made in Italy and Sweden in which hydrofoils are in commercial operation, and also in the United States, where an experimental open-sea hydrofoil is at present under construction. Hydrofoils at present in operation are confined to relatively smooth waters and would not be suitable for use on the Irish sea routes.  Present research into the development of open sea hydrofoils may lead the way to vessels which could be safely used on the cross-Channel services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress I said I wanted to raise a specific matter in connection with the administration of the Department during the past year.  The Minister refers in <Col N="975" /> his statement to the fact that there was a quantity of 240,000 tons of wheat which had to be disposed of by An Bórd Gráin either by export or by sale on the home market for animal feed.</P>
      <P>I want to ask this question: is it true that we wound up by selling about 100,000 tons of this wheat to a Dutchman for something between £16 and £18 a ton at the end of a period during which we imported 1,250,000 cwts of pollard at prices varying from 18/- to 20/11d. per cwt?  Would anyone explain to me also on what basis of calculation it was thought desirable to import 1,250,000 cwts of pollard at an average price of £19 a ton while we were selling 100,000 tons of wheat for export to Holland at a price of £16 or £18, more especially when during the earlier part of the year the minimum price at which that wheat could be bought here at home was £22?  It was reduced to £20 a ton relatively recently and now I understand there is little, if any, to be had.  If you go to look for it, you are told it has all been disposed of to the Dutchman.</P>
      <P>It seems to me one of the oddest transactions we have ever engaged in. I should like to be reassured by the Minister that, if he finds himself confronted in any future season with 240,000 tons of wheat which he proposes to dispose of for animal feeding, he should seriously consider giving a preference to the home producer rather than selling it to the Dutch at a price less than the home producer is paying for imported pollard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first mentioned this in this House I think the Minister sought to make the case that there was some fundamental difference between pollard and feed wheat.  Of course, there is not.  The process of making pollard is that you grind up wheat and you abstract from the wheat a certain percentage, and that percentage abstraction is pollard.  You can extract 20 per cent., or 30 per cent., or 40 per cent., or you can extract any higher percentage you like.  Naturally, if you are dealing with wheat which is convertible into flour, you make your extraction as low as you can because <Col N="976" /> flour fetches a higher price than pollard and, therefore, it is easy to extract approximately 30 per cent. of pollard from whole wheat and sell the balance as flour.  But, if you are selling the whole of the wheat for feed wheat, there is no reason why you should not extract 70 per cent. as pollard and leave the remaining 30 per cent. to be used either as flour or as a constituent of compound feeds. But one thing seemed to me perfectly manifest and obvious, and that is that it is daft to sell the Dutch Irish feed wheat at £16 or £18 a ton while we are buying over 1,000,000 cwts. of pollard at prices averaging £19 a ton.  I should be glad to have some better explanation of that procedure from the Minister than he has made available to us heretofore.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the course of his speech that since the House recently had a full discussion on developments in relation to the organisation of European trade it was scarcely necessary for him to re-open the subject in any material way.  I disagree with the Minister entirely. It seems to me that he has a very grave obligation to the agricultural community to give as clear a forecast as he is in a position to do of what the likely repercussions of the Common Market development will be on Irish agriculture.  I think he has a pretty fair idea.  It is true that no final programme has been fixed by the Six who constitute the present Common Market of Europe as to the final pattern that agricultural economics will have under the new régime but there is a good deal of material available in the Treaty of Rome itself to point in the general direction of what the repercussions are likely to be on the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister, with the additional information that he has at his disposal, has a duty to give all the guidance he can to the agricultural community here as to what the future holds for them.  I am not in a position to provide an informed forecast in that matter because I have not access to the same material as is available to the Minister.  Nevertheless, I dare to <Col N="977" /> say that I believe that, given a right policy for agricultural production in this country, and the exploitation of the full potentialities of our 12,000,000 acres of arable land, it should be possible for the farmers to have a reasonably secure future in a Common Market world and, what is more important, to have a reasonable margin of profit on what they will produce for export in that common situation provided they are facilitated by the Minister for Agriculture and the Department to raise their agricultural output to its highest potentiality.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister does justice to himself, to the House, or to the agricultural community by the kind of Delphic observation recorded at page 5 of his statement.  He refers to the unsatisfactory prices for cattle which have been obtaining for some time and he states that certain factors have been suggested to him as giving rise to these unsatisfactory prices.  &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;all these factors operated, but if one adds them all up I am still left with the strong impression that they are not sufficient, in comparison with previous years, to account for anything like the full extent to which prices have fallen in Britain in recent months.  It looks, therefore, as if there may be a factor or influence of some other but more obscure nature operating in Britain which has had the effect of making the decline in prices much steeper than most people could have expected.&rdquo;  With all the information the Minister has, does he seriously tell us that there is some mysterious factor operating in Great Britain, the nature of which he cannot elucidate, because, if that is the case, things have changed very considerably since I was last in the Department of Agriculture?</P>
    <P>In my experience very little could transpire in the markets in which we were vitally concerned that the resources of the Department could not detect.  I do not know of any mysterious element that can be operating in Great Britain which could be beyond the capacity of the Department to disentangle and diagnose.  I should be glad to know how it comes about that in this day and age we have reached a stage when we cannot, by an inquiry <Col N="978" /> with our opposite numbers in Great Britain and through the ordinary trade channels to which we have access, find out this, or any other factor, that operates to the detriment of our livestock trade.  Certain it is that the people who produce cattle and have them for sale have been having a very bad time for the last three years.  In the spring there was some improvement in the price of cattle and it was thought that, perhaps, the depression was passed.  Now we are right back where we were.  Cattle are again hard to dispose of and selling at poor prices.</P>
    <P>I often wonder when people recall the increased prices of cattle that were exported, the increased total of money secured by the sale of cattle, does anybody ever ask himself how each of these individual cattle fared?  Does anybody ever ask himself in this House what did the men who produced the cattle make out of them?  You can sell 40 cattle in the morning for £2,000 and yet lose £400 on the transaction, if you had to keep those cattle for longer than you should.  You can sell 40 cattle another year for £2,000 and make £400 on the transaction if you have been able to sell them a bit earlier and get a better price for them because they are young.  In the statistics they both appear as 40 cattle earning the same amount of money but, for the individual farmer, they represent between modest comfort and inevitable bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>Sometimes when I hear statistics thrown about this House I wonder do those who refer to them so glibly ever think of what they mean to the individual farmer.  I would like to ask the Minister one specific question.  There has been an export subsidy operating in respect of fat cattle and meat.  I understand that there is some change to be made in that subsidy and some people were under the impression that it was to end on 1st August.  I understand that there is now some provision for its extension and I would ask the Minister to let us know if that is so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with breeding the Minister said that special attention would be given to progeny testing.  I would be glad if the Minister would tell us what is the scope of progeny testing in regard to cattle, particularly in regard to milking cattle, at the present time.  The Minister has referred here to the exports of live sheep and lambs.  I cannot but believe that the Minister is aware of the catastrophic fall in the price of lambs this year as compared with last year.  I will be glad to hear if there is any prospect, in his estimation, of that situation improving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned on more than one occasion that I was advised that the inauguration of progeny testing of pigs is a good thing.  I accepted that advice and I built the first testing station at Cork.  I understand that there is another station to be established at Thorndale in Dublin but I think we are failing to communicate to the average person what benefit accrues from the operation of progeny testing. I concede at once that it is a long term project and I think it is acutely necessary that the public, which will mainly consist of pig producers, should have clearly outlined for them what is the nature of the pig progeny testing programme. I conceive it to be that the foundation stock of the pigs in the country will be vastly improved and that the day will come when we arrive at the situation when any farmer purchasing a breeding sow will have a guarantee that it comes from a generation of pigs that have passed through the progeny testing station <Col N="980" /> at Cork or Thorndale and, therefore, has the capacity for the production of the highest grade of bacon pig available. I believe that at present a good many people of good will are at a loss to know what helpful purpose that progeny testing station is serving and the regular reports of the progeny tests themselves are so highly technical that the average person is at a loss to understand them.</P>
    <P>I think I originally introduced the guaranteed price for Grade A pigs and I resisted very strenuously any proposal to provide a guaranteed price for pigs other than Grade A or the new Grade A Special pig that has been constituted recently.  The reason for that was that if you try to fix a price for lower grade pigs the tendency would be for people to ignore the supervision necessary to produce the top grade pig.  I find that people on the whole will be reasonable if they are asked to do reasonable things but there is no doubt that a small pig producer finds great difficulty in getting the higher grade.  If the confidence of the small feeder is not to be undermined the Minister ought to take some further action to reassure him that his pigs are being equitably graded and that he is not being defrauded. I know that in the absence of special skilled husbandry it could happen that pigs do not attain the highest grade.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is wide scope for the feeding of pigs to the store stage by small farmers culminating in the operations of more highly skilled feeders to bring them to the finished stage.  That is on the basis of universal grading but I think we cannot close our eyes to a new development in Britain which has received wide publicity.  That is the recent pronouncement by the chairman of Walls, one of the biggest bacon processing concerns in Britain, that he did not want farmers to grade pigs.  The managing director of Walls, at the last meeting of the Board, was understood to say that he was prepared to accept the proposition that farmers ought to produce the pig that paid them best and that he, as a processor, accepted the assignment of tailoring that pig to <Col N="981" /> suit the requirements of the consumers he was charged to serve.  I understood him to say: &ldquo;If a farmer finds it more economical to feed a fat pig, let him feed a fat pig.  I will pay him on the weight of his pig and I will remove whatever excess fat is on the pig in the course of manufacture and will present the bacon to my customers in suitable form and will present the trimmings in divers other forms, for which it is my job to find a market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That has to be followed, in regard to our domestic conditions, by a realisation of the fact that the manufacturer in Britain has a very much more diversified market for the by-products of the pork industry than any manufacturer in Ireland, that they are catering for a population of 50 millions and that ours are catering for a population of 3 millions, and that by-products like sausage, chops and the other things that constitute the by-products of the pork industry are not easily shippable in fresh condition to the British market.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are faced with the situation that whereas a fat pig may be wholly unsuited for domestic manufacture into bacon for export, it is not impossible that there could be a market in Great Britain for fat pigs which they could successfully convert into bacon and by-products on an economic basis. What many people forget is that prewar we had an annual export of more than one million live pigs to Britain and it was a very profitable business. It was a great trade.  I do not see why we should not seek to find our way back into that trade to supplement the demand for pigs that exists in our own factories here at home.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister for Agriculture whether he sees any prospect of exploiting that new concept of pig processing adumbrated by Walls for the benefit of the farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>I see no reference in the Minister's statement to the prospects of the turkey trade.  That is a very important trade and it is a trade urgently calling for close attention.  Last year the turkey trade was not very good.  It would have been much worse if we had not got the percentage of white turkeys that we were in a position to offer.  I expect <Col N="982" /> that in the course of the next two or three years we will be in a position when practically all the turkeys we have for export will belong to the new breeds introduced by the Department of Agriculture in 1956 and which are now being propagated at Athenry but I am told there is a new situation developing in that market in which a growing demand exists in Great Britain for a semi-processed bird which is packed and ready for the pot or the oven.</P>
    <P>I adhere to the view that there is a very marked distinction in quality between a freshly killed bird and a deep-freeze turkey such as are at present being marketed in such large quantities in Great Britain but the deep freeze process undoubtedly does help in enabling the producer to spread his output over a much longer time. I understand the turkeys for the Christmas trade in England now begin to be slaughtered in the month of July and go into deep freeze and are then sold out of the deep freeze in the month of December whereas all our turkeys are killed and shipped in the last week of November and the first three weeks of December.  I wonder is it not overdue to examine that whole business more closely?  Unless we are prepared actively to enter into this trade of the prepared turkey, do we not stand in jeopardy of losing this market altogether?</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is a difference in quality.  I am satisfied that if one has the discrimination to appreciate it, the deep freeze bird tastes like cotton wool compared to a freshly killed bird but I am reluctantly forced to the conclusion that that degree of discrimination is largely disappearing in the purchasing public in the advanced industrial communities like Great Britain.  There is no use thrusting quality on your customer if your customer prefers convenience. We could make a very great mistake, such as was often made in the history of trade before, by clinging too long and improvidently to certain standards of quality to which we attach great importance long after the consuming public which we serve have determined they no longer care, that what they <Col N="983" /> want is a bird prepared for cooking, that they do not want to buy, or are not prepared to undergo the extra trouble of buying a freshly-slaughtered bird.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister for Agriculture mean when he says that the price of creamery milk was increased by 1.3d. per gallon last year?  What was the levy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

He has not told us, although this is late in the month of July, what the levy on wheat is to be this year. May we assume it will be approximately at the rate of last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore the fact that we continue to deny the farmer who has not ready cash the opportunity of participating in the Land Project.  I believe the suspension of Part B has <Col N="984" /> excluded from the benefits of that scheme a great many people who should be admitted to it and who cannot be because they have not got the money to put down, whereas under Part B they could have had it added to their annuity and pay it as they were in a position to do so.</P>
      <P>I notice the Minister refers to the increased grant for cowbyres but I would be glad to know from him does that increase of 50 per cent. bring up the grant for cowbyres to the level at which it stood under the double cowbyre grant in connection with the T.B. scheme which he suspended.  I do not think it does.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that he has discovered that his improvident interference with the lime subsidy so reacted against the whole scheme that he has reconsidered it now and restored the full subsidy but I do not know that he has any great reason to congratulate himself on that.  I think a great deal of damage was done by the original imposition of the charge.</P>
      <P>I read with interest the Minister's notes on the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme but I observe that he does not venture to make any prognostication of when he hopes to arrive at a stage when the problem will have been finally disposed of.  What he is doing at present is, of course, the relatively easy part of the job.  He says he has not even started on the five south-western counties which constitute the dairying area of the country.  I hope he will be able to achieve these objectives in the rest of the country quickly.  He is assured of all the support we can give him in the prosecution of that task.  But I do not think it is unreasonable to say that the public will await anxiously a more explicit forecast of what the future is in respect of Kerry, Cork, Tipperary, Limerick and South Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rejoice to read in the notes published by the Minister of the virtual disappearance of infectious infertility in cattle in the western and northwestern counties.  If we have achieved that by the introduction of A.I., we have made very material progress in <Col N="985" /> a matter of very great urgency.  I like to recall that the decision to introduce A.I. into that area was the subject of severe criticism at the time; but if we have achieved the purpose here described, then our decision in that matter has been amply vindicated.  It would be a pity if we did not record that fact and mark it well, because it was as a result of a concentrated attack by the combined resources available in the Department of Agriculture that that age-old problem in Leitrim, Sligo, Donegal, and even in parts of Cavan and Longford, was brought under control and has now been apparently effectively disposed of.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to hear of some more energetic plan to deal with the warble fly problem.  I remember the hide merchants used to make considerable remonstrance to me when I was Minister for Agriculture that I was not more ardent in urging the farmers to treat their cattle with derris root. I always took the view that the only people who could benefit by the elimination of the warble fly were the hide merchants and that, if they wanted something done about it, they ought to be prepared to lend a hand.  Beyond giving good advice, they never seemed to me to be prepared to do very much; but I was obliged to confess that when it came down to tin tacks as to what they should do, it was not so easy to suggest an effective contribution they could make.  I think they could make that contribution now.  The Department ought to study the question as to whether the combined resources of the livestock exporters, the hide exporters and the farmers themselves could not be mobilised to make the internal treatment now available for the control of warble fly available to farmers at a low cost, and for a trial period, and perhaps in a restricted area to see how it would work, free of cost.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a man interested in rural conditions, who recently came back from Northumberland.  He said the thing that struck him most there was that on the hottest summer day you never saw beasts what we call in the West &ldquo;gadding&rdquo;, careering around <Col N="986" /> with their tails in the air at the sound of the warble fly.  He asked the people how could that be, that at that time of the year in Ireland the cattle would be all standing in the water, under trees or in the shade, that you could not get them and that no fence would hold them.  This man was told that this was an area of relatively large farms and big estates and that a concentrated effort was made there about five or six years ago to eliminate the warble fly.  Everybody combined in it in this area and there was not any warble fly there any more.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago they could not have kept the cattle out in that way in the sun but had to provide shelter for them.  Now they had forgotten all about the warble fly.  If we could get an area in Ireland in which that objective was achieved, it would have a profound impression on all the other areas of the country and would make a very material contribution not only to increased milk output from the cattle protected from warble fly but a very substantial increment in the total value of hides derived from Irish cattle.  There is now a practical way to go about it.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned turkeys and I would be very glad if the Minister is in a position to give me light or guidance about prospects for the turkey trade in the year that lies ahead.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the exports of dairy produce described in the Minister's notes in page 18.  I notice that the value of domestic exports of dairy produce, including chocolate crumb, in the year 1960 was £8,499,000.  I asked the Minister to furnish us with figures for the years going back to 1948 on a corresponding basis and they are reproduced in the Official Report of Tuesday, 11th July.  They present an interesting picture, but not a very encouraging one.  While from 1948 to 1953 there was a marked steady expansion, from 1955, after a set-back, there was a rise from £6.8 million to £10.3 million in 1957.  Since that year there has been a steep decline and the figure for the last year is £8.4 million.  That is not a very encouraging picture, and it is a source of surprise to me that the Minister <Col N="987" /> does not appear to regard it as a somewhat disconcerting situation.  I would have thought our exports of creamery products ought to show a very much more substantial expansion. I hope they will.  I am satisfied that they could be made to grow very much materially if we went about it in the right way.</P>
    <P>Certain of the schemes operated by the Department get lost sight of.  I often think that some of the best schemes are most readily forgotten.  I inaugurated a scheme called the Connemara scheme designed to remove the rocks off the small holdings of the Connemara farmers.  Anyone familiar with conditions there must have realised what an infinite blessing it was to many of these people to have that plan available.  I see that at the end of April, 1961, grants had been approved of under that scheme for work on 4,000 acres.  I would be glad to know how the scheme is proceeding and whether the people are still availing of it on the scale they used to.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister's references to the water supply scheme and that he is providing a sum of £290,000 in this year, £170,000 for domestic supplies and £120,000 for extensions to farms. I should be glad to hear from him whether he considers that that scheme, combined with the scheme operated by the Department of Local Government, is in fact effective to bring water to the vast majority of our farmers, or whether it might be better to expand the inducements under that scheme rather than embark upon a national scheme calculated to cost £30 million to bring piped water along the main roads of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the Minister for Local Government has not changed his mind.  If it is correct that the Minister for Local Government has now reversed his ideas and proposes to confine the piping of water along the main roads to those areas where welled water is absent as a result of geological circumstances, then there will be no difference between us.  But if there is to be a wholly improvident expenditure of public money on the provision of water mains along every road in Ireland <Col N="988" /> and a consequent charge on all farmers who avail of the water supply for the water they use, over and above the capital cost of laying the mains, to the exclusion of the existing schemes operated by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Local Government, I think such a decision would be greatly to be deplored.</P>
    <P>I record again my profound dismay at the realisation that the share of the agricultural community in the national income is steadily diminishing.  I record my profound dismay that it is becoming more manifest with the passage of every month and every year that the best elements of our agricultural community are being driven out of their homes and country.  I am convinced that is largely because we are not going the right way about providing them with facilities which will enable them to get the maximum return from their land and the best markets in which to dispose of their produce.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is reasonable to impose on me in my present position the obligation of propounding to the Minister for Agriculture for the time being a comprehensive programme to achieve that end.  One thing of which I am perfectly certain is that the key-stone of any future policy for the effective exploitation of the land, with consequent benefits to those who get their living on it and to the national economy as a whole, is an adequate agricultural advisory service working in close collaboration with the Agricultural Institute established by the Government of which I was a member.</P>
    <P>At the present time the advisory services are grossly inadequate.  There is no industrial activity which does not provide for apprenticeship, training and education in crafts so complex and difficult as agriculture.  In our circumstances there can be no doubt in the mind of any reasonable man that the only place to give effective help in the use of the most modern methods of production is through demonstration and advice on the holding of the farmers concerned.  It is simply not within the range of practicability to get every small farmer in this country educated in an agricultural college or furnished <Col N="989" /> with a degree in Agricultural Science. I am not at all sure that, even if it were achieved, we would have achieved a desirable end.  What is vitally necessary is that every farmer, small and large, should have accessible to him if he wants it, expert advice, guidance and counsel on matters of production and marketing which he himself is not equipped to resolve for himself.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, it is urgently necessary and will constitute a long term programme to persuade certain elements amongst the agricultural community who do not appreciate the value of such services to appreciate them.  I fully recognise that in the initial stages of providing an adequate service one of the tasks is to persuade the farmers themselves to avail of it.  Where I differ with the present Minister is that he does not believe these services should be made available till they are asked for.  I believe that to be one of the principal blocks on the road to true progress.  I hope to have an opportunity of making such services available to the farmers.  I hope to have the opportunity of coupling with that service an effective marketing organisation to ensure that the increased output that such educational and research services should make possible on the land can be effectively marketed at a reasonable profit to those who produce it.</P>
    <P>To get that done I believe the initiative must largely be taken and should largely be taken by the Department of Agriculture acting under a Minister who cares, who is really concerned for the welfare of the farmers for whom he should answer to this House.  The fault I find with the present occupant of that office is that he seems to be blandly indifferent to the fact that the share the agricultural community has of the national income is steadily declining, that the number of small farmers is declining every day, that the number of families being on their own holding is decreasing, that the whole social pattern of the countryside to which most of us belong at present or, at most, at one remove, is being changed to its great detriment.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Minister for <Col N="990" /> Agriculture to this is not unreasonably illustrated by his reaction to one group of small farmers in Monaghan and Cavan who have approached him in circumstances in which they find themselves unable to dispose of what they have spent their substance to produce, and are told in his statement today that he preferred to see them capturing export markets than complaining about moderate competition in the home market.  I do not think that is the attitude a Minister for Agriculture should take up.  So long as this Minister adheres to that attitude agriculture will decline.  Farmers will feel themselves frustrated and abandoned by the Minister who is supposed to represent their interests in Oireachtas Éireann.  I believe with profound regret that that is a fact today, and I hope that after next September it will no longer be so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>We all look on this Estimate as the most important to come before the House in view of the fact that the agricultural industry contributes more to our welfare than all other industries put together.  Our agricultural exports, at £89 million certainly show that the farmers are playing their part in producing greater quantities of goods for the home and export markets.  It proves that, notwithstanding the decline in the rural population, those farmers who have stayed and who have become mechanised have succeeded to a great extent in increasing their output, to their own benefit, to their own credit, and to the benefit of the country as a whole.  I have no doubt that with stable conditions and stable prices, the situation will improve.  If the farmers could be reasonably assured that conditions will remain stable and markets reasonably certain for our exports, there would be a marked improvement in our agricultural economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cattle are the predominant feature of our exports.  The cattle industry springs from the dairy cow.  Shortly after my election to this House, I put down a motion deploring the inadequacy of the price the farmers were getting for their milk.  Reading through the White Paper circulated to us a few days ago in connection with <Col N="991" /> our proposed entry into the Common Market, I was shocked to discover that the price of milk to our farmers is still 1/- a gallon below the average price paid to farmers in the Common Market countries.  I appreciate that we got some slight increase after a great fight had been made.  Considering the importance of the industry to the economy of the country as a whole, a still further increase would be justified.  Indeed, such an increase would repay not alone the farmers but our economy generally.  We must put the dairy industry on a solid footing. I stressed at that time the importance of diverting more and more milk into commodities other than butter.  I welcome the decisions taken by certain co-operative groups to divert milk into cheese, chocolate crumb, dried milk, and various other commodities. For all these, there will be an expanding market when we enter the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Our decision as to the Common Market is vitally important from the point of view of agriculture.  I discussed the matter recently with the farmers in Cork.  They were all unanimous in their opinion that, should Britain join, we should walk step by step with her and not just trail in after her.  We discussed the position if Britain did not join or came to no decision within a reasonable time.  It was the unanimous opinion that in that eventuality our Government should take the initiative and apply for some form of association with the Common Market, entering into an agreement with Britain to ensure that we would not lose our preferential treatment in that market.  If we have to continue subsidising our dairy produce and our pigs to the British market, it would be far better for us to have some form of association with the Common Market because that would ensure us a tremendous opening for our dairy produce.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that when the Taoiseach goes to Britain next week, he will be able to hammer out a satisfactory agreement with the British Government.  I sincerely hope that Britain will realise the importance of <Col N="992" /> our industries here, particularly our hard-pressed agricultural industry.  Our farmers have to work very hard to eke out a living from the land.  It is only right and proper that every step should be taken to ensure that the goods they work so hard to produce should be sold in the best markets obtainable. It is up to our Government to ensure that, when the time comes, we will have the produce to export to these markets.</P>
    <P>We could double and treble agricultural output if the prices obtainable in the Common Market countries were freely available to our farmers.  Instead of the depopulation of our rural areas continuing, there would be a flow back to rural Ireland.  Young people would realise there was a reasonable opportunity of making a living from the land.  That living has been denied them for many a long day.  The recent farm survey proved that the income of the farmers especially the small farmers, was lower than that of any other section of the community.  It is no wonder the young people fled the land.  Their flight shows their intelligence in refusing to work for slave wages.</P>
    <P>The Common Market will open up an opportunity denied to our farmers for centuries.  Given an equal chance our farmers will take their place amongst the nations and will equal the best in Europe.  The Irish farmer is as hardworking and as intelligent as his counterpart in Europe.  Time will prove the truth of my statement.  They have done a reasonably good job in increasing agricultural output in recent years, notwithstanding the decline in the number of people engaged in that activity.</P>
    <P>I must welcome, on behalf of the farmers of Cork, the announcement by the Minister that he has decided to take up reactor store cattle from 1st October.  The Minister was down in Cork some time ago and he is acceding to the unanimous wish of the committee of agriculture when he has decided to do that.  There is very little use in half measures because while a few store reactors are left on the farm, the job is only half done.  I am glad to say that reasonably good progress is being <Col N="993" /> made in Cork in the eradication of bovine T.B.  The percentage of reactor cows in my own area has been greatly reduced and when this big step is taken in October, I have great hope that eradication will be well in hand within the next 12 months.  It is one of the most important steps that we farmers can take in an undertaking that is so important to the cattle industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister also acceded to another request made at that meeting, that is, the reduction in the price of unmillable wheat.  If the Minister came to Cork more often to hear our views on different matters, the farmers would benefit a good deal more.  Those two steps he is taking as a result of suggestions made to him on the occasion of that visit will be of great benefit to us. The only pity is that it has not been done sooner.  Such visits by the Minister to the committee of agriculture can be very helpful.  The Minister gets first-hand information on the requirements of the area and I am very glad that some attention has been paid to the requests made to him.</P>
    <P>The fertilisation of our land is a most important matter.  Without the application of lime, phosphates and potash, we cannot increase the productivity of our land but we are making good progress in that respect.  A couple of years ago, a very important experiment was carried out in the mountainous area of West Cork.  The Minister was down for that occasion when an aeroplane scattered manures over that mountainous area.  That experiment is now proving that these areas can be developed to such an extent that they can produce beef cattle and sheep if they are looked after in the proper way.  One section of that mountain was properly fenced off and a rotational system was carried out.  That part of the mountain can be seen today from several miles away with its luscious green grasses growing where only ferns and rushes grew before.</P>
    <P>We must have further development along those lines in the mountainous and boggy areas of our country.  That experiment has been sufficient to make me realise that a vast proportion of our land is going to waste for want of proper attention.  To bring this land <Col N="994" /> into proper production, it will be necessary to fence it off plot by plot until vast areas have been brought in. I am going to ask the Minister that grants should be made available to people with this type of land to enable them to fence it off.  I know it is going to be a big step because we have a vast amount of such land and it will take time and money to fence it off and manure it, but when it is done, it will give a tremendous return in the number of cattle and sheep that can be grazed on it.</P>
    <P>We have here in Dublin, factories which produce the netting wire and I have no doubt that they could make the posts also.  They could turn out posts five feet or six feet in height to carry the wire.  The whole scheme would be of tremendous benefit to the farmers and to the country as a whole. I appeal to the Minister to consider the suggestion and, if necessary, to make a survey of the land available for fencing, the amount of money it would cost and the benefit it would be to the country.  The experiment we have already carried out will be the greatest indication to the Minister of what can be done.</P>
    <P>That is the most important part of what I have to say about the Land Project at the moment.  Many Deputies will deal with the delay in dealing with applications at the present time. I appreciate the difficulties when so many farmers are applying for reclamation work at the same time and I know that, with the limited staff available, all the applications cannot be dealt with at once.  However, I think there is a little more red tape creeping in to the running of that scheme than there was some years ago.  In the past, when the application was made by the farmer, he usually got the work done in a much shorter time.  Even if he did have a little of the work done when the inspector called, he was usually allowed for it.  At the moment, the regulations seem to be becoming more strict and instead of the officials going out on the farms, they are spending too much time in their offices.  We seem to have greater officialdom, with less work being done.  I would ask the <Col N="995" /> Minister to cut out all this red tape and to get on with the work of land reclamation which is so essential if more land is to be brought into production.</P>
    <P>The pig industry is a very important industry.  The last time I spoke on this Estimate, I devoted most of my speech to it because of its importance to the owner of the small farm.  I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Dillon's suggestion regarding the provision of a market for all fat pigs.  It is the only way in which we can open the eyes of the bacon curers of this country.  The system of grading of pigs in the factory is one thing that has annoyed me all down through the years.  If we could get a market for our fat pigs it would cut out a good deal of the red tape that is coming into the marketing of pigs at the moment.</P>
    <P>I have always been of the opinion that it was not the business of the factory manager to grade the pigs at all.  I have always been of the opinion that there should be a person in every factory working independently for the factory, the farmer and the consumer. The position is that the factories have their own man to do the grading. Human nature being what it is, I suppose if the farmers were to grade the pigs, they would not see themselves on the wrong side and all the pigs would be Grade A.  When it is left to the other side to do all the grading, a good deal of discontent arises.  There must be an overhaul of the system.</P>
    <P>It would be even better if we could get a market abroad for heavy live pigs.  That would solve the position. With the development of piggeries in the country at the present time, there will be a big increase in the pig population. Farmers are growing more grain, barley and oats, which, with the amount of unmillable wheat available, means that a greatly increased number of pigs will be produced.  It is important that markets should be made available for the increased output from the new piggeries which are springing up all over the country.  The Common Market may be the answer.</P>
    <P>Bacon could be processed and <Col N="996" /> tinned and a market found for it.  Such a development for the export market could open up a great future for the Irish farmer.  Processing of bacon is a matter that is worth considering, just as processed beef and lamb can be made available for the export market.</P>
    <P>We must export if we are to survive as a nation.  Our chief source of exports is the land and the farms of Ireland.  I have always held the view that the soundest economic policy for this country is to have industries based on the land and on the produce of our farms, rather than industries for which we have to import all the raw material. There is plenty of raw material in this country, if only it were availed of to the fullest extent.  We have not done that and we are not doing it yet.  There is a great deal to be done in the processing of food for the export market. It is a matter to which scientists could give a considerable amount of thought. We should make absolutely sure that when our goods are marketed, they can compete with the goods of any country in the world.</P>
    <P>The farmers, on whose behalf I am speaking, will do their part in producing the goods, if the scientists and the industrialists will do their part in processing them.  I would ask all to co-operate in developing our trade with other countries.  Money spent in the development of industries based on Irish agriculture is money well spent.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Department of Agriculture should give us all food for serious thought.  The Minister did mention that he is contemplating a new scheme for attesting herds.  The first year I came into this House, I spoke about all the different groups going into one farm to test the same herd.  It is about time this business finished and that the various organisations came together and developed one decent scheme for the recording of milk yields. Cow testing associations are still in existence in some areas and we have the A.I. stations doing progeny testing. If the various groups came together and developed one good scheme, it would be far better.  It may not be as simple at it should be, but whatever difficulties there are should <Col N="997" /> be ironed out for the common good. The percentage of our cows on test is miserably low.  That should be a matter for far greater importance, a matter urgent enough for the Minister to tackle as soon as possible and to have one decent scheme for the recording of herds.</P>
    <P>The recording of the bulls at the A.I. stations is very important.  Our store cattle are good.  I know some pressure is being brought to bear on the Minister to import Charollais cattle.  I do not know if it is wise to do so.  I would be slow to express an opinion on it because I am not sufficiently conversant with it.  I know the dairy breeds we have, such as the Friesian and the Shorthorn, are giving satisfaction.  I know that the Herefords and the Blacks are giving equally good satisfaction for beef production.  To import a new breed could have, perhaps, serious effects.  I do not know.  The Minister would be wise in being cautious in that matter, lest, in importing the new breed of cattle, we may import disease with it.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate in that our cattle are disease-free.  We have some bovine tuberculosis, but we do not look on that as being serious.  We are very fortunate in having what I believe are the healthiest cattle in the world, and every effort should be made to ensure that that record is maintained.  It is of vital importance to us that the good name which has been built up for our cattle over the years be maintained in the future.  The present breeds we have will succeed in doing that, and the Minister should be slow in departing from them.</P>

      <P>I could have easily interrupted the Deputy if I knew what <Col N="998" /> he was saying where he is sitting over there.  Consequently, I have not anything to say on what he said.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the depopulation of the rural areas is two-fold.  One part of it is concerned with the farmers' children.  That has always been the case.  Everyone of us is aware that a farm, unless it is an exceptionally large one, cannot give a livelihood to every one of the children of the farmer.  The result is that when they can earn their own living, they leave the land and go into the professions, the trades and many other walks of life outside the land.  I believe that system will continue. I have no hesitation in saying that at least 75 per cent. of those engaged in the trade and professions throughout the country have come directly from rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>The other part of depopulation, which is a source of worry, is the fact that the rural workers are leaving the land.  There are many reasons that is happening.  First, the farmer is not paying these workers sufficient to induce them to remain on the land.  There is not available to them many of the amenities available to those who go into the towns or who emigrate.  From the beginning of what I might call the industrial revival here, I have known many families whose worker members were divided, one section remaining in the rural area and the other going into the towns to work in industry.  It inevitably happens, even as far back as 25 or more years ago, that the young man who left the country and came into the town enjoyed a wage at least twice what was paid to his brother working on the land for the farmer. While that condition prevailed, it was hard to expect any farm labourer to remain on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that in any part of rural Ireland in which there are factories or good employment available in the towns, there is a tendency for the rural part to become denuded of workers. Against that, there is a fact I often wondered about.  In Tipperary, Waterford and Kilkenny, as far as I know, no labourers cottage is vacant.  It would seem to me that until we have cottages all over the place, and nobody <Col N="999" /> looking for them, there is room for more building in rural Ireland if we are to keep the people on the land.  If a cottier has a family of five or six and they remain in that cottage until they are grown up, it is reasonable to expect they will wish to be married, but it is impossible for them even to contemplate marriage if they cannot get a house to live in.  There is a hope that they might get a house or a flat if they go into a town, but if they remain in <Col N="1000" /> the rural portion outside the town, they can get neither.  Consequently, they must put marriage out of their minds or else come into the town or go to some other country.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect.  Farming in this country is changing.</P>
