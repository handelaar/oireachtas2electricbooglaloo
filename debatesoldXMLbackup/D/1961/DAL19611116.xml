    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to repeal Section 8 of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act of 1956, so as to abolish a statutory concession which has been much abused in recent years, under which quantities of flour or wheatenmeal up to 300 lbs. in weight could in certain circumstances be imported without a licence.</P>
      <P>The Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act of 1933 as amended and extended by subsequent Acts was intended to ensure as far as possible that flour consumed in this country should be milled at Irish mills from wheat grown by Irish farmers.  Provision was accordingly made in these Acts to prohibit the importation of flour from abroad, except under authority of a licence granted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1947, when flour was scarce, it became a common practice for people in the United States of America to send or bring gifts of flour to their friends in this country.  To facilitate the entry of such gifts, an Emergency Powers Order was made permitting the importation of flour in quantities of up to 300 lbs. provided it was (a) carried as private effects in passengers' baggage or (b) shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been <Col N="322" /> sent by a person who was not a trader dealing in flour or wheatenmeal as a gift to a person in the State.  This import concession was continued in permanent legislation in Section 8 of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act, 1956.  Representations have been made to the effect that the concession has been abused and should be withdrawn, as it is causing serious loss of trade to flour millers and retailers in this country, particularly in the County Donegal area.</P>
    <P>To determine the justification for these complaints special surveys were carried out by the Revenue Commissioners. These indicate that unlicensed imports of flour from the Six County area increased from 1¾ tons per month in September, 1958 to 6 tons per month in March, 1959; 17 tons per month in March, 1960, and 27 per month in March, 1961.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of these imports is that the imported flour is flour which has been milled from cheap foreign wheat and that the Irish millers who are obliged to include a proportion of native wheat in their grists could not hope to compete in price with such imported flour.</P>
    <P>In view of the increasing extent to which this concession is being used for importation of cheap flour from the Six Counties and the adverse effects which such imports will have on the flour milling industry in the State and especially in Co. Donegal, the Government considers that this concession should be withdrawn, by the repeal of Section 8 of the Act of 1956.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Two questions fall to be answered in regard to this proposal. One is, can the Minister give us approximately the price at which the flour has been brought in from Northern Ireland?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says in the course of his statement: &ldquo;... the <Col N="323" /> imported flour is flour which has been milled from cheap foreign wheat and that the Irish millers who are obliged to include a proportion of native wheat in their grists could not hope to compete in price with such imported flour&rdquo;. How can he say that, if he does not know what the price is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We have received complaints and it is not unreasonable to assume that, when people go to the trouble of lugging 300 Ibs. of flour on their backs, they can get it more cheaply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot believe the Minister would stand up to tell the Dáil millers cannot compete with the price when he does not inquire what that price is.  The Minister ought to tell us and I urge that view very strongly because it would tend to make our proceedings farcical if the Minister can come in and tell us he is satisfied that the price of flour coming in was one which made it impossible for mills in Ireland to compete, and then say: &ldquo;I do not know what the price is.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about one-third per sack cheaper.  I am not familiar with the exact prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice the Minister has a heavy cold and I am assuming that perhaps his reluctance to extend his customary courtesy to the House may be in some measure due to that distressing circumstance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is entirely unrelated, I am afraid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point which falls to be considered is what will happen when we go into the Common Market.  I am listening every day of my life, with approbation and understanding, to the exhortations which are continually coming from the Minister, nis colleagues and the Taoiseach that everybody is to brace himself for circumstances with which we will be confronted when we enter the Common Market.  Yet we continually have pieces of legislation presented to this House <Col N="324" /> designed to impose import prohibitions, restrictions or further tariff protection. It seems to me to reveal an odd dichotomy of mind in our approach to these matters.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister's reaction to that problem is.</P>
      <P>This special proviso was implemented by us during our last Government, I think, to meet a very special situation. At that time there were gifts coming in considerable volume from abroad and there were endless complications and difficulties.  This proviso was put in in order to meet that situation.  The situation that it was designed to meet no longer exists and if the Minister were in a position to make any kind of reasonable case, which I do not think he has so far succeeded in doing, we would not be concerned to oppose this proposal.</P>
      <P>I am thinking as I am speaking of the relationship of this proposal, admittedly a minor proposal, to the general question of the wheat situation. However, as it is my intention on behalf of this Party to set down a motion to deal with the broader issues arising in connection with the wheat situation I propose to reserve my observations in regard to the wider question for the occasion on which that will be discussed which I hope will be at a very early date.  In the meantime, I think the Minister ought (1) to tell us more precisely what the price differential is to which he refers in the course of his introductory statement; and (2) whether he has any thoughts to offer us as to restrictive proposals of this character in the context of the Common Market future that lies before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as we are concerned, we do not oppose what seems to be a minor piece of legislation. Some time in May of this year complaints were received by the Labour Party through the trade unions to the effect that there was this big increase in the importation of flour from the Six County area to the southern part of the country, particularly to Co. Donegal, and it was having an effect on employment in the shops and in the mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> I drew the attention of the Minister to the situation that existed in Donegal on that occasion and urged him to introduce a measure such as he is introducing here this morning.  For that reason we welcome it.  The figure given by the Minister here, while it does not indicate the price, does show that there has been an abnormal increase in the importation of gift packages of flour from September, 1958, when imports amounted to 1¾ tons per month up to March of this year, when imports reached 27 tons per month.</P>
    <P>The only reservation I have about this is one which Deputy Dillon mentioned. I suppose we should not attempt to cross our bridges until we come to them but practically every discussion on industrial matters in this House will be tempered by the knowledge that in the near future, in a year or two years, we may become members of the Common Market.  If our Ministers were to legislate in anticipation of our becoming members of the Common Market in a year's time I wonder what type of legislation we would have?  I suppose we could work on the basis of our continuing as we have been, that is, as a more or less independent trading country, apart from our relationship with Britain, and legislate accordingly. I am sure that the Minister has in mind the situation that will arise, if and when we become members of the Common Market.  I should like to thank the Minister and say that we approve of his action in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a minor Bill to remove a minor irritation to millers. At the same time, we have the complete dereliction of wheat farmers by the Government.  It really is a sign of the times and an indication of the thought behind the Cabinet at the present moment in relation to the production of flour and the growing of Irish wheat.  I do not agree with the Leader of the Labour Party that this has any effect on employment in the mills.  I would merely give one pair of figures to prove that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure given for increased importation of gift flour into this country is 20 odd tons.  There is one mill in this country which produces six tons of flour per hour.  In fact, we are talking <Col N="326" /> about the production in one mill in this country for three hours.  Anybody who knows anything about the production of flour in mills knows also that there is a five-day week in a three-shift cycle.  Three hours in one year does not bear any relation to the employment of labour in the industry. In fact, any suggestion that it does is merely a dangled carrot to induce the Labour Party to believe that their proper duty is to go with this legislation. It is entirely a minor irritation. Anything I have said about the labour aspect of it should be regarded by my good friend, Deputy Corish, as merely recording the figures and not a criticism of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>At the same time, that is the exact position.  We are talking of an irritation so small that it affects the production of one mill in this country for three hours in a year.  We are looking after this absolutely minor irritation, which is of no consequence, while ignoring the unfortunate situation of those who produce the real raw material, namely, the wheat farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon seemed to take all the credit or the blame for the introduction of this provision in so far as it appears in Section 8 of the 1956 Act.  Section 8 merely enacted for the first time what was already contained in an Emergency Powers Order of 1947 and whether there is blame or credit, I am afraid his Government and predecessors will have to share it.  It is obvious that the provision was designed to facilitate something that was happening and something that was then desirable, although I still wonder at the people who carried 300 lbs. weight of flour on their backs across the Border.  The differential in price is, I understand, about 135/-, Twenty-Six County price, as against 100/- outside price for a 280-lb. sack.  That itself is, I think, an inducement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the source of the 300-lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is right. With regard to the flourmilling industry generally, it is not fair to allege that there is that differential in the <Col N="327" /> efficiency of our flour mills as against those outside the State.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the object of the original legislation was to ensure that the wheat grown in this country would be used to the maximum possible extent.  It is reasonable to assume that millers outside the State get their raw material at a cheaper price than it is possible for our own millers to do so.  The difference between the price of the sack is not a measure of the difference in efficiency of our millers as against the others.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, that is not to say that one cannot but have some concern about the future of our flourmilling industry in Common Market conditions. That is one of the objects which is engaging my attention and the attention of my Department.  It is obvious that, in common with other interests, reorganisation from within, if possible, will have to take place in the milling industry.  If it is not possible from within and if such reorganisation proves to be necessary, other action will have to be considered in relation to our flourmilling industry.</P>

      <P>This is a consolidation measure which replaces, with amendments, the existing statute law on coroners.  One of the Acts being repealed dates from the reign of Edward I.  The office of coroner is therefore one of great antiquity and it is appropriate that, before commencing to deal with the various provisions in the Bill, I should indicate briefly how the coroner's office has become what it is to-day.</P>
      <P>The primary task of the mediaeval coroner was to keep a record of the pleas of the Crown, so that royal dues should not be overlooked but, because violent deaths might bring revenue to the Crown in many ways, one of the coroner's most important duties was to inquire into unnatural deaths.  Whatever caused a death was forfeit to the Crown, and the chattels of those who were convicted of felony or who committed suicide were likewise forfeit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Treasure trove was then of considerable importance as a source of Crown revenue.  Before Magna Carta, the coroner had authority not only to hold an inquest but also to proceed to trial and judgment.  The power of proceeding to trial and judgment was taken away by that statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> Gradually, with changing conditions, the importance of the coroner's fiscal duties declined and the holding of inquests on unnatural deaths became for all practical purposes his only function.  During the 19th century, the establishment of regular police forces provided new and efficient machinery for the investigation of suspicious deaths.  The present method of prosecuting offenders, that is, investigation by the police followed by the taking of depositions before a magistrate to see if a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made out, dates from the middle of that century.  The 1927 Act, which was on the lines of a statute passed in Britain in 1926, recognised the fact that under modern conditions the functions of the coroner are no longer mainly directed to criminal investigation in that it obliged the coroner, in the absence of reason to the contrary, to adjourn an inquest where a person had been charged with murder, manslaughter or infanticide.  This provision relieved the coroner of the investigation of most cases of suspected murder or manslaughter.  The 1927 Act also gave coroners power to dispense with a formal inquest in certain cases of sudden death where a post-mortem examination revealed the cause of death.  A large reduction in the number of inquests followed. The Act also enabled a coroner to hold inquests without a jury, except in certain specified cases.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the scope of a coroner's duties has declined considerably and it is not surprising that there have been suggestions that the office should be abolished altogether.  In favour of abolition it can be said that we now have a centralised police force which investigates all suspicious deaths and that there is no need for an inquest except perhaps in the case of some major disaster or in other circumstances in which the public interest would require a detailed inquiry to be held.  Such inquiry, however, would be more proper to a formal tribunal of inquiry than to a coroner's inquest. On the other hand, there is a great deal of public confidence in the office of coroner.  There can be no doubt of the value of an inquest in ensuring <Col N="330" /> that prompt publicity is given to the circumstances of sudden or suspicious deaths and putting an end to exaggerated or unfounded rumours concerning a death.</P>
    <P>Inquests are particularly useful as a means of allaying public disquiet where the police find on investigation that there is no evidence, or insufficient evidence, to justify criminal proceedings.  The cost of the office is not considerable.  The total salaries do not exceed £13,000 and the saving on abolition would be less than this as the functions of coroners would have to be performed to a greater or lesser extent by other persons.  Abolition of the office would involve payment of compensation to existing coroners.  The Government have considered the question of abolition but have come to the conclusion that it would be in the public interest to retain the office of coroner.</P>
    <P>Another question that may occur to Deputies is whether we should follow the lead given by Northern Ireland in their Act of 1959 and confine future appointments to members of the legal profession.  Of our 52 coroners, 19 are members of that profession and the remaining 33 are doctors.  Experience has shown, however, that, on the whole, the present arrangement works satisfactorily and I consider that such a change would not be justified, particularly when the Bill proposes&mdash;in Section 30&mdash;to prohibit the consideration or investigation of questions of civil or criminal liability at an inquest. The Bill provides specifically that every person appointed as coroner, whether he be a solicitor or barrister or doctor, must in future have five years' professional experience.</P>
    <P>Turning to the various provisions in the Bill, I do not wish to weary the House with a detailed explanation or justification of all the minor changes being made in the law and I propose to refer merely to a number of the more important provisions.  The Bill is, I think, in the nature of a &ldquo;committee&rdquo; Bill, but if there are any points on which Deputies require further information I shall endeavour to deal with them when concluding.</P>
    <P>The first provision to be noticed is <Col N="331" /> Section 11 which imposes a maximum age limit of 70 years for future appointees to the office of coroner.  At present, coroners hold office for life, but coroners have to be fairly active to carry out their duties properly, and it seems only fair that there should be a reasonable age for retirement prescribed for persons who take up duty as coroners in the future.  As coroners have no entitlement to pension it would not be right to apply an age limit to coroners now serving.</P>
    <P>The next provision of importance is that contained in subsection (4) of Section 18.  This imposes a statutory duty on doctors, registrars of deaths, funeral undertakers, occupiers of houses or persons in charge of institutions to notify the coroner immediately in cases where they have reason to believe that a death has taken place by violence or through negligence or from any cause other than natural illness for which the deceased had been seen and treated by a doctor within one month before his death, or in such circumstances as may require investigation.  Failure to discharge this statutory duty is being made an offence punishable on summary conviction by a fine not exceeding £20.  A provision of this kind was introduced into Northern Ireland law in 1959.</P>
    <P>The object of the section is to ensure that, so far as is possible, all questionable deaths are brought to the notice of the coroner but it will have the incidental advantage of securing an improvement in the number of deaths registered and in the proportion of these deaths which are medically certified.  At present there is a very high proportion of uncertified deaths, particularly in the age group 70 and over.  In 1959, the percentage of uncertified deaths was as high as 6.1%, whereas the corresponding figure for Northern Ireland was less than 1%. In Leitrim, for example, there were in that year 120 uncertified deaths out of a total of 610 deaths registered.  In the adjoining county of Fermanagh, only 9 deaths were uncertified out of a total of 649.  When a death has been reported to the coroner under the provisions of Section 18 Subsection <Col N="332" /> (4) it will be a matter for him to decide what action he should take. He may decide that no inquest is necessary or he may direct that a post-mortem examination be made, on the result of which he will decide whether or not to hold an inquest.</P>
    <P>The next new provision is contained in Section 24, and authorises the Attorney General to direct that an inquest be held in any case where he has reason to believe that a person has died in circumstances which make the holding of an inquest advisable. The Attorney General stands in a special relationship to the general public and has a statutory duty of asserting and protecting public rights. For this reason it is considered that it is in the public interest that he should have the power proposed to be conferred on him by this section. A similar provision was introduced into Northern Ireland Law in 1959.</P>
    <P>A change in the law is being made in Section 27, which provides that a coroner need not view the body where it has been viewed by a member of the Garda Síochána who gives evidence to that effect at the inquest or where it has previously been viewed by a coroner or deputy coroner.  The necessity for a view of the body is one of the curiosities of coroner's law and can be explained only in terms of the historical evolution of the duties of coroners.  An inquest without a view is wholly void.  A British Departmental Committee on Coroners, which reported in 1936, recommended that the coroner should have a discretion to dispense with a view of the body and this change was introduced into Northern Ireland law in 1959.  The provision in Section 27 does not go quite as far as this and follows the procedure adopted during the Emergency and which appears to have worked satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Sections 30 and 31 are aimed at confining the investigation at an inquest to ascertaining who the deceased was and how, when and where he came by his death.  Section 30 prohibits consideration or investigation of civil and criminal liability at an inquest.  Section 31 prohibits <Col N="333" /> verdicts or riders of censure and exoneration but there is a saver for recommendations of a general character designed to prevent further fatalities, for instance, a rider recommending the removal of a dangerous bend from a road, with a view to reducing deaths in road accidents.</P>
    <P>I think it will be generally agreed that questions of civil or criminal liability should be left to be decided by the appropriate tribunals, that is to say, the courts established by the Constitution. Any consideration of these questions at a coroner's inquest is unlikely to be as properly done as it would be in the ordinary courts, with the result that the proceedings at the inquest may constitute an embarrassment in any subsequent civil or criminal proceedings.  So far as questions of criminal liability are concerned, the provision in Section 25 obliging a coroner to adjourn an inquest where he is informed by the police that criminal proceedings are being considered, should, in any event, substantially reduce the possibility of overlapping between proceedings at inquests and those in the criminal courts.</P>
    <P>Section 35 subsection (2) introduces a fresh disqualification on a coroner who is a member of the legal profession. It disqualifies him from holding an inquest or inquiring into a death where he has drawn up, or assisted in drawing up, the deceased's will and also benefits under it.  There has been a provision in the law since 1881 prohibiting a medical coroner from holding an inquest where he has attended the deceased professionally within one month before the death, and it seems equally reasonable to avoid the conflict between duty and interest that might appear to arise where a &ldquo;legal&rdquo; coroner had drawn up the deceased's will and was a beneficiary under it. Another disqualification on a &ldquo;legal&rdquo; coroner is contained in Section 53 which prohibits him from acting in proceedings arising out of any matter which may have come before him as coroner.  It is not the intention that this provision should debar a solicitor from taking out probate or letters of administration, but it would prevent him from taking part in other civil or <Col N="334" /> criminal proceedings.  Both of these disqualifications are already law in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another provision that should be noticed is Section 44, which deals with the situation where a jury fails to agree.  I am sure that the case will be made that there should be a unanimous verdict by a coroner's jury, as there has to be in Northern Ireland, but since 1927 the law has been that the verdict of the majority must be accepted provided the minority does not exceed two.  The Bill is going a little further than this in providing that the verdict of a simple majority will be sufficient.  The law will still be, therefore, that where there are six jurors the view of four jurors will prevail; but where there are twelve, the view of seven of the twelve&mdash;not ten, as at present&mdash;will decide the issue.  Now that the coroner's inquest is primarily a fact-finding investigation, it seems reasonable to modify the provisions about majority verdicts in the way proposed.</P>
    <P>Another of the curious provisions in coroner's law, as it may appear to many Deputies, is that authorising a coroner to direct that a body may be deposited in a publichouse pending inquest. My predecessors and I have received, over the years, strong representations from members of the licensed trade who regard this provision as objectionable and indefensible in present-day conditions.  The Intoxicating Liquor Commission of 1957 were also opposed to it.  Section 46 proposes to replace the provision with one authorising the coroner to direct that the body be removed into a convenient mortuary or morgue or other suitable place.  I have no hesitation in saying that I do not regard a publichouse as a &ldquo;suitable place&rdquo; and I have no doubt that no coroner will regard it as suitable or, if he does, that the publican concerned will not agree with him.  Although some inconvenience may be caused, especially in remote areas, I have no doubt that it will be the lesser of two evils.</P>
    <P>Because of the repeal of the statute of Edward I, it became necessary to consider whether the jurisdiction <Col N="335" /> coroners now have to enquire into treasure trove should be preserved. Treasure trove may be defined as any gold or silver coin, plate or bullion found concealed in a house, or in the earth, or in a private place, and it belongs to the State.  In olden times it was a considerable source of revenue but nowadays it is only of importance from an historical, antiquarian or archaelogical point of view.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I should like to explain to Deputies that the State is anxious that anything found which may be of antiquarian value should be immediately handed up for examination and possible preservation.  To achieve that object, the State is always prepared to pay to a finder the full value of any treasure trove which an individual may come across.  It is important that that should be known because it is desirable that people who find things which may have an antiquarian value should immediately hand them over to the authorities.</P>
    <P>So far as I have been able to ascertain, no coroner has had an inquest on treasure trove for very many years, but if the necessity arose, a determination by a coroner's jury would be less expensive than a determination by a court.  The jurisdiction has been preserved in Britain and in Northern Ireland and it has been decided that, on balance, it would be desirable not to discontinue this particular jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to Sections 57 and 58, which have an important practical significance.  These sections empower the Minister for Justice, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government, to prescribe certain fees and expenses, notably the fees payable to doctors for performing post-mortem examinations.  These fees are at present regulated by the 1927 Act and a revision is long overdue.  A change is also being made in the procedure for payment of these fees and expenses. At present, they are paid to the witnesses concerned by the coroner, who is recouped by the local authority. Section 58 proposes that in future the coroner should certify the amount of the prescribed fee or expenses and <Col N="336" /> that the certificate should subsequently be presented to the local authority for payment direct to the person concerned.</P>
    <P>I need not, I think, say anything about the Repeals Schedule, which is quite lengthy, and repeals eleven Coroners Acts completely.  I hope the Bill will commend itself to the House as a measure which sets out in up to date form all the existing law on coroners and which makes amendments designed to bring the practice and procedure of the office of coroner into line with present-day requirements and present-day thinking on the role of the coroner and the coroner's inquest.  The coroner has still a significant part to play in modern society.  Although the emphasis has shifted from the inquest to the post-mortem examination and inquests have become far fewer, their importance is still considerable.  A properly conducted inquest has advantages in speed and cheapness which a more elaborate inquiry does not possess.  It enables public disquiet and rumours to be set at rest.  I have no doubt that the office of coroner has a long period of useful life ahead of it.</P>
    <P>May I add that copies of the Bill have been circulated to every coroner and that observations have been received from many of them?  These observations and any suggestions that may be made by Deputies in the course of the debate will be carefully considered and any necessary amendments moved on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been described as a consolidation measure to a great extent and as a consolidation measure, it is worth while considering. The Minister told us that the Government took two decisions regarding it. One was to retain the office of coroner. Personally, I was not aware that there was any real body of opinion in favour of abolishing the office of coroner.  Quite a number of people objected to the powers coroners' juries took to themselves, by way of adding riders, and that is being abolished here. The second decision, which we are told was a Government decision, was that there was some enthusiasm on <Col N="337" /> the part of some people to have the office confined to members of the legal profession.  That view, if is was ever a view strongly held, has not been accepted and, I think, quite properly, particularly as when this Bill becomes law, the findings are to be confined to certain matters of fact.  Any question of placing responsibility, or taking responsibility, or anything in the nature of a rider which might seem to take responsibility away from anyone is being removed from the coroner.</P>
      <P>I agree that this should be so.  I certainly agree that the coroner's office should be maintained and have no particular view at all as to whether it should be confined to members of one profession or another.  The Minister said, and here he drops into the old error, that for the future coroners will have experience.  That does not arise. The phrase in Section 14 is that people must have a practice of so many years' standing.  That is the phrase that has often been considered and criticised.  It does not necessarily mean that a person has had a case either as a barrister or as a solicitor. It simply means one takes the date of one's qualification and when five years have elapsed one has five years' standing. Merely to put in the word &ldquo;practising&rdquo; adds nothing.  If you said the person had to be a barrister or solicitor having practised for five years, certain difficulties could arise.</P>
      <P>In any case, I just want to counter the idea that because we have certain old stereotyped phrases, it necessarily means that the person has any practice whatever.  It is well known that this same phrase was used with regard to qualifications for the district court and that a person is now sitting as a district justice of whom it can be said he did not handle a case in his whole period.  In fact, he was a journalist for the necessary qualifying period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many sections in this Bill which call for Committee discussion. There is one which I want to query right away, that is, Section 18, subsection (4).  This means it will be an offence for any person who has reason to believe certain things, with regard to a death, if he does not report them <Col N="338" /> or that death to the coroner.  I do not mind if the matter is about any difficult circumstances&mdash;circumstances, say, of violence, misadventure or other unfair means, misconduct or negligence. That is all right.  But in the case of a person who has reason to believe that somebody has died from natural illness, even where that person has not been attended by a doctor for a month before the death, it is made an offence not to reveal the matter of such death to the coroner.</P>
    <P>I suggest that is wholly unnecessary. There is no atmosphere here of criminality, negligence or anything like that. If a person has reason to believe that a person has died without being attended to for a month&mdash;even though that person has had attention for years for some natural illness&mdash;if death ensues, by reason of the fact that the deceased person has not been visited for a month by a medical practitioner, anybody who knows that fact must report it to the coroner or he will be held guilty of an offence and may be fined £20.  I do not know what the reason for that is.  I should imagine there are a very big number of people who die here without having had a medical attendant within the month before their death.  I do not suppose it is regarded that there is any necessity for a coroner's inquest in such cases.  In fact, there need not be a coroner's inquest even under such circumstances. If a person evades the commission of an offence by giving a report, the coroner may decide right away there is no question of an inquest and he need not necessarily decide on a post-mortem examination.</P>
    <P>I think this is taking precaution far too far.  I do not know whether medical officers could give us statistics.  I should like to find out if any coroners have adverted to this subsection and if they have made any comment on it.  I should imagine that in great parts of this country, certainly along the western seaboard, it would not be anything unusual to have many people dying who have not seen a medical attendant in the month before their death.  It seems to me to be taking precaution to the verge of the ludicrous.  If it were not then necessary in every case that <Col N="339" /> there should be either a post-mortem examination or an inquest, we would be leading somewhere, but we are not now putting all questions of suspicion aside.  I am asking for rectification of that.  I am told this system is operating in the North of Ireland.  I had not known that.  I should like to know how much is involved in the way of time wasted, money expended through phoning and all the rest, which might have to be done in connection with this.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of provisions here described as new.  They do not amount to much.  I welcome the provisions in Sections 30 and 31 that no question of civil or criminal liability is to be brought under the notice of a coroner's jury or the coroner himself. They are limited to the matters of the identity of the person and how, when and where death occurred&mdash;simply matters of fact.  It is, I think, a good thing to prevent coroners' juries adding riders so long as the saving clause is operated liberally that they may still make observations to give warning to prevent further fatalities near particular places.  Coroners' juries have often given very useful warning by calling attention to bad lighting, to bad corners, to hidden bends and all the rest.  They have often called the attention of local authorities to improvements they considered should be made in order to ensure safety on the roads.</P>
    <P>In this legislation there is power given to the Minister to remove from his office a coroner or a deputy coroner.  This is couched in the very well-known terms:</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister is satisfied that any coroner or deputy coroner has been guilty of misconduct or neglect of duty or is unfit for office or incapable of the due discharge of his duties by reason of physical or mental infirmity, the Minister may by order remove such coroner or deputy coroner from office.</P>
    <P>That order is to specify the reason for the removal.  I presume it is an order that will have to come before the House.</P>
    <P>I want to call attention to the phrase <Col N="340" /> is &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo;.  That phrase that was very definitely analysed by the late Mr. Gavan Duffy in a famous case which, in the end, led to the repeal of certain parts of the Offences Against the State Act and the production of a new piece of legislation by way of amendment to that.  His analysis of what is imported by the use of the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; has never been contradicted. I think it is still good law. It certainly has the appearance of the High Court behind it.  According to the late Judge, the use of this phrase means that the person is acting judicially or has acted judicially in the administration of justice.  In that case it was the administration of criminal justice.  For that reason the judge considered it was contrary to the Constitution, which allows only criminal matters to come before regularly-appointed judges and regularly-appointed courts.</P>
    <P>It may be said here that this is not the administration of justice.  I do not know what it is then.  It is certainly asking a person to become, so to speak, a judge, having to get evidence on which he acts and having to do a variety of things imported by the term. If this is found by the courts afterwards to be anything in the nature of administration of justice, it may also fall as being unconstitutional.  If it is the administration of policy, as the late Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy distinguished, it might be all right.  But I do not imagine this expression means it is merely the administration of policy.  The examination affects a person's livelihood to a certain extent. That would bring the use of this phrase rather inside the area of examination that was imposed by the courts on the solicitor's legislation which led that legislation to be declared in part unconstitutional and requiring amendment.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the phrase should be weakened.  It has come to the notice of people, who had not observed it before, that certain disciplinary matters, like, say, those concerning the Civic Guard, depend upon what an official considers to be something, so long as he can get the consent of the Minister.  The fact that a <Col N="341" /> person considers somebody to be in a particular position, added to a Ministerial consent, certainly affects the livelihood and liberties of certain people.</P>
    <P>I do not at all urge that this phrase &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; should be weakened down to where a Minister &ldquo;is of opinion,&rdquo; which is the phrase used in the amendment, because that would certainly give complete control and I do not suppose that is desired.  How to get a phrase in between is a matter that would have to be considered.  The word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; has been given a particular meaning.  That meaning has been carried forward again in the consideration of the solicitors' matter. On the whole, these phrases have been considered as importing judicial determination and, as such, are matters that cannot be done by the Minister alone.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the position here under the Constitution is that judges can be removed, but that is because the Constitution says so.  That is because there is a position accepted with regard to judges which gives the two Houses power over the Judiciary arising out of misconduct or misbehaviour.</P>
    <P>Most of the other matters with which I am concerned are matters for Committee Stage and I shall have amendments for these.  I suppose it is the accepted habit that there should be an age limit because of the nature of this office.  For that reason, I presume, the age of 70 was imported here.  It is generally being accepted that there should be some age limit put upon people holding offices of this kind.</P>
    <P>There is a provision with regard to qualifications.  The White Paper says this is not the old position.  The old position was that the Local Appointments Commissioners established the qualifications after consultation with the Minister.  That is now being changed and the Minister is being given power to declare the qualifications for appointments after consultation with the Local Appointments Commission.  I read in the memorandum that this change is to get in line with the Local Government Act, 1941.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> For the time being, I would prefer if the Local Appointments Commissioners made the qualifications after consultation with the Minister or if the Minister made the qualifications with the consent of the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now heard the legal interpretation of the Bill and I should like to give a layman's opinion of it.  It was a good idea to introduce this Bill because there were a number of points which needed to be straightened out.  There is a typical one in Part II, Section 6, which deals with coroners' districts.  In fact, the Bill will now make legal what has been the practice for quite some time.  It is right that these matters should be cleared up.</P>
      <P>Section 10 deals with the question of salaries.  That is a matter which should get a lot of attention because the present system is that a coroner is paid something around £250 per year, out of which he is required to pay his deputy a sum of around £20, his travelling expenses, telephone charges, etc. That means that the position of coroner is almost an honorary position.  He gets very little for it except the honour&mdash; the doubtful honour, in some cases&mdash; of being coroner for the district.  That matter should be looked into and there should be proper remuneration for the position.  If there is not, there is the danger that a solicitor who is a coroner will find himself in the position of being unable to act for people who are affected by, say, a road accident.  If a road accident occurs, he may wish to act for one of the parties and because of the fact that he is coroner, he cannot do so, with the result that for the miserly sum he receives as coroner, he may have to throw away the substantial sum he would get by acting for one of the parties.  For that reason, he may decline the position of coroner and we may find people less well qualified being appointed because the better qualified people are not available.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of reporting deaths to the coroner, I think it would be a better idea to have them reported to <Col N="343" /> the local Garda station.  After all, not everyone knows who the coroner is or where he lives, but everyone knows where the local Garda station is.  There is the other point that one Garda can view the body, and that the coroner need not view the body where it has been viewed by a Garda, as was previously the case.  That is a good idea but I suggest that more than one Garda should view the body because it has happened that a member of the Garda has been transferred and has not been available when the coroner's inquest was due to be held. That holds up the proceedings.</P>
    <P>On the question of juries adding riders, I think that a jury should be confined strictly to saying what they are in fact appointed to say, and that they should not make comments.  The tendency has been for some juries to get the idea that they are some type of court of inquiry and that they should make all sorts of suggestions, recommendations and condemnations. I also think coroners should be advised that it is not their business to make comments on the cause of accidents.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a case where a man was killed at work and the coroner said it was his opinion that the man caused his own death by negligence. That had a very adverse effect on the subsequent court case and the widow and family of the unfortunate man received a miserly sum, although everyone except the coroner knew that his death was attributable to a different reason.  He was killed because the machinery he was using was defective.  Coroners should be prevented from making such comments at an inquest.  That would make the position much easier for those who have to deal with the case after the inquest.</P>
    <P>The section which allows an inquest to be held without exhumation is a good section.  There was far too much red tape and bodies were exhumed, even though it did not make any difference so far as the inquest was concerned, but the law said it should be done and therefore it was done. Anything which modernises the law is a good idea and should be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> On the question of where the body is to be placed, I think it was excellent that the Minister did not say that a public house was the proper place to bring the body.  After all, the unfortunate person will not get get much joy in a public house.  The trouble was that it was preferable to take the body to a public house rather than to a private house or to a shed.  Originally, that was the reason why a public house was laid down as the place to which the body should be taken. Unfortunately, there are very few mortuaries in the country&mdash;there are just the odd ones attached to hospitals or churches&mdash;and the fact that there are so few may present a problem.</P>
    <P>There is the second problem that when an ambulance goes to the scene of an accident, under Local Government regulations, it is not allowed to take away a dead person.  If there is a spark of life, the ambulance can take the person away, but if the person is dead, it cannot.  I think the ambulance should take the body to the hospital to which it will be returning from the scene of the accident. Perhaps the Minister would have a word with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to see if something could be done&mdash;or perhaps the Minister for Health has something to do with it&mdash;to remove that restriction. It is unnecessary and, in fact, it is not nice to go to the scene of an accident, take away two people who are injured, and leave the third person who is dead lying on the side of the road for many hours, which happened as recently as last year.  The proper thing is that the body should be taken to the mortuary in the ambulance which goes to the scene of the accident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to hold up the House for very long.  I agree that this is mainly a measure for consideration on Committee Stage. I do not at all agree with the viewpoint of Deputy Tully regarding the operation of the section which declares that a solicitor may not act in certain cases in which he is involved as coroner. There is clearly a conflict of interest and it is an essential principle, an ethical principle, that a solicitor should <Col N="345" /> not act for two sides where there is a conflict of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have that clarified because it may have the effect, and I believe it has had the effect, of keeping out of the application list a number of solicitors who would otherwise apply.  The functions of the coroner are limited and, even when this Bill becomes law, the position will remain the same.  I am always pleased to see this type of legislation introduced and a particular debt of gratitude is due to the Department of Justice for the measures it has introduced here over the past few years.</P>
      <P>There is no question of vote catching involved, no case of a large measure of public pressure.  These are measures designed to bring our law up to date, to consolidate it and improve it, and all have shown great scholarship and very hard work on the part of the officials involved.  I can only say I hope the work will continue and that we shall bring our law up to date, not merely in regard to matters of this kind but in all other respects as well. I shall have, on Committee Stage, quite a number of suggestions to make to the House.  I agree with one or two of the points raised by Deputy McGilligan, but I think it more suitable to leave them over until then because no controversy is involved.  I believe the Minister will be quite prepared to meet any reasonable suggestion that will be forthcoming from either side of the House since his hope, and the hope of the House, is to produce a Bill that will not have to be amended in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see where scholarship comes into this measure. As far as I can see all it really proposes to do is one really good thing&mdash;to abolish the old custom, which was a great imposition upon the public houses throughout the country, that they were liable to have a corpse thrust upon them at any time.  All of us who are familiar with licensed premises are fairly familiar too with the fact that <Col N="346" /> very often people who are sinners enough to use licensed premises could be embarrassed by certain provisions in the old Act in this respect.</P>
      <P>This business of using licensed premises as a sort of morgue stems, of course, as the Minister suggested, from the time when the obvious place for dealing with any occurrence which might necessitate the attention of the coroner was the licensed premises.  A coroner, no doubt, in those days lived in the local manor.  It was a privileged office under the Crown and the last thing thought of would be to bring so unpleasant a thing as a corpse to his premises, so the local inn was the place selected.  I think this Bill does at least that much.  There is nothing else significant in it.  I welcome it on that score alone.  The licensed vintners have been campaigning for years to the various Ministers to have this done.  It is being done now and it is very welcome.</P>

      <P>I merely rise to reiterate what Deputy Tully has said about the removal of remains from the scene of an accident.  The fact that remains are allowed to stay at the scene of an accident while the local authority and the coroner quibbled about the means of removal has been the cause of a lot of public concern for years.  I understand the main objection by the local authorities is the necessity to remove a decayed body and it is most objectionable to have it done in a public ambulance. I would suggest that the Minister considers the possibility of providing some sort of sealed container for the removal of the bodies.  I feel that would get over a lot of the objections from the point of view of the local authority.  I should like the Minister to include something of that sort because it is most unchristian in a supposedly Christian country to allow this state of affairs to continue.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has suggested, and Deputies have agreed with him, this is essentially a Committee Stage Bill.  I do not think anybody will take any exception to the major changes proposed in this legislation.  I should like to raise one <Col N="347" /> local matter at this stage.  The Minister provides in one of the sections for a change in certain coroners' districts&mdash; Kilkenny, Clonmel, Drogheda, Sligo. Would he have a further look at the division of the coroners' districts?  He may have had some intention of doing this.  At least in County Wexford there seems to be an unnatural division of the county for the purpose of coroners' districts.  There are two coroners in the county, but one of the districts is the region which you might say is east of the Slaney River and the other is to the West of the Slaney.  If there is to be any natural division in County Wexford, the division which would be most acceptable to the people would be North Wexford and South Wexford.  I think the Minister should consider that because we have the peculiar situation where the coroner for North Wexford comes down as far as Wexford town, which is definitely in the South.  I do not want to weary the Minister with the geography of County Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel sure it would not but I should like him to examine the Wexford district to see whether he could divide the county into North and South districts.  I have reason to believe as well that as far as the two coroners there are concerned, there would be no difficulty at all in regard to travelling.</P>
      <P>Deputy S. Dunne congratulated the Minister on the proposal in the Bill which discontinues the practice of having bodies removed to licensed premises.  I assume that that means also that inquests may not in future be held in licensed premises.  I do not know whether that is made abundantly clear in the Bill.  I would be very pleased if that were a very definite proposal in this measure because I think everybody knows the objections to the removal of remains to licensed premises and certainly to the holding of inquests in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of the removal of bodies to mortuaries and morgues. <Col N="348" /> I do not know how effective that can be or what it means.  The only mortuaries I know in this country are those attached to churches.  Does this mean that a dead person who has been the victim of an accident can in future be removed to a mortuary?  What is a mortuary, for the purpose of this Bill? Does is mean a mortuary attached to a church?  Perhaps the Minister would tell us how many morgues there are in the country?  Nobody is anxious to see a great number of them, but I do not know that there are any morgues at all in County Wexford.  Would the Minister tell us what responsibility, if any, there is on local authorities to provide morgues in their functional areas?  I do not know that there is any.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make clear now what exactly is to happen if a dead person is found?  Where is the corpse to be brought?  Where is the inquest to be held?  There is no statutory obligation that I know of.  There is no regulation either in the Department of Health or the Department of Justice which says that a body must be received into a hospital for the purpose of holding an inquest.  I am informed that bodies are received in county or district hospitals only with the permission of the county surgeon or the matron.  It is with their permission that inquests are held.  I applaud Deputy Tully's suggestion that the Minister should consult with the Minister for Health to ensure some firm arrangement with regard to the removal of bodies to local authority hospitals and the holding of inquests in these hospitals.</P>
    <P>Nearly every year local authorities have discussions&mdash;one might almost describe them as rows&mdash;about the purposes for which ambulances can be used in relation to sudden deaths or accidents.  It is well known that county managers and county council officials protest they are precluded from using ambulances for the transportation of corpses.  In the case of an accident, or a sudden death in a public place, I do not think it is unreasonable that some sort of transportation should be provided by the local authority.  I do not agree it ought to be an ambulance.  There are reasons why I think it should not be <Col N="349" /> an ambulance.  But some form of transportation should be provided.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the only function of a coroner now, and his jury, is to determine the cause of death.  I was interested in Deputy Tully's and Deputy S. Flanagan's comments with regard to the position of a barrister or solicitor who also happens to be a coroner.  If the coroner's only function is to determine the cause of death, I do not see why that should preclude him, if he is a barrister or a solicitor, from acting subsequently on behalf of one of the parties involved.  At first glance, I certainly cannot see any objection to a coroner acting on behalf of relatives of an injured person.  I have an open mind on the matter. There may be snags.  There may be a conflict of interest.  If, however, we intend to preclude country solicitors from engaging in court actions, after having sat as coroners, I do not think we will get many who will come forward to apply for positions as coroners.</P>
    <P>The coroner's function&mdash;let me emphasise it again&mdash;is merely to determine the cause of death.  Hitherto, he could return a verdict.  Now all he has to say is that the man is dead and the cause of death.  I quite agree coroners should be curbed in the wild statements some of them make, attributing blame to unfortunate members or officials of county councils.  In that respect, they are no different from many district justices, who take a very wide licence in summing up, lambasting all and sundry, especially public representatives.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what latitude coroners have in their comments at inquests because their comments can be very hurtful and very damaging.  At first glance, I can see no reason why coroners should be prohibited from appearing in subsequent court actions, since their only function is saying what the cause of death is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little to add to what has been said but I suggest to the Minister that in rural areas the proper place to take a body is the Garda station.  We have enough of those in the country to warrant <Col N="350" /> an arrangement on these lines and the Garda authorities are the people mainly concerned.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Health Authority is proposing to muster the entire ambulance fleet in their own premises. Remembering the number of accidents that occur in the city, the provision of a particular type of transport for the removal of corpses should be considered.  Of course, there are enough means now at the disposal of authorities to make sure that ambulances used for the removal of corpses are properly disinfected subsequently. All of us who have been unfortunate enough to witness serious accidents can appreciate the need for that. Deputy Tully referred to the ridiculous practice of ambulances proceeding to the scene of an accident and returning empty because the injured person was already dead.  There would seem to be no economy in that procedure.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to mortuaries. I doubt if the ecclesiastical authorities would welcome the suggestion that bodies should be brought to mortuaries for the holding of inquests. It is reprehensible enough in the local inn, but it is going from bad to worse to suggest that mortuaries should be used.  The Minister might consider the possibility of utilising Garda stations for the reception of corpses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this is mainly a Committee Stage Bill but I should like to add a few words to what Deputy Carroll has said with regard to the removal of bodies to the nearest Garda station or the mortuary attached to a church or hospital. I can understand how people would react if a body were brought into their home or place of business.  I have had cases where people wanted to transfer from homes because dead bodies had been in them, when people fell or were killed on the premises.  Others believe a place is haunted once a dead body has been or is found on the premises.  It is probable that at one time there was competition for dead bodies by public houses because it probably brought <Col N="351" /> business.  Now, when the public houses are becoming &ldquo;posh&rdquo;, they do not want dead bodies because they might frighten people away.  Perhaps some public houses still want them because my experience is that where there is anything like that, there is a huge crowd.  Even where victims of accidents are dying, they cannot get air, so they certainly attract an audience.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether the coroner should have an interest in the victim or the next-of-kin of the victim, I disagree that he should.  It would be as if a judge in the courts had an interest in the prosecution or the defence and I am not so sure that there would be a fair judgment.  As regards the question of salary, it boils down to how much work the coroner does and what he gets out of it.  Other people, such as members of a county council, are not paid, but it pays some of them because by reason of membership, they are well known and perhaps get good business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, at the outset, to express to the House my appreciation for the helpful manner in which it has received and discussed this Bill and indeed for the agreement on all sides that, in essence, it is a Committee Bill and that we can discuss it more freely and advantageously in Committee.  However, a number of points have been raised and I should like to mention them very briefly in replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan indicated that as far as he knew there was no volume of opinion in favour of the abolition of the office of coroner.  I do not think he is quite right in that.  There was certainly some opinion to the effect that the office was an archaic relic and should be done away with.  Indeed, one very influential, well-informed English newspaper led a campaign to have the office abolished, but apart from that, I think it is something that should have been examined.  In any event, the fact that you have an office of this sort there for a long time with historical origins, an office that came into being when circumstances were infinitely different from what they are to-day&mdash; all that justifies an examination as to <Col N="352" /> whether or not the office should be abolished.  There was a considerable amount of expert opinion to the effect that the work could be done more expeditiously otherwise.  However, the decision to retain the office has been taken and as far as I can gauge the opinion of the House, the House agrees that the office should continue and that it can perform a very useful function.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also mentioned the matter of notification.  I should like to reiterate what I said in my opening speech.  The object is to ensure that all suspicious deaths are notified.  I think the provision in the Bill is reasonable, that if a person dies who has not been attended by a practitioner within a month before his death, then it is reasonable that such death should be reported.  Apart altogether from the coroner aspect of this, we are anxious to increase the registration of deaths, to get more knowledge of deaths that occur.  It is a matter socially undesirable that the figure I have given&mdash;6.1 per cent. of deaths uncertified&mdash;should be correct and I think the provision in the Bill will help to remedy that situation, as well as ensuring as far as possible that suspicious deaths are notified to the coroner.  The coroner can then decide whether or not he will hold an inquest.</P>
    <P>There is also another aspect.  When the provisions of this Bill become known to people generally, I think it will encourage people to call in a doctor possibly more frequently than they might otherwise do, where it appears a person may be in danger of death, and so obviate trouble to themselves later on of having to notify the coroner.  That would be a good thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan drew attention to the phrase we use: &ldquo;whenever the Minister is satisfied.&rdquo;  I had been thinking of that phrase myself and I was considering an amendment on Committee Stage to change it to the wording that Deputy McGilligan mentioned, that is, &ldquo;where the Minister is of opinion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the matter of the removal of bodies. In that regard the position in Dublin <Col N="353" /> city is that the local authority has an arrangement whereby a firm of undertakers is under contract to remove bodies and take them to the morgue.  That practice may or may not be followed throughout the country.  The suggestion has been made that ambulances should be used for this purpose.  The House will readily understand that this is a matter for the Minister for Health and one can immediately see that the Minister or health authorities would have certain objections.  Whether they could be overcome along the lines suggested by Deputy Coogan or not is a matter that could be investigated.</P>
    <P>However, from my point of view and that of the Bill, the important thing is that the Bill does prescribe that all expenses in connection with the removal of bodies can be authorised. If a local authority wants to make any such arrangement, the expenses can be authorised and paid.  It is entirely a matter for the local authority whether they decide to follow the lead of Dublin Corporation and make an arrangement of that nature or make some alternative arrangement.  The Bill enables expenses of any such arrangement to be authorised and paid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully, in what I regard as a particularly valuable and informed contribution, mentioned a number of points which I shall certainly consider. One which he and other Deputies mentioned was coroners' salaries.  The salaries were reviewed in 1947 and since that time, coroners, of course, have participated in percentage increases which all local authorities' officers have got since then.  I am not aware that the salaries would be regarded as inadequate in any way. Deputy Sherwin quite rightly pointed out that there are two aspects of this, one, the amount of work the coroner has to do and the second, the factor he mentioned, that the office or the fact of being coroner brings certain prestige and standing to the office holder which could not readily be related to any emoluments.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any danger that we are not likely to get fully qualified applicants for these positions. I have no indication that that is so and <Col N="354" /> I do not think the House need be unduly worried in that regard.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies welcomed the provision about riders and statements exonerating from blame and so on that have become the practice in recent years.  Some Deputy asked what my view was about these and about statements by coroners.  My view is quite clear and definite.  The function of the coroner is clearly defined and the function of the inquest is to ascertain who the deceased was, how, where and when he died, and no more than that. Statements of any sort are to be deprecated.  The usual type of condolences offered to the deceased's relatives are, of course, in a different category.  Nobody would object to that sort of statement by a coroner but anything outside of that is completely unnecessary and unwanted by all of us.</P>
    <P>We are preserving in this Bill the valuable provision that general recommendations may be made.  Those recommendations should be, as I see it, confined to endeavouring to ensure that further fatalities would not arise in a similar set of circumstances.  They should be of a general nature.  There should be no question, as Deputy Corish very rightly says, of coroners or juries attacking officials or other people concerned in these matters.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the question of morgues and mortuaries.  Let me say immediately I do not contemplate that the mortuaries attached to churches should ever be used for this purpose.  I admit this is not specifically prohibited in the Bill, but I want to make it clear we would not regard a mortuary attached to a church as a suitable place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>By a mortuary, I mean a mortuary attached to a hospital. In that regard, the responsibility is solely on the local authorities to provide suitable places.  I do not think great difficulty will arise.  Throughout the country there are, I think, an adequate number of hospitals with mortuaries attached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that may arise in certain circumstances.  Anyway the Deputy will realise the Bill does say &ldquo;a suitable place&rdquo;.  That will be a matter for the coroner himself to decide and there is an onus on the local authority, where the coroner complains, to do something about the situation. It is not a matter we should try to deal with by legislation.  We must leave it to the good sense of the coroner and local authority to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>The fact that it is requested by the responsible leader of the Labour Party is sufficient to ensure that the request will receive earnest attention.  However, there is no question of inquests being held in public houses.  Deputy Corish might be under a slight misapprehension there.  The inquest must be held where the body is and the fact that bodies will not be in the public house any longer should certainly obviate any necessity to hold an inquest there.  I <Col N="356" /> hope that will not happen and I cannot imagine that it would.</P>
      <P>Those are the main points Deputies raised.  As we shall be going over the whole Bill in more detail on Committee Stage I shall confine myself again to thanking Deputies who have contributed to the debate for the very reasonable manner in which they have approached the Bill and for their very sound and sensible suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned that the coroner will direct that the body be removed.  If the coroner is 30 or 40 miles away, is it the responsibility of the local Garda to do so?  Do we have to wait until that coroner comes to the scene which may be a couple of hours later so that there is a continuation of the same scandalous state of affairs that the body is left there?  Something will have to be done.  It should be provided in the Bill who is to be responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill is the necessary result of a decision to carry out a scheme of reorganisation of the Dublin Metropolitan Division of the Garda Síochána.  The scheme provides for the creation of twenty-one additional posts of inspector rank in the Division and to enable all these appointments to be made the existing statutory provisions governing the strength of the ranks of the Force will have to be amended.  These provisions are contained in subsection (2) of section 5 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925.  They prescribe that the Garda Siochana shall consist of such officers and men as the Government shall from time to time determine not exceeding the total number of officers and men respectively specified in the Third Schedule to the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that Schedule, as amended by the <Col N="357" /> Garda Siochana Act, 1945, the maximum strength of the inspector rank is 90 and that number also represents the strength of the rank as determined by Government.  Within the present statutory limit, it has been possible to make some of the additional appointments but to enable all the appointments to be made it will be necessary to provide for a maximum strength of 103.  That is the purpose of the Bill but Deputies will note that I am asking for approval of a maximum number of 110.  I consider it prudent to provide for a margin in excess of present requirements in order to meet possible future contingencies.  This course will obviate the necessity for further legislation.</P>
    <P>The scheme of reorganisation, which has been formulated by the Commissioner of the Force in consultation with his senior officers, is based on the recommendations of a firm of management consultants which carried out an investigation into the administrative and organisation structure of the Dublin Metropolitan Division.  The scheme is aimed at improving the present administrative system and increasing crime prevention efficiency in the Division, and many of the provisions of the scheme dealing with the allocation of duties and personnel, the coordination of the efforts of different work sections and the elimination of duplication have already been put into operation.</P>
    <P>The aspects of the scheme which make the appointment of the inspectors necessary are those relating to station and unit control, outdoor supervision, communications and a crime prevention service.  It is considered essential, in the interests of effective control, that there should be attached to each station a person of responsible rank who would have responsibility for the activities of the complete station party and station area and under the scheme 21 of the city's 23 stations will have an inspector assigned for this duty&mdash;Raheny and Kill-O'-Grange will not be so staffed, but they will come under the control of the inspectors at Clontarf and Dalkey respectively.  Likewise, each of seven district detective units will have an inspector in control.  In addition, <Col N="358" /> the maintenance of adequate outdoor supervision will require the assignment of three extra inspectors for duty tours at each of the city's six central stations, viz., College Street, Kevin Street, Harcourt Terrace, Bridewell, Fitzgibbon Street and Store Street.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a Crime Prevention Advisory Officer is also provided for.  He will be required, among other things, to make a study of crime prevention methods, to advise firms and individuals on the best protection methods against housebreaking and loss of property and to give lectures to members of the Force on prevention and detection methods.  Lastly, it is intended to have a Communications Officer who will be in charge of 999 calls, radio service, telephone and teleprinter service.</P>
    <P>I have carefully considered the proposals of the Garda Commissioner and I am fully satisfied that the scheme will result in a more satisfactory system of organisation and administration and will provide a big improvement in the machinery for supervision and crime investigation.</P>
    <P>The creation of the additional inspector posts in the Dublin Metropolitan Division will mean promotion for a number of members of the Force of sergeant and station sergeant rank with consequential promotion for members of Garda rank.  I should like, therefore, to make some comments on the subject of promotion generally as it seems to me that in any Force like the Garda Siochana it must be regarded as being of vital importance. It is one which is of particular interest to the individual member and one on which there has been, from time to time, a great deal of discussion and comment.  It is a matter which vitally affects morale and has an important bearing on the efficiency of the Force as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is important at the outset to emphasise that in any such Force only a proportion of the members can attain promotion and it is only natural, therefore, that there will be some disappointment to individual members from time to time.  That is, of course, inevitable and cannot be avoided.  What can and must be <Col N="359" /> avoided, however, is that that natural and human disappointment should be transformed into a sense of frustration or injustice leading to discontent.  This can only be done if the system of promotion is obviously just and equitable, and every member of the Force can feel, and indeed know, that he will get a fair crack of the whip. In any large organisation, luck will play a certain part but every fair-minded person will understand that this cannot be helped.  The workings of any system will throw up the odd anomaly from time to time, and maybe even an occasional injustice.  The objective, however, must be to ensure that any such discrepancies are kept down to an absolute minimum and that the system is demonstrably as fair and reasonable as possible.</P>
    <P>Promotion prospects were never better than they are at present.  At no time since the inception of the Force have there been such widespread opportunities available to all ranks as there will be during the next few years.  Every Garda today carries gold braid in his tunic pocket and the young man of ability who applies himself to his career in the Force with diligence, zeal and energy can look forward to a very promising future. During the next six years, as a consequence of retirements on age ground alone, the following appointments will require to be made:</P>

    <P>I have heard complaints that the older members of the Force are being victimised by the promotion of younger men over their heads.  I have made inquiries about this aspect and find that the average age of promotees over the past three years was 57 years for chief superintendents, 51 years for superintendents, 46 years for inspectors and 35 years for sergeants.  Other things being equal, preference is given to senior men, but suitability for <Col N="360" /> higher duties, and not seniority, is the determining factor.  In the Garda Síochána, where there is promotion right up along the line, and where there is no entry to the officer ranks through the medium of a cadet force, it is essential that seniority alone should not be the sole ground for promotion. I should point out also that between 1954 and 1960, 757 members passed the eligibility tests for promotion to sergeant rank and only 70 of these were over 40.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the number of elderly men in the Force, these figures clearly show that the reason why the younger men are figuring in the promotion list is that the older men are not eligible to be promoted.  In November 1960, the existing promotion procedure was discussed by the Commissioner with the Representative Bodies for Gardaí, sergeants, station sergeants and inspectors.  A number of members expressed criticism of the procedure but the Bodies had no concrete suggestions for improvement. In view of the paramount importance of this matter, however, and the accelerated volume of promotion which must take place within the next few years, I intend to discuss the existing arrangements with the Commissioner at an early date in order to satisfy myself that they are the best possible having regard to all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I found in my hands the other day this piece of legislation to enable 110 inspectors to be appointed in the Guards, instead of 90, the present limit.  I came in to hear a statement as to what were the extra difficulties which have arisen in the running of the Garda Siochana which demand that 20 extra inspectors should be appointed.  The Minister takes that opportunity to make a highly prejudicial ex parte statement bearing on the recent controversy.  It is an abuse of Parliamentary functions, particularly when there is an effort being made even to stifle questioning on the whole matter.  I will have to leave further discussion on this until <Col N="361" /> I see what this scheme of organisation is and have some information given me with regard to this matter of promotion.</P>
      <P>The question of promotion is a cause of a great deal of dissatisfaction in the Force, apart from the question of pay.  The Minister takes the opportunity on a simple piece of legislation such as this to make a completely prejudicial statement of one side of the case.  He might at least have shown some delicacy in the matter.  In present circumstances, it is almost an insult to say that the Guards are getting a fair crack of the whip.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise one point which I raised here before on the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  I think it arises now, particularly since the Minister refers to the creation of extra posts of inspector. A superintendent is entitled to an extension of service if he has I.R.A. service. That does not apply to an inspector and there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction among the small number of men affected.  While the Minister was making his general statement, I noticed that he did not say anything about this matter.  It is a matter which I have raised in succeeding years on the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  Perhaps the Minister would consider giving this extension, which applies to superintendents, to inspectors in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on the proposal to increase the number of inspectors from 90 to 110. I have had complaints from senior station sergeants that on several occasions in the past they were overlooked. I think that these men who have vast experience should be considered. I do not think that there should be any barrier to promotion.  It is every man's ambition to rise higher.  It is every T.D.'s ambition to become a Minister some day.  In fact, it has been the complaint of certain T.D.s that they got browned off awaiting their opportunity.  That is why they took to drink.  That is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be no barrier put in the way of any man.  As the Minister said, using a variation of the Napoleonic <Col N="362" /> expression, every member of the Garda has gold braid in his knapsack. Station sergeants should not be overlooked.  Sometimes it is a bad thing to be too good.  It has been said that we cannot do without a person; that he should be left there.  That is all right but whether a man is very good or not, he should not be debarred from promotion if he deserves promotion. I have been informed that some of the senior station sergeants were to some extent victimised, perhaps because they were too good for their jobs.  In this matter of promotion, there should be no obstacle put in the way of any man.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that &ldquo;all things being equal,&rdquo; some priority would go to the senior men.  I do not agree with that, either.  It all depends on what you mean by &ldquo;all things being equal.&rdquo; For instance, there is usually a certain standard of knowledge and you have to pass a test.  We all know that in deciding on this sort of business there must be some standard.  Allowance must be made for the fact that some men who may not have the accepted standard, may have vast experience. For instance, it might be laid down that one must know a certain amount of Irish or some other subject and the senior men may have forgotten what they had known of those subjects and might not then be regarded as equal to others to whom they may be far superior in knowledge and experience. Therefore when it comes to this question of equality, the Minister must make allowance for experience and give some percentage of marks for experience and not merely make the appointments on mere academic tests, which is the usual procedure.</P>
    <P>It has been proved, especially in times of revolution, that it was the sergeants who became the chief persons. Most of the Russian marshals were sergeants.  In every revolution these are the men who came to the top because that is the time when red tape is abolished and experience counts.  If I had to pass a test in order to get into Parliament, they would never make me a T.D.  It is experience that counts.</P>
    <P>These men have made the case to me privately and I am here to voice <Col N="363" /> their views, as I am entitled to do. There should be no barrier to promotion for any man.  Allowance must be made for experience and it must not be a question of equality in tests or any of these artificial conundrums devised to decide whether a man is a genius or not and which do not prove anything.</P>

      <P>I felt that that was running through what the Minister said.  I should not like the occasion to pass without letting the Minister know that I am aware that there is a certain amount of uneasiness amongst the Gardaí in regard to the question of promotions, that junior men have been promoted.  They may be good but the Gardaí must be satisfied in that respect.  They have proved that they were not satisfied.  It is unfair that there should be such unrest.  Recently the younger men felt that they were not treated well in certain circumstances with regard to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to bring out the point that these are the men who are given the <Col N="364" /> tough assignments in the North and these are the men to whom the Minister showed the mailed fist in the last week or two.  It is most unfair that there should be any uneasiness amongst the Garda.  We have held them in high respect.  Amongst all sections of the public they are held in high respect.  The Minister should bear that in mind.</P>

      <P>There is only one point that I should like to bring to the Minister's notice. If at a particular time a member of the Garda of any rank qualifies in the standards then set for a higher post and the regulations are changed before he has been promoted, perhaps in a way to exclude him from promotion for which his merit has been previously established, that should not exclude him.  If he has the qualifications at a particular time for a higher post, a change of regulations should not debar him from attaining the post, when the time comes.</P>

      <P>I spoke of change.  When the Minister talks about Gardaí having gold braid in their pockets I think I am entitled to refer to it.  As far as promotion is concerned, there have been comments from time to time but in regard to every job in the country there have been comments from time to time as to the way promotion was carried out.  We have a new Minister and, with our knowledge of what can happen, we are entitled to give the new Minister, who is making a very promising start, every possible assistance in this House to improve the Force.  It would be unfair for us to say that the proposal to have extra inspectors is for the purpose of instituting extra prosecutions for minor offences.</P>
      <P>There are serious crimes occurring in the country.  There are serious crimes occurring in the city.  Unfortunately, we are coming to the time of year when serious crimes become more numerous.  If the Minister's action in introducing this motion succeeds in reducing the number of serious crimes and in having persons responsible for such crimes prosecuted, we should all be very grateful to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make an observation.  It is true that a tradition has been established in this House that the House tacitly waives its rule that people must not read speeches in favour of Ministers introducing Bills or elaborate Estimates but there has been a corresponding courtesy on the side of Ministers that, where the terms of their introductory observations require the Minister to read a document to the House, a copy of it is circulated for the convenience of Deputies, for the simple reason that if the Minister's statement is one of such complexity as requires it to be read, it follows that Deputies listening to it will want to have the text to refer to if they are intelligently to comment on what the Minister has said.  I think the Minister has overlooked that courtesy twice today.  Possibly it was an oversight but I would be grateful if he would have regard to it in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Bill which deals with reorganisation of the Garda is a Bill of consequence <Col N="366" /> and, of course, raises a vast area of discussion once we speak of reorganisation and the things that flow from it.  I am deliberately abstaining from any reference to recent controversies as I hope and believe that these matters are now being equitably resolved.  But, there is one matter in connection with the reorganisation of the Garda which, I think, warrants attention.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the incidence of attacks on unprotected women in the streets, particularly in the suburbs of Dublin, is coming to assume serious proportions.  The difficulty associated with this problem is that we hear of proceedings in relation to some of these incidents when somebody is apprehended or when the occurrence is of exceptional gravity.  But I regret to say my information is that a great many instances of this kind are occurring and that the victims, simply because they recoil from the additional burden of publicity, are not bringing them to the attention of the Garda. Nevertheless a great deal of public anxiety exists and parents are apprehensive for the safety of their daughters and husbands are apprehensive for the safety of their wives.  These instances extend from the mere gesture of jostling women in the street up to the point of offering them physical violence.</P>
    <P>There is no use raising a matter of this kind unless one has some suggestion to make as to how it may be met. I do not think any system of reorganisation, or the provision of motorised patrols, or any mechanical device of the character which Deputy Seán MacCarthy appears to have at the back of his mind in the new atomic age when he speaks of new circumstances in which we find ourselves, is adequate to meet this situation.  I believe the fact that this situation is much worse in cities like New York, London, and some of the big industrial cities in the outside world, is due to the failure of the authorities there to realise what I believe to be a fundamental fact of unsatisfactory police administration, and that is that there is no substitute for the man on the beat.  That is very easy to understand in rural Ireland but the extension of <Col N="367" /> that principle to urban life is sometimes overlooked.</P>
    <P>In Government and out of Government I have opposed a series of proposals materially to reduce the strength of the Garda in rural areas.  There has always been a strong school of thought who want to try and close up as many rural Garda stations as possible and substitute for the permanent station perambulatory patrols.  I never believed that that is a satisfactory method of maintaining public peace in rural Ireland, because it is the local resident Guard who knows the people, who has the confidence of the people, who will get from the people the kind of co-operation without which no police force can maintain the law.  That principle can and should be extended especially to suburban areas around the cities.</P>
    <P>If we have an adequate patrol and an adequate number of beats in the suburbs with Gardaí who grow to know the residents and habitues of the areas the possibility for violence of the kind to which I have referred will start receding because the Guards will come to know the individuals who are capable of such conduct, if they are resident in the particular area in which the Guard is on patrol.  If it be strangers who are coming into the district to create disturbances, their very presence will be detected by the Guard who is familiar with the district before any danger is done.  If damage should be done, the Guard will make a careful note of the appearance of the strangers he has seen abroad and that will greatly assist in the detection of offences of this kind.</P>
    <P>I want to submit to the House that it is what we might describe as relatively minor offences of this kind which can constitute one of the greatest abuses in ordinary civil life.  The burglar, the murderer, the embezzler, and the major criminal is, as a general rule, apprehended, and it is relatively easy to mobilise public co-operation for the detection of that type of crime, but for the ordinary citizen who experiences aggression in the public street, to the point of being gravely intimidated or possibly injured, it can be an infinitely distressing experience <Col N="368" /> and create a general atmosphere of <i>malaise</i> and anxiety which becomes a great burden on ordinary law-abiding citizens.  Therefore I avail of the discussion on this Bill to direct the attention of the Minister to the existence of this evil and to suggest to him that, particularly in suburban areas, adequate patrols be provided until this abuse is effectively brought under control.  I attach such importance to that matter that I propose to confine my observations on this stage of the Bill, which is designed for the reorganisation of the Garda, to that and one other topic.</P>
    <P>In the matter of promotion and administration, it seems to me that nothing is more important than that every officer of the Garda should be satisfied in his mind that if he faithfully discharges his duty he will be supported and sustained by his superior officers and by the Minister for Justice of the State.  If a Garda detects any one of us, whether we are from Oireachtas Éireann or members of the Government, or individuals who are not in public life, whether we be rich or poor, in the breach of regulations or in the breach of laws for which it is the duty of a Garda to prosecute, it is vitally important that every Garda should know that if he discharges his duty, no matter how influential the person involved may be, the Garda will be sustained in the discharge of his duty.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that in the relatively recent past summonses have issued at the instance of the Garda and have subsequently been withdrawn.  I should be glad if the Minister would look into that matter. If summonses in connection with breaches of the licensing laws have been issued, I should be glad to be reassured by the Minister that careful perusal of his records reassures him that any such summons that has been withdrawn has been withdrawn for a proper reason and not simply because there was any reluctance on the part of the Executive to allow the prosecution of an individual to proceed.</P>
    <P>If we once accept in this country a dual standard, under which certain persons are exempt from conformity <Col N="369" /> with the law, I believe it is impossible to maintain a decent police standard at all.  We have got to establish definitely that if a Garda does his duty under the regulations and in accordance with the obligations of courtesy every public servant owes to his employers, he will be sustained and supported by those who are in authority over him without regard to persons and circumstances.  I should be glad to have on the occasion of this Bill an assurance from the Minister that that is his intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and all concerned that the recent trouble is now all over and that the men seem to have come out of it well.  One matter I should like to mention to the Minister is the question of promotion.  Any Garda who has given years of service in his area and who is satisfactory and capable of being promoted should not be passed over in favour of younger men.  Those who have 25 or 30 years of service should get promotion if they are worthy of it, because it would be a great help to them in after years when they go on pension.  The value of money is depreciating every year and those people who come out on pension at present may find themselves in the position of old age pensioners in five years' time.</P>

I would suggest to him that he be re-baptised or go through some similar process to rid himself of the results of the sins of his predecessors in the Department of Justice.  As far as I can see, the results of some of the activities in that Department are beneath contempt, particularly the attitude towards members of the Garda.  I want to make special reference to the methods involved in connection with promotions.  The question of pay has sparked off a very unusual drama&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the sentence finished, Sir, but the question <Col N="370" /> of promotion will very soon spark off a bigger row.  I wonder if Deputies are aware of some of the extraordinary methods used in connection with promotions from Garda to the rank of sergeant and from sergeant to superintendent? I wonder are Deputies aware that this method is open to many and varied interpretations and is a very doubtful one?  The examinations are set, I think, by two superintendents and a chief superintendent. It often happens in these examinations that there are questions involving criminal law.  But in the whole Force, as far as I am aware, there are only two people who know anything about criminal law, two people who could stand on their feet if the question of criminal law had to be debated.  One is a chief superintendent with the qualification of B.L., and the other is a superintendent, also with the qualification of B.L.  Do either of these two people take part in the setting of the examinations for promotion within the Garda?</P>
      <P>I also want to point out that it is well known that members of the Garda at various ranks are able to have advance warning of the type of question they will be called upon to answer. That is only reasonable to expect when you consider that some of the people going for promotion may be the escort or the driver of the superintendent who set the questions.  Some of them may be the clerk to the superintendent who frames the questions.  It is only human that information should leak out.  Consequently, the sergeant or the Garda who happens to be known to the people who set the examinations has the best chance of getting promotion. Is there not some way of getting over that?  Can the Civil Service Commissioners or someone else not deal with this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man who is at the head of the Force, and in my opinion he should not be at the head of the Force, was a civil servant himself and should be one of the first to alter a suspect method of promotion.  As this method now stands, the whole system is suspect. It is believed that favouritism is taking place.  In the local areas the rural Guards are very displeased because they always find that, in the long <Col N="371" /> run, promotion goes to people who are known to have been known to the people who set these examinations.  I ask the Minister to make a special inquiry into that.  If he does nothing else but to change that very doubtful method of promotion, he will be doing good work for himself and for the Garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been made which I should like to deal with in reply.  First, I shall deal with the points raised by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon.  I took a careful note of what he had to say with regard to the recent development of attacks on women.  First of all, I am sure the House will appreciate the Garda are almost completely powerless in cases which are not reported to them.  That is one of the difficult factors in that type of case, that women are reluctant in a number of cases to report these matters to the Garda.  It is very difficult, therefore, for the Garda to do anything at all in such circumstances. However, I am afraid it is true there is some evidence that this type of menace has increased in recent years.  But I should not like the House to pay too much attention to the newspapers in this regard.  I am afraid there is a tendency on the part of the newspapers to highlight this sort of sensational story and probably give a wrong impression as to the frequency with which attacks occur.  However, I can tell the House that this is a problem which is very much in mind.  In the past two years, 200 extra Gardaí have been drafted into the city and the frequency of beat duty has been increased.  I think that is all I can usefully say at this stage about it.  I would of course urge on those who are attacked in any way to report the matter immediately to the Garda. Indeed the newspapers can also do much to help by not making sensational matters out of incidents in the way they have done from time to time, thereby making people reluctant to come forward and report what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also mentioned the question of summonses.  I want to <Col N="372" /> make it absolutely clear that I know of no case where a summons which was issued has been withdrawn.  I should also like to make it clear that that would not primarily be a matter for me. Any case about which the police are in any doubt as to whether or not they should prosecute is referred to the Attorney General and he is the appropriate authority to decide whether or not the prosecution should proceed. I do not know of any case of a summons being withdrawn because the people to be prosecuted were influential, or because any factor of that nature entered into it.  Deputy Dillon also asked for an assurance in that regard.  I am now giving it.  To my knowledge, no such withdrawal has ever taken place.</P>
    <P>I am sure most Deputies who were in the House when I was speaking were quite surprised at Deputy McGilligan's remarks.  I am quite certain that he must not have understood what I was saying because I merely took the opportunity afforded by the introduction of this Bill to try to do what I could to make it clear to all the members of the Garda that if anyone in authority can help it, there will be no grounds for discontent with regard to promotion.  I was availing of this opportunity to get the message across that we are anxious to ensure that the system is fair to everyone, and not only fair but capable of being seen to be fair, that this is a matter which every member of the Garda can understand and appreciate, and, as I said in my opening remarks, that it is inevitable and only natural that in any large organisation there will be individual disappointments with regard to promotion but that what we must try to ensure is that every member of the Force will realise that even if he was not successful in a particular interview or application for promotion, nevertheless he got a fair crack of the whip and that the system was fair to all concerned.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with Deputies and others who raised the matter of the older members of the Garda not getting promotion to which they feel they are entitled.  I tried to make it clear in my remarks that there are very special circumstances applying <Col N="373" /> to the Garda in that regard.  Any individual Garda can get promotion right up to the top; in other words, there is no entry, at officer rank, straight into the Garda.  In that situation, strong weight must be given in promotion to suitability for higher duties.  It cannot be left to seniority alone because, as I say, any member of the Garda can be promoted right up to chief superintendent or deputy commissioner. In those circumstances, considerations of suitability, efficiency and capacity as well as seniority must be taken into account.  All other things being equal, the system is that seniority will then count.  That is about as fair as we can be.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening remarks, I regard this matter as of fundamental importance to the Garda. I regard it as absolutely essential that they should be satisfied in so far as is possible that the system is fair and working fairly.  For that reason, I propose to discuss it fully with the Commissioner to see if there is some way in which the system can be improved, if it has to be improved.  Apart from that, even if the system is all right, it must also appear to work all right.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also mentioned the question of the closing of rural stations.  That is a matter on which I am glad to hear the considered views of Deputies who have given thought to it because there is the problem of balance.  No rural station is closed without a great deal of consideration, and all the factors are gone into very carefully indeed.  I need hardly say that no station is ever closed unless the area in which the station is situated has been virtually free of crime for a number of years.  It is a problem of balance.  No one wants to have unnecessary stations or unnecessary members of the Garda.  From that point of view, the further we proceed with the closing down of unnecessary rural stations, the better.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is a great deal in what Deputy Dillon said about the necessity for the Garda to live in an area, know the people, win their confidence, and so on.  As I say it is a problem of balance and one every aspect of which will have to be given <Col N="374" /> careful consideration.  I regard it as helpful that Deputies give their views on the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin mentioned the question of Irish in regard to promotion. I should like to point out to him that the Irish Proficiency Test enters the picture for promotion purposes only in the case of men who joined the Force since 1943.  For men who joined before 1943, it is not a promotion factor.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy raised the point of the change in the regulations depriving men of promotion to which they would otherwise be entitled.  I do not know of any such instance and I shall certainly look into any case of which the Deputy has knowledge.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass raised the point about the extension of service in the Garda on ground of national service. I am not too clear as to his exact point because as I understand the position, the present condition with regard to retention beyond the normal age of retirement applies to inspectors as well as superintendents.</P>
    <P>I think I have now dealt with most of the points which were raised.  I again find myself in the position of being able to thank the House sincerely for the helpful and constructive manner in which they have approached this Bill. Finally, may I say that I am quite certain Deputy McGilligan must have completely misunderstood my remarks.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the allegation of preference being given to younger men on the Force as against older men for promotion purposes. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that all other things being equal, seniority of service will be taken into consideration in the future.  I am aware of the unrest among the older members of the force in relation to promotion in recent times.  I wonder if the Minister is aware that in 1960 five senior sergeants as against eleven junior sergeants were selected and that in 1961, five senior sergeants were selected as against thirteen junior sergeants. <Col N="375" /> It would seem there are grounds for complaints that discrimination is being used against the older members having regard to those figures.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be able to give that assurance to the Deputy. Other things being equal, seniority counts.  I should like to refer the Deputy to what I said in my speech with regard to this question of older and younger men and promotions.  I pointed out that between 1954 and 1960, 757 members of the Garda passed the eligibility test for promotion to sergeant and only 70 of those were over forty years, so that out of 757, only 70 of the older members were eligible for promotion.  Accordingly, it is only natural that when promotions were being made there would be more younger men than older men.  The difficulty of the older men is to pass the eligibility test.</P>

      <P>There have been some complaints, usually in relation to border-line cases, but they have not been on a widespread scale.  I am satisfied that, generally speaking, millers are grading the maximum quantity of wheat as millable.

      <P>The consumption of butter per head in this country is already the highest in Europe while the price paid to producers for milk is among the lowest.  It is common practice in butter exporting countries to have the home price for butter higher than the export price.</P>
      <P>If the price for milk were to be determined by the export price of butter milk prices in this country would be reduced by 9½d. a gallon.  On the other hand if butter were to be sold on the home market at the export price the total cost of butter subsidy would be about £10,000,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The British Government intimated recently that, with a view to relieving pressure on the British butter market and strengthening prices, Governments of countries currently supplying butter to that market were being asked to limit their shipments in the six months from 1st October, 1961, to 31st March, 1962, to certain specified quantities.  They stated at the same time that they would be obliged to impose anti-dumping duties on butter from those countries which did not agree to limit supplies in the manner proposed.  These duties would be imposed in pursuance of applications made last August by New Zealand and Denmark in which Ireland and other countries were named.  Although we fully appreciate the need for, and are quite prepared to participate in, a reasonable and equitable arrangement designed to improve the market for butter in Britain, we were unable to agree to the particular proposal that was put to us.  The matter is still under discussion between the two Governments.</P>
      <P>The bulk of our surplus butter has traditionally been exported to Britain and the Six Countries, which are at present the only available markets of any importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give any indication as to the nature of the discussions taking place between his representatives and the British Government representatives?  It seems that the Danish quota at the present time is much higher than the Irish <Col N="389" /> quota and the percentage amount of butter we export to Britain is a negligible proportion of the consumption there.  In view of the close relations existing between Britain and Ireland for some years, surely the Minister should endeavour to have the situation reviewed in so far as it adversely affects Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I said this matter was still under discussion and I do not think I should go further than the information I have conveyed to the Deputy in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a provision in the trade agreements governing trade relations between Great Britain and Ireland to the effect that Great Britain will not apply restrictive quotas, as opposed to total prohibition, to any agricultural product exported from this country to Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 17 to 21 inclusive together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to previous replies on this subject.</P>
      <P>Because of their inability to operate in low visibility or high winds helicopters would be essential to the life-saving services only in very exceptional circumstances.  The recent loss of the &ldquo;Halronnell&rdquo; was the first case in our waters in which such circumstances prevailed since helicopters first came into operation and may well be the last for many years to come.  Indeed, even on this occasion, the coincidence of daylight and good visibility, the abatement of wind and the partial preservation of the vessel's structure constituted an element of providential good fortune which resulted in the helicopter being of service in saving three lives.</P>
      <P>The availability of helicopters for search and rescue purposes in Britain and elsewhere in Europe arises incidentally from a primary military requirement. On occasions of distress all who can help are bound by long standing traditions and international conventions to do so and our thanks are due to the British Navy for the splendid assistance they rendered.</P>
      <P>On the information and advice before me I am not prepared at present to recommend to the Government the diversion to a helicopter service of the very large sums which would be required and which were estimated a few years ago at £200,000 capital expenditure and £100,000 annual operating costs.  Such sums could be usefully applied in less novel but more effective ways to the saving of life in other fields of endeavour or to the general benefit of the community.  The situation is kept under constant review.  I am asking Aer Rianta Teo. to ascertain whether conditions have changed since the last enquiry in any way which would indicate a greater volume of demand for helicopters for a variety of uses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the scandalous reply by the Minister, is it not a fact that on innumerable occasions over the past five years we <Col N="395" /> have had to depend on the good offices of the British helicopter service in the north of Ireland and in Britain itself to rescue our sailors and to provide relief for our men in the lighthouses? Is it not a fact that on a number of occasions they had to provide ambulance services?  Surely the Minister does not suggest that it is only when there is an exceptional storm that the services of the helicopter people in Britain are necessary in Ireland?  Is the Minister suggesting now that it is more desirable on his and the Government's part to expend £1,100,000 on the purchase of obsolete jet aircraft and the construction of a runway at Baldonnel for military purposes than to expend the sum of £200,000 on a helicopter service which is absolutely essential in this country if we are to show any sense of responsibility towards the people on our coastline?</P>

      <P>The services of the Irish Air Companies have expanded at such a rate in recent years as to culminate in 1959-60 in the inability of the Air Corps to provide trained personnel in adequate numbers to meet additional pilot requirements for the companies.  As a result the companies found it necessary to arrange for the training of a certain number of selected Irish youths at an aviation school in Scotland.  This is intended <Col N="397" /> as a temporary measure as announced by the companies at a press conference on 25th September, 1961, when full details of the scheme were given. Negotiations are in progress for the future training by the Air Corps of the pilot requirements of the companies, and I am hopeful of a successful outcome.</P>

      <P>The scheme in operation between Aer Lingus and the Air Corps has not proved flexible to accommodate Aer Lingus with regard to the number of pilots needed.  Is it not a fact that over £1,100,000 was spent on the Air Corps for the purpose of making facilities available for the training of pilots for Aer Lingus and that that money has now gone down the drain?  Is it not a fact that jet planes were purchased by the Air Corps&mdash;there was argument in the House&mdash;for the purpose of training pilots who would be transferred to Aer Lingus?  That scheme has proved unsuccessful and pilots have now to be trained in Wales and Scotland for Aer Lingus.  Money spent on jet aircraft and on the runway at Baldonnel has been wasted.  Yet we cannot spend £200,000 on the provision of a helicopter service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by C.I.E. that the Board has for some time past been operating a chauffeur-driven limousine hire service of limited extent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that the whole question of hotel staff training is under examination by a <Col N="405" /> Working Group of which the Deputy is a member.

      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Local Government whether he has issued any regulations under the new Road Traffic Act in regard to the parking of vehicles; if so, what was the date of issue and the S.I. number; and whether it is prescribed in these or previous regulations that parking lights must be left on in a vehicle left overnight in an approved parking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which enables me to make regulations regarding the lighting of vehicles is not being brought into operation until the regulations on the various subjects dealt with in the section have been prepared.  In the meantime the lighting provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, and the regulations thereunder apply.  These include Article 5 of the Lighting of Vehicles Regulations, 1934, which exempts any vehicle which is stationary <Col N="445" /> in a parking place within the meaning of that Act from any provision requiring the carrying of a lamp on such vehicle.  Parking places under the 1933 Act are appointed by the various local byelaws made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána with my consent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there is a great deal of confusion in the public mind at the moment in regard to parking regulations and the question of having sidelights on at night?  Is he aware that in a number of towns the Gardaí have strictly enforced what would appear to be regulations under the new Act?  The Gardaí are insisting that cars have parking lights from lighting-up time on, while in other towns in similar streets, no effort is made to implement this regulation.  Would the Minister realise that I am trying to clarify for the public whether it is mandatory to have parking lights on after lighting-up time in main thoroughfares and streets where there is public lighting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Deputy is trying to clarify, but I am afraid I am not in a position to answer his question.  The question as to whether or not a vehicle should be lighted could not possibly be dealt with in a global answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. There is a danger, however, that the public will become annoyed and irritated. If that happens, it is quite likely that the same disregard will be shown for this as was shown for the licensing laws over past years.  I want to see an Act that will meet with the approval of the public.  At the moment they are confused.  Could the Minister clarify that in an announcement or in some other way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate there may be some confusion in the minds of some people as a result of the different application of the existing law.  The law in regard to this question of parking lights has not yet been changed.  It is the old law under the 1933 Act that is being invoked and applied&mdash;more rigorously, I should say, in some cases than in others.  The parking of <Col N="446" /> vehicles in dangerous places is being dealt with very rigorously by the Garda on the instructions of the Commissioner.</P>
      <P>As far as the question of showing parking lights in streets during lighting-up hours is concerned, while I am aware that some confusion may appear to exist, I am also unaware that any prosecution has resulted from this confusion. If there is anything further I can do to clarify the situation, I shall be only too glad to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that many of the white lines painted at stop signs at the junction of minor roads with major roads in Dublin City are painted at points on the roadway from which it is impossible for motorists to obtain any or any proper view of the major road; and if he will endeavour to have the siting of such lines reconsidered in each case with particular regard to the physical features of and actual obstructions at each junction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of traffic signs (including roadway markings) is a matter for the road authority, who are empowered to provide all such signs at the request of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or with the Commissioner's consent.  Road authorities were advised by a circular letter of 30th November, 1956, that the stop line provided in conjunction with a stop sign should be sited as near as possible to the signpost and so as to give adequate visibility to a halted driver and without endangering traffic on the major road or interfering with pedestrians.  In particular cases it may be difficult to achieve proper vision for drivers without interference with pedestrian cross-traffic.  I understand that the Dublin Corporation have received some complaints recently and are examining them.  If the Deputy considers that a stop line is sited improperly in a particular case in Dublin city it is open to him to bring the matter to the attention of the Corporation.</P>

I understand that the employees referred to by the Deputy finished work on polling day at the normal finishing hour, 6 p.m.  I am not in a position to state whether or not they were prevented by the circumstances of their employment from voting.  There is no legal obligation on any employer to transport his employees to the polls.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is <Col N="452" /> aware that a number of Dublin County Council cottages are overcrowded by the families of the tenants' married children because regulations will not permit payment of the full State subsidy towards the cost of new cottages for such families; and if he will take steps to ensure that full payment of the subsidy will be made in cases where families with two or more children are recommended by the county medical officers for rehousing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a breach of the Housing (Management and Letting) Regulations to permit the occupation of a housing authority dwelling by a family other than the family having the tenancy.  Where such subtenanting has occurred, the housing authority is expected to encourage subtenants, such as married sons and daughters, to rehouse themselves by making available to the fullest extent the grant and loan facilities and developed sites authorised under the Housing Acts.  Subsidy at the lower rate is generally available towards the rehousing of such person by the housing authority and, where the circumstances so warrant, subsidy at the higher rate can be paid on medical or compassionate grounds.  Generally, however, families living in unfit and unhealthy dwellings must continue to have prior claim on the resources of the housing authority.  This is the object of the present policy on letting priorities and on subsidies and, until the slum clearance programme has been brought nearer to completion, there would be manifest objections to a relaxation of that policy.</P>

      <P>I am informed that Dublin County Council is considering <Col N="453" /> the rehousing of two families from houses which may eventually be demolished in connection with the extension of Dublin Airport and one of which is considered by the council to be unfit for human habitation.  I have not, however, received any proposal in the matter from the housing authority.

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure to be followed by county councils in giving effect to applications for vesting of cottages is set out in Section 17 of the Labourers Act, 1936, which provides that where a cottage purchase scheme is in force in respect of a cottage, and an application is received from a person who claims to be entitled to purchase in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the County Council shall make a vesting order on being satisfied that his claim is correct. As regards the second part of the Question, my approval is not required to the vesting by a council of cottages which are included in an approved purchase scheme.  The period which elapses between the making of a scheme and the Minister's Order bringing it into force is, where there are no exceptional circumstances, approximately five months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand one of the provisions is that the Minister must lay the Order on the Table of the House for about three months.  That is a very good scheme for idling time.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to reply to Questions 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>Determination of responsibility for removal of dangerous roadside trees depends on the circumstances in each individual case.  A number of complex legal issues are involved all of which are not necessarily covered by the general considerations which I am about to mention.  A local authority has a duty to keep the public roads in its charge clear for traffic.  If a fallen tree is an obstruction to traffic using a public road, the local authority have a duty to remove the obstruction.</P>
      <P>If a tree on a public roadside is, to the knowledge of the local authority, in danger of falling, the local authority have a duty to prevent it from falling on the road.  If a tree growing on land adjoining a public road is, to the knowledge of the landowner, in danger of falling across the roadway, the landowner has a duty to take precautions to prevent it from falling on the road.</P>
      <P>A local authority has no general duty to ensure that trees growing on lands adjoining roads are not a danger to users of the road.</P>
      <P>In view of recent accidents caused by falling trees on public roads I am asking local authorities:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) to ensure that periodic inspections are made of trees growing on public roadsides so that trees that appear dangerous to road users on account of age or condition are removed;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> (2)  to bring to the notice of landowners on whose lands there are trees adjoining public roads all cases where such trees, while not prejudicial to roads within the meaning of section 34 of the Local Government Act, 1925, are nevertheless observed to be in a dangerous condition.</P>
    <P>I think that in the majority of such cases landowners may be relied on to co-operate in having the trees removed. I am, however, having the powers of local authorities in this matter reviewed.</P>

    <P>I am informed by Dublin County Council that the cottages at Turnipin, Cloghran, are served by a piped water supply to public fountains and that some of the residents have themselves brought piped supplies from the public main into their houses.  The Council <Col N="460" /> did consult the tenants on the question of the installation by the Council of water and sewerage services in the cottages but did not proceed further because of the refusal of the majority of the tenants to accept the extra charges suggested by the Council.  I understand, however, that apart from the attitude of the tenants, it is possible that disposal difficulties might prevent the provision of a public sewerage system in this area.  No proposal for the provision of public lighting has been made by the Council, presumably because of the remoteness of the area.</P>

      <P>On my Department's recommendation, measurements of air pollution in Cork are being carried out by the Corporation since May, 1958. While the results to date indicate that Cork, possibly because of its topography, is subject to a higher degree of pollution than might be expected in a city on a comparable level of industrialisation, they do not indicate any present danger to health.  Tests are, however, being continued with a view to a firm evaluation of the degree of pollution and of the remedial measures which may be practicable.</P>

      <P>A person who is a citizen of Ireland aged at least 21 years on the date on which the current register of electors comes into force is entitled to vote at a Dáil or local election in the constituency or local authority area in which he or she is registered as a Dáil or local elector by virtue of ordinary residence or of occupation&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that four increases have been given since 1957 but he did not say how much they amounted to&mdash;a few miserable shillings.  Will the Minister not agree that we have a special duty to old age pensioners and that we should be ashamed of ourselves in this House if we do not discharge it both to those receiving contributory and non-contributory old age pensions and living in this city particularly?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will expedite consideration of cases of hardship in respect of workers, their wives and families who have been refused unemployment assistance as a result of the unofficial dock strike in Cork so that a decision will be given as early as possible, particularly in respect of casual dockers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare and Unemployment Assistance Acts provide that neither unemployment benefit nor assistance is payable to persons who have lost their employment owing to a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute and who had been employed at the premises or places at which the dispute took place.  There was no avoidable delay in the decision by Deciding Officers of the claims to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance of persons involved in the unofficial stoppage of work to which the Deputy refers and which, I am glad to note, has now ended.  I might add that any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Deciding Officer in his case has the right of appeal to an Appeals Officer.</P>

      <P>My Department has, as the Deputy is aware, been actively interested in the possibility of increasing the tempo of its land acquisition for forestry purposes in the vicinity of the Bord na Móna bogs with a view, <i>inter alia,</i> to alleviating the effects of seasonality in Bord na Móna employment.  Some success has been achieved in the vicinity of some of the Midland bogs, but there is no prospect of expediting afforestation to such an extent as to resolve the problem with which the Deputy is concerned.</P>

      <P>The answer is in the negative.  I would refer the Deputy to my reply to him on this matter on 24th May last.  The principal objection to permitting the publication of local Telephone Directories is the difficulty of ensuring that they would not be used long after they had become out of date.  Post Office policy therefore <Col N="492" /> is to encourage subscribers and callers to use only the official Directory and it would be contrary to that policy to permit the publication of nonofficial Directories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware (1) that the khaki uniform which commissioned officers are required to purchase at their own expense before being dispatched for service to the Congo is entirely unsuited for the climate in that country; (2) that the serving personnel have not been provided with a walking-out dress with which their counterparts from other countries have been provided; (3) that contingents experience great distress and discomfort by arriving in the Congo and serving for a time in their ordinary &ldquo;bulls wool&rdquo; uniform, and that this could easily be averted by the issue prior to their dispatch of the light UN battle dress; (4) that the provision of rubber boots, good tentage and mosquito nets is essential, particularly during the rainy season; and (5) that the provision of steel helmets instead of the fibre ones currently issued is a vital necessity; and whether he will have these matters immediately investigated, and ensure that any replacement of kit, etc., found necessary will not be at the expense of the individual officer or personnel concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to the matters mentioned in the Deputies' question is as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Officers are not required to purchase tropical uniform before going to the Congo.  The provision of tropical uniform is a responsibility of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Heretofore the United Nations had not agreed to provide a walking-out uniform in addition to the service tropical uniform.  The United Nations has now agreed to meet <Col N="500" /> the cost of providing a walking-out tropical uniform as an extra and extraordinary cost if the uniform is supplied to our troops before leaving this country.  Arrangements are in hand to provide the 36th Battalion with a walking-out tropical uniform before the unit leaves Ireland.</P>
    <P>(3)  Personnel have suffered some discomfort as a result of not being equipped with tropical uniform before leaving for the Congo.  It has been our constant aim to make the best arrangements possible for the comfort and welfare of the troops, and to this end, in addition to the provision of a walking-out tropical uniform, arrangements have been made with the United Nations to have tropical service uniform delivered here before the departure of the 36th Battalion.</P>
    <P>(4)  I am advised that rubber boots are not suitable for wear in the Congo.</P>
    <P>(5)  The provision of tentage in the Congo is a matter for the United Nations but as our troops are normally housed in permanent buildings tentage is used very infrequently.</P>
    <P>(6)  There has not been any request from our units for mosquito netting which is provided by the United Nations where necessary.</P>
    <P>(7)  The mission of Irish troops in the Congo is that of police duty, consequently steel helmets were not issued.  As a result of recent events in the Congo, steel helmets are being issued to the 36th Battalion for protection.</P>
    <P>(8)  Personnel serving in the Congo are not required to pay for the replacement of kit supplied either by the State or the United Nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see that the Minister has taken steps to meet practically all the points I have mentioned in the question.  Regarding No. (2), that serving personnel have not been provided with walking-out uniforms, the Minister states that it was the responsibility of the United Nations and was not the responsibility of our Government.  Might I ask why was it that the Swedes and other contingents <Col N="501" /> were provided with this equipment and our troops were the only troops in the United Nations services in the Congo left without it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether the troops sent to the Congo were equipped for offensive action or only for police purposes; and if the former was the case if he will specify the fire power available to the troops at Jadotville, and in particular the duration of fire that could be maintained with the ammunition available to the troops in that town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish contingent serving as part of the International United Nations Force in the Congo is engaged on duties of a police character. The second part of the question does not therefore arise.  I may say, however, that the contingent's armament is generally on the basis desired by the United Nations.  Since our troops first went to the Congo their armament has been strengthened from time to time, in the light of experience, in order to afford them greater protection in the changing conditions and nature of risks encountered.  I am advised that the armament available to our troops in the Congo compares favourably in scale, quantity and quality with that of most other countries' contingents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy knows that the troops are under the control of the United Nations and that the request for them was made specifically for police purposes.  If the circumstances <Col N="502" /> of the duty out there have changed I do not think that the arrangements made here for their dispatch could in any way be blamed if they are found to be insufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <P>It is not possible from records to furnish the cost of maintenance of each aircraft to date.  The total cost of stores, including spare engines, tools, ground equipment and engine overhauls, to date is £67,843, and the cost of jet fuel and oil is £28,321.  Military labour only is employed on the maintenance of these aircraft.</P>
    <P>The total cost of construction of the concrete runways at Baile Dhomhnaill was £493,016, including contract, acquisition of land and incidental works.  The concrete runways were not, however, specially constructed for jet aircraft.  They were provided so as to enable all Aer Chór aircraft to use the Aerodome all the year round which would not be possible with grass runways.</P>

In view of the fact that Aer Lingus have now embarked on a different scheme for training their pilots, would the Minister not agree that spending almost £1,000,000 on what has proved to be a waste was a tragedy, particularly in view of the fact that we cannot spend £200,000 on the purchase of helicopters to save lives?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the number of radioactive fall-out shelters erected in the country; if a shelter has been erected at any particular place in the city of Dublin or suburbs; if he will state what plans there are, and what schemes are ready to be put into action at once should radioactive fall-out occur; if sites for shelters have been examined or selected at Parnell Square, Stephen's Green, Trinity College and High Street; and what is the present radioactive fall-out in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's Question could be related to radioactive fall-out resulting from&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  nuclear explosions in wartime, or</P>
      <P>(b)  test nuclear explosions in peacetime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> If the Question relates to the former, the information requested by the Deputy is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  No fall-out shelters have been constructed either in the city of Dublin, its suburbs or elsewhere in this country. It is, however, a comparatively simple matter for householders, employers, etc., themselves to provide, at short notice, an effective and adequate refuge room in their own houses and premises at comparatively little cost.  A Home Protection Handbook containing (amongst other things) instructions as to the manner in which householders and others could provide these refuge rooms has been drafted and will be issued when the Government deems it appropriate to do so.</P>
    <P>(2)  A civil defence plan to cope with a civil defence situation, including particularly the hazard of radioactive fall-out, has been prepared.  This plan is aimed at having a control and operational system ranging from a National Civil Defence Control down to the lower reaches of existing local authority administrative areas, viz. Dispensary Districts and even townlands.  The plan has already been communicated to the Local Authorities who are at present actively endeavouring to ensure its implementation by the nomination of persons as heads of services and the enrolment of the large number of volunteers required&mdash;a matter to which every citizen should give serious thought.</P>
    <P>Pending the implementation of this plan in an effective way, a special interim plan which would be less effective but which would nevertheless be a very useful standby, has been prepared to meet a civil defence situation, including particularly the hazard of radioactive fall-out, which could arise with very little advance warning.  This plan consists of a series of improvisations aimed at making the fullest possible use of the Civil Defence resources available now, and linking them up with existing organisations such as Óglaigh na hÉireann, An Garda Síochána, certain other State Departments and semi-State organisations and Voluntary Aid Societies.  The plan envisages that warning of the imminence of war, and/or danger from fall-out resulting <Col N="510" /> from hostilities, would be given through the medium of the radio and the press, and that suitable advice would be given to the public, through the same channels, as to the steps they should take to protect themselves and their families, particularly in relation to fall-out.</P>
    <P>Until such times as An Cór Breathnadóirí (The Observer Corps)&mdash; whose primary function will be the monitoring on a nation-wide basis of radioactivity from nuclear explosions&mdash; has been developed, responsibility for limited monitoring will be undertaken by District Officers of An Garda Síochána assisted by such Civil Defence Volunteers as are available.  This monitoring will be done with radiac instruments already distributed throughout the State and the results reported to and co-ordinated by Army Commands.  Appropriate instructions for the public would follow.  In this plan the existing Civil Defence staff of the Department of Defence, both administrative and technical, would have an important role.</P>
    <P>(3)  Having regard to the situation already outlined in this reply, it has not so far been deemed necessary to examine or select sites for fall-out shelters at any of the places mentioned by the Deputy or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy's Question relates to radioactive fall-out from test explosions in peacetime or other peacetime uses of nuclear energy, I should point out that my functions in this regard do not include the detection and notification of radioactivity in the atmosphere or on the ground.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme which was agreed to by the Government in June, 1959 at the request of the elected representatives of the members of the Garda Síochána, a pay claim was considered at meetings of the Conciliation Council on 24th and 25th of last month.  An offer of increased pay was made by the Official Side.  The Garda representatives had, under the Scheme, the option of accepting the offer or of taking the claim to Arbitration.  They accepted the offer; and the new rates were approved by the Ministers for Justice and Finance with effect from the 1st November.  In accordance with section 12(2) of the Police Forces (Amalgamation) Act, 1925, the draft Order providing for the new agreed rates was submitted to the Garda Representative Bodies.  The Order has now been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new rate for male members of the rank of Garda is £8 15s. during their five-months training period; and £9 19s. on completing training, rising <Col N="515" /> by ten annual increments to £14 a week.  The new rate shows no change on the former rate for the first four years of service after training although the Garda claim submitted on 28th August, anterior to the proceedings of the Conciliation Council on 24/25th October, in asking for a new pay scale for Gardaí, actually sought a reduction in the annual rates then existing for Gardaí on the completion of training and again after one year's service by £19 and £2 respectively.</P>
    <P>When criticising the adequacy of the salary of a member of the Garda Síochána a number of relevant factors must not be overlooked: for example, the maximum salary of £14 per week for a member of Garda rank is exclusive of any element in respect of evaluation of uniform nor does it take account of boot allowance or cycle allowance or detective allowance or plain clothes allowance where members are not supplied with uniform or, where members are stationed in Gaeltacht areas, the additional 7½ per cent. which their salary attracts.  In addition Gardaí enjoy medical attention at State expense.  Further a Garda to-day with 30 years' service may retire when he reaches 50 years of age with a gratuity of £1,070 and a pension of £7 per week.  Nor would it be out of place to mention the promotion prospects of the members of the Force which are really excellent.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, meetings have been recently held by a number of the Gardaí contrary to the Disciplinary Regulations and despite warnings by the Commissioner as to the consequences.  In addition, &ldquo;Go-slow&rdquo; tactics in the performance of their police duties were adopted in a concerted campaign for some days and only ceased on the same day as the Commissioner issued a warning that any Garda found engaging in serious misconduct of this kind would be dismissed forthwith.  Secret committees of Gardaí were set up who sought financial assistance from members of the Force and from business concerns.  They also sought and got extensive publicity in some newspapers which had the effect of exaggerating the situation and <Col N="516" /> creating unrest and disaffection throughout the Force.</P>
    <P>On 8th November, the Commissioner, in accordance with Article 24 of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 1926, sought my consent to the dismissal of 11 Gardaí whom he considered unfit for retention in the Force.  I gave my consent.  Article 24 provides for summary dismissal without notice of members considered unfit for retention and can be exercised by the Commissioner only with the prior consent of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>On the following day, I issued a public statement that on receiving an assurance from the Commissioner that discipline had been fully restored throughout the Force, I would be prepared to examine, with a view to improvement if necessary, the workings of the negotiating machinery available to members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, through the intervention of His Grace, Most Rev. Dr. McQuaid, Archbishop of Dublin, for whose help I am profoundly grateful, I received over the week-end an assurance that no acts of indiscipline would in future occur.  The Commissioner then reported to me that in view of this assurance he was satisfied that discipline was restored in the Force and, that being so, I issued a public statement on 13th November to the effect that I would take steps to examine the question whether any changes are desirable in the arrangements available to members of the Force for making representations on matters affecting their welfare.  I also decided, after consulting with the Commissioner, that if any of the 11 dismissed men applied for reinstatement I would accede to an application from him for my consent to his re-appointment. In the result, the 11 men have been reinstated.  Furthermore, charges preferred under the Disciplinary Regulations against a number of Gardaí for attending an unauthorised meeting are not being proceeded with.</P>
    <P>I have already taken steps to put in motion a departmental enquiry into the manner in which the Representative Bodies are elected and as to how they function and I shall have <Col N="517" /> no hesitation in changing the present procedure or the governing statutory regulations if such a course is found necessary in order to ensure that the members of the Force are satisfied with their machinery of negotiation and that their best interests are thereby served.  I know that in this regard I am acting in accordance with the general intentions of the Government to do what they can to promote the interests and welfare of the Force generally, as is evident from the number of important improvements in pay, pension and schemes for providing better housing and barrack accommodation which they have approved in the past two years.</P>
    <P>In view of suggestions in Dáil Questions&mdash;and otherwise&mdash;that a system of independent arbitration should be provided to deal with Garda pay claims I wish to emphasise that such a system has been in operation since 1959.  Claims are considered first at conciliation level at which the Garda representatives are free either to accept any offer made or to submit the matter to an Arbitration Board. The Arbitration Board consists of an independent Chairman, at present Mr. T. K. Liston, S.C., nominated by agreement between the Garda on the one side and the Ministers for Justice and Finance on the other side.  In addition to the Chairman the Arbitration Board consists of two Garda representatives and two civil servants. Where a majority of the Board are unable to agree in a finding, the finding is made by the Chairman.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme two pay claims have been determined and the non-pensionable rates of rent allowance have been increased and converted into pensionable pay.  The first pay claim, following disagreement at conciliation level, went to arbitration, and the findings of the Chairman were adopted in full by the Government. In that connection, I would refer Deputies to last January's issue of <i>Iris an Gharda,</i> the organ of the Force.  At pages 145 to 151 it publishes the arbitration report and in explanation for doing so it gives this reason at the head of page 145:</P>
    <P>in order that our members may have <Col N="518" /> an appreciation of the immense amount of work put by your members into the preparation and presentations of the Garda case we print herewith a full report of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>This report which was presented by Government to Dáil Éireann shows that the Garda side submitted every possible argument they could think of in favour of increased pay: they mentioned the peculiarities of a policeman's calling, his status in the community, the risks he takes, the pay of neighbouring police forces and so on, in great detail.  In return, the official side submitted that the responsibilities and obligations peculiar to the Garda Síochána must be determined by reference to the conditions prevailing within the State rather than to the pay of the police forces of Great Britain and the Six Counties and they compared, amongst other things, the Garda pay with the pay in the Civil Service. All the arguments as to the policeman's status, peculiar responsibilities, etc., were gone into and the Board's findings took them into account.</P>
    <P>That then was the position: as from 1st March, 1960, new pay scales were settled by Arbitration for which the provision in this year's Vote to meet pay and pension cost of that award is £500,000.</P>
    <P>In December, 1960 the substitution of a pensionable element in pay in lieu of rent allowance is costing an additional £154,000 in this financial year.</P>
    <P>Last month another pay claim was the subject of an offer at a meeting of the Conciliation Council which was accepted by the Garda representatives: the annual cost is estimated at £400,000.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise too firmly that there can be no question of determining claims and proposals relating to conditions of service of members of the Garda Síochána up to the rank of chief superintendent outside of the machinery of the scheme of conciliation and arbitration now in force in which, of course, there is provision for amendment by agreement between the Minister and the Representative <Col N="519" /> Bodies.  I am satisfied that this machinery is fully adequate for a proper determination of these matters.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I express the hope that we have seen the end of this recent, sorry chapter of events in the history of the Garda Síochána, that nothing like it will ever again occur and that the Garda Síochána will always be that disciplined police force of which the nation has had such good cause to feel proud.</P>

      <P>When we strip the Minister's reply of its verbiage, is it not a fact that it was made known to the Government that the dismissals which the Minister stood over and backed up here were found to be illegal and that the Government were in such a position that they were not able to face their responsibilities, which were beyond them, and that were it not for the fact that His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin intervened, the Government would have been in a serious predicament? Is it a fact that it was intended to put into operation here the kind of activities which have been conducted in dictatorships, obliterating the right of people to assemble lawfully and peaceably for the purpose of making their criticisms known, and that, having carried out such a peaceful activity, members of our police force were dismissed in a most disgraceful fashion? Is it not a fact that it was not the Commissioner but the Minister who was responsible, that it was the Minister who directed the Commissioner, and the Minister is now pretending he is the good boy in all this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put this to the Minister?  The fact that these occurrences took place in the Garda Síochána recently is a clear manifestation of the widespread discontent among a large number of Gardaí who feel that in being refused any increase in pay, they have been treated unfairly.  Is the Minister aware of the fact that because there is only one chairman of the Arbitration Board, who presides over Civil Service arbitration cases, teachers' arbitration cases and Garda arbitration cases, it probably would be from four to six months before that independent chairman could sit in an arbitration case, having regard to, one, the number of cases at present awaiting a hearing and two, to the fact that he is a very busy legal man who is at present engaged in a case which has occupied our courts for two and a half years, so that reference of the case to arbitration does not provide any consolation to the Gardaí concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is anxious to bring this to a satisfactory conclusion and not to allow this wound to continue suppurating he should constitute a public arbitration board to enable the case to be submitted for an increase in pay, particularly in respect of the young Gardaí, and the Minister should accept the award of such a board. The problem should be treated as one of urgency.  The young Gardaí are <Col N="521" /> not getting a fair deal and it must be brought home to them, by offering them an arbitration board, that the House is prepared to extend justice to them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister, in the course of the examination of the machinery, take early steps to ensure that there will be available to the representative body, or to whatever body represents the Garda, an arbitration board before which they can bring their claim for improved pay immediately and that that body will be available to adjudicate upon the claim at an early date?  There is no use in saying to the Garda&mdash;I take it the Minister will accept this&mdash;&ldquo;You will go to arbitration but you cannot have your case <Col N="526" /> heard for four or six months.&rdquo;  That is not genuine arbitration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether at any time within the past ten years advertisements inviting applications for membership of the Garda Síochána contained a statement that members of the force would enjoy <Col N="527" /> free accommodation; whether a charge is now made for accommodation; and, if so, what is the amount thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Advertisements published prior to 21st December, 1960, contained a statement to the effect that accommodation or an allowance in lieu would be provided.  Up to then, accommodation if available was provided free; where accommodation was not available, non-pensionable rent allowances were paid.  These varied from £27 to £62 according to area, the average being £40.</P>
      <P>On 20th December, 1960, following a pay claim by the Gardaí that rent allowances be increased and made pensionable, the Garda representatives accepted an offer at a meeting of the Conciliation Council.  This provided that the varying non-pensionable rent allowances then payable to members living out should be abolished, and replaced by a pensionable addition to pay of 25/- a week applicable to all members of the rank of Garda whether living in or living out.  The agreement provided for a flat deduction from pay of £1 a week where accommodation is provided, irrespective of whether the accommodation is a house or married quarters provided for a married Garda, or accommodation at a station for a single man.</P>
      <P>Where the accommodation available is not regarded as suitable, permission to live out is granted and the deduction ceases.</P>
      <P>The new agreed arrangements were brought into effect by the Garda Síochána (Pay and Allowances) Order, 1961.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether in view of present dissatisfaction among members of the Garda Síochána with methods of promotion to the ranks of Sergeant, Inspector and Superintendent he will ensure that in future at least a proportion of these promotions be made on the grounds of seniority of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Promotion in the Garda Síochána is based on the selection by a selection board of the most <Col N="528" /> suitable members of those who, having become eligible for promotion by passing qualifying examinations, are sent forward to the selection board by their divisional officers.  Other things being equal, preference is given to senior men, but suitability for higher duties, and not seniority is the determining factor. It is not proposed to alter this procedure.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Commissioner that the fact that greater numbers of senior men have not been promoted in recent years is due to the fact that only a small number of them have passed the qualifying examinations which would make them eligible for consideration for promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we do not deal with the question of promotion from the rank of sergeant upwards in a just and equitable fashion in future, the Minister will have upon his hands a greater revolt amongst the senior men than he has had amongst the younger men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any question about the fairness of promotion. There will always be discussion, comment, and so on, and there will always be some disappointment because certain people were not promoted, but, as far as we can ensure, the system is fair; everybody gets his chance.  It is a just system and it is demonstrably fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The list of those eligible for promotion is very heavily loaded with younger men and that is why there are more younger men than older men promoted to the rank of sergeant at the moment.  But that is the only reason.  Secondly, as I have said in reply and as I said this morning, other things being equal, seniority counts.  I think that is fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says the position at present is that the list of Gardaí eligible for promotion is heavily overloaded, by comparison, with younger men.  Does not that in itself suggest there is something wrong with the test of eligible Gardaí, if the men who have given long and useful service in the Force are being eliminated from the prospect of promotion by the form of test at present being employed?  Is that not calculated to give rise to reasonable resentment on the part of the Gardaí?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Superficially, it would seem that way.  In fact, that is not so because if you look at the constitution of the Force at the moment I think there is another explanation.  By far the greater number of Gardaí at present in the Force all came in at the same time. Now that age group is, by and large, leaving it or on the verge of leaving it.  There will be a very considerable number of the older age group leaving shortly and I think that is the reason they are not on the list of those qualified for promotion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

The Garda Síochána have no corresponding legal duty in regard to stray cats and there is no basis on which I, as Minister for Justice, could make a grant available <Col N="535" /> to the Cats' Home.  I have reason to believe that the Society concerned appreciate this position and that their request for a grant for the Cats' Home is being made to the Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>As regards the Dogs' Home, a grant of £800 a year is paid.  A few years ago, an application was made for an increase in that grant.
