      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that the correct result of the competition held by the Local Appointments Commission for the post of Chief Agricultural Officer, County Roscommon, was published in the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> on 22nd April, 1961, although the Commissioners' recommendation was not issued to the County Roscommon Committee of Agriculture until the 8th May, 1961; and, whether in view of the apparent breach of secrecy in this matter, he will cause an investigation to be held.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that the correct result of the competition held by the Local Appointments Commission for the post of County Engineer, County Louth, was published in the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> on 26th November, 1960, although the Commissioners' recommendation was not issued to the local authority until the 8th December, 1960; and, whether in view of the apparent breach of secrecy in this matter he will cause an investigation to be held.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, Sir, to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy and I have investigated the matter.  The desirable <Col N="1622" /> position in such cases is that the identity of the successful candidate should not be made public until the local authority have made the appointment and the candidate has formally accepted office.  So far as is practicable, the procedure of the Local Appointments Commission is designed to conform with that course; and I believe that the present arrangements have, on the whole, worked satisfactorily.  This procedure involves, however, notifying the unsuccessful candidates that their applications have not been successful, and requiring the successful candidate to furnish evidence of his age, academic or professional qualifications and so forth. Particularly in the case of professional appointments, where most of the applicants will be known to one another, it is virtually impossible, therefore, to prevent information about the outcome of the competition becoming known and the fact of such disclosure of the result in this way is no evidence of a breach of confidence on the part of anyone.  Persons familiar with the procedure of the Local Appointments Commission are often able, in the manner I have described, to deduce the identity of the candidate being considered for a position before any official announcement is made on the subject.  I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by taking any further action in these cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr McQuillan Mr McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that these are the only two instances where a local or any newspaper published the correct result before the local authority had the official information?  In the circumstances, would the Taoiseach not agree that there has been a leakage from some source in the Local Appointments Commission to a channel in this newspaper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there has been a leakage.  I think the explanation I have given as to how the information may have become known is a far more reasonable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the newspaper stated that they exclusively announced the appointment <Col N="1623" /> of Mr. X?  In view of that statement, would the Taoiseach not agree that the integrity of the Local Appointments Commission has been put under grave suspicion and would he not consider it desirable to make a statement that he would deplore such breach of confidence in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here the extracts from the newspaper.  It is not apparent to me that they announced that they had the information exclusively. It just appears to have been a piece of enterprise on the part of the newspaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sir.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> within the past month patted themselves on the back and stated that they exclusively announced this appointment before the official result was known to the county committee of agriculture?  In view of that statement, does the Taoiseach persist now in stating that two such appointments were known as a result, shall we say, of skilful reporting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not.  It is extremely likely that the Roscommon County Engineer knew that he was successful in the competition for County Louth before the County Louth committee had made the appointment. It is equally likely that the applicant for the position of Chief Agricultural Officer of County Roscommon knew that he was successful before the Roscommon County Council made the appointment, by reason of the fact that he had received from the Local Appointments Commissioners a request to furnish his birth certificate and other documents necessary to enable them to confirm the nomination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the County Engineer for Louth first knew of the appointment <Col N="1624" /> when he saw it in the <i>Roscommon Herald</i>?  As a result of seeing it in the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> he wrote to the Local Appointments Commission querying what had taken place to make sure that he would not be blamed for any alleged leakage of information. How does the Taoiseach reconcile that with his statement now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure is as I have described it.  It was the practice at one time not to notify unsuccessful candidates until the appointment had been made, but there were many objections to it.  If there is any change suggested in that procedure, it could be considered.  No change would prevent the successful applicant, when receiving a request for the usual information from the Local Appointments Commission, guessing that he was going to be appointed.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give a list of the appointments made to local authority offices by the Local Appointments Commissioners since 1st January, 1961, giving in each case the name and address of the successful applicant.</P>

      <P>The Local Appointments Commissioners recommend persons for appointment&mdash;the actual appointments are made by the local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners issued 112 recommendations in the period from 1st January, 1961, to 21st July, 1961. So far, they have been notified in 60 cases that appointments have been made by the local authorities concerned. I propose, with your permission, Sir, to circulate in the Official Report, a list setting out particulars of these 60 cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the fact that a number of recipients of (a) old age pensions and (b) unemployment assistance are having their pensions and unemployment assistance reduced on account of the earnings of their wives and families in cottage industries such as knitting, and that this is discouraging women from working in these industries; and, if so, if he will take immediate steps to ensure that these earnings will not be taken into account in assessing means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any development in connection with the assessment of means for old age pension or unemployment assistance purposes which is discouraging women from working in cottage industries such as knitting.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the means of recipients of non-contributory old age pensions and unemployment assistance must be reviewed when any change occurs in the circumstances of the recipient; where self-employment is involved the means must also be re-examined periodically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the relevant statutory provisions governing the calculation of means for non-contributory old age pensions purposes a married male pensioner is assessed with one-half of the total means of himself and his wife.  All income in cash which either he or his wife may reasonably expect to receive during the year succeeding the date of calculation, must, with certain specified exclusions, be taken into account in the calculation of the total means.  Voluntary contributions including those from members of the family are subject to a statutory <Col N="1631" /> deduction of £52.5.0 before assessment for old age pension purposes.  While I have seen no evidence that earnings from cottage industries such as knitting are causing reductions in pensions, a measure which passed all its stages in this House only last week, makes provision, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, which will enable income such as earnings up to £165 to be disregarded in the calculation of means for old age pension purposes in the case of the older member of a married couple who fulfil certain conditions.</P>
    <P>In the case of unemployment assistance the relevant statutory provisions likewise require that all income in cash which an applicant may reasonably expect to receive during the year succeeding the date of calculation must, with certain exclusions, be taken into account.  In addition, the actual or estimated amount of income which such person may reasonably expect to receive as head of the household whether as contributions to the expenses of the household or otherwise must be included in the assessment. In practice, the officers of my Department in the course of the discharge of their statutory duties, find generally that earnings of applicants' wives and families in cottage industries such as knitting are not causing increased assessments of means for unemployment assistance purposes and that recipients of unemployment assistance are accordingly not having their assistance reduced by reason of such earnings.</P>

      <P>Following is the information:</P>
      <P>Revenue returns for the year ended 31st May last indicate, in general, increased consumption of intoxicating liquor.  It would not be reasonable to infer, however, that such increase is attributable to the enactment of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960.  The trend towards increased consumption has been present for some years and other factors such as improvement in economic conditions generally must also be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Particulars of the quantities of intoxicating liquor on which duties were paid in the three years ended 31st May last are appended.</P>

      <P>Between March, 1957 and 30th April, 1960, there was no change in the basis of remuneration of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries. At that time the annual salaries of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries were £2,125 and £1,560 respectively, these amounts including the Deputy's allowance of £624, free of tax.  Pursuant to the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1960, salaries of £2,000 and £1,200 respectively, became payable to Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries with effect as from 1st May, 1960.  There was, therefore, no increase in Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries salaries as such.  In common, however, with all other Deputies they receive an allowance of £1,000 a year for expenses subject to tax pursuant to the same Act.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the concurrence of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions No. 26 and No. 27 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three Boeing Jet aircraft were purchased by Aerlínte and were delivered between October, 1960, and April, 1961.  The cost delivered, engines installed and fully furnished was £1.4 million each or £4.2 million in all.  The provision of spares and ancillary <Col N="1641" /> equipment in connection with the aircraft brings that expenditure to approximately £6 million.  This sum was provided by way of investment by the Minister for Finance in Aer Rianta. The latter company in turn took up for cash an equivalent investment in Aerlínte. No question of repayment of the capital arises but the aircraft are being depreciated over ten years which is the estimated life.  No provision has so far been included in the accounts of Aerlínte to cover remuneration of the capital but I am hopeful that provision for such remuneration can be made when the service is fully established. Depreciation included in the accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1961, amounted to £53,000 and depreciation in the year ending 31st March, 1962, is estimated at £400,000.</P>

As indicated in reply to a question by Deputy Sweetman on 18th July, 1961, I do not consider it appropriate, at this stage, that the initial list of industries should be published.</P>

The corporations of Cork, Limerick, Clonmel, Dún Laoghaire and Sligo and the county council's of Cavan and Sligo have, however, made bye-laws controlling the use of wireless, loudspeakers, gramophones, amplifiers and similar instruments in public places.  As to the second part of the Deputy's question, my Department has already drawn the attention of local authorities to their powers in this respect and recommended that they should consider exercising them in appropriate cases.  Wider provisions dealing with the control of noise will be included in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1960.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main objects of the Bill are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(i)to increase from £1,500,000 to £3,000,000 the aggregate amount of the shares in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited which the Minister for Finance may take up;</P>
      <P>(ii)to increase from £500,000 to £1,250,000 the aggregate of the grants which may be provided for the Company; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)to provide for the issue by the <Col N="1647" /> Minister for Finance of repayable advances to the Company to meet one-half of the expenditure by the Company on the provision of dwellings for workers employed on the Industrial Estate established at Shannon Airport.  The aggregate amount of advances shall not exceed £400,000.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited was incorporated as a Limited Company under the Companies Acts on 28th January, 1959.  The main function of the company is to promote the increased use of Shannon Airport for passenger and freight traffic and for tourist, commercial and industrial purposes.  To that end, the main activities of the company have been concentrated on attracting industrialists to set up factories in the Customs Free Airport area.  Under the provisions of Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1958, industries established in the Customs Free Airport enjoy certain taxation privileges, in particular, total exemption from income tax and corporation profits tax until 1983 on profits derived from export business.</P>
    <P>To facilitate prospective industrialists the company has undertaken a factory building programme, and factories can be provided for industrial undertakings at Shannon in the following ways:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(i)The undertaking may lease a site from the company on which to build its own factory and for this purpose a building grant from the company may be negotiated;</P>
    <P>(ii)The company may build a factory to a special design to be leased to the undertaking;</P>
    <P>(iii)The undertaking may lease one of the company's standard factories.</P>
    <P>As an adjunct to the factory building programme, the company has also undertaken the provision of housing accommodation for a proportion of the workers employed on the Industrial Estate.  A scheme of houses and flats, for renting to tenants, is in hands.</P>
    <P>The company's main sources of <Col N="1648" /> finance are provided under the authority of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited Act, 1959.  The Act authorises:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(i)The Minister for Finance to subscribe for shares in the company up to an aggregate limit of £1,500,000, and</P>
    <P>(ii)the provision by way of grant-in-aid voted annually of sums which in the aggregate shall not exceed £500,000.</P>
    <P>The capital being used by the company to acquire revenue-earning assets such as factory buildings and dwelling-houses, the income from which will go to supplement the company's grant income.  The grant-in-aid is applied by the company towards meeting its running expenses and providing financial assistance to new industrial undertakings at the Airport.  Capital issued to the company up to 30th June, 1961, amounted to £1,358,000 and payments by way of grant-in-aid to £402,500.  It will be seen that these figures are approaching the existing statutory limits.  Accordingly, it is now necessary to increase these limits so that the company may continue its operations.  Of the share capital expenditure up to 30th June, 1961, £939,000 was expended on factory buildings and £394,000 on dwellings.</P>
    <P>Up to 30th June, 1961, 15 factory bays had been completed together with a special factory of approximately 53,200 square feet constructed by an industrialist with the aid of a grant from the company.  Including the special factory mentioned, the total area of factory floor space provided as at that date was 285,340 square feet.  All the factories are, of course, situated within the Customs Free Airport area.  At present five factory bays are under construction.  Ancillary services such as water, sewerage, electricity and boiler house have also been provided.  The company has almost completed ten houses and a scheme of 137 flats is nearing completion. Plans are in hands for the construction of a further 100 houses.</P>
    <P>As at 30th June, 1961, eight factories were in operation in the Industrial Estate and the total number of workers employed was 724.  Of these <Col N="1649" /> 64 per cent, are male.  A good number of skilled craftsmen have immigrated to Shannon.  Among the commodities being manufactured are transistor radios, floor maintenance machinery, knitted jersey fabrics and knitted garments, wire gauze for industrial purposes, precision threaded fasteners and miniature capacitors, pianos and record players and radiograms, tungsten carbide inserts and diamond drilling equipment.  All these industries are primarily export industries and are not in competition for the home market with other Irish manufacturers. The company is in active negotiation with a number of potential industrialists and I am happy to say that there is every reason to be confident that this estate &mdash; the first industrial estate in the world to be situated in an airport &mdash; will succeed and will continue to develop.  The industries already established have given a very considerable fillip to air freight traffic at the airport and it is estimated that by 1965 over 5,000 tons of air freight will be generated annually by the factory operations now established or planned at Shannon.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that industrialists are attracted to the estate by reason of the availability of the convenient air freight facilities.  The company on my direction are concentrating their efforts on the creation of an air freight industrial community and are seeking new industries of a kind likely to make the fullest possible use of the air freight facilities.  The examination of inquiries made by industrialists about the Shannon Estate, and the origin of these inquiries, makes it quite clear that the great majority of these firms are interested in this aspect.  A major advantage in the regular use of air freight is of course that the manufacturers can avoid having to tie up a large proportion of their capital in maintaining large stocks of materials, while the finished goods can be dispatched all over the world in a matter of days &mdash; sometimes of hours.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that factories can be leased as soon as they can be built.  Apart from the five factory bays now under construction, plans are being prepared for the provision of a <Col N="1650" /> further 32 factory bays over the next four years.  Capital expenditure during the current financial year on the development of the industrial estate is estimated at about £550,000.  It is difficult to forecast the probable capital expenditure after that date because this is naturally related to the continuing success of the company's efforts to attract industrialists.  If the rate of capital expenditure to date is maintained the increase of £1,500,000 provided for in the Bill would sustain operations for perhaps three to four years.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an increase from £500,000 to £1,250,000 in the aggregate amount of the grants which may be made to the company. These grants are to cover the running expenses of the company and to enable the company to do such things as are calculated to encourage the establishment of commercial, industrial and trading enterprises at the airport. Receipts by the company up to 30th June, 1961, amounted to £422,000 made up of grants-in-aid of £402,000 and £20,000 in other receipts.  The company paid out £202,500 in running expenses and £216,000 in grants to industrialists.  The latter figure is made up of grants as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>It emerged at an early stage of the operation of the company that the provision of suitable type housing was an integral part of the industrial development. The Airport is somewhat isolated from existing communities and industrialists already in production and firms about to commence production urged that housing should be provided in the immediate vicinity of the factories for a proportion of the workers.  As I have already indicated, expenditure on the provision of housing at the Airport up to 30th June, 1961 was £394,000.</P>
    <P>Here again, precise estimation of probable expenditure is difficult because expenditure will, of course, be related to the demand for housing which in turn will depend upon the rate of increase in the number of workers employed in the Industrial <Col N="1651" /> Estate.  However, it is estimated that expenditure on housing in the current financial year will be of the order of £580,000.  The cost of housing will be met as to one half from the company's share capital at a nominal rate of interest, the other half being met by way of repayable advances under this Bill.  These advances will be on the same basis as loans from the Local Loans Fund, both as to rates of interest and repayments.</P>
    <P>After making a most thorough investigation into housing requirements for the industrial estate, the company reached the conclusion that, subject to constant re-evaluation, up to one-third of the workers would seek housing accommodation adjacent to their work. In view of the many factors involved it has, however, been decided to limit the first stage of the housing estate to 250 houses and flats and to have a full reassessment of the housing problem from every aspect before reaching any decision to proceed further.  The scheme for the 100 houses now being put in hands will cater for the needs of workers requiring accommodation at lower rents than those which can be charged for the flats now in course of completion.  The industrial expansion at the Airport has also led to consideration by local authorities and private interests of house building programmes in adjacent towns and this is a development which I am sure all of us will welcome.</P>
    <P>The work being undertaken by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited is unique in the Irish economy and is probably without parallel in the economy of any other country.  It is an experiment which involves considerable financial risk for the State but from the encouraging progress made so far, I am satisfied that the State should continue to finance the operation.  The company has shown commendable enterprise, vision and enthusiasm in attracting industrialists to Shannon and I feel that I must take this opportunity of congratulating the directors and staff of the company on the results already achieved.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>The House can accept this without much enthusiasm. I should like to get it into its proper framework.  The concern has been operating for over two years.  The company was started in January, 1959. A good many hysterical comments were made in the newspapers and by people sent there by the Government to write up the Shannon development matter.  The comments have not helped.  I read an article the effect of which was that within a very limited period there was to be a new city of 50,000 inhabitants brought together there and that there were to be all sorts of conditions for workers.  The reality of the situation was given in an answer to a question the other day which said that the highest number of people employed on new production is 724, not on building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The papers made great comments about the amount of production in the factory sent out by air.  Last year, I asked a question on these lines.  I was told that they were only estimates. There was no way of getting any record of what was being produced and sent out.  This year, I was told that the collection of figures leading to a correct answer on such a matter had been put in hands somewhere.  It was hoped that the estimates might be procurable <Col N="1653" /> some time later.  There is no statistical information at all.</P>
    <P>I notice that on page 4 of his statement the Minister says: &ldquo;it is estimated that by 1965 over 5,000 tons of air freight will be generated annually.&rdquo;  What is the basis for that estimate?  How much of the tonnage of air freight has been generated already insofar as it is known?  I got a figure which was open to many critical comments and I was suspicious about it.  My suspicions were not relieved when the Minister spoke on the Estimate.  He said there was no real statistical material available.  Anything that was suggested was practically a guess.</P>
    <P>The company started in January 1959.  We are now dealing with the matter towards the end of July, 1961, and we are told that the highest number of people employed on new production is 724.  We know nothing as to what tonnage of freight has been generated by the operations of this company.  This must be put into its framework.  The Minister is a member of a Government which succeeded in getting elected at the last election on the basis that 100,000 jobs were to be procured for workers.</P>
    <P>The reality, as shown by <i>Economic Statistics</i> in respect of the Budget, is that the country is short by 51,000 employees as compared with 1956. Instead of there being 100,000 as was promised in the four years, we are faced with a loss of 51,000.  Even if the estimate made in reply to a question of mine is realised, that there might be 1,000 workers employed by 31st March, it will still leave a deficit of 50,000 people as compared with 1956 and 150,000 people as compared with the promises made in the last election.  Those are very serious calculations.  They are all derived from Government statistics and they cannot be challenged.  I notice that even recently there has been no great desire to enter into any conflict as to whether these promises were made or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement also said: &ldquo;All the indications are that factories can be leased as soon as <Col N="1654" /> they can be built.&rdquo;  If that is the case, one is inclined to ask, with the lack of employment in the country and the failure to catch up on the promises made in 1957, why more factories were not built?  I never understood that the situation was that industrialists were falling over one another with the object of getting to Shannon.  It took a great deal of advertising.  Two or three factories failed.  There was no great success &mdash; nothing commensurate with all the propaganda used in regard to the Airport itself.</P>
    <P>In regard to production in the Shannon industrial zone, I also asked how much of it derives from native raw materials.  I asked a question on the Estimates last year what was the value added to native materials by native labour.  I was aiming to get the statistics in relation to those employed and the break-down as between men and women and between foreigners and natives.  In connection with any precautions taken with regard to specialised products that may be undertaken at Shannon, I should be glad to see that our own people will be trained by those who come in from abroad so that in a very reasonable time our people can take over whatever industrial development is in Shannon itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have adverted to another matter.  I do not think I am agitating in any unreasonable way or giving vent to views that are lightly held.  How far does the Minister feel that the artificial arrangements made at Shannon can stand in regard to the new Economic Community into which it is thought we are going to go?  The tariff side of industrial development has to be very carefully watched.  The whole atmosphere of the European Economic Community is free trade under fair conditions. Any such thing as tariffs or incentives by way of reduced taxation applicable to certain industries is not likely to be regarded as fair trading in the new conditions.  It works in the other direction.  Anything in the way of an artificial advantage given to a group or series of places will certainly not, from my reading of the Rome Treaty, be regarded as fair trading in the new conditions,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> When the Minister speaks of something that may happen by 1983, he is looking to a future unclouded by any suggestion that the Rome Treaty conditions might make the artificial aids given to Shannon obsolete, or at least unfair, and that they may have to be stopped.  I do not think the conditions that operate in Shannon can possibly last outside the Rome Treaty.  I know there are free ports elsewhere and that this is an effort to make the Shannon area something like them.  It has a rival in the estuary project referred to in this House.  But these special aids &mdash; remission of taxation, no profits and ploughing back of profits &mdash; are matters that are already being picked out by a lot of other countries as aids that can adversely impact on the Rome Treaty.</P>
    <P>I give this Bill a welcome, but not a very enthusiastic one.  There has been very little done in comparison to the propaganda used in regard to this place.  The tot of the labour employed is very disappointing after a number of years and after all the State provided by way of financial sacrifice and some sacrifice on the local side by way of remission of rates.  After all this, we have a total of 724 people employed, of whom somewhere around 300 are women workers &mdash; I do not know of what age or at what wage rates they are employed.  One is always suspicious of new industries of 50 per cent female labour.  The figure here is practically 50 per cent.  The Minister says that 64 per cent of the 724 are male.  About 400 would be male and about 300 would be female labour.  The thing is disappointing and, as far as one can gauge the interpretation already being put on the Rome Treaty, whatever chance the industrial area has at the moment, its future is very definitely limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I welcome anything that benefits Shannon Airport for the one obvious reason that its prosperity reflects on the city of Limerick, which I have the honour to represent in this House.  I must confess I am a bit disappointed at the amount of information the Minister made available to the House.  The Shannon Free Airport Development <Col N="1656" /> Company followed the establishment of the Shannon Free Airport Development Authority in November, 1957. At a meeting held in Shannon Airport, some time around that period, the aims of the new Authority were set out.  It was visualised that with the development of jet aircraft Shannon Airport would be overflown to a considerable extent and that that would re-act particularly on the transit passenger traffic and the transit freight traffic, which had brought such considerable expansion and employment to the airport. It was felt that unless a vigorous effort was made by a body charged with that duty, Shannon Airport might dwindle considerably from the point of view of giving employment.  A good deal of credit is due to the first body set up, subsequently followed by the company, of which Mr. O'Regan is the chairman today.</P>
      <P>The reason I said at the outset I was a little disappointed at the Minister's lack of information is because I have a very vivid recollection of the purpose of the original Authority followed by the company, about which we are talking this afternoon.  I would have liked to have had from the Minister more particulars as to the success in attracting freight traffic to Shannon Airport.  I know the Minister has given certain figures in regard to the amount of air freight traffic generated in the industrial zone, but that is still only a very small proportion of the total transit traffic passing through the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally, a good deal of discussion took place on the possibility of developing Shannon as a centre where air freight could be flown in, packaged and broken up into smaller consignments, and flown out again.  The Minister has been singularly uninformative in giving the House particulars of that development.  I have always felt that that type of expansion would have been very useful for Shannon Airport and would have cost comparatively little by way of capital outlay.  I know that three of four years ago, the Authority, not the Company, had very optimistic views of developing Shannon Airport as a transit centre for air traffic of all types suitable to be flown in and flown out of an airport.  Could <Col N="1657" /> the Minister say how successful their efforts in that regard have been?</P>
    <P>It is also quite true, as the Minister appreciates and as everybody living near Shannon Airport will understand, that with the falling off in the transit passenger traffic, the sales at Shannon Airport shop have gone down considerably. Unless this type of traffic can be expanded again, it looks as though that side of the airport's activities must look forward to a continuing drop in sales.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that there has been a substantial increase in the amount of terminal traffic, passengers getting off at Shannon Airport and getting on again there.  I think there is room for considerably greater improvement in that type of traffic.  I think we have tended to look too much to the American traffic in the context of Shannon Airport.  I see a very big future for Shannon within the context of the European countries.  As this country develops as a tourist centre, great opportunities will offer of utilising Shannon Airport as the entry for air traffic from the various countries on the Continent and particularly for passengers wishing to visit the South and West of Ireland.  I should like to see a greater drive to have this type of traffic concentrated at Shannon Airport rather than at Dublin Airport as at present.  That development, to my mind, would work hand in hand with the present drive to increase hotel accommodation in the various holiday resorts throughout the South and West of Ireland.  I should like to see the Minister giving the House some idea that he visualises the development of that type of traffic.</P>
    <P>Shannon Airport, of itself, is not a community centre.  Practically everybody who works there migrates into the Shannon Airport area.  While it is true, as has been stated here on a number of occasions, that it is vitally necessary to maintain employment at Shannon Airport, one must not forget the fact that the workers at Shannon Airport live to the greatest extent in Limerick and to a lesser extent in the town of Ennis.  In visualising the continuance of the employment of these men and women, it is well to <Col N="1658" /> take into consideration the fact they are working away from where they normally live and that any effort to increase employment in either Limerick city or in or near Ennis would have the same effect as providing employment at the airport.</P>
    <P>That is why I have expressed the view here on more than one occasion that it is a great pity that an effort was not made to establish an industtrial zone contiguous to Limerick city.</P>
    <P>I have never accepted the arguments that all the industries that could be established at Shannon Airport could not be set up near an established community of 50,000 people like Limerick, or even near a small community such as Ennis with 12,000 population.  I am still strongly of the view, in spite of the success attending the efforts at Shannon Airport, that with far less capital outlay, an industrial estate could be established on the Shannon Airport side, if you like, of Limerick which would have provided even greater outlets in employment than Shannon has done up to now.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's viewpoint that one of the main attractions of Shannon Airport is the fact that it is an international airport and that industrialists are encouraged to go there to manufacture a type of article that can be shipped out by air, but I think I am correct in saying that not all the imports of raw materials that go into the manufactures in the industrial zone at Shannon or all the exports that come out of it travel by air.  On a number of occasions, I have tried to get particulars of the goods going into or out of the industrial zone otherwise than by air but up to now it has been impossible to get these figures.</P>
    <P>If it is a fact that certain industries there are importing and exporting goods otherwise than by air, it seems it would have been a more sensible development to establish these industries near a large community centre like Limerick.  If I am wrong in that argument.  I hope the Minister will put me right, but it does seem that when we establish an industrial zone <Col N="1659" /> 15 miles away from Limerick with its 50,000 population and still with a very substantial number of unemployed and a high rate of emigration, the possibility, at least, of establishing an industrial zone closer to Limerick where the workpeople live would be worthy of investigation by the Minister or by some other Department.  I still hope that in, or near, Limerick city an industrial zone of this type may be established and I believe that if it had city would have benefited very substantially and a good deal of capital would have been saved.</P>
    <P>It seems to me more logical to expand an existing community rather than try to create a completely new community around the Airport.  I must say that together with other public representatives in Limerick and elsewhere, I have been disturbed by the extent of the future town &mdash; I might almost describe it as a small city &mdash; which we were told recently was to rise at Shannon.  Estimates of 30,000 to 50,000 people living at Shannon Airport have been made from time to time.  If that is a fact, I think it does offer a very serious threat to the existing community of Limerick city.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that there would be a break after the first stage to the extent of 250 dwellings, and that thereafter they would have another look at the situation to see how it was developing.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that certain industries will require at least part of their staff to reside near their place of work but I should have thought the number involved would be comparatively small and that, in the main, workpeople employed in these factories would wish to live in their own homes, where their families have lived for several generations.  Certainly, it would have been cheaper to build houses near Limerick and provide fast, cheap transport to the Airport, rather than start building what already amounts to a small town and what will, if the company's estimates reach fruition, become a very substantial town in a few years.</P>
    <P>In offering these criticisms, I do not <Col N="1660" /> want to be taken as in any way wishing to dampen the efforts made at Shannon. A great deal of credit is due to the initiative of the Shannon Company in securing these industries.  But I should like to know what expansion has taken place in the original concept of Shannon Airport as a centre for transatlantic freight.  Secondly, I should like to know if the industries&mdash;or some of them&mdash; established there could not have been established at Limerick or Ennis and the finished goods taken out either by road or rail to the Airport?  Thirdly, what are the possibilities of expanding tourist traffic from the Continent through Shannon Airport?</P>
    <P>As other speakers have said, the State has invested a great deal of money in Shannon Airport.  In many ways, it has been a unique experiment. Everybody here wishes it every success. Personally, I wish it continuing success but I should like to feel certain that the capital so employed would not be better employed elsewhere.  At this stage, I should like the Minister to have a look at the possibility of establishing an industrial zone near Limerick city from which goods could be transported to the Airport and thence by air or alternatively, could be exported through Limerick port which, as the Minister knows, is a port for ocean-going vessels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister deserves to be criticised very severely for having come to the House with this Bill without first having ensured that a more up-to-date report would be available in respect of this company than that for the year ending 31st March, 1960.  Presumably, the company has kept to its accounting date and that 31st March last was the accounting date on which the balance sheet was struck and up to which income and expenditure accounts have been prepared.  It should not be beyond the wit of man, in a concern of the size of this company, to ensure that their accounts are brought in and that the company meeting is held before the Minister comes to the Dáil towards the end of July, some four months after the end of the company's financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if there were some hitch regarding completion of the accounts &mdash; and I <Col N="1661" /> do not see what hitch there should be&mdash;it should have been possible for the company to hold its annual meeting and adjourn it, and for the chairman to make an approximate statement at that annual meeting.  I say that because I believe that it is at the annual meeting that the statement should have been made in such circumstances rather than by the Minister anticipating the chairman's report at such an annual meeting.  The Minister is clearly to blame for not having made the appropriate arrangements with the company's board of directors so that the information would be available in that form, if it is not in final form.</P>
    <P>Personally, I can see no reason why it should not be available in final form. If the experience of last week is repeated we will, I suppose, find the new report will be published next week. The Minister showed a complete disregard for the Dáil by the manner in which he announced a major step immediately after his Estimate concluded last week.  That kind of slick procedure is a disgrace in its implications and in the aspersions it casts on this House.  I am not making any comment at this stage either as to whether the Minister was wise or unwise to set up the super-State Board over State Boards, but it was a disgraceful thing that the Minister did not pay the Dáil the courtesy of advising the House that he had that in mind when his own Estimate was being discussed three or four days earlier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I have been accused of being impolite to the House.  I should like to say that the report in the newspaper concerned was not accurate and I issued a statement giving the truth about this committee to all the newspapers. I do not know if the Deputy read the corrected statement, but it made it quite clear that there was no such thing as a super-Government or State Company Board of an economic character.  This was the heads of all the State companies meeting at intervals in order to discuss common problems. There is nothing in the nature of a new planning authority and nothing in the nature of an instrument over and beyond the instruments now in <Col N="1662" /> existence, such as the Industrial Development Authority, etc.  I made that clear in the statement I issued to the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is correct in what he says just now. He was so anxious about the initial blurb that he did give a false impression and the false impression was taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, it would have been more courteous to advise the House when his own Estimate was being taken a few days before.  I do not want to see the same thing happening in relation to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I do not want to see a balance sheet and accounts issued a few days after we have discussed a Bill instead of the House getting the information, as it should get it, while the Bill is actually under discussion.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons I am particularly anxious to see the report to the 31st March, 1961, is because I cannot reconcile certain statements in the Minister's speech with the 1960 report.  I am sure the Minister has the 1960 report there.  If he turns to page 14 he will see that the report states that on 31st March last, 1960, in addition to the special factory, there were 22 factory units in operation.  In paragraph 5 of his own speech he says there are 15 factory bays, a special factory bay, and five under construction. That makes only 21.  Where are the 22 factory units?  Where is the additional factory unit that the board of directors said was in existence on 31st March, 1960?  Where has it gone in the interval?  Has it got lost? Is it that the Minister does not know what is happening in a concern for which he himself is responsible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from all that, we have, I think, been given far too little information in relation to the costings of this concern and the projects in relation thereto.  What is the average cost of these factory bays?  On what basis is the rent fixed?  For how long is it proposed to amortize the building <Col N="1663" /> costs by way of rent and apart from the return on the capital involved? Without being taken as criticising the project itself, when asked to increase so substantially the amount of money involved, the House is entitled to know the exact economic facts in relation thereto.  We are entitled to know whether each of these factory bays is let at an economic rent, first, in relation to the return on the capital invested, secondly, in relation to getting back that capital by amortization in the ordinary way and, thirdly, whether we are entitled to know the split in the economic rent as between what is charged, on the one hand, and the free grant in respect of the factory bay on the other hand.</P>
    <P>I accept without question that there must be from time to time variations in the cost of the individual factory bays.  It is the principle with which I am concerned&mdash;the principle as to what is done in relation to costings, whether the lowest rent is fixed to produce an economic return, and over what period of years exactly that economic return will be made available. Apart from the actual factory buildings the Minister, in reply to a question, told us that three firms have ceased to function.  Are we to understand that these companies have gone into liquidation?  Are we to understand that there are no unsatisfied creditors, Irishmen and women, who have not been paid for the contracts which they took up?  Everyone knows that, while the Minister does not accept legal responsibility in relation to these factories, there is a moral obligation on him to make a careful assessment of the work of the various concerns before they come in there.</P>
    <P>I have seen articles in relation to one of the concerns that was established there and that subsequently closed up.  The allegation was made that the way in which that particular concern was being run throughout the world was nothing short of a racket. The manner in which that article was written and the fact that it was published in a responsible and reputable magazine&mdash;a magazine with a financial background&mdash;made it perfectly <Col N="1664" /> clear to me that they must have had their facts correct because there was otherwise a clear action for libel, and no action for libel was taken.</P>
    <P>According to what I hear, certain Irishmen and women lost through that concern, which was established in Shannon and which folded up, which was inevitably bound to fold up because the whole purpose behind it was to sell out the parent stock to people here and the company concerned were not going to take back the progeny of the parent stock for a number of years, before which time they would fold up their tent and creep away.  I think both the Minister and the company have a moral obligation to ensure that we do not get under State sponsorship in Shannon Airport that type of concern.  Nobody can possibly prevent an occasional mistake but there should be the most careful screening before there is an acceptance of factories for the free airport.</P>
    <P>I must confess I also find some considerable difficulty in understanding the difference of the approach of the Minister to the Shannon Free Airport Development, on the one hand, and the Shannon estuary development on the other.  In relation to the latter there are of necessity, perhaps, not exact estimates available, not exact forecasts available, not exact plans available.  That is inevitable in the development of something new, even though as in this case, the Minister is dealing not only with his own money but with that of the taxpayer as well.</P>
    <P>In the other case the people were making the investigation with their own money and it does not seem to me that the analysis of the forecasts and estimates for which the Government asked the Shannon Estuary Company has been made in the same manner as it was in this case. People who were expending their own money, as those concerned in the Shannon Estuary Company were should, it seems to me, be entitled to at least the same facilities as operated in relation to estimating in the Government's own concern.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell referred to the provision <Col N="1665" /> of housing on the estate.  That matter has been raised often already by Fine Gael speakers and, for the life of me, I cannot see what the advantages are in setting up the new residential area in the Airport, with the costs which that inevitably brings in its train compared with availing of the types of buildings which are adjacent to cities and towns&mdash;Limerick, Ennis and Clarecastle, let us say. After all, it is not only the question of the cost of the houses.  You cannot expect people to live in houses without proper amenities.  It would mean perhaps hospitalisation and almost inevitably new schools.  I do not know what it will mean in relation to the costs of new religious buildings in the area concerned.</P>
    <P>The whole idea of building a new town for the purpose of dealing with this is, I suspect, not really as the Minister says&mdash;because industrialists want people living near their work&mdash; but because the Minister was determined to try and make a splash of this. Of course there would be certain key personnel required near factories, but the number of those would be very small, indeed, compared to what the Minister referred to in his speech.  It would, to my mind, be far better that adjacent towns would be built up with the shops and the business people already in them and having other facilities and amenities such as cinemas and schools.  Dispensaries would also have to be set up and that could all have been done far more cheaply and far better in the adjacent towns.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties with which every political Party is concerned is the manner in which towns, in certain cases, are being depopulated.  Here was a chance to avoid that in relation to this area and I cannot see why this additional cost was incurred when we could have, for the same or less cost, availed of the amenities which are necessary adjuncts to the adjacent towns.  I must confess that in relation to this Act&mdash;and I make allowances because it is the first Act&mdash;I find far less information being made available to the House than should be made available.  I hope that when we are giving this increased subvention to the company we will bear in mind the <Col N="1666" /> onus that there is, because public money is being made available, to have a frank and complete disclosure of the economic costings to date and in the future in relation to individual projects.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of suggesting that the money involved here should not be given.  The House is entitled to know the exact basis upon which it is being asked to provide the money and I think it is unfair to the House that this should be brought here by the Minister with only a balance sheet 16 months old available and that available only for a trivial period of a couple of months.  I do not quite understand one technical question in relation to the Bill.  As I read the Bill, we are required to guarantee the £200,000 available which, at the same time, is being provided out of advances of £400,000 under Section 4.  Is that merely a switch in the manner of financing or is it now consequent upon the order made on April 28th last removing the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited from the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act?  Either now or during Committee Stage, I should like the Minister to provide us with that information.</P>

      <P>This is the second if not the third of the Bills introduced in this House for the purpose of developing Shannon Airport. I always understood that the original of these Bills was for the purpose of ensuring that Shannon Airport might remain open.  When the Minister introduced one of the earlier Bills he stressed the point that Shannon Airport was likely to be overflown on account of the approaching jet age and that, for that purpose, he wanted to ensure he would be able to establish an industrial arm at the airport.  This Bill, as far as I can see, is purely an extension of the capital and State guarantees behind this concern.  As well as that, a clause relates to the building of houses in the vicinity of the Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must acknowledge that on the last occasion on which he introduced a Bill quite a few Deputies, not alone from the Fine Gael Party but <Col N="1667" /> from other Parties as well, stressed the point that as Shannon Airport was in an outlying area it might be better, in considering an overall scheme, to encourage industrialisation in that area, and within the vicinity of the airport itself that we should take into consideration the fact that the industries could be just as economically centred in or around the existing towns&mdash;places like the centre of Limerick and the other towns near the airport. If my memory serves me right, the Minister's reply was that it was the intention to save the Airport at all costs and that he thought that that would be the natural sequence of events, that these industries would be sited not only around the Airport itself but in the surrounding towns and cities.  The fact that the Minister has come to this House this afternoon with a clause providing £400,000 for the building of houses in the vicinity of the airport suggests that that was wishful thinking on his part and also that he does not appear to have paid sufficient heed to the advice given to him from the Opposition benches and even from his own benches in the last debate we had.</P>
    <P>In the front page of his opening speech today the Minister says that the main function of the Shannon development scheme is to increase the freight traffic and to promote commercial, industrial and tourist activities. I do not find anything in his speech to suggest there is any definite link-up between the development company and tourism.  I do not see anything in his speech about tourists being invited to fly into Ireland, about a definite link-up between, say Bord Fáilte and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and about the availability of transport facilities to convey people to the different scenic spots around Ireland where we have so much to offer the tourists.  Could the Minister tell me, for instance, if there is any bus running from Shannon Airport to Bunratty Castle which is not very far away and which I think he himself went down to open with a great flourish some months ago, or whether there are any buses available to transport people to other places of <Col N="1668" /> interest in the immediate vicinity or in other parts of Ireland?</P>
    <P>If this House is to be asked to guarantee an increase in capital up to £3,000,000 for this area, seeing that this is State money, are other parts of the country not entitled to such consideration? Would the Minister like to tell us whether this Shannon Free Airport Development Company is solely for the purpose of setting up industries in and around Shannon Airport?  Is it solely for the purpose of providing facilities for companies who wish to set up there or is its purpose an all-out drive to secure more transport business for the air company itself and to benefit the national economy as a whole?</P>
    <P>Representing a constituency on the east coast of Ireland, I was naturally suspicious when the Minister came into the House to tell us: &ldquo;We have this company set up because if it is not set up, the airport may close down; we may be overflown.&rdquo;  At that time I expressed the view that Shannon Airport would never close down because it is indispensable to the other air companies.  There is not a month goes by that there is not some news of an impending disaster to an aeroplane out over the Atlantic which must return to Shannon Airport as the most westerly point.  It is less than a fortnight since an aeroplane got into serious difficulties off the west coast of Ireland because of which Shannon Airport had to be alerted to receive the plane coming back.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company could be a good idea. It would have been a very good idea if it were utilised entirely for light industries, products of which could be transported from Shannon Airport to countries in the western hemisphere and to different parts of the world. We have no information from the Minister as to what are the trade returns, whether the Airport is being used by air companies for transporting their material, whether the type of stuff manufactured at the Airport is suitable for transport by air at all. We know nothing about that.  When the Minister introduces a Bill here he is probably under the impression that every Deputy knows all about the <Col N="1669" /> industries that are starting there.  We do not.  We do not know what the type of industry is.  We do not know whether these industries are based on Irish raw material, whether they are heavy industries or whether they are light industries the products of which are capable of being transported at an economic price.  Recently an article appeared in a certain journal&mdash;I am not sure whether it was an industrial journal or the journal associated with the chambers of commerce&mdash;in which they complained that some of these industries were being started under false pretences, that they were not fully utilising the air transport facilities available to them at the Airport. These are matters on which the Minister should give us some information.</P>
    <P>Nowadays we are very prone to have Bills hurled at us by the Government. At the moment we are having them thrown at us at the heel of the hunt practically on the verge of a dissolution. There are 15 or 16 Bills confronting the House and I think I am right in saying that this is the third Bill the Minister has introduced relating to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I do not think we have had sufficient information.  In replying the Minister should tell the House in minute detail what the returns are, what are the prospects of this company being a paying concern, whether in the main it is helping to increase transport business by making more use of the Airport than there has been.  It is very easy to say we require this money for further development but all it really means is that the Minister is looking for more capital to start more industries and to build houses.  Does that indicate to Dáil Éireann that this is a satisfactory company? It may be a commercial concern but I could very easily ask: &ldquo;Why should that £3,000,000 not be utilised in County Wexford&rdquo; which I represent and where I should be very happy to see it utilised, if it is purely for the purpose of expanding the national economy?</P>
    <P>If this Bill is for the purpose of keeping alive the Airport and if the Airport is being kept alive purely by the fact that industries are centred <Col N="1670" /> around it, it is not achieving the object for which it was set up.  I understand its function was to increase the freight traffic of the Airport and to expand tourism in Ireland by bringing more people into Ireland.  If it is not fulfilling that function, we are just having further money expended on having industries sited in one area.  Deputy Russell said just now there are a vast number of unemployed people in Limerick.  Of course there are.  There are a vast number of unemployed people in every town in Ireland.  Instead of spending a vast amount of money in providing industrial employment in a new town, even if full employment is provided in that new town, would it not be far more sensible to give employment in existing towns? I would ask the Minister to deal with the points I have made when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity of looking at this Shannon Free Airport project and observing the progress, it is making, if any.  As I understood the scheme in the first instance, it came to life from the idea of protecting employment at Shannon when there was a fear that, with the development of large jet aircraft, Shannon might be overflown to such an extent that employment there might be imperilled.  The idea was then conceived of creating a free airport at Shannon as a lifeboat operation for the purpose of saving the employment of personnel who might be displaced with the introduction of the more powerful aircraft which it was then contemplated would use Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in pursuance of that policy, I take it, that firms have been encouraged to establish themselves at Shannon where certain advantages have been made available to them. The idea has progressed sufficiently to justify us asking at this stage what is the general plan about the future of Shannon.  Is it the objective to locate only a certain number of industries there and to allow industrial development to take place in other areas? How many industries is it intended to locate at Shannon?  What is the employment potential aimed at there? Is it intended to develop at Shannon the necessary attributes of civilised <Col N="1671" /> living so as to ensure that persons employed there will have at least the amenities they would have in, say the nearby City of Limerick or the substantial town of Ennis?</P>
    <P>The idea of living on an airport is rather abnormal in 1961.  Nobody would select as a place in which to live, unless driven to it by economic necessity, the perimeter of an airport over which 707 Boeing jets were flying day and night.  It would be an interesting study to examine the second generation of Irish who had been born and reared on a jet airport and to see the physical characteristics they reveal. Everybody will agree that as a site for a home and a place to rear young children the perimeter of an airport has been avoided as far as possible. To select Shannon Airport as the ideal site for a bungalow, a place where one can get rest and peace, a place with a halcyon climate, would seem to be a complete reversal of everything that human ingenuity has thought of up to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not exaggerating. I should be happy to be told in what way I am exaggerating.  The Minister is taking power in this Bill to spend money on housing.  I take it somebody will live in the houses, that we will not have another folly such as we had at Foynes and that the houses will be occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The houses are not at either end of the runway, which is the main point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not need to be at either end of the runway to hear a 707 as people in this city who hear them go over at night know to their disadvantage, apart from Shannon or any other airport in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to find out the exact reasons why it is contemplated making Shannon, not merely a factory site, but a residential area.  As has been pointed out by other Deputies, if it is intended to make it a residential area consideration must be given to the provision of <Col N="1672" /> schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, secondary schools.  Alternatively, one must contemplate long travelling from the residential area around the Airport to whatever place these facilities are available.  It is not the best possible type of planning which involves persons having almost to leave home in order to get these facilities.</P>
    <P>If there were no towns or cities near Shannon I could understand the reasons for proceeding in this way to build houses at Shannon and to provide these other facilities there in order to accommodate staff working at the Airport but in view of the proximity of Limerick City, with its scenic attractions, and the modern town of Ennis and other fair sized towns and villages, I cannot understand why, in planning for industrial development regard is not had to the need for building up Limerick and these other towns and villages instead of, as it were, concentrating on the Shannon project to the neglect of these other areas.</P>
    <P>Every one of the firms at Shannon could be given precisely the same facilities in Ennis or Limerick.  All that this House has to do is to decide how they should get them.  There is no great disadvantage in importing the raw material or exporting the finished article.  All that could be done, if firms decided to come here and if we wanted to facilitate manufacture and export of goods, by duty free import and facilities for export. We could let them take in the raw materials free of duty and put no impediment to their export.  If these firms were located in Limerick, Ennis or any other town they could get the facilities that are available at Shannon. That would obviate the risk of over-industrial sing Shannon to the neglect of other places which have been centres of human activity and where equal facilities are available for the establishment of industry.</P>
    <P>I do not say, and have never said, that this whole project is undesirable. I realise the necessity for a lifeboat operation by establishing industries at Shannon to take up the possible sag in employment caused by Shannon being overflown by the larger type of aircraft but we have to review this <Col N="1673" /> matter from time to time and see where we are travelling and not accept that what we do today inevitably drives us to do something next year which was not contemplated in the first instance.  This matter must be examined from time to time from the standpoint of operating a lifeboat service to save employment and the heavy capital investment at Shannon but having regard to the very legitimate claims of other towns and cities for a share of the industrial development which at the moment, so far as that portion of Ireland is concerned, seems to be concentrated somewhat unduly at the Shannon Free Airport.  I do not want to be over-critical of what has been done, but I do say that a considerable amount of prudence is necessary to make sure that we are not putting, as it were, all of our money on one horse, while many equally deserving horses are available to carry our money, perhaps to ultimately more rewarding ends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reinforce some of the remarks I made on previous occasions, and which have been stressed by Deputies this afternoon. The original plan when facilities were provided at Shannon, as I understood it, was to cater for those who might be disemployed as a result of the development of modern aircraft, and the likelihood that Shannon would be over-flown.  That, in itself, was a desirable objective, but, as I mentioned previously, and as other Deputies have said, it is worth while seeing where we are going in regard to these facilities that are now being provided, or which may have to be provided, at Shannon, which to a very considerable extent are already available at Limerick or Ennis.</P>
      <P>In fact, workers who may be disemployed as a result of any of these developments now reside, in the main, either at Limerick or Ennis, and those who were formally employed dealing with aircraft at Shannon had to travel to Shannon from Limerick or Ennis where their families resided, and where the various facilities were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to find out is: what special facilities are available at Shannon that cannot be provided at Limerick or Ennis?  It may be that <Col N="1674" /> for certain types of industries which import raw materials which are suitable for air transport, an airport is a convenient place to set up a factory to process the raw materials and, in turn, export the finished article.  On the other hand, there is no inherent difficulty in providing the same facilities for the establishment of such an industry at Limerick or Ennis, or some of those smaller places such as Newmarket-on-Fergus or Clarecastle.</P>
    <P>In the case of Limerick and Ennis, one of which is a large city and the other a very considerable town, both have ample facilities available.  They have all the ancillary services, churches, housing schemes, schools, shops, and so on.  There are many examples of special arrangements being made for existing industries which have to comply with certain requirements.  It would be possible to get similar requirements complied with, if necessary, at either Limerick or Ennis.</P>
    <P>There appears to be some magic in the words &ldquo;Shannon Free Airport.&rdquo; Because of the description &ldquo;free airport,&rdquo; the same facilities could be provided either under licence or whatever other statutory or technical requirement is necessary at either of these other places.  I believe that what has been said this evening by Deputy Norton is correct.  We should have another look at this matter.  No one will criticise the Government for efforts made to absorb those who may have been disemployed.  On the contrary, everyone supports that intention.</P>
    <P>Merely because an effort was made to do that at the Airport&mdash;and because of the fact that the other facilities exist in abundance in normal conditions at Limerick or Ennis&mdash;is no reason why we should not now reconsider the question.  It may be argued that it might be too costly to establish a factory or factories at one of these other places and bring the finished article or the raw material to the Airport, that is, the finished article in the case of finished commodities and the raw material in the case of imports.  On the other hand, it would probably be far less costly to do that than to provide housing schemes, churches, schools and the other necessary adjuncts to a <Col N="1675" /> development scheme such as is envisaged here.</P>
    <P>I have never yet got a satisfactory answer as to why these facilities which are being provided cannot be provided at Limerick or Ennis.  If there is any lingering fear that there would be criticism if the project were altered, or the original project changed, there need be no doubt about that, because Deputies on all sides of the House are quite prepared to have this matter looked at afresh and examined with a view to arriving at the best possible solution from the point of view of providing employment for those who may lose their employment.  This scheme has very considerable possibilities but these necessary services are already available in these other places.  They could be provided far more cheaply by availing of the existing services which are catering for substantially more people, without embarking on an undertaking the full consequences of which cannot be actually foreseen or entirely estimated on a financial basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Some speakers have been cautious in their acceptance of this Bill and others have questioned the whole project.  Most of the questions asked have already been answered in my Second Reading speech, and I do not propose to repeat either what I said on that occasion or what I said during the course of my Estimate speech.  I shall try to deal so far as I can with the new questions that have been raised.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this air industrial estate is to provide employment for those who may be disemployed as a result of aircraft flying over Shannon. It has already emerged since that decision was taken that there is a new demand, for property adjacent to the airfield from which raw materials and finished goods can be directly despatched and discharged from the factory to the airplane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer to the Deputy who raised the question as to whether we could not have established these industries in Ennis or Limerick is that this is a specific type of new industrial estate which does not exist anywhere <Col N="1676" /> else in the world, except in Luxembourg, where they are already planning an estate of the same kind.  Therefore, the project is entirely new and development is proceeding.  I cannot tell the House how quickly it will grow.  I can only give estimates on the basis of the present bookings of factory bays.  If the number of factory bays built each year&mdash;which is roughly from eight to ten&mdash;and the bookings, continue on as satisfactory a basis as at present, several thousand people will be employed at the Shannon industrial estate in the course of the next few years.  Much depends on international trade and on other conditions over which we have no control, or little control.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked why we were building houses at Shannon.  There again, the answer has been given many times in the Press, and in my speeches on the Estimate, and on other occasions. These houses are not being constructed in order to provide a splash by way of Government publicity.  The housing scheme is based on the most minute and detailed inquiries having been made from expert town planners with international reputations.  We consulted our own town planning experts and the town planning experts of at least three other countries on the complicated question of how many people, if you give employment in an isolated part will want to live near their work, how many must live there, and how many are prepared to go by bus, whether subsidised or unsubsidised, 14 or 20 miles away from their homes.</P>
    <P>This is a question on which there is a great deal of evidence from foreign countries, through the building of entirely new towns such as those built as satellite towns in England.  There is a variety of evidence based on individual psychology, domestic habits, and related to various types of workers. On the basis of the expert advice, it is reckoned that about one in three workers will want to live in Shannon and the rest will want to live in Limerick, Ennis, Sixmilebridge, New-market-on-Fergus or somewhere adjacent. The Government decided that the matter should be examined further <Col N="1677" /> and so, as I indicated in my Second Reading speech, we plan at the moment to build 250 dwellings, including flats let at higher rents and houses let at lower rents.  The demand for these dwellings is already very favourable, showing that at least to some extent we know already that the town planners and the experts were right when they said that in any new industrial area, there will be people who wish to live close to their work.</P>
    <P>I should also add that the industrialists contributed their measure of information and help by making it clear to us that there must be housing for certain classes of workers adjacent to the Airport.  These industrialists included firms of international and very fine reputation who had built factories in other places where there was a floating population and had some experience of where their workers wished to live.  I have now outlined the purpose behind the development of this estate.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy McGilligan, there are 724 persons employed now.  That again is a figure which we regard as very hopeful.  He spoke about the small numbers of persons employed, but the estate is just getting into operation and many of the firms have not yet installed all their plant.  The firms have told us that, other things being equal, they hope they will eventually employ 2,000 people.  That is what the firms tell us.  This forecast again will be affected by international conditions and the state of trade in general, but I think it is a very good indication from the point of view of industrial development in the country.  The firms themselves have invested about £1,000,000 in the estate, exclusive of all grants by the Shannon Company.  They have told the company that their total investment will be £2,000,000, which again is quite considerable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of our joining the Common Market, it would be much too difficult for me to go into detail in regard to its effect on the Shannon industrial estate.  All I can say at the moment is that the inquiries coming in for factory space are increasing, if anything, and show no decline whatever since this matter has been discussed and since all the <Col N="1678" /> talk about the Common Market started in earnest, both in Great Britain and here.  It would take me much too long to give the House full particulars of how the Common Market could affect the estate.  I think we can look at it in a reasonably optimistic frame of mind and if the firms are doing their job properly, and if their costs are low and their productivity high, I think with some adjustment they might be able to take advantage of the greater market in the future.</P>
    <P>In particular reply to Deputy Russell, if the industrial estate had been established in Limerick, there would be two additional transshipments of raw materials and finished goods and that is one of the particular factors which is very important to the promoters of industry there.  They do not want to transship their goods, if they can avoid it.  They want only single handling.  If Deputy Russell and Deputy McGilligan would like to go to Shannon, I am sure they would be received by the chairman and other officers and they could be introduced to some of the managers of the factories who would explain to them why it was so important to have the industrial estate on the actual taxi-way of the airport.  It is the development of this new idea which I think is going to bring prosperity to the industrial estate at Shannon.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that I have emphasised to the board of directors of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company the necessity of keeping to the principle that this is an air industrial estate, in order that they should not compete unfairly with the development associations in other towns throughout Ireland who are trying to secure industries for themselves.  I am very glad to say from the origin of the inquiries made to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company that it is perfectly evident that the firms coming in there are, in the great majority, those looking for sites right on the verge of the Airport for the particular advantages that accrue from that situation.</P>

      <P>I think I can say I have not received any indication of amounts of a substantial character owed to any firm or individual as a result of liquidation.  Deputy Russell and Deputy Esmonde asked some questions about bringing traffic to Shannon, both freight and passenger traffic.  The answer is that the Shannon Company spends considerable sums on advertising campaigns, both direct and in collaboration with other air companies and agencies.  Television advertising is also carried out and other promotion methods are used to promote Shannon as a travel centre.  Tours are organised from Shannon to other parts of Ireland and the Shannon Company itself manages Bunratty Castle and ensures that there are excellent travel facilities to the Castle from all directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to air freight, as the House knows, there will be a reduction of air freight rates on September 1st of this year, and it will take some time to estimate how far that will help Shannon to become to a greater extent an <i>entrepôt</i> for transatlantic air freight. Much depends on the effect of the fixed points at which changes of rates are made in regard to bulk cargo.  It may be that these weight break points will encourage the use of Shannon as an <i>entrepôt</i> for trade and on the contrary, it may encourage aircraft to go further to other countries.  That matter is being studied and as soon as the Shannon Company is able to assess the position accurately, they, encouraged by us, will do what they possibly can to tell the whole of the freight world how the rates can affect freight costs and enable companies to benefit in their costings and dispatch by using Shannon as an <i>entrepôt</i>.  There is an element of controversy in regard to the future use of Shannon Airport <Col N="1680" /> for freight purposes.  The question arises as to whether it is better to encourage a large number of planes to visit the airport and to fill up spare capacity with freight or to encourage a few large freighters to take very large quantities.  All that enters into the general examination of the position.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the accounts for the period ending 31st March, 1961, are not ready.  The officers of the Shannon Development Association have been working extremely hard.  They have been working overtime.  They have been dealing with an entirely new project in which innumerable questions of a novel kind had to be answered.  They have had to help industrialists to establish themselves.  They have had to arrange for the training of workers. They have had to plan the housing.  I believe the Company to be efficiently run.  There is no special reason why the accounts should be delayed.  I understand they should be ready in the course of a month.</P>
    <P>In regard to the whole of my Department, that position arises in the presentation of accounts.  Were it not that it would mean other complications, the ideal period for the Department's Estimate would be September each year.  The final accounts of the companies seem to come just at the end of the Dáil period.  I was able to extract some provisional figures, in connection with some of the State companies over which I have supervision, in time for the Estimate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman asked some questions about the arrangements for the provision of factory buildings.  It would be very unwise <Col N="1681" /> for me to give details of the individual agreements made with each factory.  Over the whole period it is expected that the Industrial Estate will be a viable undertaking to the point that it will eventually pay interest on the capital invested in factory buildings at an economic rate.  I doubt whether capital will be repaid.  The investment will provide an economic interest eventually.  It would be impossible to give particulars of each individual factory because these agreements are made privately.  At a certain point the rents will be of an economic category as the rents rise over a period; in some cases they are struck at an average rate.  The whole effort is intended to be economic in the long run.</P>

On the half of the capital derived from the company itself, only a nominal rate of interest is charged. In the case of the factory buildings, it is anticipated that the rents paid for the factory buildings will, at a certain point, be equivalent to the normal full rate of interest on the capital advanced but there will be no amortisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Very shortly after becoming Minister for Education it became apparent to me that a serious defect in our system was the relatively meagre provision for scholarships.  Not only is the total provision of scholarships meagre in proportion by comparison with that in many other countries, but in very many cases the value of the individual scholarship is very low.  This position must have been fairly obvious to most people who have given thought to the matter, and it is a constant wonder to me that there has not been more criticism of so evident a weakness.</P>
      <P>On coming to the conclusion that an increase in the provision for scholarships was an urgent educational and social necessity, and on having obtained the Government's agreement that steps should be taken to remedy this position, it remained to consider how best to effect a remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> A solution that readily presented itself would be to establish a system of direct State scholarships side by side with those already provided by the local authorities.  Such a system of direct state scholarships might have certain administrative advantages, but on further consideration it soon appeared that, whatever these advantages might be, they would be greatly outweighed by the disadvantages and inconsistencies that would be inevitable if two systems were to develop, as might easily happen.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, to replace the local authorities scholarship system set up by the 1944 Act by a direct State system would seem to me to savour of a diminishing of a democratic principle, a principle which needs to be strengthened rather than perhaps weakened, and which, in such matters as this, if properly put into effect, can cater better for conditions in one locality relative to another than could an absolutely centralised administrative machine.</P>
    <P>It is also a good general principle that where there is an already existing structure, it is better, if at all possible, to build upon that than to substitute for it something which, however new and shiny, might not quite respond in every way to the original idea.</P>
    <P>This Bill is therefore intended not to replace but to supplement and increase moneys which local authorities are already providing under the 1944 Local Authorities and the 1908 Universities Acts.</P>
    <P>As far as this country is concerned, the Bill is a new approach inasmuch as it is now for the first time proposed that the State step in to provide money for scholarships on a general scale.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill makes clear, I hope, how exactly this would be done.  In recent years, the local authorities have been spending in all about £150,000 per annum on scholarships.  The broad intention of this Bill is to begin by supplementing substantially that provision and to proceed to the point where, in return for an addition of £90,000 by the local authorities to their present £150,000, the State, which at the moment contributes nothing to the <Col N="1685" /> scheme, would in four years' time be contributing about £300,000.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Bill envisages that four years after it should have come into effect the total provision for scholarships would be approaching four times the figure at which it now stands. I think that this may fairly be regarded as a substantial step in the laying down of a pattern for future educational development in this particular field.</P>
    <P>On the whole, our people are very conscious of the benefits of education. The ever-growing numbers in voluntary full-time attendance at our secondary and vocational schools and our universities put this beyond doubt. There are, however, I regret to say, a small number of counties which lag very much behind the others in scholarship provision.  In that way we have great disparity between a county which provides for scholarships only the equivalent of the amount raised by a rate of 1d. in the pound and others which raise the equivalent of 5d. for that purpose.  The substantial State contribution and the method of financing now proposed will, I believe, open the way for the ironing out of such anomalies and of the relative disadvantages that result for some of the abler children.  They should certainly act as a sharp stimulus to those areas which have not been in the forefront, while it will be for the other authorities to see to it that there be no falling off in their present plans and to ensure that the money available from the State is called upon and used to the utmost advantage.</P>
    <P>Apart from the details of the scheme which are given in the Explanatory Memorandum, there are a few matters to which I should like to make specific reference.</P>
    <P>The first of these is that up to one-fourth of the moneys will be allocated to scholarships to be awarded on merit alone, that is, without a means test. There may at first glance be divided opinions on this, but in considering it I think we should view in a large way the object of the scholarships.  Although of course the social aspect of things is involved in relation to what is proposed, <Col N="1686" /> the scheme is not just a piece of social welfare.  Its primary object is educational.  It is directed towards bringing forward, for the benefit of the country as a whole, the very best talent that the country is producing, and that from whatever economic level in which such talent is to be found.</P>
    <P>Now, any means test, even at the most reasonable possible level, will exclude some of the best talent, for the parents' decision to send a particular child forward for postprimary or university education, with no assistance, may in any given case have to be balanced on the knife edge.  This would be especially the case where, as in Ireland, families are usually fairly large and so were what would otherwise seem to be a reasonably good income has to be devoted to the education not of one but of a number of children.  In addition, I think it desirable that all parents who contribute by way of taxes or rates should have some chance of having their child of good ability benefit from their contribution.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat that the principal object of this section of this Bill is to bring forward, for the benefit of the nation as a whole, the country's best talent, wherever it is to be found.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to make special reference is the proposal that the amount to be allocated for university scholarships should not be more than half that provided for post-primary scholarships in one third of the total moneys. The chief factors taken into account in arriving at this ratio were the proportion of post-primary pupils who normally go on to a university and the relative costs, to the parents of post-primary and of university education. It seems to me that in matters such as this the pattern throughout the country should be reasonably uniform. At any rate, in view of the numbers proceeding to a university as compared with those availing themselves of post-primary education, we should not have, as is the case at present in some countries, the disproportionate position of the major portion of the scholarship money <Col N="1687" /> being devoted to university scholarships.</P>
    <P>May I express the hope that the discussion on this Bill will help greatly towards the forming of a public opinion that will not only welcome these scholarships but will come to see clearly that what is here involved is not only an educational and social problem related to particular localities, but an important national problem as well.  That national problem is the provision of special encouragement towards the development of our best national resources, which, as I have said on another occasion here, are the brains with which God has been pleased amply to endow our people.</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly a severe testing time ahead for this and indeed for all countries.  It is for us therefore to strengthen in every way possible our own country's moral fibre.  I think that it should be a strengthening of this country's morale for a citizen, be he poor or rich, to see that it is recognised by those in authority that his child, if of good ability, should be given the opportunity of developing that ability all the way up the educational ladder.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me recall that, as someone has recently remarked, there is in all countries a kind of public schizophrenia in relation to education. The demand for more and more education has grown very rapidly and will continue to grow.  There is accordingly a constant call upon State and other authorities for more and better educational facilities.  But, side by side with that, there exists also an irrational attitude that such additional facilities should somehow or other be provided without additional cost.  The fact is that educational provision costs money, and that more educational provision costs more money.  For educationalists and all others really interested in education, I think it may nowadays be said to be an article of creed that the additional money needed is well worth the spending.</P>
    <P>I would accordingly appeal to Deputies on all sides, as enlightened <Col N="1688" /> men, to give every help they can, as members of local authorities or wherever else they may find themselves in a representative or indeed even in a private capacity by putting their weight and influence into seeing that the local authorities take the fullest advantage of the provisions of this Bill so that the money made available by the House for scholarship purposes be called upon to the full.</P>

      <P>The Minister need not fear there will not be the fullest possible support for this measure, but it will be said &ldquo;Sé a locht a laighead&rdquo;&mdash;the little that is in it is the biggest fault in it. The Minister is just breaking the coating of ice over that part of our education where the talent in the country is looking for an outlet which in our economic circumstances and ordinary family finances, we are not able to give.  I see in this no pattern for future educational development in that field, but I see a point.  I agree with the scheme by which the State steps in to assist the local authorities to finance the pursuit of greater excellence in the development of our educational talent for both the economic and the general moral good of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain things in this Bill that will require to be explained in a little more detail on Committee Stage, but there are certain things in it, however, we ought to clear up at this stage.  The Minister, assisted by the Minister for Local Government, replied to certain questions raised here by Deputy P. Byrne in July.  In relation to the figures sought, there are certain things I should like to get clear.  In part of the Bill, the Minister indicates that one-fourth of the moneys will be allocated to scholarships to be awarded on merit alone.  He then goes on to deal with another aspect of the matter, that is, that only one-fourth of the total moneys are to be <Col N="1689" /> available for university scholarships of any kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>One-third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That will want to be cleared up in relation to the figures.  The Minister says now that up to one-third can be available for university scholarships.  Having made the division between university scholarships and scholarships to secondary and technical schools, we come up against the question of how, under these various sections, the scholarships on merit are to be distinguished from, shall we say, the scholarships with assistance.  At column 526 of the <i>Official Report</i> of the 11th July, 1961, the Minister indicated, in reply to Deputy Byrne, that the total amount of money being spent by local authorities for the school year 1959/60 was £91,536, that is, £91,000 was being spent under the Local Authorities (Education Scholarships) Act, 1944. He indicated at the same time that in the same year approximately £60,000 was being spent on university scholarships provided by local authorities, that is, under the Irish Universities Act, 1908.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated broadly that he is going to provide for scholarships one pound for every pound provided by the local authorities.  He is working rather close to that.  But for the purpose of making it clear, I am putting this question to the Minister: do I understand in relation to local authorities that the moneys provided for the schemes under the 1944 Act and under the 1908 Act are to be regarded separately?  I take it the Minister is answering that they are not, because it would possibly mean that his figure of spending one-third on university education would be radically altered to the detriment of the amount being made available to the universities.  A sum of £91,000 is being spent under the 1944 Act and £60,000 under the 1908 Act.  Therefore, the Minister's suggestion that only one-third has to go to the university authorities must fall from the start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about the amount allocated in each financial <Col N="1690" /> year by the corporation of a county borough or a county council.  When the Minister talks of the amount allocated by local authorities to a particular scheme, do I understand that the amount allocated includes the total amount of the money raised from rates and the total amount of money received for scholarship purposes from the Government?  Section 2 of the Bill states that, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 4 of the Principal Act, a scheme under this Act:</P>
    <P>shall provide, in relation to the amount allocated in each local financial year by the corporation of a county borough or council of a county by which the scheme was prepared for payment in respect of scholarships under the scheme, that the amount shall be allocated by the corporation or council, as the case may be, without regard to whether the parents or guardians of the persons to whom the scholarships are awarded comply with the provisions prescribed under paragraph (c) of the said section 4</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is, it will be granted without means&mdash;</P>
    <P>subject to the proviso that, if one-fourth of the amount aforesaid becomes allocated to persons whose parents or guardians do not comply with the provisions prescribed under the said paragraph (c),</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is, if they are well off&mdash;</P>
    <P>the remainder of the amount aforesaid shall be allocated to persons whose parents or guardians comply with the provisions prescribed under the said paragraph (c).</P>
    <P>That is, if they are not well off.</P>
    <P>The gist of the section, as I read it, is that a scheme shall provide that only one-fourth of the amount allocated by the local authorities for that scheme will be provided on the basis of merit alone.  A question that arises there is the meaning of &ldquo;the amount allocated&rdquo;.  Does that mean the amount allocated out of the scholarship fund accumulated by the adding of the produce of the local rate to the grant received from the Minister?</P>
    <P>A scheme is set up there.  According <Col N="1691" /> to the Minister's scheme, the local authority is responsible for the scheme. The local authority, under the Acts passed so far, takes the initiative in the matter, subject to the approval of the Minister and gratefully receiving from the Minister a certain amount of money related in terms of equality to the amount of money they themselves raise.  They spend that money that becomes theirs when the scheme is operated.  When we come to discuss the spending of money under this Bill, we are talking of the joint fund.  That is clear.  When we come to Section 3 we are dealing with moneys provided by the local authority under another Act.  They may strike a rate for that under the 1944 Act and here again we come up against the question of doubt.</P>
    <P>Section 3 says:</P>
    <P>(a) the amount allocated under that subsection by a corporation of a county borough or council of a county in any local financial year beginning after the commencement of this Act for payment in the provision of assistance for students shall be allocated in accordance with the merit shown by the answering at the tests of ability referred to in that subsection and without regard to the need (if any) of the students for assistance: ....</P>
    <P>In relation to that I want to ask: is that a composite fund also&mdash;the moneys provided by the local authority under its powers under the 1908 Act, plus the moneys that the Minister provides as a result of a scheme in this Act and, when there is mention of one-fourth, does the one-fourth refer to the composite fund?</P>
    <P>When we come to subsection (b), it says:</P>
    <P>the amount allocated by a corporation of a county borough or council of a county in any local financial year beginning after the commencement of this Act for payment in the provision of assistance for students under that subsection shall not exceed one-half of the amount allocated by the corporation or council, as the case may be, in that year for payment in respect <Col N="1692" /> of scholarships under a scheme or schemes approved of under Section 2 of the Principal Act...</P>
    <P>Here we bring in the question of the provision of assistance for students. I take it the money given for students under the 1908 Act is called &ldquo;assistance for students.&rdquo;  The Minister should make that point clear.  He has said that when a corporation deals with the fund&mdash;at any rate under the 1944 Act&mdash;they are dealing with the consolidated fund: when dealing with the moneys made available under this Bill and in relation to the universities, is that another separate consolidated fund?  I take it, it is not and that the two funds are all one.  That being clear, the operation of it by the Minister will, I think, require to be made a little clearer.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the financing of the scheme, I have no comments to make except that it seems that if it is the Minister's idea to work up to equality of finances on the part of local authorities and on the part of the Government, the scheme will work to that end, but he speaks of the relative disadvantages and anomalies that arise in certain cases in respect of abler children.  I want to recall to the Minister's mind certain provisions made in connection with the financing of vocational education bodies in various parts of the country to make up for the relative disadvantages that the young people of these counties would be under if the cost of the scheme were left on the £ for £ basis.  Something like seven counties had to be specially dealt with because of that difficulty. They were Counties Donegal, Kerry, Leitrim and Sligo in which it was regarded as unfair to insist for the £ for £ basis under certain circumstances. In addition, there were probably, at times, Galway, Longford and Mayo.  I suggest to the Minister, who proposes the levelling out of anomalies and discrepancies where one authority strikes a rate of five pence and another a rate of only one penny, that there may be certain counties where there will be very serious disabilities, counties that are not notable for the dullness of their children&mdash;Donegal, Kerry, Leitrim and Sligo, and again Galway, Longford and <Col N="1693" /> Mayo.  All, or at any rate the first four I mentioned, may suffer considerable disadvantage in respect of the provision made for scholarships if the Minister sticks to his arrangement here of a £ for £ basis.  I urge the Minister very strongly to consider that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>When the Minister says this is a pattern that will encourage development of the best national resources&mdash;our brains&mdash;in a new and more effective way, I would ask him to think of what we mean when we talk of educational scholarships intended to provide greater and developing educational facilities for talent.  What exactly do we mean when we set out to make financial provisions for that?  Would the Minister look at some of the figures that have been assembled and see what happens in certain places.</P>
    <P>At column 523 of the Official Report of July 11th, 1961, the Minister, in reply to Deputy Desmond gives information in respect of the total number of university scholarships held in the various counties.  We see that they range from £100 plus university fees in Carlow, to £100 in Clare, to £147 in Donegal, to £200 in Limerick, to £175 in Offaly, to £185 in South Tipperary, to £95 with fees in North Tipperary. There seems to be no general idea as to what the scholarship is intended to be.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether any consideration has been given by those qualified to do so to the question of what a young boy or girl entering on a four or five year course at a university ought to be given by way of financial assistance to see that boy or girl through that course. The Minister has indicated that we have here large families.  There should be plenty of experience available to him as to the waste of valuable talent, a waste that very often takes place by reason of the fact that the older children have to be pushed out to earn whatever they can to enable the parents to manage on whatever income they can command.  Even on the small scale along which the Minister is seeking for excellence in a particular line, namely, providing an open door for the best talent we may have, one matter <Col N="1694" /> that should be very carefully considered by him is the size of the scholarship that ought to be given to a young boy or girl entering a university, whether from Leitrim or from Cork, whether from Kerry or from Louth.  At a stage at which the State is stepping in, recognising its responsibilities and recognising the necessity for getting the best possible results, the Minister will fail in a very vital matter if he fails to face up to that question.</P>
    <P>The same applies to scholarships to secondary and vocational schools.  In that connection, if he will look at the figures given in answer to a question put by Deputy Desmond to him at column 519, he will see that in North Tipperary the range of scholarships per annum given to children from secondary to vocational schools runs from £12 10s. to £50.  A certain element in that may be the means test that is applied, but there is more than a means test in some of the schemes in operation, schemes which call for the Minister's approval.  I have a scheme here, for instance, where the value of the scholarship shall be £30. In the case of pupils who do not reside within a convenient distance&mdash;that is five miles&mdash;of an approved secondary school, or where, owing to the absence of travelling facilities, they cannot attend as day pupils at such a school, or for other special reason, the county council may, if of the opinion that the circumstances of the parents or guardians demand it, increase the scholarship to a sum not exceeding £50 per annum.  I admit that is a comparatively old scheme&mdash;it is nearly seven years old&mdash;but it is at any rate a sample.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether in relation to what he has in mind it is reasonable to differentiate between a person who gets a scholarship to a secondary school within four or five miles, or on their doorstep, on the one hand, and those who, because of their family conditions, would like to see their children in a more institutionalised boarding school.  There is too great an emphasis on and too great a move towards cheeseparing in providing for a sounder and better education for children of scholarship calibre. It seems absurd to cheesepare on what <Col N="1695" /> one will give to a boy or girl of a large family because there are secondary school educational facilities immediately at his or her door.</P>
    <P>These are the general points I wish to make but I do want to stress to the Minister that there is no pattern of any very clear kind being operated at the moment.  That is abundantly clear when one looks at the provisions made by local bodies as a whole. There is a statutory pattern there but the ideal that is being driven home in introducing this new moulding is not sufficiently presented from the Ministerial end and from the executive level.  It is not sufficiently presented to people who are panting for a better opportunity to give the quality talent we have an opportunity.</P>
    <P>There is another point to be considered. The Minister might very well turn his mind to the general discussion that took place in the United States under the auspices of the National Catholic Educational Association of America.  That body has been meeting for the past 50 years.  A very elaborate discussion forum exists in which some one aspect of educational importance is discussed.  The discussion takes place between the members of the Association and others induced to come in and take part.  Last year, as far as I remember, they discussed &ldquo;The Pursuit of Excellence&rdquo;. That was the theme.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of a very elaborate volume, containing papers, discussion and comment, the Minister will find a reference by one of the speakers to what happened in the United States schools when, following the impact of two World Wars, all kinds of people with a general idea that they had a right to a living and to an education from somebody crowded in, with financial assistance of one kind or another, into the universities there.  We have a very meagrely set up university organisation here.  It is already somewhat overpowered.  If the Minister now makes systematic and idealised provision for ensuring that university and secondary education is provided for our talent, he ought to ensure at the same time that real excellence and <Col N="1696" /> real brains are catered for instead of just throwing open the doors to higher education and inviting a great many young people into inevitable resultant blind-alley employment, on the one hand, and further overpowering the teaching faculties of both our universities and secondary schools on the other.</P>
    <P>That is not now a warning that he is going too far here.  He will find he is not going too far for what people want, but I do not think he is going far enough in clearly defining what is wanted from our talent and what is wanted by way of educational facilities for our talent.  As the Minister progresses from this point&mdash; not from this pattern because the pattern is a statutory pattern only&mdash;he will find that he must pay attention to what is meant by developing our talent and providing for that development both the necessary facilities and the necessary machinery.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a complete failure if it is intended as a step towards providing a much needed system of free secondary education for every school-going child in this country, but insofar as it is a stop gap measure which will induce local authorities to provide further and greater amounts of money towards secondary and university education, it is welcomed by me and by my Party.  I believe it will bring about some improvement in our educational system.  However, I am not too happy that, as an inducement towards greater educational benefits, this measure will overcome the type of objection to the expenditure of money on education often found among representatives of the ratepayers on local councils.  It is deplorable sometimes to listen to supposedly enlightened people who object to the expenditure of any money on improving our educational facilities beyond the very limited few secondary and university scholarships now being provided by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is deplorable that irrespective of the standard of ability of children, the money provided for free education is still so small.  It limits the number of scholarships that county councils are <Col N="1697" /> empowered to provide each year to twenty secondary and six university.  I welcome the decision of the Minister in this Bill to apportion quarter of the amount spent on scholarships to a scheme which does not include a means test, because in general I believe that means tests are undesirable.  Whether it be in the matter of secondary or university education, I feel the only test should be the children's ability and not the amount of money in the parents' pockets.  Let us go forward in the knowledge that any boy or girl in this State who has the ability will not be stopped by the amount of money his parents possess or the lack of money from which they may suffer.  Since this is a step in that direction I welcome the measure.  As Deputy Mulcahy has said, there is very little in this Bill but the little in it is a welcome improvement.</P>
    <P>From my reading of the Bill, without the advantage of having available to me a copy of the Principal Act, it seems to me there is provision in this Bill for a change in the residence qualification. I understand that in future where parents leave a certain county before the period of the operation of this Bill they will not be cut out from the benefits of a scheme in that county. I have known of at least two cases of hardship where the residence qualification caused hardship by preventing a county council from awarding scholarships to children of parents who had only recently left the county.  I do not say that the provision of £250,000, as is suggested in this Bill, will bring about any extravagant improvements in our educational system but it is an improvement and I accordingly welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>When at last we come to discuss the extension of university and post primary scholarships, I do not think we should approach it with such apparent financial caution as is evident from this Bill, from the explanatory statement and from the Minister's introductory speech.  The very opening words of the Minister conveyed that the necessity for such a course as this became obvious to him shortly after he became Minister.  That was in sharp contrast with his <Col N="1698" /> customary humility.  If that is so, it has taken a very considerable time for him to introduce this measure.  I do not think those opening words of his can get over the fact that an extension of the provision of scholarship benefits generally was envisaged by people both in the House and outside it before the Minister adverted to it.  The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, in a policy statement at Malahide, last November, made such a statement. Hard on its heels came a statement by the Minister at a later date before a gathering of his Party in this city.</P>
      <P>I would prefer and I think all sides of the House and the country would prefer if this measure had been brought in here at a much earlier stage in the life of this Parliament.  It now carries with it, in addition to the very many inherent and obvious defects in its provisions, the suspicion, by reason of its timing, that it is a measure which is being introduced when a Government, having almost fulfilled its statutory period is going out of office, and that it will not be implemented in any serious way until after the general election.  That is unfortunate. It is unfair to the people who might well at an earlier stage have been gearing themselves to take advantage of it and to local authorities taking steps in a certain direction.  It is unfair to all these people to have attached to it the suspicion that it is merely a piece of election propaganda and an election promise.</P>
      <P>After so much cogitation, after the full realisation of the necessity for it and after what must be long and careful consideration, this is a very mean Bill in the amounts it asks the Oireachtas to provide for scholarships. Nowhere in this Bill is it clear, having regard to rising costs, having regard to the necessity for consequent increases in the value of scholarships themselves, that the number of extra scholarships will reach any appreciable figure or will do any good towards the promotion of education which, I am sure, it is intended this Bill should promote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a suggestion of a need for uniformity throughout the country. Deputy Mulcahy has given certain <Col N="1699" /> figures in relation to the different counties.  There is an appalling lack of uniformity.  There is a lack of uniformity in relation to direct State scholarships and the scholarships given by local authorities.  Even from the very beginning there was a very wide gap between the scholarships given by the State for the Gaeltacht and those given by local authorities.  Two persons benefiting from each class might well come from the same village and receive widely differing amounts.  I remember a time when one student would go to University College, Galway, on a local authority scholarship of £60 per annum out of which he would have to pay his fees whereas another student on a Gaeltacht scholarship coming from the same village and the same kind of household could go to University College, Galway, on a scholarship of £150 per annum.  I am not saying that the £150 was too much but I do think £60 was too low.  There is that kind of anomaly existing in relation to western counties with regard to the value of scholarships.</P>
    <P>My county of Mayo had a total number of 12 scholarships held in 1958-59.  The value of each scholarship is £120 and that is not an unreasonable figure having regard to the yield from the rateable valuation of the county.  However, when I look at the figure for an adjoining county which is much richer I see a figure of only £85 a year for scholarships, and Leitrim, which is even poorer than Mavo maintains the Mayo level of £120.  That lack of uniformity should be cured in some new scheme to be prepared as a result of this fresh assessment of the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not agree at all with the view that a pupil who gets say, first place in a post-primary scholarship, and who lives some miles from a secondary school, should be forced to take a scholarship of a lesser value than that of scholarships generally given.  There should be no impediment or restriction in a scholarship system in regard to what people want.  If a pupil gets a scholarship from a local authority to a secondary school, he should be <Col N="1700" /> free to choose the secondary school to which he wishes to go.</P>
    <P>In most cases there is a means test applied.  The means test application forms are a peculiar anomaly in a case of that kind.  Within this mileage limit, you would have a person whose household would benefit considerably from his going away to a boarding school apart altogether from the advantages of institutionalised education. Another child in the house, by reason of the saving from the cost of food and everything else in the secondary school, should be able to take advantage of a nearby day school.  If a boy or girl gets first place in a county in a local authority scholarships scheme, that should carry with it not alone the advantage of receiving a secondary education but the comforts that are available as well, such as being saved the discomfort of cycling or walking to school in inclement weather, having possibly to stay in the school portion of the day uncomfortably wet.  All these circumstances should be taken into consideration. Anyhow if there is something going for merit, it should carry with it no restrictions.</P>
    <P>There should be uniformity in the value of university scholarships.  There should be uniformity if possible in the case of post-primary scholarships to primary and secondary and vocational schools but certainly the value of university scholarships from the different counties should not be based on the ability to collect so much in the £ from the rates.  It should be based upon the fees that are to be paid and on the cost of maintaining the scholarship recipient in Dublin, Cork, Galway or anywhere else to which he might elect to go.</P>
    <P>In establishments where students board, whether hostels, guesthouses, digs&mdash;whatever you like to call them &mdash;there is a startling uniformity in the amount demanded from each student. A Dublin, Cork or Galway landlady will not take into consideration the fact that a student comes from a county that is paying only £85 as against a county that is paying £120.  Therefore, people who get scholarships should have equality of advantage from the economic point of view so that one will <Col N="1701" /> not be put in a worse position than another.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect which, I take it, when we are discussing scholarships, might well be relevant, that is, that there should be very clear-cut directions by way of advice and guidance generally in the secondary schools or from the Department of Education to pupils who get scholarships.  For instance, a pupil might show aptitude for certain subjects in the Leaving Certificate examination, upon the results of which, I take it, these scholarships will be given.  There might be pupils who showed a leaning towards science as against the humanities generally.  There might be others with an aptitude for modern languages who might be discouraged from taking a modern languages course by being told they would have to go abroad for, perhaps, a year, to perfect a language.  They might decide to take a course which would not be so costly.  Pupils should be directed. The fields for which they are most suitable should be made known to them so that they might do the best for themselves and by the country.  On the other hand, pupils might show aptitude for subjects which might not have any market value for them.  There are several cases that could be cited in a country like ours but it might be invidious to go into them in too much detail.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say that this is a matter on which a great deal more can be done, say, on Committee Stage of this Bill by way of detail.  The Minister might well reconsider his whole attitude towards the amount of money being given.  After four years from now the result of this Bill insofar as it can be ascertained will be that the moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas on the basis of this Bill will be in the region of £300,000.  If we are serious about the provision of scholarships, the extension of scholarship schemes, the extension of the whole idea of people benefiting from education in this world where people are crying out for education, the amount envisaged at the end of four years, pursuant to the provisions of this Bill, is but a fleabite.  That would tend to strengthen the suspicion that there is <Col N="1702" /> an element of pre-election propaganda in this document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Vanity would make me believe that this Bill is produced as a result of a motion put down some time ago by Deputy McQuillan and myself asking for better educational services.  I suppose I have a right to assume that the arguments made by me were so compelling to the Minister that this is the end product. However, commonsense leaves me no alternative but to accept that the motion has had very little influence in the production of this Bill and that, in fact, it is designed to provide a rather modest niche in the coming election manifesto of the Minister's Party.</P>
      <P>I believe this is a fair charge because most of the wordy platitudes which the Minister used in the course of his opening speech about the need to develop the finest brains and talents to the maximum, and so on, were true last year, the year before last, five years ago, ten years ago, or 20 or 30 years ago.  It seems to me to be asking too much to ask the House to believe that this Bill is produced merely because the Department of Education has decided that the defects in our educational services, particularly in relation to the provision of scholarships, should be made up at this time.</P>
      <P>This could be accepted as part of the political campaign if it were not such a serious matter.  The care of old people, better health services and education are the three most important functions of any Government and their proper expansion and development is one of the great privileges of any Government in its time of office.</P>
      <P>I object to the suggestion in the Minister's speech that this Bill will achieve what he called the principal object of the Bill, namely, to bring forward for the benefit of the nation as a whole the country's best talent wherever it may be found.  I have no doubt that that will get a little paragraph to itself in the <i>Irish Press</i> tomorrow and later on in the election literature of the Party but it just does not happen to be true.  If it were true, then the Bill could be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> Clearly, this Bill is defective in many ways and its major defect is in respect of its limitations on expenditure. Quite clearly, there is no sense of urgency, immediacy or necessity to deal with an urgent problem in the Minister's mind when he introduces this Bill.  Remember, what the House debated, what the House agreed to and what the Taoiseach agreed to substantially was the proposition put forward by us that the child should have a choice at the age of 14 or 15 of staying on for an additional year in the primary school or going forward to a vocational school or, alternatively, to a university, depending solely on the question of merit in a particular line in relation to education. This Bill does not provide for that at all.  It is a make-shift, last minute device intended to continue to fool the people into believing the Government have any serious interest in this whole question of education.</P>
    <P>I suppose it would be true to say that some children may benefit after a time from the provisions of this Bill but it would be quite wrong to say the country's best talent, wherever it is to be found, will benefit from this Bill.  It is quite clear, as the Minister said in another part of his speech, that even at present, a number of counties are lagging behind in the provision of schemes under the 1944 Scholarships Act.  &ldquo;There are a small number of counties which lag very much behind the others in scholarship provision,&rdquo; he said in his speech.  That is true.  It has always been true when legislation of this kind was being put on the statute book.  There are counties which, either because of the fact that they have not particularly enlightened councils, or because of the very much more mundane and real fact that they have not got the money&mdash;poor counties, like the counties on the western seaboard&mdash;lag behind in the provision of these services.  They have no alternative to denying their children the opportunities of higher education.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to put a county like Leitrim on the same footing as Limerick, Cork or Dublin.  The result is that the child in the backward county, <Col N="1704" /> the less wealthy county, is victimised for no reason whatsoever&mdash;through no fault of his or her own&mdash;other than that he or she happened to be born in a particular part of the country.  That has always been true and even under the provisions of this Bill it will continue to be true, because the poor counties will stay poor in relation to this Bill, and the slight addition they will get, will still leave them in the position that they cannot compete on the same footing in regard to the provision of scholarships with the wealthier parts of the country.</P>
    <P>To that extent it is misleading and wrong for the Minister to say: &ldquo;It is directed towards bringing forward, for the benefit of the country as a whole, the very best talent....&rdquo;  That is not true.  It will not do that.  As I say, under the 1944 Act it did not, and under this Bill there will be the same discrepancy in relation to the relative poverty of these counties.</P>
    <P>I believe that a valid principle is applicable in this regard.  I believe that everyone with a natural talent should be given the opportunity of developing it to the optimum.  That principle if it is valid and good&mdash;and it is&mdash;should have general application. That principle has not been observed in this Bill.  There is no general application of the principle that every child with talent should be given the opportunity to develop that talent&mdash;whether manual skill or skill of the mind and brain&mdash;to the optimum.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put a limitation and a restriction on these scholarships. One quarter of the children will get scholarships which are not subject to a means test.  Clearly if there is any limitation at all, that means that a certain number of children will be excluded.  In regard to the question of education, as indeed in regard to the question of health, it is difficult to know which section of the people is worse hit.  There is the position of the worker who has a large family. Most of our people have large families. They are told to have large families and, having got them, they are told: &ldquo;They are all yours now; get on with it&rdquo;.  They are given little or no help or education, and are not looked after properly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> There is the working class family which has one or more clever and talented children in a family of five, six or seven.  That family is faced with the serious dilemma, when the child is 14 or 15 years, of whether or not to let the child go on and develop its talent.  If it accepts on the one hand the sacrifices involved, does that mean that the sacrifices will be met by the other children, either in relation to the food they eat, the clothing they wear, the entertainment they enjoy, or even the health facilities they can avail of?</P>
    <P>As a result of making sacrifice and sending one child forward to avail of a scholarship&mdash;the parents of the working class household must face the fact that the child could make money, even a few shillings, pedalling around on a messenger boy's bicycle or selling newspapers and so on&mdash;the parents lose income.  The feeding and clothing of the other children must also be taken into consideration because everyone will agree that, generally speaking the scholarships are inadequate, and many of them grossly inadequate, for working class parents who are trying to provide for the proper care and education of the other children.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for the working class family.  For the white collar worker with again a large family, the problem is nearly as great.  They must try to live up to a particular level or standard and also try to educate their children. They have to pay for the fact that we have not got a proper health service; they have to try to make allowance for their old age.  They must feed and clothe their children and try to provide money for a vacation.  All these added charges on the family exchequer leave the family with the alternative of educating possibly one child&mdash;or at best two&mdash;and the rest are sent off to do the best they can in unskilled work of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I think it is very wrong that any family&mdash;working class, white collar or whatever it may be&mdash;should be faced with that dilemma.  Any father seeing that a child is clever, and knowing he cannot afford to educate that child, is faced with a dilemma which, in no <Col N="1706" /> properly ordered society, he should have to face.  This Bill still leaves many families in that position.  They are left in that position because there is this means test in relation to a certain number of them&mdash;three quarters of them&mdash;and for that reason young boys and girls will be denied access to higher education.  So, again, it is wrong and misleading for the Minister to say there will be a benefit to the nation as a whole by bringing forward the country's best talents wherever they are to be found.  That simply is not true.</P>
    <P>Again, on a third count, I say the Minister will pass by certain young boys and girls with talent and ability, who could develop that talent and ability if given the opportunity.  That is implicit in the limit which he places on the amount of money which will be spent by him and may be spent by local authorities to provide scholarships. It is quite clear that if he is going to limit the amount of money he is providing for these scholarships, he is going to limit the number of children who can come forward.</P>
    <P>Clearly, if the Minister were genuine in his anxiety to see that the country's best talent, wherever it is to be found, is given the opportunity of higher education, he would say: &ldquo;Here are the scholarships and send me the bill; educate these children and send me the bill&rdquo;.  It is quite impossible for the Minister to make out his bill in advance.  If he does, he certainly is putting a limit on the number of children who can avail of scholarships and consequently is not honouring the pledge which he has given in his speech, to look for talent and to educate it.  Where there is a limit on the amount of money to be spent on these scholarships, somebody is going to be neglected, whether it is in the lower income group or in the middle income group.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes no pretence in the important section in his Bill of honouring this pledge of looking for the talent and educating it, wherever it is to be found.  What he is saying is that if there are 12 children, 13 children, 100 children, or 500 children, you will educate just as many as <Col N="1707" /> will be covered by this sum, as made up by the subvention from the rates and by the Exchequer, and no more. If there are 100 children, or if there are ten children, or 500 or 1,000 more, they must be denied this education, this access to higher education which he tells us, in a series of platitudinous remarks is so necessary from the point of view of our children and our society.</P>
    <P>I believe that this tiered education system which we have has been greatly responsible for the retention of the privileges in our society which are such an objectionable feature. It seems to be very wrong that a child of wealthy parents, no matter what his ability, whether he has talent or not, is pushed forward to be a doctor, a lawyer, or an architect or whatever it may be, while children of talent but of less wealthy or poor parents are denied the opportunity. It seems to be a negation of the Constitution's phrase to cherish all equally.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether at this stage it is possible for the Minister to deal seriously with this question of education.  This obviously is a particularly timid effort.  The Minister talks about the danger of substituting a system which, however new and shiny, might not correspond with the original idea in every way.  From reading that, everyone would think of the Minister on his white charger, as a knight in armour who is charging against unknown armies and pioneering something completely new and novel, blazing a new path.  But we are at the tag end of this whole question of social development and in the provision of education, one has only to look at the other countries in the world, at New Zealand or the Scandinavian countries, at Great Britain or across the Border, to know that this is no experimental question, the question of equal opportunities in education.  It is an accepted fact of life in the average democracy, with the exception of a few, and they are beginning to understand the whole question of the community paying <Col N="1708" /> for the members of its society who have not got the money themselves to pay for their health services and so on.</P>
    <P>This whole question of the socialist approach to the organisation of society is becoming more and more accepted and paying greater and greater dividends in the provision of a very highly educated mass of the population.  Even the most backward countries are beginning to understand that there is a tremendous loss to every society which denies to every child capable of developing his character, the opportunity to develop his talents.  It is quite clear, looking around the world, that the socialist societies which have accepted that general principle are leading most of the other more backward, so-called democracies in the world of science, technology, education, literature, the arts and every aspect of education.</P>
    <P>So that the Minister when he says he might be frightened of turning down something, not knowing quite what to put in its place, should look around the world and he will find plenty of examples from societies which have found that the simple answer is for the community at large to provide from the common purse the wherewithal to give talented children, the talented young boy or girl, access to higher education or vocational education merely on the simple test of capability.</P>
    <P>I await with fascination and great interest future development in these matters in this country.  I do not suppose I am misrepresenting him when I say that Pope John in his Encyclical <i>Mater et Magistra</i> has himself come out&mdash;to say &ldquo;as a socialist&rdquo; would probably be going a little far&mdash;as a man who recommends socialisation or socialist ideas in both health and education.  Is this to be one of the occasions on which we will take our politics from Timbuctoo rather than from Rome or will we treat it as it has already been treated by some of the international Press, misrepresented in some of the national Press and suppressed or misrepresented?  A famous headline from one of our national newspapers on the Encyclical read: &ldquo;The Pope Condemns Socialism.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want merely to recommend the Minister to consider that educational services for our people cannot effectively be dealt with in piecemeal fashion, that is, if he is really serious in his aim.  I suggest that if he is not prepared to find the money to give us, there should be a scheme whereby the Exchequer would be fully responsible for all scholarships.</P>
      <P>One of the surprising aspects of Government here is that we are repeatedly told of the state of prosperity of the country, for which we are asked to thank the Government.  We are told it is possible to spend anything up to £6,000,000 on jet aircraft but yet it appears that we are too hard up to educate our children, to give our sick better health services or to care properly for our aged.  If, in fact, we are too hard up to educate our children properly&mdash;I am sure that will not get a headline in the <i>Irish Press</i> tomorrow&mdash;would it be possible for the Minister to amend his scheme and give it a certain impetus in its early stages by introducing a clause on the lines of the financial provisions of the 1947 Health Act which, he may recall, the Government accepted, with a certain baseline, and paid to bring up the total amount spent by local authorities to a certain level?  I should prefer that he would put no ceiling on expenditure by the State, that he would put no ceiling on the expenditure by health authorities, that he would encourage local authorities to spend to the maximum if he is not prepared to take what I think is the proper step, namely to say to the relevant parties: &ldquo;Devise scholarship schemes which will provide for access to higher educational opportunities whether in the universities, the vocational schools or otherwise for every child who can avail of them and send the bill to the Department of Education and we shall be glad to pay up.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister alleged <Col N="1710" /> in his concluding remarks that there is a type of public schizophrenia in regard to educational expenditure, an irrational attitude on the part of many people who demand an increase in educational services but who are not prepared to face up to the need for increased expenditure on the services. I think that is an unworthy allegation to make in respect of the people of Ireland who are fully conscious of the need to spend more and more on educational services, who are growing to appreciate more and more that expenditure on educational services is one of the most productive forms of public investment.</P>
      <P>We are a country poor in natural resources.  We have no lack of brain power.  It is to our shame that we fail to develop that brain power to the fullest extent.  One has only to cross the Irish Sea to England to see tens of thousands of semi-literate Irish persons who are capable of engaging in no other form of livelihood than labouring by reason of their lack of education. This Bill, as Deputy Lindsay has said, is only a flea-bite.  It does not set a pattern or a model for the development of improved scholarship services.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has been preoccupied for the past four or five years with the need for bringing in a scheme such as this, it is suspect that he should do so at this late stage.  However, at least it is a start and we can welcome it for that.  At least it is setting about the process of ridding this country of a class-riddled system of education which we have tolerated for too long.  We must face the need to provide educational services in this country comparable with other advanced European countries.</P>
      <P>As far as public expenditure on education is concerned, we are not facing up to that need.  We are providing for an expenditure of approximately £60,000 this year on a scholarship scheme: in four years' time the sum will be £300,000.  It is far from adequate.  As the last speaker said, it contrasts very strangely with expenditure such as £6 million on jet planes and £4,500,000 on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, necessary and all as a T.B. attestation scheme is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister believes that it would <Col N="1711" /> cut across a fundamental democratic principle if the system whereby local authorities are in control of scholarships in this country were departed from.  I am very disappointed that the Minister has retained the system of control of scholarships by local authorities.  I do not think local authorities are best equipped to administer these scholarship schemes.  Indeed, I do not think it is going too far to say that in some counties one could search high up and low down and one could not find anywhere a body of persons less equipped to administer educational services than the average Irish local authority.  I say that with reluctance but it is a fact that, since the inception of the managerial system and county managers, local government has been at a rather low ebb in this country.</P>
    <P>As far as raising finance for educational development is concerned, I do not believe that that can properly be done through the medium of the local rates, either in whole or in part.  The Minister must be aware&mdash;if he is not, he should be&mdash;that it is only in the past few weeks that the Government have referred to the newly set-up Economic Research Institute the question of surveying the rating structure of this country.  We are all conscious of the fact that the rating system has many defects.  There are many anomalies in it.  There are services provided for financially through the rates which should be on the Central Fund and <i>vice versa</i>.  I submit that the education service is an obvious example of the type of public service which should be provided for out of the Central Fund rather than out of the local rates.</P>
    <P>As far as the local authorities are concerned, education is the Cinderella. Dublin Corporation provides no more than £22,000 per year for scholarships. In the City of Dublin, which is a case in point, during the past fifteen years there has not been one public library built.  The city has been developed very considerably.  New suburbs have been set up but our local authority is so little concerned about the provision of such amenities that not one of these new suburbs has been <Col N="1712" /> equipped with a public library.  That is a measure of the lack of concern on the part of such bodies to provide for educational services.</P>
    <P>Rates are a form of taxation.  In Dublin, particularly, the rates are very high and I sympathise with those members of Dublin Corporation who say that the provision of scholarships is something which should properly be done by the State.  If the Minister is merely going to match pound for pound local authority expenditure, with Departmental methods, I cannot see any great extension of scholarships in this country in the forseeable future.</P>
    <P>The amounts provided by several local authorities are very small.  As a previous speaker said, it is noteworthy that the poorest counties, in particular, have provided very meagre sums for scholarships in the past, particularly those on the Western seaboard.  County Clare, the Minister's own county, in 1959-60 provided only £600 for university scholarships.  Laois provided £550 and Leitrim £880.  All these areas, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out, are not by any means noted for the dullness of their children.  Quite the contrary. They are areas lacking in natural resources.  They are areas where educational development would result in very considerable rewards both nationally and socially.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening speech, spoke about the laggard counties. What is he going to do about that? Has he provided himself with any mechanism in this Bill whereby he would be able to call them to task and ensure that an adequate number of scholarships are provided?  I do not see that he has done so at all.  I believe that, ideally, there should be no means test at all in respect of secondary school and university scholarships.  As there must be a means test, I think it should be uniform as between one county and another.  I do not think that is the case at present.</P>
    <P>The amounts of scholarships in the different counties vary very much.  That is a system which is not being changed in the Bill.  Presumably, they will continue to vary.  Deputy Mulcahy asked us to consider what, if any, investigation has been made as to what are the reasonable costs of education <Col N="1713" /> which should be covered by scholarships and what are the items of maintenance that should be provided for.  That is not being done at all.</P>
    <P>In that connection I should point out to the Minister that many educationalists, both school and university authorities have expressed concern at the growing practice of young students in both secondary schools and universities to engage in vocational employment outside the country.  That has been going on for some time in regard to the universities.  It has only recently developed in secondary schools.  The President of the Secondary Schools' Organisation recently expressed grave concern about the matter.</P>
    <P>I must admire the young boy who, in order to help his parents meet his constantly rising school fees and the cost of maintenance, goes abroad in summertime to earn £12 or £15 a week on the buses in the Isle of Man or Blackpool or in a canning factory or even at sea.  That is an indication of the great need for adequate provision for such costs as maintenance.  How many scholarships are necessary and how far does this Bill go towards meeting the needs of the nation?</P>
    <P>I hope that I do not sound pessimistic about this.  I admit it is a start. I give the Minister credit for doing something which none of his predecessors did, even if he is doing it on the eve of an election.  But let us not fool ourselves.  Let us not accept this as a pattern or a model for the future.  It is very meagre.</P>
    <P>The Minister is retaining in this Bill the provisions of the 1944 Act whereby he must approve of the regulations made by local authorities in regard to scholarship schemes.  The Minister is retaining power to modify and alter such schemes in such manner as he thinks proper.  He is retaining power to refuse to approve of any scheme of scholarships or ancilliary regulations.</P>
    <P>I said a few moments ago that local authorities were, by and large, ill equipped to cater for this service. We have had one very striking illustration of that in recent years.  We are not extending the number of university scholarships available.  I do not know <Col N="1714" /> exactly how many there are in Dublin city because I have not got the data before me, but in a year's time the number will be at least double.  The situation, it would appear, will continue to prevail whereby some of my Protestant constituents will be unable to avail of Dublin Corporation university scholarships in the University of their choice.  I deplore that fact.  I believe that the State or a local authority has not the right to set itself up as the keeper of the conscience of any individual.  The Minister is well aware that the vast number of young Protestants leaving secondary schools here would wish to proceed to Trinity College, Dublin, to avail of a university education.  They are quite entitled to go there.  If they qualify for a university scholarship, it is a gross injustice to deprive them of taking up their scholarship in the university of their choice.</P>
    <P>It is as simple as that.  At present the regulations made by several local authorities, under these Acts we are now reviewing, including, I am ashamed to say, Dublin Corporation, will permit no one, not even a Protestant, to take up a scholarship in the university of his choice.  Insofar as the Minister has approved of these regulations and insofar as he has the right to insist on amendment of these regulations made by local authorities, he is condoning a breach of simple justice in relation to these people and I take him to task for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The best that can be said of this Bill is that it recognises the direction which our educational policy should take but that it timidly and haltingly looks at the road and says: &ldquo;We will travel just a portion of this road because it is too expensive to exploit it more than a very short distance.&rdquo;  That is the pity about this Bill, which is framed in a good outlook, against the background of a desire to make more progress in the educational field and which is obviously born of a recognition that the present scholarship standards throughout the country are so hopelessly inadequate that we ought to do something substantial in 1961 if our people are not to be left hopelessly <Col N="1715" /> behind in the race to equip young people adequately for the battle of life, which is becoming harder, tougher and sterner with every day and every month that passes.</P>
      <P>I do not think it will be seriously challenged that education provides the access and the key to greater skills, nor do I think it will be seriously challenged that education provides for intellectual development.  Without education you cannot have the key to higher skills and higher intellectual development.  If we accept these two contentions, it clearly follows that our failure to develop educational facilities for our people means we deliberately deny them by State policy access to higher skills and higher intellectual development.</P>
      <P>In this age, where the competitive spirit is greater than it ever has been, where we are now citizens of a common world, where space has been virtually annihilated and when we are on the eve of entering a gigantic Common Market in Europe, one would imagine we would recognise much more fundamentally than we are doing in this Bill the necessity for equipping our people so that in the Common Market, in this wider and more cohesive world in this highly competitive age, our people will not stand as second class citizens but will have access to the educational facilities other enlightened countries are providing for their people. Because we are poor in material resources, because we are numerically small, without the ability to make an impact or impression on the world by our physical or numerical strength, is all the more reason why we ought to recognise we are too backward educationally and too poor materially to economise on education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can do as the Swiss have done and make up for that in the educational field.  Better than anybody else in the world, the Swiss have been able to make up for their smallness numerically and physically and for the absence of raw materials.  They have been able to give skills to their people, not one of which is indigenous, in the production by the country of the raw materials necessary for the development <Col N="1716" /> of industry.  If you go to Switzerland and study the system of education there, you will find the whole impact of State policy is designed to make the Swiss one of the best educated people in the world.  Of course, it has succeeded. You do not find the Swiss emigrating to other countries to be the hewers of wood and drawers of water. You do not find them doing menial jobs in other countries.  You do not find them down other people's mines. You do not see them doing the kind of hod-hauling job our people very frequently have to take when they go away&mdash;the kind of job they have to take because of the absence of higher education which could for them be the passport to a better job and a better way of life.</P>
    <P>I have nothing but the best intentions towards the Minister.  I think he has the opportunity of making history for himself in this educational field, which, relatively, has not been scraped and certainly has not been exploited to anything like the extent of the educational facilities provided in other countries in Europe.  By every educational standard, we are behind the democratic countries of Europe from the point of view of the money spent and the facilities provided.  More and more they have come to recognise the value of education.  Now, since we are an outpost of Western Europe, facing the task of earning the means of our livelihood in the middle of the competitive heart of Europe itself we must do the same.</P>
    <P>This Bill does something.  It increases expenditure from £150,000 to about £300,000 four years hence.  That indicates that we are travelling in the right direction but not travelling far enough, and this Bill does not provide the Minister with the equipment necessary to expand the educational facilities available to us here.  We ought to accept the principle&mdash;if we are to make any progress at all&mdash;that every child with ability in the country should be entitled to secondary education.  There can be no answer to the morality of that claim.  Greater education is the key to greater skill and greater intellectual development.  I see no reason why we should not accept the principle that every child has a moral right <Col N="1717" /> to secondary education, that it is the function of the State to provide that education.  If we accept that, then more and more of our children will get the key to culture and skills and intellectual development and that cultural heritage inseparable from intellectual development.</P>
    <P>Here, we have never accepted secondary education as the right of every child and the result is that we have a hotch-potch scholarship scheme which, in 1961, has reached the puny figure of an expenditure of £150,000 per year. So far, with all our talk about nobility of ideals and virtues, secondary and university education are obtained only if you have a cheque book, a good bank balance.  I deny that a child's right to intellectual development should be governed by a cheque book; I deny that the right to a decent education should be governed by the fact that our children have access to the means of wealth and I definitely reject the idea that the child of, perhaps, poor parents must go through life with his mind blighted or half-developed, without access to skills or intellectual development, merely because of the poverty of the family and their inability to provide that access to education.</P>
    <P>Is it not time, in 1961, that we accept without equivocation the obligation to provide secondary education for all children and that it should not be the privilege of those who have access to the cheque book as a means of providing it?  Is it right that we should continue an educational system which because of our inability to provide money&mdash;while providing money for less virtuous activities&mdash;still denies access to universities to persons whose minds would be immensely enhanced, whose skill would be immensely developed for the benefit of the nation if they had the advantage of university education?</P>
    <P>One of the things that can be said to their credit&mdash;and it is time the western world learned of this&mdash;is that in all the countries where Communist influence reigns, whatever other mistakes they have made, they certainly have not made any mistake from the point of view of educational development. Every one of these countries, judged by international statistics, is <Col N="1718" /> building more and more universities; more and more of their citizens are being trained in the universities and more and more emphasis is put on going to universities and taking degrees in technical subjects, with the result that more and more of their people are coming out of universities and colleges better equipped, I am afraid; than the citizens of many western countries for the battle of life, better equipped for the technical progress associated with some of these countries.  If that can be done by the Communist countries, democratic Europe and this small island should not be behind in the race to give the people at least the facilities that are provided elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister would have made some sort of major breakthrough on this whole question of educational services and that even though it might take us some time to reach the pinnacle of a first-class educational service, nevertheless we should see the framework of what the future holds. I know of no better purpose on which we could all campaign together as a united House than on the provision of money for the education of our people. The value of providing them with a good education to work at home is incalculable and even if they emigrate, even if we cannot stop emigration, is it not better for them to arrive in another country having obtained a good secondary education here than to emigrate with the fragmentary knowledge they get if all their time is spent only at national schools and especially if they attend fairly irregularly during their period at such schools?</P>
    <P>Whether they stay at home or emigrate, Irish citizens ought to recognise that they cannot carry with them any lighter equipment than knowledge and education and light though it may be, it is still the best&mdash;in fact, the main&mdash;passport to regular employment at proper rates of pay.  It is because it means so much to us in that field at home and so much to our potential emigrants that we ought to spend more money on education, even if we have to prune services which might perhaps be more spectacular in one direction but which do not give us the enduring <Col N="1719" /> results that can be got if we fortify our people properly by access to standards of education which, I am afraid, will be insisted upon in the new world into which we are being precipitated and which will be sadly missed by our citizens if we try to live in that world ill-equipped compared with other occupants of it because we are not now taking the bold and vigorous steps that we ought to take in respect of educational facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that everybody, including the Minister, will subscribe to the principle that no boy or girl of ability should be prevented, by lack of means, from reaching the highest rung of the educational ladder attainable by his or her talents.  Most of us, I think, would go so far as to say that our children should be encouraged in every way towards a higher standard of education for their own benefit and the benefit of the country.  Viewed in that light, I am sure the Minister will not disagree, if I describe his Bill as a modest effort in the right direction.  I do not subscribe to the view put forward here today that we are in a position to tell every boy and girl in the country to get the best education they can and send the bill to the Minister.  That would be an ideal state of affairs, if it could be achieved.  In our present circumstances we must have some regard to the realities of the situation. An expenditure of £300,000, augmented by an expenditure of £250,000 from local authorities in four years' time, is not very substantial and the Minister would have been justified in going at least a little further in the scheme he has put before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this scheme and I hope that the Minister, or his successor, possibly, will find it possible in the not too distant future to build further on the foundation the Minister is laying. The time is not inopportune to have a look at the present set-up in education.  The Minister in introducing his Estimate this year gave certain statistics.  In round figures we have some 500,000 children attending primary schools, about 70,000 children who undergo post-primary education <Col N="1720" /> in either secondary or vocational schools, and at the top of the ladder we have the lucky ones&mdash;some might say the wealthy ones&mdash;who attend our universities. They number about 7,000 native-born Irish.  Of the 500,000 children who complete their primary education between 13 and 15, roughly one in seven gets an opportunity of post-primary education.  The bulk of those go on to secondary school.  About one in 70 has the advantage of a university education.  That would not encourage us to believe we are either educationally or technically equipped to face the difficulties which will confront us when the new European Community comes into being, and that might well be only a few years hence.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that the Minister's scheme of extended scholarships for secondary or other forms of post-primary education would be availed of by the boys or girls concerned in order to attend technical schools or technological colleges.  I have a feeling&mdash;I have expressed this view before&mdash;that there is a certain snobbishness attached to attending a secondary school and I expressed the hope a year or two ago that some means would be found to bring technical education into the general scheme of secondary education and that we would not have this distinction between a secondary school as such and what is generally described as &ldquo;the Tech&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say that all our young people should go to university. I do not believe that would be practicable.  I do not believe the vast bulk would benefit by university education. I should like to see a far greater number taking technical education.  I believe the progress, the economic well-being, the wealth and the happiness of a country depends fundamentally on those who are equipped technically and scientifically to expand the resources of the country.  It is a grand thing to have people with a classical education.  Such an education is essential.  I do not subscribe to the view that the only progress nowadays is technical progress and that there is too much classical education.  Education in the humanities always pays a dividend.  The best of all education for <Col N="1721" /> our young people ought to be a sound general secondary education.  In Irish industry to-day, a far higher standard is required as compared with some years ago.  I have some experience of Irish industry and I know that management now wants boys and girls with a technical school or secondary school education.  The chances for boys and girls with a primary education only are growing fewer and fewer.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the mechanics of the Minister's scheme.  I am not quite clear how it will work out in practice.  Perhaps the Minister will elucidate some points when he comes to reply.  As I understand it, in the first year the Minister will give £ for £ up to a maximum of 1d. in the rates.  Does that apply to existing schemes operated by local authorities or is this additional to those schemes? Limerick City Council operates a university and secondary school scholarship scheme.  They give three university scholarships at £200 each. I think that is the highest in the country.  They give ten post primary scholarships of £25 each, two of which are confined to girls.  In other words, they give £850 for the first year of the university or post primary course.  The figure multiplies as the course progresses.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's contribution is intended as a contribution towards current cost, it will mean that in Limerick we shall be reducing our contribution towards the university end of the scheme if we comply with the requirement that only one-third of the moneys available must be devoted to university scholarships and two-thirds to post primary scholarships. The Minister may say that because he would give only £ for £ up to a maximum of 1d. in the rates, the local authority is not precluded from giving more.  This appears to be a joint State-Local Authority effort and they should, therefore, be put on a basis of equality.  I should like the Minister to expand that aspect when he comes to reply.  He also says that not more than one-third of the moneys available may be devoted to university scholarships. What happens to the fraction? You have three scholarships.  What <Col N="1722" /> happens?  It is a small point, perhaps, but the Minister and his officials might give their attention to it.</P>
    <P>I have tried to estimate what this will mean with regard to the number of extra scholarships.  Taking the Limerick City Council scheme, we give £200 a year for a four or five year university course, or roughly £1,000 in all.  It would appear to me that something like 100 extra students should be able to avail of university education.  It is not a great increase, if my estimate is even roughly correct, in the present number of between 7,000 and 8,000 who are attending universities in this country.  On the basis of our scheme in Limerick, were we to give £25 Scholarships, it appears to me we would add another 2,000 children to the numbers already enjoying the benefits of secondary and technical education.  In numbers rather than in terms of money, the additional number of young people who will be able to avail of scholarships will be very small indeed.  Nevertheless, the scheme is indeed a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has considered, instead of reserving one quarter of the available money for scholarships without means tests, as an alternative raising the means test and not reserving one quarter of the funds as the scheme sets out.  The means test ceiling varies in every centre.  We in Limerick City Council raised it from £800 to £1,000.  I think it would be much better if there were a level ceiling of, say, £1,200 in the case of all local authorities and no exclusion on the question of means below that figure.  The money available would then give better value to the children applying for scholarships.</P>
    <P>In Limerick in particular, this scheme will be welcome as the Minister will appreciate from the number of contacts he has had in recent years with the sponsors of the proposal to have a constituent college of the National University in Limerick.  In view of that project, Limerick's share of the money available under this scheme will be but a small drop in the ocean in comparison with the proposal <Col N="1723" /> to have a college of the National University in Limerick.  In a centre of between 11,000 and 12,000 secondary school children, the provision of another half dozen university scholarships will make very little difference and I trust the Minister will not look upon this scheme as in any way a substitute for the need in Limerick and the whole country for a fourth university college.  I am aware that this is under active consideration by a Commission set up by the Minister, but in case he might think that the Limerick people or the people in the areas contiguous to it could be fobbed off with any scholarship scheme, I want to reiterate the case that the only answer for the growing primary and secondary school populations is the establishment of another country of the National University.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill the State is for the first time undertaking the responsibility of providing scholarships for our highly intelligent boys and girls.  The Bill is well thought out and carefully designed but it is no major development because of the very negligible sum provided.  The sum provided by the State is conditional on the local authorities providing a sum of almost similar proportion in their respective areas. In recent years, the tendency of the Government is to throw more and more responsibility on the local authorities.  Does the Minister realise how difficult these local bodies are finding it to make ends meet?  Does he realise that in certain borough and county council areas rates are already as high as 24/- in the £ and does he appreciate how determined the people are to resist any further impositions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scholarship scheme should be entirely a charge on the State in a country where we can give half a million pounds for television in special guarantees and loans and where we can provide millions for aeroplanes. Surely a fundamental matter like the education of our children should get priority.  For those reasons, I feel the Bill will not evoke any spectacular <Col N="1724" /> applause throughout the country because the people who pay the rates are those who will also provide the cash for the scholarships.  The double commitment for them will not be very enticing.  We must remember that thousands of our children will never have an opportunity of a secondary education, and while the scheme of scholarships already in existence may be effective in areas where the local authorities are conversant with the needs of the children in their respective areas, it is poor consolation to them that a very attractive scheme of scholarships operated by the Government will never be attainable for many of those children.</P>
    <P>This Bill would be ideal if we had a general system of secondary education for everybody in the State.  That situation is very far away.  We know of the secondary top, as it was called in earlier years, where the primary course was carried on and the intermediate examination was done in the national school.  That is disappearing rapidly because of the competition between the secondary schools throughout the country.  The parents feel a certain humiliation in keeping on their children in a school classified as secondary top, if there is already a full-blooded secondary school in the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal of snobbery in the country in relation to education because of the lack of integration and the failure to knit one system in with another.  We will have that so long as we have this lack of uniformity.  If the Department have £300,000 to throw away, I think it would be more fruitfully utilised by making some provision for the areas long lacking secondary education by way of supplying books for the secondary course which are now so costly for parents in limited circumstances.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the Minister that there is a great and growing demand for higher education &mdash; for secondary, vocational, and university education. That is all to the good but when we reflect on the fact that it is beyond many of our children ever to attain to that status we have to be very careful. The provision of a fundamentally <Col N="1725" /> sound system of education is vary desirable in the present age.  We see that greater and greater sums are provided annually for the education of the children of all other countries because the people there recognise that, in the competitive age in which we live, if they want their children to hold their own, the Government or whatever authority provides the money for education, must not be niggardly in making provision for the facilities these children need if they are to have a full education in the country of their adoption.</P>
    <P>One thing I do not like is the extraordinary competition between secondary schools and the vast sums spent on advertising results.  If these secondary schools would only devise a scheme of scholarships instead of advertising, much more would be accomplished. This advertising takes from the intrinsic worth of education and emphasises its commercial side.  It is a pity there is that development which does not do us any good and which causes disquiet in the minds of unfortunate parents who have neither the opportunity nor the facilities of having vocational or secondary education provided for their children.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill is well thought out and ingeniously designed, in our circumstances at the moment it is meagre in the provision it makes for scholarships. It is meagre particularly in the first few years and even in the eventual sum of £200,000.  However, we hope that small beginnings will lead to great achievements and now that the ice is broken, the Minister will go into deeper waters and sail our educational ship to brighter horizons than we see at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly at local authority level there has been a recognition of the necessity for an increase in both the number and value of scholarships made available.  In this Bill I notice the Minister is anxious to maintain the democratic principle in regard to local control so as to avoid inequality and injustice in relation to the best pupils in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder does this measure give us that?  Is this the type of measure which will ensure that the best pupils will be <Col N="1726" /> able by scholarships to reach the university?  Does even the scholarship system as it is now operated as between one local authority area and another give equality and bring to the top the best scholars in those areas?  The system as it is worked allows for a local arrangement in regard to a means test applied to the parents of pupils, and the examinations are then conducted on behalf of the local authorities.  Up to now, scholarship schemes were operated by the local authorities within their boundaries. Now the State steps in with the avowed object of increasing the number of scholarships and giving opportunities to the best in the State.  There is inequality in regard to the standard reached in the scholarship examinations. In one area, the marks given reach a certain percentage and in another area reach a different percentage, which indicates there is inequality of opportunity in those areas.</P>
    <P>There is a means test for the award of scholarships but there is, to my mind, another means test which applies within the scheme as it exists at the present time, that is, a means test as to the school from which the pupil comes.  Take the rural school at the present time.  Pupils in a one-teacher school or in a two-teacher school where the teacher is handling several classes are at a disadvantage when, at the end of the sixth standard course, they have to compete for scholarships on equal terms with the pupils of a school where there is a single teacher for a single class, where there is provision for a scholarship class and where, as I have mentioned previously in this House, there is a system of cramming which is aimed completely at the achievement of results in scholarship examinations.  In many small country schools there are students who would prove brilliant and more suitable for university education if they had the opportunity of reaching the university than those produced under the present system.  That is something to which the Minister should give some thought.</P>
    <P>There is an attempt now being made to make secondary education available to a larger number of children by the <Col N="1727" /> provision of secondary schools in the smaller towns and even in the villages. In the constituency I represent, there are quite a number of them and we are satisfied with the facilities for secondary education available to the children in those areas.  There again, however, the children are at a disadvantage in competing for university scholarships with the larger schools where more attention can be given to the preparation of pupils for university scholarships.  That raises doubts as to the equality of opportunity afforded, so as to make such scholarships available to the best pupils.</P>
    <P>That will present difficulties but it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility to make due provision in scholarship schemes for the type of school from which the pupil comes. There is grading of horses and dogs to allow them to compete in races.  Grading should apply in the case of scholarships.  I am thinking especially of rural schools and I suggest that they should get an opportunity of obtaining their fair share of scholarships.</P>
    <P>I presume that the mechanics of the scholarship scheme will be worked out between the Department and the local authorities.  In my county there has been a discussion at county council level and it was agreed that the present level of financial provision is too low.  In the case of scholarships to the university regard must be had to the university fees, the cost of accommodation, of examination fees and of books.  It should also be recognised that a university student requires a certain minimum provision to allow him to avail of the social activities which are an important feature of university life.</P>
    <P>The aim which we all desire to achieve is the provision of secondary education for everybody who wants to avail of it.  That is not feasible at the present time, because children living in rural areas have no opportunity of secondary education unless schools are provided for them.  When speaking on the Estimate for Education, I asked the Minister if he could devise a scheme which would assist people <Col N="1728" /> who are prepared to bring secondary education to the smaller centres of population.  Everybody knows that we cannot provide secondary education for the entire schoolgoing population but university graduates could be encouraged to establish schools in rural areas by giving them financial consideration and the necessary sympathy of the Department.  That is the only way by which the benefits of secondary education can be extended within a reasonable length of time.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of scholarships to technical schools and schools which give technological education.  There has been a good deal of discussion as to the problems which the Common Market creates for this country.  In Denmark folk schools were established based on the agricultural farms.  The Danes readily accepted the opportunity they provided to bring technical skill to industries based on the raw material of their land.  In the extension of scholarship facilities, we should make provision for a similar type of education here.  It would be well worth while to make a determined effort to extend the benefits of such technical education.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of the graduates of our universities leave the country. Many students at the universities know that when they graduate they will be faced with the problem of finding a job elsewhere.  We might with great benefit to the country as a whole attract students who have attained the Leaving Certificate into higher technical schools.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which recognises the need for increased scholarships, is very welcome. The financial provision has been criticised.  However, it is an attempt to move forward in the right direction.  I should like the Minister to inform us, when he is replying to the debate, whether he will have any powers to influence local authorities to increase their provision <i>vis-á-vis</i> the provision the State is prepared to make.  From the point of view of the provision of increased facilities for scholarships, I welcome the Bill but there is the defect in the scholarship system at the present time that there is <Col N="1729" /> no recognition of the type of school from which the pupil comes and there is a means test which often operates against the pupil with ability.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister if he can give any indication along those lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If ever there was a disappointing Bill, this surely is one.  The Minister expressed surprise in his opening speech that there was not more criticism of the meagre scholarship structure which has been in existence over the years.  Of course we know only too well that this Bill is introduced now because of the vehement criticism of the Fine Gael Party, over the past four years in particular.  This Bill is purely a sop to the electorate to indicate that Fianna Fáil are not unaware of the disgraceful neglect of education in this country.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that while this Bill is inadequate, it is better than nothing.  For that reason, it is deserving of some support.  Let me say that this Bill is merely the overture to the educational opera which the Fine Gael Government will produce before the end of the year.  While we are glad that a Minister, who is personally a pleasant person, is leading the overture, someone else will lead the educational orchestra in a very short time. Perhaps that is just as well.  The Minister must be embarrassed at introducing such a miserable pittance. It is an indication that he has not been able to get the better of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>That is a rather lame excuse for not scrapping altogether the old system under which the local authorities were asked to make a contribution, but that is not sufficient justification for the Bill in its present form.  The Minister suggests that his reason for retaining some responsibility to the local authorities is to preserve &ldquo;... a democratic principle, a principle which needs to be strengthened rather than perhaps weakened, and which, in such matters as this, if properly put into effect, can cater better for conditions in one locality relative to another than could an absolutely centralised adminstrative machine.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> That is very nice and well written, but it is rather remote from what should be done.  We know that many of the personnel of the local authorities have, through no fault of their own, a very low educational standard. It is a sorry reflection on our local government that that should be so, but nevertheless it is so.  Educationally, our local authorities are in the main of poor calibre, whether we like it or not.  I am not concerned about whether I am criticised personally for saying that.  It is a matter of fact with which any person of even average intelligence will agree.</P>
    <P>That being so, we are handing the educational rights of our children to a group, many of whom will be jealous of better educational opportunities being given to other people.  We are throwing what should be the birthright of all young people into competition with bins, garbage collections, street lights, and the hundred and one other services which local authorities are called on to perform.  We either believe in equality of opportunity for all children or we do not.  It seems to me that the Minister does not, if he throws what ought to be recognised as the right of a child to a decent education into competition with these material and very mundane things.</P>
    <P>This year we are told that the finances of the country are so happy that we can give relief to surtax payers, and various other financial reliefs to certain sections of the community which were not under any tremendous pressure.  We are asked to accept this miserable Bill as an earnest of the State's interest in education, although it is proposed in this Bill to provide only £50,000 extra to provide scholarships for those who need them most.  It is a very sorry reflection on this House that, at the end of a rather busy session, we are asked to give quick approval to this Bill.  If the Minister were really sincere, he would not attempt to confuse the educational issues by bringing in such a miserable Bill which will be used as an excuse to postpone any further improvements. It would have been better to leave things, bad and all as they are, for <Col N="1731" /> another 12 months and allow someone else the opportunity to bring in a Bill which would be of some value.</P>
    <P>I have one worry in connection with the scholarship scheme in general and so far as I have been able to ascertain, it is not proposed to make any improvement in that regard in the Bill.  There is in operation a system whereby greater grants and scholarships are given to parents whose children are attending boarding schools.  There are cases in which as much as £80 or £50 may be given to parents whose children are attending boarding schools.  If the parent takes the child away and sends him to the Local Christian Brothers, or the local day school, the scholarship is reduced by £5 or £10.  That is wrong and I believe it is unfair. The maintenance of a child is not very much diminished when he is fed at home rather than at a boarding school.  Most boarding schools are not run to make phenomenal profits. There is little ultimate profit in their charges.</P>
    <P>If the parent wants to keep the child at the local day school, the child has to be fed at home, and the parent is without the income which the child might bring in if he were working. The parent must provide him with the means of getting to and from school by train, bus or bicycle.  He must also be provided with the extra clothing needed to protect him against the weather as he goes to and from school.  I believe the authorities have not taken this simple matter into proper account.  I hope that in the future there will be less discrimination in respect of scholarships as between children attending boarding schools and children attending day schools.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to draw any odious comparisons between boarding schools and day schools, but again we must face the facts.  Many boarding schools are institutions which, of their nature, cultivate snobbery.  Most of our secondary day schools are run by Christian Brothers and if there is any social democracy in any institution in this country, it is in those institutions. <Col N="1732" /> I think it is unfair that those who choose to send their children to boarding schools should get extra assistance far beyond the extra burden of sending them to boarding schools.</P>
    <P>One effect this has had is to discourage parents from sending their children to perfectly efficient and suitable day schools.  While parents may have different opinions as to whether boarding schools or day schools are preferable, they should be allowed to exercise their judgment independently of any consideration relating to scholarships.  I should like, therefore, to see a smaller difference between the scholarships made available to boarding schools and day schools.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters relating to scholarships but I do not think it would be proper at this stage and on this miserable Bill to waste the time of the House.  This Bill increases to some extent the amount being made available for scholarships.  I suppose that is better than nothing.</P>
    <P>The whole educational system needs to be thoroughly revised.  We need to dovetail kindergarten, primary, secondary, vocational and university education into one comprehensive educational system which will be available to all children, irrespective of whether they were born with a silver, an iron, or a gold spoon in their mouths.  This Bill will put very few silver spoons into any mouths and it is going to ease the lot of very few parents.  I have not had the time to check on these figures but, as far as I can ascertain, the new Bill proportionally gives less assistance to young people today than did the 1929 Act.  That is to say that the numbers attending all schools today, at all levels, have increased to such an extent that this Bill helps a smaller proportion than did the Scholarship Act.  Therefore there is no reason why we should rejoice or compliment the Minister about it.  It is better than nothing and let us hope it will not be long before necessary legislation will be introduced to do away with all this scholarship system, which to my mind, while it is worthy and desirable at some levels, is to some extent the cause of children cramming for examinations.</P>

      <P>Last week we discussed the importance of agriculture at great length and in that respect education is a very important matter.  I wonder if the Minister overlooked the question of scholarships for agriculture when he was framing this Bill?  At least some of the money now being provided for scholarships should be ear-marked for agricultural scholarships. Agriculture being our main industry and our agricultural exports being our greatest exports, we should concentrate more on education for the young farmers. I would be very sorry indeed if the Minister did overlook that aspect because it is high time it got a leading place in education.  At present there are numerous university graduates with various degrees who cannot make a living in their own country, doctors, dentists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputies who have spoken from these benches, almost continually since the Minister introduced this measure, have pretty exhaustively dealt with our attitude to it.  It is a very important Bill and one that should not be launched upon this House under the circumstances under which it is now being examined, at a time when the House is concerned with the passing of the Estimates and at a time when, let us be candid about it, the minds of so many members are distracted with impending events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Impending disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for some, or for many possibly.  I shudder at the thought.  It is in these circumstances that the House is examining this measure which is long overdue and the need for which this Party has consistently drawn attention over the last three or four years.  We feel the content of the Bill is not up to what we <Col N="1735" /> require but we welcome any improvement in regard to easing the difficulties for those who have children who could, if given the opportunity, make their mark in life, if given assistance at the time in their career which would permit them to go on to better things. We all know that due to the drop in the value of money, and the fact that so many people, particularly those in the agricultural industry, have to educate their families, people whose incomes have diminished in recent years, and because of the increased cost of books, of transport, of education and the cost of living generally, it is becoming increasingly burdensome on parents to provide their children with the degree of education which they would desire.</P>
      <P>This measure will assist in a very small way but it is a pittance in relation to what would be required to deal effectively with the problem.  With regard to the method of levying the cost of these scholarships, as a member of a local authority and as one who would support, on any occasion, the voting of monies for the improvement of education, be it agricultural or the usual type of education, I have no doubt that the Minister will receive the utmost co-operation in the implementation of this Bill from all members of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I fear is that in the circumstances of a figure of rates now being levied at some £2,000,000 in excess of what it was five years ago, in the circumstances of similar levies being imposed on ratepayers by other Ministers in relation to other Acts of this House, this measure will not be examined in the fair and dispassionate manner it merits.  It will unfortunately be associated with such impositions on the ratepayers throughout the country as the operations of the Health Act, methods of levying for road maintenance, and so on and so forth.  I fear this will be compared with them.  If it stood on its own merits and was presented to the local authorities in the circumstances of a rate level of some five or six years' ago then it would be easier to secure the co-operation necessary to implement the consequences of the enactment <Col N="1736" /> of this Bill.  Even with those difficulties, the situation is so grievous that we shall succeed in getting at local authority level the measure of co-operation essential to implement the provisions of this measure.</P>
    <P>There is one defect, again, in the apportionment of the levy on the local authorities.  In the areas where it would be of benefit to the pupils and their parents, the product of a levy on rates would be much lower than in the parts of the country where the parents need not have recourse to scholarships.  In that way, there is inequity.  The product of a rate levy in parts of the country where the provisions of this Bill would be more beneficial will be very much less than that yielded by the levy of a similar amount on the wealtheir and higher-rated parts of the country.</P>
    <P>If there were no alternative to this system, we would gladly accept it.  I should merely be repeating what those before me have said if I were to express all my views on this measure.  I think they have been adequately voiced by my colleagues.  The measure is overdue.  It is inadequate.  It has been launced upon the House at a time when possibly it will not get the consideration it merits.  The absence of any supporting voice from the Government benches is a conclusive proof of my point that this is not the time at which such an important measure should be presented.</P>
    <P>There were months during which this House sat when we were not distracted by the examination of Estimates.  Now, when the House has gone beyond its normal adjournment time, it is an unfortunate time to present the Bill.  Notwithstanding the high regard in which the Minister is held by all members of the House, it will be very hard to avoid the charge that the timing of the Bill can be associated only with the preparation of election addresses for the forthcoming general election.  The only other explanation is that the Minister has very strongly been influenced by the fact that the provision of adequate scholarships was mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition some time ago and has been supported quite <Col N="1737" /> strongly by people prominent in the sphere of education.  If those considerations guided the Minister and the Government then we in Fine Gael have done a good day's work to bring the necessity for improved scholarships so forcefully before the public that the Government have been forced to react to it.  It is unfortunate that the Bill cannot be examined at a time of the year when many more Deputies, even on the Government benches, might have something concrete to add to what the Minister said in his opening statement.</P>

      <P>I think I said myself that this Bill is only a step.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that it is just a breaking of the ice.  At the same time I am very glad the ice has finally been broken and that it has been broken by a Fianna Fáil Government.  I hope the breaking of the ice will be the major part of the big effort required to shape public opinion and the opinion of people in public life towards adequate expenditure on education in this country.</P>
      <P>I do not think much in the Bill can be wrong.  It must have some political significance when so many people from the opposite side try to snatch little pieces of glory from it for themselves and dampen down the merits of it at the same time.  The first attempt was on the part of Deputy Lindsay who started on a &ldquo;We said it first&rdquo; theme. He said that Deputy Dillon said first that more scholarships are required. Then some other Deputy said that he and another Deputy put down a motion in this House about it and that they said it first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not concerned about saying things.  We did it.  We produced a scholarship extension scheme.  We provided for the money for that scheme.  If anybody wants credit for saying it they can claim it.  However, <Col N="1738" /> the Taoiseach announced in this House two years ago that he foresaw, within the lifetime of this Dáil, an extension of the scholarship schemes.  I think that was before any person made pronouncement upon it.</P>
    <P>If certain people want to claim credit for saying things, they can claim credit for saying things.  However, Fianna Fáil have provided a scholarship scheme and provided the money for it. Life is simple enough for Deputy Ryan. He has only to come here and say he is against what is being done, that it is bad because it is being done by this Government and that if his Party come to power they will do much better.  He lightened the atmosphere by giving some imagery of this being an overture with Fine Gael opera coming later.  It was rather entertaining to think of the casting of the characters in the comic opera which he foresaw.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan was not around in the lifetime of the last Government, as far as I remember.  I would remind him that, before the taking over in 1957 by the Fianna Fáil Government, it was not a question of providing a scholarship scheme or a better scholarship scheme. The problem was whether they would be able to pay the teachers.  The problem was to provide money for building schools.  There was real difficulty in providing money at all. One group of teachers agreed not to force their claim for increased salaries until the finances of the country could be put right again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy was interested to know whether the funds would be in two separate groups, one referring to the Universities Act and the other to the main Act.  I visualise one main fund in each local authority area.  With regard to the money produced by the local authorities at the moment, I do not visualise any local authority cutting back on that. The problem was to permit a local authority to extend the number of scholarships in the first year and to carry on that extended expenditure in the second year and then extend it still further so that we would have a four years build up.  In other words, while the local authority may still raise the money they are raising at the moment, the State's contribution in the first year will be related to the money the local authority raises by the imposition of 1d. on the rates.  It will be pound for pound on that.  In the second year, it will be still pound for pound.  For every 2d. on the rate, there will be a one pound per pound relationship.  In the third year the State contribution will be one and a half to one and in the fourth year it will be the same thing.  The aim will be a five to four ratio between state and local contribution, making one fund which will be divided into two-thirds for post-primary education and one-third for university education roughly.  The local <Col N="1740" /> authority will provide their schemes first and the schemes will come to be sanctioned by the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The fact that the State is providing money will give the Minister a certain influence over the nature of the schemes provided.  Some Deputy asked if we could not influence the local authorities to spend more.  I am sure that the one and a half to one State contribution on the product of the 3rd and 4th penny of rates will be an incentive to local authorities to raise amounts above the 2d. on the rates. Almost all except a few are raising that 2d. already.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of providing for the poor counties, one Deputy wailed quite a bit about the poor children in the poor counties.  He mentioned a number of counties.  The fact is that the poor counties, especially those he mentioned, are at the moment providing best for these poor children. They are not the offenders in regard to the question of providing adequate scholarships.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne mentioned a matter in respect of which I should like Deputies to use their influence.  He referred to the provision of scholarships and mentioned people on local bodies who feel they are there to prevent any impositions on the rates.  I thought I covered the matter when I was introducing this Bill when I spoke about the schizophrenia which exists where you have all sorts of people saying that there should be more scholarships and better facilities but when it comes to paying for them think that there should be some Santa Claus who should supply the money.  I think the Deputy was very helpful and I hope other Deputies on local authorities will be instrumental in persuading the local authorities to take full advantage of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also welcomed the fact that one-fourth of the monies would be spent on scholarships to be awarded without reference to the means of the parents of the children concerned.  At any level where you have a means test, there will be children who will just be excluded. If you have very able children at that barely excluded level, there will <Col N="1741" /> be a real loss to the country.  Allowing one-fourth of the money to be spent on merit scholarships will ensure that at whatever level the means test is set, the able students near that level will have an opportunity of getting post-primary or university education.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wycherley asked for scholarships to agriculture.  These post-primary scholarships will be available in vocational schools and also in secondary schools where agricultural science is taught.  The Department of Agriculture provides scholarships through its own Vote.  One of the faculties in the universities to which these scholarships are available will be the Faculty of Agriculture so that in no way could a person consider that agriculture is being overlooked.</P>
    <P>Time and again, I have tried to give a clear picture of the numbers going on to post-primary education.  Again to-day, Deputy Russell worked on a base-line of 500,000 children in the national schools and 77,000 in the secondary schools.  He worked on these as a proportion, one of the other.  The children in primary schools are there from the age of four or five to 14.  They may continue in &ldquo;secondary tops&rdquo; up to 18 years of age, so you are comparing the number of pupils from four to 18 years of age with the number in the group from 12 to 18 years of age.  That is not a fair comparison.</P>
    <P>If you want to get an estimate of the proportion of children getting post-primary education, the base-line to take is the age group 14 to 16 years. You then work out the numbers getting post-primary education in that age group in proportion to the number of children in the age group.  If that is done, it will be seen that there is a very much better proportion in the numbers getting post-primary education and university education than the Deputy seems to think.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms of the Bill was that not enough money was being spent.  Apart from the earlier consideration, on which I differed with Deputy Mulcahy, I should like to point out there has been other expenditure on education during the life of this Government.  The national school building programme was doubled.</P>

I hope that once the ice is broken, as the Deputy himself put it, we shall be able to spend more on education and get more results from our spending.  I am sure all Deputies will agree you cannot spend more money if you have not got more money.  The reason we are able to spend more money is because there has been good management for the past four years.</P>

      <P>The Minister must understand he cannot have it now.  Perhaps I would be in order in helping the Minister to understand that?  We are anxious to facilitate the business of the House in any possible way, particularly under the circumstances in which we are working, but there are things too important to go ahead with without understanding them.  We should not consider approaching the Committee Stage without the Minister having an opportunity of considering some of the realities of the situation.</P>
      <P>I did not want to discuss Section 4 in detail until we got an understanding as to how the fund would lie.  In relation to that question, I should like the Minister to consider two areas. Take, first, Limerick.  Limerick city provides for secondary scholarships and scholarships to secondary schools £1,350 a year and for university scholarships £1,800 a year.  That is, they provide annually £3,150 for scholarships such as those contemplated in this Bill.  How much are they going to get in the first year under this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

I do not think Deputies understand that under this measure, which proposes to move towards all these things, Limerick city can go on spending £3,150, but next year they will get £709 under this Bill and the following year £709.</P>

      <P>I have cited Limerick.  Now take South Tipperary, which spends £2,500 a year on secondary and technical scholarships and £6,600 on university scholarships, a total of over £9,100.

      <P>Tairgim go léifí an Bille Athuair anois.  Is fada siar a théann stair an Churraigh.  Bhain na tailte ann, comh maith leis na tailte mórthimpeall air, le mainistir Thomascourt ar dtúis, ach nuair a díothaíodh na mainistreaca in Éirinn, tháinig na tailte sin go léir i seilbh Gall.  In a dhiadh sin roinneadh na tailte timpeall an Churraigh ar daoine éagsúla, agus tugadh cearta féaraigh ar an gCurrach dóibh san.</P>
      <P>Leis na cianta anuas do husáideach An Currach mar ionad rásaíochta agus traenála capall.  I dtosach na 19ú aoise bunaíodh campa sealadach ann agus sa bhliain 1858 tógadh campa buan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Um an dtaca san, níor léir cad iad na cearta féaraigh a bhí i bhfeidhm, nó cad iad na tailte gur bhain siad leo, agus ba mhinic achrann i dtaobh na <Col N="1746" /> ceiste.  Chun an scéal a chur ina cheart, ritheadh dhá Acht &mdash; Acht Churrach Chill Dara 1868 agus Acht Churrach Chill Dara, 1870.</P>
    <P>Faoin Acht 1868 roinneadh an Currach i dtrí codanna mar atá:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Na &ldquo;Tailte Donna&rdquo; (575 acra) i.e. ionad an Champa Mhíleata &mdash; níl aon cearta féaraigh i bhfeidhm ar an limistéar seo.</P>
    <P>(2) Na &ldquo;Tailte Gorma&rdquo; (463 acra) mar a bhfuil cearta féaraigh i bhfeidhm agus mar is ceadaithe freacnaimh mhíleata mar aon le raon-chleachtais a chur ar siúl.</P>
    <P>(3) Na &ldquo;Tailte Glasa&rdquo; (3,832 acra) an fuighleach &mdash; an limistéar is mó agus an príomh-ionad inír.  Tá cearta áirithe ag an Turf Club ar chuid den limistéar seo i gcóir rásaíochta capall agus ina theannta sin is ceadaithe an áit d'úsáid i gcóir cúrsaí míleata áirithe &mdash; mar shampla, léirbhreithniú agus druilleanna.</P>
    <P>Le himeacht aimsire do cuireadh leis na Tailte Donna agus baineadh dá réir de na Tailte Glasa.  Fé Alt a 11 den Acht 1868 cuireadh beagnach 100 acra de na Tailte Glasa leis na Tailte Donna.  Níos deánaí anuas b'éigean 60 acra sa bhreis de na Tailte Glasa a iamh le haghaidh riachtanaisí míleata. Tá an limistéar seo dá thógaint isteach ins na Tailte Donna mar aon le limistéar beag eile de 40 acra chun teora na dTailte nDonn a dhíriú.</P>
    <P>Faoin Military Lands Provisional Orders Confirmation Act 1898 fuarthas cearta raon&mdash;chleachtais ar limistéar de 352 acra de na Tailte Glasa.  Tá an limistéar seo ins na Tailte Gorma don Acht nua.  Faoin Acht 1868 ceapadh triúr coimisinéirí chun ceist na gcearta éagsúla a réiteach.  Thug na coimisinéirí a mbreith i 1869 agus deimhníodh an bhreith san Acht 1870.</P>
    <P>Is léir ó chomhairle dlí a tugadh ó am go ham go bhfuil na hAchtanna 1868 agus 1870 i léig go forleitheadúil chomh fada is a bhaineann siad le riarú an Churraigh ó 1922 i leith.  'Sé an príomh-aidhm atá leis an mBille seo ná an scéal sin a leigheas gan laghdú a dhéanamh ar na cearta éagsúla a bhí i bhfeidhm roimh 1922.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> Tá an chumhacht a iarrtar in Alt a 11 chun cuid de thailte an Churraigh a iamh ar cheann de na cumhachtaí is tábhachtaí san mBille.  Is cúis imní le fada dos na hUdaráis Rásaíochta an lot atá dá dhéanamh ar an limistéar rásaíochta tré innilt na gcaorach air. Cheapadar go bhféadfaí an fhadhb a réiteach ach an limistéar a leasú.  Ach is é a tháinig dá bhárr ná gur mhóide an tarraingt a bhí ag an gcuid sin den talamh a leasaíodh ar an caoirig.</P>
    <P>I dtuairim na nUdarás Rásaíochta is é an cúrsa is éifeachtúla chun an scéal a chur in a cheart ná an limistéar rásaíochta a iamh agus tá beartaithe acu socrú a dhéanamh leis an oiread féaránach is gá, go dtabharfar suas dóthain cearta féaraigh chun é sin a chur i gcrích.  Tá súil acu go mbeidh an méid sin déanta agus gach ullmhúcán críochnaithe roimh Derby an Churraigh an bhliain seo chugainn, rás a bheidh, mar is eol do theachtaí, ar cheann des na rásanna is luachmhaire san Eoraip.</P>
    <P>The Curragh of Kildare with its adjoining lands formed part of the Abbey or Monastery of Thomascourt, near Dublin and as such came into the hands of the British Crown on the dissolution of the monastic institutions in Ireland.  After the dissolution, certain of the lands surrounding the Curragh were granted and in those grants there was included a right of commonage over &ldquo;the great Common called the Curragh of Kildare&rdquo;.  The present rights of pasturing sheep on the Curragh derive from those grants.</P>
    <P>For centuries past &mdash; I am told that there is a record dated 800 A.D. &mdash; the Curragh has been used as an open space for the training and racing of horses.  In the early part of the 19th century, a temporary military camp was established on the Curragh and in 1858 a permanent military camp was built.</P>
    <P>Trouble apparently arose at that stage between the graziers, the racing and training people and the British military and moreover there was considerable doubt and confusion as to what rights in fact existed, who were the holders and to what lands did the rights appertain.  In an endeavour to <Col N="1748" /> define the position and to reconcile the overlapping and often conflicting interests, two Statutes were passed &mdash; The Curragh of Kildare Acts, 1868 and 1870.</P>
    <P>The 1868 Act divided the Curragh into three parts, which were defined on a map deposited at the time with the Clerk of the Peace for County Kildare.  The three divisions were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) The Brown Lands, i.e. the site of the military encampment, over which grazing rights were suspended.</P>
    <P>(2) The Blue Lands or Rifle Ground being an area to the south and south-east of the Camp which could be used for musketry and rifle practice and other military exercises while remaining subject to the rights of common grazing.</P>
    <P>(3) The Green Lands, representing the balance, to be used primarily for the grazing of sheep, and in part by the Irish Turf Club for horse racing and training, but to be available also, though to a more limited extent than the Blue Lands for military purposes including &ldquo;Reviews, Drills and (in cases of emergency) temporary encampment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The total area of the Curraigh is approximately 4,870 acres and in accordance with the 1868 Act it was divided as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Under the Military Lands Provisional Orders Confirmation Act, 1898, right of firing over and right of user for rifle practice, etc., of an area of 352 acres of the Green Lands were acquired.  This area is regarded as Blue Lands for the purpose of the new Act.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the 1868 Act gave power to take in and add to the Brown Lands any portion of the Green Lands not exceeding in the whole 100 acres and pursuant to that power somewhat less than the permitted 100 acres has been incorporated into the Brown Lands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> In recent years, it became necessary to enclose areas of the Green Lands&mdash; totalling about 60 acres &mdash; for military purposes and, with a view to squaring-off the boundaries of the Camp area a further 40 acres are now being added to the Brown Lands.

    <P>The 1868 Act provided for the appointment of a Ranger and Deputy Ranger to administer the Curragh but placed the Camp Area in the control of the British Secretary of State for War for as long as it might continue to be required for military purposes. The Act also provided for the constitution of three Commissioners to ascertain&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) What (if any) rights of common of pasture, rights of way or other rights (except the rights of the Crown and public rights of way) exist in, over, or affecting the Curragh, or any part thereof, either by grant, charter, or prescription;</P>
    <P>(b) to what persons, and for what terms, estates, or interests, the rights aforesaid respectively belong;</P>
    <P>(c) What (if any) are the lands in respect of which the rights aforesaid respectively are exerciseable;</P>
    <P>(d) what (if any) compensation should be given to any party whose rights are or may be injuriously affected by the Act;</P>
    <P>(e) what (if any) public right of way exists in, over, or affecting the Curragh or any part thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Curragh Commissioners made their award in 1869 and it is embodied in and confirmed by the 1870 Act. The award, among other things, set forth that the Curragh should not be grazed by any animals except sheep: it listed the persons whose claims to rights of common of pasture were allowed; and it set out the number of sheep which each such person was entitled to graze.  Many claims were disallowed or allowed only in part.</P>
    <P>The law officers have from time to <Col N="1750" /> time expressed the view that the earlier Curragh Acts have been largely obsolete since 1922 and the present Bill is designed to remedy that position while at the same time preserving the various rights in respect of the Curragh which existed prior to 1922.</P>
    <P>One of the most important provisions in the Bill is that dealing with inclosure (Sect. 11).  In this connection the Racing Authorities have been concerned for a considerable time over the impairment of race tracks and training gallops due to the sheep grazing; as a consequence of which owners and trainers have been reluctant to run valuable horses at the Curragh. Efforts by the Turf Club to remedy the position by the application of fertilisers have not been successful because the resultant improvement in the pasture has simply made the area concerned more attractive to the sheep, and the Racing Authorities have urged that inclosure of the racecourse area is the only solution.  They have undertaken to secure the surrender of a number of sheep-grazing rights commensurate with the area sought to be enclosed (about 850 acres) on the basis of approximately two grazing rights to the acre and they hope to have this done as a matter of urgency so that they may prepare the race track for the 1962 Irish Derby which, as Deputies will be aware, is expected to be the best endowed horse race in Europe.</P>
    <P>Taking the Bill section by section: Section 1 is the usual &ldquo;definitions&rdquo; section.  Section 2 vests in the Minister for Defence the parts of the Curragh not already so vested.  In 1957 the Camp area was vested by Deed of Conveyance in the Minister for Defence by whom that area is administered but the Blue Lands and Green Lands are still vested in the Minister for Finance and administered on his behalf by the Commissioners of Public Works.  Two of the Commissioners fill the offices of &ldquo;Ranger&rdquo; and &ldquo;Deputy Ranger&rdquo; for the purposes of the old Acts.  Following the vesting now proposed the administration of the entire Curragh will be a function of the Minister for Defence.  The Minister's <Col N="1751" /> ownership will be subject to existing leases, tenancies, etc., and to the rights of way, rights of common of pasture and other rights specified in the 1870 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a re-enactment, in modern terms, and with minor adjustments, of the part of the 1868 Act governing the use of the Camp area for military purposes.  Similarly, Section 4 specifies, in modern terms, the uses which the Minister may make of the Blue Lands for military purposes. The powers of the Minister under Section 34(1) of the Defence Act, 1954, are limited by this section inasmuch as the erection of permanent buildings on the Blue Lands is prohibited.  This limitation derives from the fact that the right of common of pasture extends over the Blue Lands.  Section 34(1) of the Defence Act, 1954, provides that the Minister for Defence may use any land vested in or occupied by him for such purposes connected with his powers and duties under that Act and in such manner as he thinks proper.</P>
    <P>Section 5 prescribes the uses which the Minister may make from time to time of the Green Lands.  The Green Lands are the main sheep grazing area and while, as I have already stated, the 1868 Act gave the British Secretary of State for War some rights over these lands, his powers in regard to them were much more limited than in the case of either the Camp or the Blue Lands.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the lodging of copies of the new &ldquo;deposited map&rdquo; in the Central Office of the High Court and in the local Circuit Court Office, where they will be open for inspection by the public.  It also deals with the purchase of copies of the map referred to.</P>
    <P>I propose to move on the Committee Stage an amendment to subsection 4 of this section to secure the deletion of the words &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister&rdquo;, as I feel that such approval should not be necessary. Section 7 enables sewers, drains, cables, pipes, etc., to be laid as necessary on or under the Curragh and also deals with their maintenance.  The corresponding section of the 1868 Act, which was <Col N="1752" /> confined to sewers and drains serving the Camp is being broadened in scope in order to meet present-day requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 8 enables the Minister to remove or permit the removal of gravel, clay, turf, etc., from the Curragh as occasion demands.  Section 9 exempts the county roads on the Curragh from the operation of this Bill save in the matter of vesting (Section 2), the power to close the county road through the Camp in any emergency (Section 3) and the power to lay sewers, cables, pipes, etc. (Section 7).</P>
    <P>Section 10 acknowledges and preserves the rights of common of sheep grazing over the Blue Lands and Green Lands making it clear that those rights do not extend to the Camp or to other parts of the Curragh leased or let for special purposes.  Examples of the latter are the site of the racecourse stand and paddock, the Drogheda Memorial Hospital, the sheep-dipping station at Ballymany and some houses, stables, gardens; etc., which do not in the aggregate occupy a significant proportion of the Curragh area.</P>
    <P>Section 11 which, as I have said, is one of the most important sections of the Bill enables a part or parts of the Curragh to be enclosed and fenced to the exclusion of sheep but the exercise of this power is made contingent on the prior voluntary surrender and extinguishment of grazing rights commensurate with the area proposed to be enclosed.  At present the number of sheep (7,957) for which rights exist is somewhat less than twice the number of acres available for grazing in common.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the publication of notice in the Press of intention to inclose, specifying the area concerned and the date from which the inclosure will operate.  I propose to move an amendment to this section on the Committee Stage providing for the deletion of the words &ldquo;the Minister proposes&rdquo; and the insertion in lieu thereof of the words &ldquo;it is proposed&rdquo;. The purpose of this amendment is to bring the section into line with subsection (1) of Section 11.</P>
    <P>Section 13 enables the Minister to exclude or authorise the exclusion, <Col N="1753" /> temporarily, of sheep from parts of the Curragh while race-meetings, carnivals, exhibitions, competitions or other such functions are being held. Section 14 preserves existing contracts, agreements, leases, tenancies, etc. Similarly Section 15 provides for the continuation of legal proceedings which may be pending.</P>
    <P>Section 16 enables the Minister to make bye-laws in relation to the Curragh and provides for penalties in respect of breaches.  It may seem to Deputies that the maximum penalty proposed (£20) is rather heavy for breach of a bye-law but experience has shown that the existing maximum of £5 prescribed in the original 1868 Act bye-laws is quite inadequate as a deterrent against unauthorised grazing. The existing bye-laws will continue in force until new ones can be made.</P>
    <P>Section 17 repeals the 1868 Act completely and Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the 1870 Act.  The other sections of the 1870 Act are retained in order to keep in force the award scheduled to that Act, which constitutes a statutory record of the grazing rights.  Section 18 is the usual expenses section and Section 19 is simply the short Title.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We, of course, accept this Bill but there are certain things in relation to it that require a little clarification.  The Minister said that the lands had been conveyed to the Minister for Defence by a conveyance in 1957.  I am not quite clear by whom they were conveyed.  That is of importance because, as far as I can see, there is nothing in the Bill to give to the Turf Club, or to the racing authorities, any rights in respect of any part that may be inclosed except the right to exclude sheep from pasturing. The right of sheep to pasture is, of course, a statutory right under the Acts of 1868 and 1870.  It is not much advantage to the Turf Club, however, to be enabled to keep sheep off the pasture, unless they are also properly empowered to keep trespassers of other kinds off the gallops as well.  It is important, therefore, to know exactly how the conveyance of 1957 vested the complete ownership of <Col N="1754" /> the whole Curragh lands in the Minister for Defence so that the Minister will have the right to make a lease, or otherwise, in relation to these lands.</P>
      <P>As stated by the Minister, Section 11 is the important provision in the Bill.  The remaining provisions are merely tidying up and are, with one exception to which I shall refer in a moment, merely modernising, so to speak, old legislation.  The additional area the Minister is taking into the Brown Lands of the Curragh is not of any great consequence, though I think it is about 18 to 20 acres and with the 99 acres already taken in under the Act of 1868, it does not make a very large difference.</P>
      <P>It does occur to me, looking at the map that has been deposited, that certain things have been done in relation to the Blue and the Green Lands on the Curragh in years past for which there was no statutory right or permission and I think all Governments have been guilty of breaches in that regard. The planting that has been done on the Curragh on the Green Lands was not authorised by the old Acts and, I think, was probably in breach of the provisions of those Acts.  Be all that as it may, the amount that is being taken off the Brown Lands on the Army Encampment to provide access to the sewage farm does not seriously affect the rights of grazing on the Curragh.</P>
      <P>So far as permission to inclose is concerned&mdash;this is included in Section 11 &mdash; I think it desirable that there should be something more definite in relation to inclosures.  The section is purely one which enables the Minister to make an Order and leaves him in the position in which he is the sole judge of what grazing rights should be extinguished in respect of the lands being inclosed.  Would it not be more satisfactory to lay it down as a matter of statute, keeping to the basis in the old Acts that two sheep claims should be extinguished for every acre inclosed? I think a specific and definite statutory provision would be better than the somewhat vague one in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither am I very clear in relation to Section 13 about temporary inclosure. <Col N="1755" /> Is that to apply only to the holding of events in or around the camp or is it intended to give permission to lay out a car park outside the area that will be inclosed on a race meeting day such as the race of next year?  That temporary right could, in certain circumstances, have a very considerable affect on the grazing and I think the owners of those rights are entitled to some assurance in that respect.  We can deal with it in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is also the question, which must be answered by the Minister most categorically either now or on Committee Stage, of the pretty serious controversy that has arisen on the Curragh in the past couple of years since the Commissioner for Valuation, for the first time since 1870, returned the grazing rights on the Curragh.  The grazing rights were returned on a basis per sheep claim and while the Commissioner of Valuation did make that assessment, there was, on the other hand, a certain suggestion, which has been rejected so far, that instead of dealing with it on that basis, it could be dealt with on a basis of the valuation of the whole land of the Curragh being divided among the sheep claims rather than that the individual claims be valued.</P>
    <P>If a certain part of the Curragh is inclosed and if certain claims are extinguished and if the valuation is struck by reference to the total of the proportion divided, then the valuation on the remaining claim owners will be very much higher than at present. I am perfectly certain that the view of the Valuation Office is that it is the individual claims that must be valued, but I happen to know that there was a suggestion made by another party interested in the valuation from the point of view of the rates that that was the wrong basis.  I think we must therefore get the basis clearly established once and for all.</P>
    <P>The second thing to do, if part of the Curragh is enclosed, is to ensure that the part so inclosed is valued in the ordinary way and the valuation attributed to the occupier &mdash; the Minister or anybody else&mdash;so that the valuation <Col N="1756" /> formerly on the claims will be extinguished.  There is some anxiety in that respect and I would ask the Minister specifically to allay that anxiety.</P>
    <P>In relation to Section 16, there is a general practice that when bye-laws include penalties, as this one does, such bye-laws are laid on the Table of the House.  It has grown up over the years that where a bye-law does include a penalty, it is a matter of course that the members of either House have the right to negative the effect of such bye-law or the penalty arising from it by resolution of either House in the ordinary standard form to which we are accustomed.</P>
    <P>The Curragh, as the Minister rightly said, has been long known for racing and it is a matter for congratulation on all sides that the Irish Hospitals Trust have been so outstanding in their generosity and in their enterprise in sponsoring the Derby race next year which, as the Minister said, will probably be the richest race in the world. Everybody will join in helping to do anything necessary to ensure that that race will be the greatest success it can be made and in so far as the matter is brought forward now for the purpose of getting it settled at an early date, I can assure the Minister of the full co-operation of this Party.</P>
    <P>Apart from the inclosure of the racecourse itself, there is the question in relation to the gallops.  It is clear that the Minister has in mind in certain circumstances gallops other than those on the racecourse itself which might be inclosed.  Such inclosures would have to be made in such a way that the free passage of sheep to and from other parts of the Curragh would not be affected.  The Minister in bringing this Bill to the House, no matter how laudable may be the purpose of Section 11, has missed a very great opportunity. We are all doing our best to see that agricultural production is increased and it is a tragedy that a bad advertisement in regard to State lands should exist along the main road to the west and south-west for everybody driving on that road to see.  It is not generally realised by the people who do pass from other counties how bad the land of the Curragh is.  Some of <Col N="1757" /> it is extraordinarily bad land and very difficult to improve, but no matter how bad it may be, the disfiguration and the bad advertisement given by the amount of gorse and furze all over the place is, in my view, something that needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the improvement of the lands in the Curragh is not something that would in any way affect the training of racehorses or the gallops for that training.  I know certain people who tried to make the suggestion before the last general election that when I set up a committee for the purpose of seeing how the land on the Curragh could be improved, what I was trying to do was to prevent racehorses being trained on it.  Of course that was a complete fabrication.  The Curragh as it is at present is capable of some improvement and there is a national duty on all of us and particularly on a Minister of State to try to ensure that any land over which he has rights will contribute the maximum to the national pool and, secondly, that it will not act as a source of disedification to anyone who goes through the Curragh. I hope therefore the Minister now that the Curragh is being vested in him will ensure that something is done at least to eliminate the existing bad advertisement.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister can tell us what has been done by the committee set up by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture in connection with the improvement of the Curragh lands, an improvement that would be for the benefit of all who are involved in the Curragh, sheep owners, race-horse trainers and the very large number of people employed throughout mid-Kildare by those associated with the horsebreeding and horse-racing industry.  While the horsebreeding industry is not itself directly connected with the Curragh which we are discussing here, there is no doubt whatever that the propinquity of the headquarters of Irish racing does have some effect in grouping stud farms in the vicinity of the plain.  The amount of employment being given by that is considerable.  So far as horse breeding <Col N="1758" /> is concerned, there is quite a substantial export trade for us and we could say that racing is the shop window of horse breeding.  Section 11 of this Bill, while being fair to sheep owners on the one hand, will also ensure that the racing on the Green Lands there can be extended and improved and we hope that by doing that this year, it will mean that next year's race will be a great success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that steps are being taken to unify the administration of the Curragh.  The present system of divided control between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Defence is altogether too cumbersome.  The Curragh is a most important property in the economic life of County Kildare.  It holds a unique position in the country; in fact it contains our principal military establishment, the headquarters of the racing industry, while at the same time being subject to the rights of common of pasture.  It does not need any words of mine to convey the importance of the racing industry to the country to our exports and the amount of employment given in our county.  It is a considerable asset and anything that can be done to comply with the wishes of the Turf Club in connection with next year's big race should be done.</P>
      <P>Over the years since the passing of the earlier Acts of 1868 and 1870, the character of the lands of the Curragh has changed, those lands referred to as the Brown Lands, the Green Lands and the Blue Lands.  In this measure, the Green Lands will be further reduced but at the same time grazing rights are preserved.  However, while the amount of land per sheep may seem adequate, it is very doubtful if there is an adequacy of pasture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Sweetman has pointed out, there has been criticism of the fact that no efforts have been made to maintain or improve the fertility of the land.  I agree with him that parts of those lands are so bad as to be almost useless.  It seems that in regard to the fertility of the grass lands of the Curragh, what is everybody's business is nobody's business.  The State, not having the responsibility of maintaining the fertility of the land, does <Col N="1759" /> nothing about it and the sheep owners, I suppose, are not free from blame either, because throughout the years they have been satisfied to take the land as it was and have made no effort to improve its fertility.  While it is a fact that the State does not get any revenue from the grazing, it is only right that the State should prepare a scheme that will not alone maintain but improve the fertility of the land.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is the important provision in the Bill where the right of inclosure is taken.  To take the right of inclosure where you also have right of common of pasture is, I suppose, a very important step and one that might not be looked upon with approval by some of the claim holders on the Curragh. The safeguard in the section as to the manner in which the rights are to be acquired seems to me to be reasonable.  Paragraph (b) of subsection (3) of Section 11 says:</P>
    <P>A right of common of pasture shall not be extinguished, altered or modified under this subsection without the consent of the person to whom the right belongs.</P>
    <P>That is reasonable and will ensure that the rights can be acquired only where the person to whom the right belongs consents.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have another look at Section 8 before the Committee Stage.  I understand the corresponding section in the 1868 Act limited the purposes for which sand, gravel and similar substances might be removed to the maintenance of roads and other purposes connected with the camp.  In the Bill there is no such limitation and I would ask the Minister to have a look at the section again to keep it in line with the provisions of the 1868 Act.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Bill is enacted the Minister will look to the matter on which I spoke earlier, that is, the fertility of these lands and, if it is not possible for him under existing legislation to do anything about the fertility of these lands, I would urge upon him, if necessary, to introduce legislation to deal with that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the main <Col N="1760" /> purpose of introducing this Bill is to enable the Minister to have the lands vested in him, and at the same time, to put into operation Section 11 which enables him to inclose parts of the Curragh which are now comprised in the Green Lands.  As I understand the position from the Minister's speech, he proposes, in agreement with the Turf Club, to inclose about 850 acres of land over which there are sheep rights at the present time, the sheep rights being two sheep to an acre of land, and that the Minister hopes that these rights will be acquired, presumably by the Turf Club, and extinguished by the Turf Club in order to enable these inclosed lands to be brought into use or to be used in some particular way in connection with next year's Derby.</P>
      <P>Mathematically, that looks all right in as much as if there will be 850 acres left for common grazing at the Curragh Camp there will be also 1,700 sheep fewer to graze there and the balance is available for grazing sheep on the basis of the old calculation of two sheep to an acre but I should like to find out from the Minister what exactly is the purpose of inclosing this large area of Green Lands.  Under the Bill, the Minister can have it fenced or he can fence it himself.  On the assumption that it is fenced, what is it proposed to do with the lands that are fenced and which will be immediately contiguous to what is known as the outside portion of the Curragh racecourse?  Eight hundred and fifty acres is a large area. Is it to be used for gallops, for training horses or in what way will it be used in association with the future use of the Curragh as a racecourse or will it be used in any specialised way in connection with the Derby of 1962? I should like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that from time immemorial that side of the Curragh Camp has been utilised by soldiers, their wives and their children as a place of vantage from which to see races on the Curragh.  On a race day at the Curragh Camp one can see the soldiers, their wives and families moving from <Col N="1761" /> the military encampment across the field into the Green Lands and going up to the railings and watching the horse racing there.  Are the rails to be fenced off in future and are those people who have been trekking towards what is called the outside of the race course not in future to be able to get to the outside rail as they have done since horse racing started there or may we take it that, even if the lands are fenced off, somehow or another arrangements will be made to allow those local people, with whom I am particularly concerned, to gain access to that portion of the racecourse in such a way as not to deprive them of what they have come to recognise as a right of way?</P>
    <P>The Minister should clear up that point.  I do not think a situation should be created in which soldiers, their wives and families and local people who cannot afford to go into a reserved enclosure should be denied an opportunity to watch the races from outside from the vantage point which they have come to recognise as their special privilege by long usage over hundreds of years.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have spoken about the renovation of the lands at the Curragh.  If one wanted to visualise land to which the description of derelict and neglected could be applied one would finish with something like the Curragh Camp.  That is what the Curragh Camp looks like.  Many parts are completely overrun with gorse and furze which spreads over a larger portion each year.  Nothing seems to be done to stop the advance of the gorse, furze and fern which appears to grow at random.  Judging by the progress it makes annually, one would think it was a kindly-tended plant.  It continues to make this horrible progress all over the place.  Tourists and our own people travelling on the main road would get the impression that that was the way land is used in Ireland.  I venture to say one would travel all of Europe and not find a spectacle such as the Curragh Camp. Steps should be taken to get rid of the furze and scrub that has been allowed to thrive on the Curragh Camp as if it were a sacred plant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1762" /> The condition of the lands is equally appalling.  Sheep are not very difficult to please in their diet when they graze on some parts of the Curragh Camp. It is obvious from the matted, tough condition of the grass that these are sheep-sick lands.  No effort has been made to put back nutriment into the soil and year after year the lands present the same neglected appearance.  I know, of course, that divided responsibility has not made for better or more efficient administration, and the fact that there are rights there which are pretty difficult things to invade also causes certain kinds of difficulty in getting, perhaps, the necessary co-operation, but something should be done in the way of getting rid of the scrub timber on the land and at the same time, fertilising the land so that it will give a better return than the sheepowners are getting from sheep-sick land today.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what the position is likely to be in respect of acquisition by the Turf Club or the Minister of these sheep grazing rights.  I take it that only such portions of the Curragh as are covered by rights will be inclosed.  In other words, you will inclose only such portions as you have rights to cover.  Is it intended that the Turf Club should get those rights from the trainers?  Is it hoped that that transaction will be completed in time to allow the land to be used for whatever purpose in connection with the 1962 Derby?</P>
    <P>While I am on that point, I should like to pay tribute to the Hospitals Trust for their magnificent generosity in specially endowing the Derby of 1962.  That already has had the effect of calling attention to the fact that there is a very live racing industry in Ireland.  It will help further to publicise our valuable bloodstock industry, and I hope that between now and the time the race is held, the publicity which will be beamed on the value of the race, thanks to the Hospitals Trust will serve to popularise the Irish market as a place where people can get reliable bloodstock which can hold its own with the best available in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose a Deputy <Col N="1763" /> from outside Kildare may appear to some extent to be an intruder in speaking on this Bill, but as one who visits the Curragh at periodic intermittent intervals, I suppose I can say a word on it.</P>
      <P>I believe this Bill is designed to achieve a twofold objective.  One is to enable unified control to be exercised by a Minister or a single Department, in contrast with the dual control which has existed.  At any rate, as the Minister said, since 1922, the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance both have had responsibility for certain aspects of the administration of the Curragh.  The second objective is to preserve the existing rights, and particularly the rights of common pasturage in respect of the Curragh, while at the same time enabling the Minister to issue a licence to the racing authorities which will ensure that, if necessary, an extended portion of the Curragh may be inclosed for the purpose of enabling the land and the grass there to be properly treated with a view to making it fit to race on in a particularly dry year.</P>
      <P>Attention has been directed to the fact that the state of fertility of the Curragh is not up to the standard to which it should be.  That is undoubtedly true even to the casual observer, but it is also true that in order to bring it to the state of fertility, it may be necessary to enclose portions of the Curragh for quite a period.  If the Curragh is to be treated as I believe it should, it will undoubtedly mean that because it will have to be done on some sort of strip basis, or portions at a time, certain restrictions on grazing will be required for limited periods, which I believe will be in the general interests of the graziers concerned.  Fertility will be raised but some restrictions will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been said, next year the Irish Sweepstakes Derby will be one of the largest, if not the most valuable race in Europe.  It is expected that runners from other countries as well as this country will compete.  In order to maintain the very high reputation <Col N="1764" /> of Irish bloodstock, which is of great value to the national economy, and which provides employment dispersed over a wide rural area, it is necessary to ensure that the premier flat racecourse of the country will measure up to the very highest standards.</P>
    <P>The racing authorities have had the right in respect of a certain area to fence it off and control it.  As I understand it, the proposal is to extend that area and to ensure that no matter what the conditions are&mdash;if the year is a particularly dry one&mdash;sufficient coverage will be provided to enable horses to race in proper conditions.  On the other hand, if, as has happened, we have a wet year, it is an advantage to have an alternative track.  Indeed, on occasion, part of the Curragh track has been fenced off.  In recent years we have had the experience of an extremely wet year being followed by a very dry year.</P>
    <P>Quite recently, there was criticism in racing and sporting papers, and indeed criticism by some of the most eminent writers on horse racing, of conditions elsewhere.  Attention was directed to the need for watering and other facilities.  The Curragh racecourse enjoys an extremely high reputation. Arrangements are being made, as a result of the very generous contribution being made by the Hospitals Trust, for next year's race.  I hope the proposals envisaged in this Bill can be implemented speedily enough to enable full advantage to be taken of the opportunity which presents itself and the necessary arrangements to be made.</P>
    <P>This matter has been the subject of consideration in the Office of Public Works for some considerable time.  I know from personal experience that the Racing Board discussed the matter with the Commissioners of Public Works at least 18 months ago when the project was first considered.  Since then, this legislation has been drafted. I feel that tribute should be paid to the officials of the Office of Public Works, and to the draftsman, for the work that has gone into the preparation of this legislation which was not exactly easy.  It has been found possible to frame a measure which <Col N="1765" /> unifies the control and places it under the care of the Minister for Defence and, at the same time, maintains existing sheep rights on the Curragh.</P>
    <P>In considering the very great contribution which this newly endowed race will provide, it is appropriate that a tribute should be paid to the work of the Racing Board and particularly to the work of Mr. Joseph McGrath who is sponsoring this effort. They have made a very great contribution to Irish racing and breeding. The reputation which this country enjoys is one which everybody values. Any contribution which the State can make, either directly or indirectly, is one which will reflect credit not only on those concerned but will in turn mean economic benefits for County Kildare and the rest of the country, particularly in view of the world-wide publicity which has been focussed on the race in recent times and indeed on the remarkable quality of Irish bloodstock.  The fact that this measure has been introduced is a contribution towards the maintenance of that high standard in the future.  I hope it will be possible to make arrangements which will preserve existing rights and at the same time enable steps to be taken to ensure the success of the Curragh race next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with the appreciative remarks made by Deputies on the action of the Irish Hospitals' Trust in so generously endowing next year's Irish Derby.  As Deputies said, the racecourse is the shop window of the bloodstock industry.  There is no doubt that a classic race of international significance should do a considerable amount to improve the already high opinion in which the Irish horse is held throughout every part of the world where good horses are appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that this Bill which will facilitate the holding of that race, is of importance.  The Curragh, as the headquarters of Irish racing, is very important to the whole bloodstock industry and it is impossible to assess the contribution which the Curragh <Col N="1766" /> itself makes to the breeding of horses in every part of the country.  It is a very important industry and it earns a very considerable amount through exports.</P>
    <P>There were a number of points raised by Deputies.  The principal point mentioned by everybody who spoke was the desirability of raising the fertility of the Curragh.  There can be no doubt that the present standard of fertility of the Curragh is very low, as Deputies said, and that it could be raised.  The committee, to which Deputy Sweetman referred, has been studying this matter and I understand that a draft report on the problem is actually ready but that the passing of this Bill may affect it and accordingly it has been held over until the Bill will be enacted.</P>
    <P>Deputies will understand that the problem of improving the fertility of the land at the Curragh is a complex one.  As Deputy Sweetman knows, the terms of reference of the committee were to produce a scheme by which that could be done without ultimate cost to the Exchequer.  Deputy Cosgrave mentioned some of the difficulties that would arise in raising the fertility of the Curragh and that it would probably be necessary to inclose temporarily certain portions of it in rotation. However, I do not want to anticipate the report of this committee as it is obviously a complex question but I hope that it will be possible to tackle it.  It will, of course, be a long term procedure.</P>

      <P>I can promise Deputies to give the matter urgent attention as soon as the committee's report is available.  Deputy Sweetman raised the question of the conveyance to the Minister for Defence in 1957.  I do not know whether he appreciates that that was a conveyance of the camp area only, that is the Brown <Col N="1767" /> Lands, from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No; prior to that it was all vested in the Minister for Finance.  The question of the free access that has been available to local people or anybody who attended the races on the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; of the enclosure is one which I will take up with the Racing Board, but my understanding is that the intention is to erect fences which will exclude sheep but will not interfere with the view of the racecourse. It will be an open type railing. However, I am not in a position to say anything definite.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister hope to be able to give us some information on the Committee Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think I will. The question of the putting into operation of the provisions of Section 11, that is the actual fencing off of the racecourse, will, of course, depend upon the speed with which the Turf Club are able to acquire the necessary grazing rights which will have to be extinguished. Deputy Norton asked why it was necessary to enclose the course. The reason of course, which I gave in my opening remarks&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave also referred to it&mdash;is that for some considerable time the Turf Club have been worried about the state of the race track due to the persistent grazing of it.  The sheep have largely denuded it of adequate covering.  The application of fertilisers to it did not help the problem because it only attracted more sheep to the fertilised area and the area was left as bare as ever.  The only solution to the problem appears to be to have the area enclosed so that sheep can be excluded from grazing on it.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that it is the individual claims which will be rated by the Valuation Office but I am not in a position to say what exactly will happen. The initiative in this matter of rating these claims came from the Kildare County Council in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I think they hope to be able to acquire sufficient of these rights from different people and to have them extinguished in time.  Some of the people surrendering rights may be trainers while others may not.  They were originally people who had land in the vicinity of the Curragh.  I suppose a number of those people would be interested in the welfare of the bloodstock industry.  There probably will be a considerable amount of goodwill.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a second time.</P>
      <P>The Insurance Act, 1953, which this Bill proposes to amend, provides that, for the purpose of encouraging exports, the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may make arrangements for giving guarantees in connection with the export, manufacture, treatment or distribution of goods or the rendering of services.  Under the Act of 1953 the aggregate amount of the liability, at any time, of the Minister for Industry and Commerce for principal moneys may not exceed £2 million.  The purpose of the Bill, which is now before the House, is to raise the statutory limit of £2 million provided for in the Act of 1953 to £5 million in order to provide for the growing demand for political risks insurance cover under the Act as a result of the increase in the volume of exports.</P>
      <P>The aggregate potential liability of the Minister under political risks insurance policies in force at 31st March, 1961 was over £1½ million. Having regard to the increasing demand for insurance cover under the Act, it is probable that the limit of £2 million will be reached in the near future and it is necessary to raise this limit.  I think that the new limit of £5 million is, in the circumstances, a suitable figure.  The aggregate potential liability would, of course, become an actual liability only if all the risks covered by the insurance policies materialised.  As Deputies will, no doubt, appreciate this is an entirely remote contingency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Bill will facilitate the expansion of our exports by making possible the continuance on an increasing scale of insurance cover for exporters against certain risks. These risks, which are inseparable <Col N="1770" /> from the export trade, are of a type that cannot normally be covered by insurance or otherwise guarded against by commercial means.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal in the Bill will find general approval.  There are just one or two matters which I should like to put to the Minister. Is it proposed to take steps to procure the establishment of a limited company to carry on the business of re-insuring assurance business provided for in Part VI of the Insurance Act, 1936? The requirements in respect of Part VI have, I understand, never been complied with.  Is it proposed to establish a company to carry on that business?</P>
      <P>Can the Minister say what sums have already been paid in respect of liabilities which fell to be met under the existing limit?  As I understood it, he said a sum of £1,500,000 was the sum insured.  Can the Minister say, if the actual figure is available, what has had to be paid and also if there has been any increase in insurance premiums for this type of risk?  I do not know if there has been any change in this type of business but, if so, perhaps the Minister would be able to give the information we require.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the State guarantees for a ceiling up to £2,000,000.  It is now proposed to extend the ceiling to £5,000,000.  I gathered from what he said our liability extends to about £1,500,000.  Would the Minister say whether he would be able to meet any claim in respect of a political risk since the scheme was introduced and, if so, what was the amount of the claim and in respect of what area was the <Col N="1771" /> liability incurred?  Could the Minister give us an indication as to the areas mainly covered by this risk.  Could the Minister give us an indication of the far-flung character of the insurance?  Could he give a picture of the areas mainly covered by the cover which the State is providing for the insurance company?</P>
      <P>I should like to ask a third question on the lines of the question asked by Deputy Cosgrave.  Is any consideration being given to the question of the State itself setting up an organisation, a State-sponsored body, which would carry this risk itself on the basis of insurance upon the exporters or of integrating this type of insurance company here, the capital of which is almost entirely State-owned, or is it the intention to allow them to proceed as at present, the State taking the risks and the insurance company taking the premiums?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the establishment of a limited liability company under the Act mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave is concerned, I do not think that is proper to this Bill, but as the Deputy is aware there is an amendment of the Insurance Act of 1936 being prepared at the moment.  I cannot say offhand whether it is proposed to establish a limited liability company under the amending Bill, but I shall have regard to that fact, if it is my responsibility, when the Bill is being prepared in its final form before coming before the House.  The premiums have not been increased.  They have been maintained at the same level.</P>
      <P>I think I was not completely correct in answering Deputy Kyne.  The premiums are paid by the traders to the private insurance companies but are in turn refunded to the Minister. I think that that would take care of Deputy Norton's point.  In effect, the State is getting the premiums, if there is any profit, but, on the other hand, the insurance companies are doing the administration.  I think it is a satisfactory arrangement.  They carry of course, the other risks involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1772" /> So far as the liability that has accrued is concerned, there have been two cases.  I dealt with one myself.  I authorised the payment of the sum insured. It was in respect of, as far as I can recollect roughly £20,000 covering the export of beef to the United States.  Because of certain administrative technicalities, the beef was not acceptable in the United States.  Therefore, I considered that, under the circumstances, it was a political risk that ought to be borne by the moneys available under the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>How did the Minister classify that as a political risk?  Everything would be political at that rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot remember all the details now.  I mentioned £20,000.  The £20,000 covered two cases.  It was brought before me in the usual way at the Departmental conference.  We discussed the matter and decided that in the particular circumstances it was covered.  I cannot give the Deputy all the considerations that led me to the conclusion I came to.  It was some time ago but I can assure the Deputy that the Act is administered in the spirit in which it was passed here.  There was no suggestion whatever of trying to squeeze a claim in under the Act.  There was an objective examination and a decision come to that it was a risk to be covered under the Act.  These are all the points that were raised and all I can answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to enable increased funds to be made available to Bord Fáilte Éireann for the development of the tourist traffic industry.  At present, the amount of the annual grant is limited to £500,000, <Col N="1774" /> from which the Board have to meet the cost of overseas publicity and advertising, as well as other activities such as the financing of hotel staff training schemes, the promotion of conferences and congresses, the improvement of angling and other sporting amenities, the carrying out of improvement works at holiday resorts, road signposting, the provision of access to national monuments and other places of public interest, the development of the native souvenir industry and the payment of grants to meet interest charges on loans for hotel and resort development.  The Board have represented that valuable results would be likely to accrue if the rate of expenditure were to be accelerated for a limited period of time.  The Bill provides, therefore, that, instead of the present maximum annual grant of £500,000, the Board may receive grants not exceeding in the aggregate £5,000,000.  In my view, this global sum should meet the Board's requirements for a minimum period of seven years commencing with the present financial year.</P>
    <P>The marked expansion in international travel which developed after the last War has been well maintained. Intra-European traffic is increasing at the rate of about 10 per cent per annum, and American traffic to Europe is expanding at very nearly the same rate.  It is estimated that last year more than 800,000 American visitors came to Europe and that by next year the figure will have reached one million. The growing tendency towards longer paid holidays for workers, the increase in individual incomes and the favourable economic conditions which exist in many countries provide grounds for the expectation that the tourist traffic industry will continue to expand for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by visitors to this country makes a very valuable contribution to our balance of payments. Last year, for example, visitors to Ireland spent £42.4 million, almost 50 per cent. more than in 1953 and 30 per cent. more than in 1957.  There is no doubt that this income is capable of being substantially increased.  Our share of the American traffic to Europe has increased from six per cent. to 10 per cent. within the past 10 or <Col N="1775" /> 12 years, but I am satisfied that, if more advertising and promotion were undertaken in North America, the proportion could be increased to 20 per cent.  Our proximity to Britain and the freedom of travel between the two countries place us in a very favourable position to attract more tourists from that source.  At present, out of 30,000,000 British people who take a holiday away from their home each year, only about 300,000, or one per cent., come to Ireland.  If, instead of one per cent., we could attract two or perhaps three per cent, the effect on our tourist earnings would be electrifying.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are satisfied that, if we are to achieve a substantial expansion in tourist traffic, it will be necessary to intensify our overseas promotion and publicity.  The increased competition between countries for this traffic and the rising costs of advertising indicate the need to spend more money on promotion, both in the British and the United States market.  The Board hope to open new tourist offices in those countries and to engage in more effective promotional activity.  This will entail increased expenditure on printed publicity and films and on the sponsoring of visits to Ireland by foreign journalists and writers whose published articles can provide good propaganda for Irish tourism.  Good results have already been achieved by Bord Fáilte as a result of promotional efforts undertaken in certain limited fields such as coach tours and angling holidays, and the Board believe that an increase in general tourist promotion and publicity abroad would bring significant results.</P>
    <P>Efforts to attract increased tourist traffic must be accompanied by commensurate efforts to improve the standard of amenities for the reception of visitors.  As Deputies are aware, generous grants are already being provided towards the cost of the extension and improvement of hotel accommodation and the development of major tourist resorts.  There are, however, many other development activities the tempo of which must be increased. These include the provision of schemes <Col N="1776" /> for the training of hotel staff, the development of angling and other sporting attractions, the signposting of roads and the provision of easier access to beaches, rivers, lakes, scenic views and other places of special interest to tourists.  It is obviously desirable that development schemes of this kind should be carried out as quickly as possible.  Because of insufficiency of funds, however, the present rate of progress is too slow.  The new arrangements proposed under this Bill for the financing of the Board's activities will enable a faster rate of progress to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of provisions dealing with the guaranteeing of loans for the expansion and improvement of holiday accommodation and the development of tourist resorts.  The power to give guarantees in respect of loans was originally limited by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, to a period of 5 years, but this was extended to 10 years by the Act of 1957.  The 10-year period will expire in July, 1962, and, as the scheme is operating satisfactorily and constitutes a valuable incentive to private enterprise to undertake hotel and resort development, I am proposing that the power to give guarantees should be extended for a further 5 years, that is, until July, 1967.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1952 imposed a limit of £3,000,000 on the aggregate amount of loans which may be guaranteed.  The total amount so far guaranteed, or recommended to me by Bord Fáilte for guarantee, is approximately £2,500,000 and as there is a definite possibility that the limit of £3,000,000 may be reached within the next year or two, I am proposing a new limit of £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>Grants are payable by Bord Fáilte to meet interest charges on guaranteed loans arising during the first five years of the repayment period.  Interest grants are also payable in respect of loans raised otherwise than under Ministerial guarantee for the construction and improvement of holiday accommodation.  There is at present a statutory limit of £75,000 on the aggregate amount of such grants which may be paid by Bord Fáilte in any <Col N="1777" /> financial year.  As a result of the various incentive schemes which have been introduced for hotels in recent years, many new development projects have been put in hands which may involve the Board in interest grant commitments in excess of the statutory limit.  I am, accordingly, proposing that the limit be removed.</P>
    <P>In promoting this Bill which envisages increased expenditure by Bord Fáilte, I am conscious of the fact that Government expenditure on the promotion of the tourist traffic industry has been running at a rate which is not inconsiderable in relation to our economic resources.  I should like to emphasize, however, that I am envisaging under this Bill an increase in expenditure on tourism which will be confined to a limited period of time.  The view of Bord Fáilte is that an accelerated rate of promotional and development activity during the next number of years will be likely to result in a substantial expansion of the tourist traffic industry, and the proposals contained in the Bill have been prepared on that basis. I hope that the Bill will make an important contribution to the development of the tourist industry over the next few years, and I recommend it for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always held the view that the tourist industry is one of the most valuable which the country possesses and that indeed for a comparatively small expenditure, taken in a national way, the advantages which accrue from it to the country are considerable.  It is satisfactory to note that last year the income from visitors to this country increased, that, according to the Minister, it was 50 per cent. more than it was in 1953 and 30 per cent. more than in 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, however, well to recall that the OEEC, which compiles reports from the tourist committee, concluded an examination for the years 1955 to 1958.  While these figures are not probably strictly comparable in every way, at any rate the OEEC basis of assessment is offered on the understanding that they are to a great <Col N="1778" /> extent compiled on a comparable basis for each country.  It is significant to note that, of a number of countries that increased tourist income between 1955 and 1958, the figures show that Ireland increased by 12 per cent., Britain by 25 per cent., West Germany by 64 per cent., France by 30 per cent., Switzerland by 5 per cent., Italy by 48 per cent., and Austria by 103 per cent. In the case of Switzerland it seems the obvious explanation for the small increase in income from tourism is that the industry is so highly developed there that the possibility of further increases is not as great as it is elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I think it is of significance that during that period, with the exception of Switzerland, the growth in respect of the increase in tourist income for this country is half that of the lowest increase, which was in the case of Britain less than half in the case of France and substantially less than West Germany, Austria and Italy, so that we have very considerable leeway to make up.</P>
    <P>While considerable work has been done and, as the Minister remarked, the expenditure on the basis of our resources which Bord Fáilte is able to undertake is considerable, I often wonder if we get adequate value in return.  Is any assessment made, or is it possible to make any, of the value secured by the promotional efforts of Bord Fáilte?  One would imagine from the figures given that a great many of these tourists would come here in any case, irrespective of what efforts were made either by private concerns or Bord Fáilte or a combination of both.  It is remarkable that only 300,000, or one per cent., of the total number of British people who take a holiday come to this country.  It is all the more remarkable when we consider that there must be now over 1,000,000 Irish-born people resident in Britain.  Five or six years ago, our London Embassy then estimated that there were over 750,000 people of Irish birth resident in Britain.  Since then, the number has increased and if we take into account the number of people of Irish extraction in Britain, we have a very <Col N="1779" /> considerable potential to exploit.  It is a reasonable contention that of the 300,000 visitors from Britain who come here, a high proportion are Irish people coming to visit their families.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we have also the prospect of more tourists from the United States.  I hold the view that while this country is known in the United States, it is not known to anything like the extent to which it should be known and the fact that there is now as President of the United States a person with Irish antecedents and entirely of Irish extraction affords an opportunity for exploiting the publicity potential in that regard and we should take full advantage of it.</P>
    <P>As regards attracting promotional people here with a view to securing articles by journalists about this country, while nobody can control the type of article these people may write, so far as writers brought here by Bord Fáilte or under other promotional auspices are concerned, we should endeavour to secure that favourable comment will be made on this country. Quite a number of the writers who visit the country afterwards write in a vein in which we are held up as funny people and Ireland as a place where many of the amenities expected in modern tourist resorts are not available. We do not expect that people will write other than what they believe but certainly some articles in tourist magazines and so on have not been objective.  We should make it clear that if writers are invited to come here under any auspices, if we play the game with them in bringing them here, we expect them to do likewise with us.</P>
    <P>The value of congresses has been discussed before.  One of the most useful promotional activities is the encouragement of congresses here. Whether a congress is held in Dublin or in another part of the country, it is valuable.  It brings to a particular locality&mdash;I have seen this particularly in small places such as my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire&mdash;as well as the many visitors who attend, persons of considerable eminence in their <Col N="1780" /> own spheres.  Consequently, they are interested in the work of the congress and are impressed by the arrangements and facilities for the congress.  Invariably, I think, they take back with them from this country a good impression because of the satisfactory arrangements.  There is the added advantage that sometimes congresses of world-wide significance are held here and bring to the country persons of great eminence in a profession or trade or whatever is the subject of the conference.  In some cases congresses are held in localities other than the capital and also they can be held other than at the peak season and probably in certain cases in the off season or at the end or beginning of the peak holiday season.  This is, therefore, a way of extending the holiday season for the resort in question.  In that way, we have a direct method of extending the holiday season and at the same time, we have the advantages which flow from the holding of these congresses.</P>
    <P>Very important work is being done in many parts of the country in resort development under facilities provided and it has been the subject of favourable comment in many quarters.  The development of tourist resorts, building of pier promenades, as well as parks, and the provision of whatever facilities are necessary at such places are of considerable benefit.  Similarly, grants for hotel accommodation have been availed of to an increasing extent. I believe sufficient attention is not being paid to the ordinary hotels. In recent times, an emphasis on luxury hotels has crept into the approach to this matter and this conjures up pictures of most elaborate hotels in which only very wealthy people can stay.  I believe that unfortunate impression has not been created by the Department or Bord Fáilte but has crept into descriptions because if a thing is big, it generally makes news.  On the other hand, the vast majority of visitors coming here are people of average income, just as the great majority of our own holiday-makers, whether they holiday at home or abroad, are persons of average means.  They are not attracted by the emphasis on luxury accommodation.  The improvement in hotel accommodation over the <Col N="1781" /> years has been very remarkable.  Not only has the accommodation improved but the standard of catering and amenities generally has also improved.</P>
    <P>The scheme for training hotel employees is one which should be encouraged. I am glad to note that under the provisions of the Bill further encouragement by way of financial assistance will be given.  The work of the vocational schools in conjunction with the school at Shannon, and elsewhere, has proved of great benefit. Tourists nowadays naturally expect to have proper standards provided.  In order to provide such standards trained personnel is essential.  It is, therefore, important to ensure that proper training facilities are provided.  The scheme in operation is one which merits extension and encouragement because it provides employment ultimately for our people and offers opportunitities to an ever-increasing number of young people of getting employment in their own country in a way of life where training equips them to get the very best they can out of it.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which inhibits to some extent further expansion and improvement where hotel accommodation is concerned.  If hotels avail of the facilities provided they are liable to have their valuations increased.  The tax remission granted is certainly an incentive but the increased valuation is a deterrent.  I think this matter should be the subject of serious consideration in any further legislation of this kind.  Development of the tourist trade affords an opportunity for considerable expansion.  I should be glad to know if the Minister is satisfied that a sufficient return is secured for the expenditure on promotional activities. It is never possible, of course, fully to assess what benefits may flow from particular promotional efforts.  Some of the most valuable promotional efforts here have been entirely fortuitous and have come from efforts made by individual undertakings rather than from State or local authority direction.</P>
    <P>Mention was made earlier today of the proposed valuable race next year at the Curragh.  That has received <Col N="1782" /> world-wide publicity.  Last weekend we had the Hospitals Trust Golf Competition at Woodbrook.  These efforts attract attention on an unprecedented scale as compared with efforts made in the past.  They bring to the country sportsmen of international repute. Efforts of this kind deserve the best thanks not only of the House but of the country as a whole for the success which has attended them as well as for the direct and indirect benefits which flow from them to the advantage of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has had some difficulty in connection with loans for hoteliers&mdash;loans which are so freely spoken about here as being so readily available to those anxious to improve their accommodation to cater for visitors&mdash;I would suggest to the Minister that this money is not so readily available as he would give us to understand in his opening statement.  I have in mind a hotel in my own constituency which took advantage of the loan and grant given by Bord Fáilte.  The proprietors improved the bedroom accommodation considerably.  Anticipating expense up to a certain amount, they sought a modest sum.  It was given freely by Bord Fáilte.  However, as a result of the improved bedroom accommodation, they found in the following season that the diningroom accommodation was inadequate.  Regular loan repayments had been made. Despite that, they could not get an additional loan to extend the diningroom accommodation and their last position is now worse than their first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand it is the policy of Bord Fáilte not to make a second loan available until the first loan is fully paid off.  Would the Minister say if that is the situation?  If it is the situation, would he take steps to have the regulation changed?  I presume there is some regulation.  The present position is a hindrance because genuine hoteliers are handicapped through not having the necessary capital themselves. They have to work very slowly towards achieving the desired standard&mdash;the standard it is the Minister's aim to achieve and the standard, indeed, which it is the aim of the hoteliers to achieve. In the case to which I refer the benefit <Col N="1783" /> of the first loan is being largely lost, because of the delay in providing adequate diningroom accommodation. Lack of diningroom accommodation can be a source of annoyance and grievance to tourists.</P>
    <P>I endorse everything Deputy Cosgrave has said with regard to de luxe hotels.  In the propaganda issued, there is too much emphasis on this type of hotel.  The number of Americans who can afford to stay in these de luxe hotels is very limited and the duration of their stay is even more limited.  They are really on their way to doing the Grand Tour of Europe and they drop off here to visit the Lakes of Killarney for a few days.  I wonder if the emphasis we are placing on these tourists is worth the value we get.  The Irish-American tourist is a valuable asset, because he comes to visit his relatives and friends.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on a really important point when he said that 30,000,000 British working people go on holiday annually and we scarcely attract one per cent of them.  Indeed, if we subtracted the Irish exiles coming back from work in England to visit their families, and who are accounted as tourists, we would not have .5 per cent.  British tourists of the figure the Minister mentioned.  An all out effort should be made in that field because I believe Bord Fáilte loans and grants should be directed more towards helping ordinary hoteliers and guest-house owners.  They are the people who cater for the biggest volume of tourists, the ordinary workers from Britain who save up their money for the year, come here to enjoy their accumulated savings and return home without a penny unspent.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Dáil, of a local authority and of a tourist development body, I have had the utmost difficulty in securing information about the grants and loans available to local bodies and groups for small schemes of tourist development in rural areas.  I would ask the Minister to get Bord Fáilte to issue circulars to such bodies in order to <Col N="1784" /> provide them with the information required.  There are many schemes which could be done by local authorities and small groups as well as by private individuals to develop tourist amenities in their respective areas and I think the information that is now lacking should be made freely available to them.</P>
    <P>In connection with our endeavours to attract tourists here from Britain, there are some people who are putting great obstacles in our way in this matter.  When we invite tourists in here, we expect them to come as guests.  Therefore, we should treat them as guests and there should be no reluctance on our part to fly the flags of all nations.  Surely in this country we should be broadminded enough to see that there is no reluctance on our part to honour our guests by flying the flags of the nations to which our visitors belong.  Misguided patriotism does no good to the tourist trade and does a lot of harm to us as a nation.</P>
    <P>In general terms, I welcome the proposals in the Bill but before concluding would draw the Minister's attention to the serious overcrowding in passenger vessels plying between here and Britain right through the summer months.  I can speak particularly for Rosslare.  Right through the summer months, on practically every boat that arrives, thousands of people are simply thrown on the decks with no provision whatever for seating.  This sort of thing is not going to help our tourist trade and I would urge the Minister to see that something urgent is done to relieve overcrowding on both trains and ships.  After all, the Minister is the man responsible for tourist promotion and he should take a serious interest in the conditions in which people coming here, particularly mothers with young children, have to travel.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opening of the Cork Airport.  I believe it will help considerably in getting more visitors in here, particularly from Britain&mdash; people who have refused to come here till now because of the outrageous travel facilities.  I hope C.I.E. will lay on an adequate bus service to and <Col N="1785" /> from the new airport so that visitors will have little difficulty in travelling to and from their destinations.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the scheme for hotel trainees, but we have had complaints from many vocational education committees in the country against the conditions under which this scheme is being carried out.  Who supervises these trainees?  Who looks after their interests when they are finally trained and put into hotel jobs?  Is it true, as has been published in many Sunday and morning papers, that advantage is being taken of these young people when they go to work?</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will say the unions should look after them.  That is true to a point, but many of these trainees are only probationers and are not under the full protection of the unions till their probationary periods are over.  I would urge the Minister to see that some body or group is given responsibility to ensure that these trainees are not taken advantage of, and not used merely as cheap labour under the guise of tourist promotion.  I believe the Minister has made a wise move in this Bill and I hope he and Bord Fáilte will succeed in attracting greater numbers of visitors here from abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals in this Bill are indeed very welcome to everybody throughout the country and particularly the tourist industry.  It does mean that the tourist business in the country is now slipping into top gear and that we can begin to take a long-term view.  We must have our tourist industry at the optimum point as soon as possible.  Other countries are spending very much larger sums than we are and it is only by going as far as possible in as short a time as possible that we can be prepared for the world tourist business which is increasing year by year as more leisure and longer holidays with pay are made available. All these benefits to the wage earning class mean holidays and to many of them in the better-off countries it means holidays abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister we are concentrating on America and Britain. <Col N="1786" /> That is very wise indeed because the potential there is very great.  If we can get a fair share of that we shall benefit very much.  To get a fair share of it we must make preparations; we must improve our hotels; we must improve our transport to the country and in the country.</P>
    <P>In connection with transport we find that in recent years groups from England, Scotland and Wales are being given facilities to bring buses across and to make round trips here.  That is a very good development.  The Minister should ensure that facilities for shipping these vehicles and also for shipping private cars to this country, ferry services, and so on, are improved.  We do know that Bord Fáilte have co-operated in ensuring that the customs authorities at the various points along the Border do everything possible to make it easier for day trippers and other classes of tourists to come across the Border.  They have asked the customs authorities to have as short a delay as possible at the various frontier posts.  A speed-up in cross-Border travel has resulted from the efforts of the different development committees and from the representations by Bord Fáilte to the customs authorities.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that further moneys are made available for the expansion of our hotels and guest houses.  The number of hotel bedrooms available is very much under the number we require and, while I agree with the previous speaker that more ordinary, homely accommodation in the smaller hotels is required, still in addition we must have the other type of hotel which has bedrooms with bath and hot and cold water.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the tourist guide for America issued by Bord Fáilte. The first few pages have not changed for a number of years because in regard to the grading of hotels, the definition given to our grade B hotels is that some of them have hot and cold water in the bedrooms.  It is not right to send out a special guide for America which indicates that in regard to our second class hotels, in other words the next to the top grade, Americans can expect to find bedrooms which have neither hot nor cold water.  That is not <Col N="1787" /> the position.  Most of our grade B hotels, as a matter of fact, our grade B and C hotels, have hot and cold water in all bedrooms; at least those which have not this facility would be a very small minority.  Therefore that guide should be revised and brought up to date.</P>
    <P>In Donegal, which is one of our finest tourist counties, we hear complaints that a fair proportion of the flow of tourists to the country is not directed to Donegal.  That may be an exaggeration but it is a comment amongst people in Donegal in the hotel trade that when tourist organisations are brought here they are shown the South of Ireland.  The first trip is to Killarney, the next to kiss the Blarney Stone, and the itinerary of many of these organised tours does not include Donegal.  There is good ground for at least some of that criticism.  The North should not be neglected in that respect seeing that we have excellent hotels, beautiful scenery, and so on, to show our visitors in Donegal.</P>
    <P>Air travel is a great assistance to the tourist industry.  Dublin and the south of Ireland are well catered for by air travel.  The Minister might consider the possibility of having an airport in the north-west as well.  The emphasis on the south is due in large measure to the fact that airports and good air services are available there.</P>
    <P>This further encouragement by the Minister and the Government to the hotel industry is to be welcomed and will be very beneficial.  It is true to say that the people in the industry are becoming very wide awake to the benefits they individually and the country in general can gain and are gaining from the tourist industry.  We have a tourist-conscious people in the hotel industry who perhaps in the past did not put all they had into it but who now are very keen, very active and working very hard indeed towards the development of a better tourist industry.  It is only when the people in the industry and the Department of Industry and Commerce co-operate that we can expect the doubling of our tourist trade and the income therefrom to which I look forward in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Tourism is one of our great untapped resources. One attractive tourist feature of Ireland which very few countries have to offer is the fact that one can go long distances without having to contend with enormous crowds.  I heard this country described recently by a European as one great park.  Perhaps that is one of our greatest tourist assets.  With the exception of Scotland and remote countries, the same cannot be said of other countries.  We should concentrate more on endeavouring to bring tourists to the more remote parts of Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is to be a congress of international surgeons in this country which about 1,200 people will attend.  It is suggested that there will be difficulty in accommodating them.  That is understandable in view of the fact that the congress is to be held in Dublin.  Practically every congress held in this country is drafted into Dublin.  Many foreigners do not know that there is any place in Ireland other than Dublin.  The majority of tourists to this country tend to come to Dublin.  In a great many cases, they are directed by Bord Fáilte to Dublin.  Posters displayed in foreign countries to encourage people to come to Ireland invariably invite people to &ldquo;Fly Aer Lingus to Dublin direct&rdquo; or to &ldquo;travel via Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire to Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want tourists to go further afield than Dublin, we will have to advertise accordingly.  Advertisements published by Spain, Norway, Scandinavia and other countries do not invite people to come only to the <Col N="1789" /> capital cities.  That is an error Bord Fáilte has fallen into.  It may be that they have these posters on hands and find it more economical to use them but I submit that people should be encouraged to visit parts of Ireland other than Dublin so that the tourist industry may be extended.</P>
    <P>The major part of the tourist traffic to this country comes from the United Kingdom and it is the most beneficial kind of tourist traffic.  A very large number of working-class people come here.  They have a certain amount of money to spend and they spend it. In the majority of cases, they find their way to Dublin.  Would it not be possible for Bord Fáilte to route people who come from districts south of a certain line in the United Kingdom through Rosslare Harbour or Cork instead of Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire to Dublin?  I draw the attention of Bord Fáilte to that suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>They could route them through Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Shannon is in a particularly privileged position. Bills have been passed here to make sure that there are funds available at Shannon that are not available on the east coast.  I agree that there are enormous possibilities in routing people through Shannon.  Bord Fáilte would be far better occupied in encouraging tourists to come in through Shannon than in encouraging people to establish factories.  The Chair may rule me out of order if I continue on this line but Deputy Russell interrupted me and disturbed the trend of my thought.</P>
      <P>We have concentrated rather more on the very wealthy type of tourist than on working-class people.  It may be desirable to get wealthy tourists here and to have first-class hotels, as we have in Dublin and other centres, but, in the main, we ought to devote a great deal of the money voted for tourism to encouraging working-class people to come here, in providing good accommodation for them and in advertising that accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other tourists who are beneficial to us are family parties.  Family parties spend more money than anybody else. <Col N="1790" /> They buy more.  They buy knick-knacks for the children.  They can buy many things here much cheaper than elsewhere.  Notwithstanding the fact that they have not received any assistance from the State or semi-State bodies and the fact that they lack many facilities, such as good water supplies and sewerage, there are places in this country where the people, by their own efforts, have built up a small tourist trade to which families come on holidays year after year.</P>
    <P>One example is Duncannon, one of the most beautiful spots in Ireland, just as beautiful as Kerry, Donegal, Connemara or any of the other places that are continually advertised.  There is a magnificent bathing beach there where it is almost impossible for a child of three to drown.  Duncannon has managed to build up a limited tourist traffic of its own and families go there year after year.  There are innumerable such places entirely overlooked by Bord Fáilte.  Bord Fáilte should send their officials around more to study the tourist potential in these places.</P>
    <P>That poses another question.  The previous speaker is a Deputy from Donegal and complained that Donegal is being neglected in the matter of tourism.  I know that Bord Fáilte have nothing to do with tourist road grants, but at the same time, they must be in a position to advise as to where tourism is good and likely to be productive.  The tourist road grants are directed to two or three counties which definitely proves to me that Bord Fáilte are still thinking on those lines.  I do not say that in any spirit of hostile criticism.  It simply is a fact.</P>
    <P>The slow rate of increase in tourism is evident in what Deputy Cosgrave quoted here this evening.  The rate of development is slower than in any other country in Europe, although we have more to offer.  Therefore, we must do a little rational thinking.  We must see why we are not making the progress other countries are making.  Bord Fáilte should look into the question of the lesser known areas and see if they can encourage people to build guest-houses in those areas, or expand the existing guest-houses, and go in for the <Col N="1791" /> type of modern tourism, with all the labour-saving devices and so on which will give the best possible service to tourists.</P>
    <P>To encourage tourists, we must have adequate amenities and facilities.  The tourist development associations that are being formed in various counties, and seaside districts throughout the country, are worthy of more consideration from the Board.  Many representations are made to me in my own county asking me to go to the Board and see if I can do anything with regard to securing these amenities. People are looking for simple things&mdash;perhaps a small job of reconstruction on a beach, the provision of a few bathing boxes or some such work.  I always hear the same story about the heavy demand on the funds of the Board, but they have no time for the forgotten people in the backwaters.</P>
    <P>The case I am trying to make is that there is an enormous potential for expansion.  That expansion lies not in Dublin city, or even in Cork city, but in the hinterland where there are beautiful beaches and wonderful scenery.  I know from my experience of going to Europe and mixing with Europeans that they cannot believe what we have to offer.  They cannot believe that we have not exploited what we have to offer.  For that reason, I welcome the provision of this money.  I sincerely hope it will be directed to publicising the lesser known places.  This country could be a tourist paradise.  There are many people seeking peace and quiet today; they want to get away from the crowds. We should make this country a haven for them where they can spend a holiday with their friends.  If we start a snowball like that, there will be no end to the tourism that will follow and tourism would then be what it should be, our second major industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Deputies in saying that I welcome any effort by Bord Fáilte to increase our present substantial tourist trade.  In a country like ours, with a deficit in our trading account somewhere <Col N="1792" /> in the region of £70,000,000 to £90,000,000, a sum of £42,000,000 is a very significant figure.  I am quite certain that with more aggressive salemanship, particularly in Great Britain and on the Continent, that figure could be substantially increased, and tourism could play an even more important part in reducing our trade deficit.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, this Bill seeks to do three things.  Instead of paying to Bord Fáilte £500,000 a year, as has been the practice up to now, they will be paid an aggregate of £5,000,000, which the Minister estimates will last a minimum of seven years.  Personally, I am rather reluctant to depart from established procedure.  I do not see why Bord Fáilte could not have their annual grant increased from £500,000 a year to £700,000, which the Minister estimates to be the average figure for the next seven years.  However, there may be good reasons for that.</P>
      <P>The second purpose of the Bill is to increase from £3,000,000 to £5,000,000 the aggregate amount of loans which may be guaranteed.  The Minister also proposes to eliminate the ceiling of £75,000 in respect of interest grants. Apart from commenting on the question of giving Bord Fáilte a round sum of £5,000,000 rather than an annual sum of £700,000, I have no comment to make.</P>
      <P>However, I have comments to make on the efforts being made to attract tourism to this country.  I find myself substantially in agreement with those who said our most valuable market for tourism is Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  According to the Minister's statement, we have increased our share of the United States market over the past ten years from six per cent. to ten per cent., but still, ten per cent. of 800,000 American tourists is only 80,000 persons, whereas of the 30,000,000 British people who take their holidays away from home each year, 300,000 persons come here, or almost four times the number who come to us from the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the Minister's optimistic forecast that we can increase our share of the North American traffic to 20 <Col N="1793" /> per cent. is realised, it would still be substantially lower than the market which lies only a few miles from our shores.  I believe that a great concentration on the British market, and particularly on the middle and working-class tourist, would pay far greater dividends to the country as a whole than a concentration on the American market, which, of necessity, must be a very expensive one.</P>
    <P>We have had some experience of the cost of trying to get a share of the American market for our whiskey exports.  Those efforts have been a sad failure, unfortunately.  It now seems that instead of the tens of thousands we have been spending, we require to spend sums in the region of £500,0000 or £1,000,000 per annum on advertising before we can hope to get anything like a reasonable share of the American market for our whiskey.  To some extent, that is the case in regard to this vast tourist market of 170,000,000 or 180,000,000 people.  It is a market which is ringed about with cartels, agents and middlemen of all kinds, all of whom must either be paid or bought off in one way or another.  With the contacts we have built up in England through those who have emigrated over the past 35 or 40 years, we can expect a far greater share of their tourist trade than we have at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is a third market which has not been mentioned, the Continental market.  I do not know what efforts Bord Fáilte are making to induce tourists from the Continent to come to Ireland.  I believe there is a very substantial market to be tapped there. I should like the Minister to tell me what offices Bord Fáilte have opened on the Continent, and what success has attended the opening of such offices, if any.  With the development of the European Economic Community, it is almost certain that we will come in closer contact with the Continental countries and now is the time to prepare for an expansion of the tourist trade from Western Germany, France and elsewhere on the Continent. One way of achieving what Deputy Esmonde spoke about, inducing tourists <Col N="1794" /> to come to the southern and western parts of Ireland, the less populated parts, would be to fly them in direct to Shannon, or Cork, or possibly Galway, if a flying field were established there.</P>
    <P>In general, many of the facilities we can offer do not cost anything.  There is no annual grant required in respect of matters like cleanliness, courtesy, or friendliness.  We have a superabundance of friendliness in this country and plenty of courtesy.  We are a friendly courteous people, attributes which cost nothing at all and from my experience of tourists, they count for far more than luxury hotels and all the flashy things you see in some of these new hotels going up throughout the country.  Not that I wish to belittle those because I think there is a trade for the wealthier type of tourist, particularly from America, and it is up to us to get a share of that type of business.</P>
    <P>Basically, we should concentrate on the more modest tourist who comes with his wife and perhaps his family and as one Deputy said, spends everything in his pocket and goes home &ldquo;broke&rdquo; but happy.  Generally speaking, the wealthy tourist does not go into the shops and buy the small requisites on sale there.  He generally goes to his hotel and stays there but perhaps buys a work of art costing 100 or 150 dollars and takes it home with him.  As some Deputies pointed out, we have other natural amenities that cost nothing, such as roads that are largely free of traffic and magnificent scenery, much of which, unfortunately, is still blanked off by high hedges.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would cost a lot to make available, possibly to the local authorities, some type of hedge cutter to cut down these hedges and let the tourists see more of our beautiful scenery.  These things do not cost a lot of money but they make a big difference to people travelling through the country.  The number of people coming in in coaches is increasing and these people like to see the country and are disappointed when they find high hedges adorning, if I might use the word, a great number of our roads. Another point is that the tourist coming <Col N="1795" /> here requires to travel in comfort and at a reasonable speed and I think there is still a lot of well-founded complaint with regard to travelling by steamer from England to this country.  We might also be more generous in our terms to people coming here with cars. In certain Continental countries, when there is a minimum of four passengers travelling with a car the car is carried free of charge.  We should also investigate the possibility of establishing air ferries for cars and also steamer car ferries.  Anything that makes the tourist's journey from England or the Continent to this country quicker or more comfortable should be put into effect.</P>

      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the producers of the monthly magazine <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i>.  It is very well produced.  I do not know what its circulation is or to whom it is circulated, but I feel that if it were in wider circulation, it would have very beneficial effects on the tourist trade.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to indicate what success has attended the establishment of a native souvenir industry. We have all had experience of the frightful so-called Irish souvenirs manufactured anywhere but in Ireland. We would all like to see that pseudo-Irish trade done away with as quickly as possible and well made souvenirs manufactured in this country.</P>
      <P>Another recent and justified expenditure has been the renovation of Bunratty Castle.  I know that, strictly speaking, it does not come within the Minister's province but is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power, but the reason I mention it is its tremendous success last year when thousands of people visited it.  In Limerick city, there is another monument of that type, King John's Castle, a twelfth century castle that would well repay renovation.  I should like to see that carried out by Bord Fáilte and possibly if it were floodlit by night, it would be a very good tourist attraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> I do not think we should allow this Bill to pass without commending the various tourist agencies for the energy and enterprise they have shown, particularly over recent years.  Although they do not come within the ambit of this Bill, they have contributed to the success of the industry in no small way.</P>
    <P>One Deputy suggested that these grants from Bord Fáilte should be available to local parish councils or development associations.  If I recall rightly, the 1952 Act contained a provision whereby local development associations could receive loans or possibly grants.  I wonder if any of those were ever given, or if that part of the Act has fallen into disuse.  It would be a good idea to encourage local initiative and it might be a cheaper way of doing things, particularly in small areas not worthy of a major development scheme by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is mainly an enabling Bill which increases the amount of grants which may be made to Bord Fáilte from £3,000,000 to £5,000,000 for the period ending in 1967.  It gives us an opportunity to review the work of Bord Fáilte Éireann and those concerned with the development of the tourist trade.  Considering the amount of loans and grants available in agriculture, which is our largest industry, the demands of this second largest industry are not very great. We should take this opportunity to express a special word of praise to Bord Fáilte for the very excellent report for 1960 which they made available to Deputies showing the achievements of the Board and the work carried out during the past 12 months.  That report enables Deputies, with their local knowledge and experience, to pinpoint some of the needs in their districts, which will enable Bord Fáilte to go ahead with some improvements.</P>
      <P>It is a remarkable fact that our air traffic facilities seem to be much better than our boat traffic facilities.  The lack of adequate facilities at peak travelling time causes agitation almost every holiday season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the work done by the Board in an organised way, there is still a lot to be done to cater for tourism in this country.  Also, we must try to cater for Irish people who wish to spend their holidays at home.  When it comes to the provision of facilities and amenities, most of the publicity refers to luxury hotels and huge schemes of accommodation for visitors.  Although publicity is being given to these schemes, quite an amount of work is being done in the smaller hotels.  We should cater for the middle class visitors rather than the very wealthy ones.</P>
      <P>Somebody mentioned that the middle class people spend their money and go home &ldquo;broke.&rdquo;  When they are spending their money, we should ensure that there will be amenities for them.  The emphasis should be on catering facilities for middle class husbands coming here with their wives and families for a limited holiday.  If we examine any organised effort in that respect, we immediately think, for instance, of Butlin's Holiday Camp. An organised unit caters for people desiring the facilities made available there.  We have also two places in Skerries where organised holidays are provided for English people, English wage-earners who come into this country.  There are not many such places in Ireland which are designed to provide that type of holiday for English wage-earners.</P>
      <P>It seems we ought, as far as possible, to go further in encouraging the establishment of more centres where English people can enjoy that type of holiday.  The accommodation is not here.  Great credit is due to Butlin's, Red Island, and so on, who organise these holidays during the winter.  They plan the holiday for these people over there, who contribute to the holiday fund weekly and then come here to enjoy it.  I mention those places to show that they are concentrating on providing holidays for people in England who come over here to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned that 30,000,000 people go on holidays every year from England and that only one per cent. of that number, 30,000, come to Ireland. <Col N="1798" /> I feel we do not provide sufficient facilities to attract them here and that we could.  For example, what beach facilities do we provide here, on the average, or have we attempted to provide here, compared with the beach facilities available at many of the well-known Mediterranean resorts?  Of course, they are super places.  I believe we could make an effort.  We could select some places and provide organised amenities at some of the beaches.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as saying nothing has been done: it has.  Several seaside resorts have been improved to a very great extent but if we compare any of them with the super beaches, where so many facilities are available, at many of the tourist resorts on the Continent, we realise that we have a long way to go.  Have we any heated indoor swimming baths near any of our holiday centres?  Messrs.  Butlin's Holiday Camp provided one this year at considerable expense and it is proving a very attractive amenity. People who have visited that camp say it was money very well spent.  That is one of the very many amenities we could attempt to provide at some of the more popular seaside resorts&mdash; places where people can swim, whether it is rainy or stormy outside.  Instead of sitting indoors looking out at inclement weather and being denied the enjoyment to be expected at a seaside resort, people who have come here for a limited time to relax and to have a holiday would appreciate such amenities.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte keep a careful eye on the charges and we should be very careful about them.  Tourists should not be overcharged.  Overcharging gives a bad impression and people may say it is far more expensive to have a holiday in Ireland than on the Continent. It is very bad propaganda from our point of view.  Some steps should be taken to ensure that people who come here for a holiday will be given reasonable value for their money.</P>
    <P>The angling aspect of our tourism seems to be developing rapidly.  We have become aware of our great variety of fishing facilities.  Apparently we are attracting, off-season, quite a number <Col N="1799" /> of people interested in angling.  Even in England it is a very popular sport. It could be popularised to a much greater extent here.  I consider that Bord Fáilte are doing a good job.  Even if statistics show that progress is not as rapid as in other countries, at least they have made a bold start.  They have shown enterprise.</P>
    <P>When looking through the Report of Bord Fáilte Éireann, I noticed that very little was provided for the coast of County Dublin, stretching from Gormanston to Killiney.  The provision of a boat slip at Malahide was mentioned. Unfortunately, although it has been provided, it is considered not as satisfactory as it might be.  I hope <Col N="1800" /> Bord Fáilte are not finished with the boat slip at Malahide and that they will consult the local people about it so that it will be constructed and completed satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>We have Skerries and Portmarnock and all these places along the east coast to which thousands of people travel on Sunday.  It is difficult for people outside County Dublin to realise it but it is a fact that 20,000 people move out every Sunday from Dublin city along the coast as far as Gormanston.</P>
