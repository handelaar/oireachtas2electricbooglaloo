    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, further to a reply of 15th November, his attention has been drawn to the Annual Report of Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, a body set up by the Government, in which the idea of setting up a State Board to look after the affairs of the Gaeltacht was again raised; and whether in view of this report and the remarks of Mr. Liam Ó Luanaigh, President of the Comhdháil, at the annual general meeting on 18th November on the subject of the necessity for better overall planning for the Gaeltacht, he will consider reexamining the question of setting up such a Board for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been drawn to a resolution passed at the recent annual conference of Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge to the effect that the Gaeltacht should be administered by a State Board; and whether he is willing in any way to entertain the suggestion of the Comhdháil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's questions appear to be based on a number of misconceptions. I would point out that Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge were not set up by the Government, that their recent <Col N="884" /> Annual Report does not raise the question of setting up a State Board to look after the affairs of the Gaeltacht, and I understand that, at their recent annual general meeting, they did not pass a resolution to the effect that the Gaeltacht should be administered by a State Board.</P>
    <P>So far as the suggestion referred to in the Deputy's questions is concerned, I refer him to the reply which I gave to his question on the matter on the 15th instant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state for each of the past five years the amounts, and the methods by which they have been computed, of emigrants' remittances received in the State from exiles working in the following countries while temporarily or permanently domiciled there: England, Scotland, U.S.A., Canada, West Germany and Soviet Russia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The countries distinguished in the compilation of the figures of emigrants' remittances are Britain, the United States, Canada and the total of all other countries.  I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the estimated totals of remittances for these areas for the years 1956-60.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures for emigrants' remittances are compiled mainly from data collected by the commercial banks and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The banks record the sterling equivalent of drafts, foreign currency notes, telegraphic remittances, etc., cashed or lodged with them, which are believed to have been sent by persons resident outside the State to friends or relatives resident in Ireland for no consideration, e.g. as gifts, legacies, etc. Remittances received in payment for goods or other valuable consideration, where such is apparent or known, are not included.  Foreign money orders and postal orders are omitted from the banks' figures and separate particulars in respect of these items are recorded <Col N="885" /> by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The total of all such money orders and postal orders received is included as emigrants' remittances.  In addition to the figures compiled by the banks and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs a conjectural estimate of the amount of emigrants' remittances sent in the form of sterling notes through the post is also included.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>ESTIMATED receipts of emigrants' remittances from various countries, 1956-60.</P>

      <P>May I inquire, as a matter of interest, would it be considered practicable, or perhaps the Central Statistics Office might consider it desirable, to include in those estimates the dollar bill receipts, at least for a period of six weeks before Christmas, which go into the branch banks and which must be very considerable, as coming in as gifts to Irish people during that six weeks?</P>

      <P>Is it a fact that if an emigrant sends home money by post at Christmas or in the summer, that money comes under the title of emigrants' remittances but, if that emigrant comes home for a fortnight's holiday at Christmas or in the summer, the money he spends in Ireland is looked upon as money that comes under the heading of tourism?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of occasions over the past ten years on which his Department have been notified regarding physical injury caused by rats to patients in hospitals, nursing homes, county homes, mental hospitals or similar institutions within the State; the total amount of any awards made to those injured in such incidents; and the steps taken to ensure that in future there will be no recurrence of such incidents.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that the Laois County Manager has instructed that court proceedings be instituted in all cases where there are outstanding hospital, medical and ambulance accounts; and that many poor people who cannot afford to pay these large sums are being brought to court; and if, in view of the fact that the members of the local authority are very much disturbed, he will receive a deputation of the members so as to stay all such proceedings pending the suggested changes in the administration of the Health Act; and, further, if he has satisfied himself that it is proper that such people should be brought to court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had enquiries made from the Health Authority and I am assured that the position is not as has been indicated by the Deputy.  I understand that reasonable time to pay is given in all cases where charges are levied on patients who receive hospital treatment or avail of medical or ambulance services.  If, following the issue of repeated reminders, the accounts are not discharged, the circumstances of the patient are again investigated and the matter is referred to the Health Authority's solicitor only where the Authority is satisfied that the charge can be met without hardship.  In most cases following an approach by the solicitor arrangements are made to discharge the accounts either in full or by instalments.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I cannot accept the suggestion of the Deputy that many poor people who cannot afford to pay the sums involved are being brought to court.  I have received no request from the Health Authority to receive a deputation in regard to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have no functions in the fixing of charges for hospital treatment within the statutory limits and in the arrangements made for the collection of such charges in individual cases.  I have, however, had enquiries made from the Health Authority in this case and I understand that the person concerned was not the holder of a medical card at the time he received hospital treatment, for which a charge of £5 10s. was made, or for some time subsequently.  In that period an arrangement was made and accepted by the Health Authority for payment of the amount due by instalments and, in fact, £3 of the account was paid in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> A medical card was applied for and granted in October, 1960, as the applicant was then in receipt of Social Welfare benefit.  I understand that the Health Authority are reviewing the position regarding the amount outstanding.</P>

    <P>Under the Regulations, a health authority is empowered to enter into <Col N="890" /> an agreement for the provision of medical care for mothers and infants with any registered medical practitioner (whether resident in the functional area of the health authority or not) unless:</P>
    <P>(a)  the medical practitioner is employed in a wholetime capacity in the service of the State or of a local authority, or</P>
    <P>(b)  by reason of previous breaches by him of an agreement with the health authority or any other health authority, the health authority consider that it is not desirable to enter into an agreement with the medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions of agreement between a registered medical practitioner and a health authority require that the doctor shall, in respect of each eligible woman accepted by him for maternity care, provide such services as can appropriately be given by him and as he considers desirable in respect of motherhood; and in particular that he shall provide such of the following services as are appropriate in respect of each such woman:</P>
    <P>Initial examination (to be carried out, where possible, not later than the sixth month of pregnancy); an examination where possible in each of the last three months of pregnancy; such other examinations and ante-natal care as the medical practitioner considers necessary; attendance at the confinement (if the medical practitioner considers it necessary or if his services are called for by a midwife attending on the patient); attendance on at least one occasion in the week following the delivery; an examination (including a pelvic examination if thought necessary) at or about the end of the sixth week after the delivery; such other examinations and post-natal care within the period of six weeks after the delivery as the medical practitioner considers necessary; the taking of any specimens required for investigation.</P>
    <P>A doctor providing domiciliary attendance is empowered by the regulations to summon, on his own authority, the assistance of another registered medical <Col N="891" /> practitioner.  A doctor may also, if he deems it necessary, recommend a patient for specialist services and may refer a patient for institutional treatment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether in view of the fact that since 1951 health inspectors have had to perform increased duties under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, the Office Premises Act, the Rats and Mice Destruction Act and in respect of food and drug sampling, etc., and have not received commensurate increases in salary with other officers in the local authority service, he will take steps to ensure that the salary scale of these health inspectors will be considerably improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The remuneration of health inspectors is primarily a matter for the individual health authorities.  While additional duties which are related to those prescribed for health inspectors have from time to time been assigned to them in the period since 1951, I am not aware that there has been any change in the nature of the duties and responsibilities of health inspectors which would of itself warrant an increase in their remuneration.  Apart from the current round of salary revisions they have received increases in salary commensurate with other officers in the local service.  I understand that the question of further revision of the salary scale of health inspectors is at present under consideration and I am prepared to consider any reasonable proposals which may be submitted to me in that connection by the health authorities.</P>

I am ready at any time to consider any such amendments if the panel of staff representatives of the General Council think fit to put them forward.

      <P>I do not want to embarrass the Minister but we are all agreed that, subject to your discretion, Sir, certain questions may properly be answered by a tabular statement.  But may I suggest that this is carrying the principle a little far?  When the Minister in reply to this Question&mdash;which asks &ldquo;What steps are being taken to ensure that Christmas gifts posted by Irish emigrants in Britain and elsewhere to their relatives at home will not be subjected to customs duty as in previous years?&rdquo;&mdash;says he proposes, with your permission, to furnish a tabular statement, I respectively submit, Sir, that you should withhold your permission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Question the particulars requested at (a) and (b) cannot be calculated with accuracy, mainly because of the difficulty of apportioning the total expenditure on export guarantee payments between individual areas.  It is estimated however that the total net cost of the Scheme to date has exceeded £1,600,000 in the case of (a) and £6,900,000 in the case of (b).  The net cost in the case of (c) is £19,272,466.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Question the position in County Cork is similar to that in the remainder of Munster, excluding County Clare which, of course, is attested.  Under what is known as the Southern Dairying Area Scheme re-tests of some 50 per cent. of the herds in the Scheme indicate that in the re-tested herds the incidence of the disease in dry stock has been reduced to a low figure and that the incidence in cows has fallen appreciably.  The progress made by herd-owners in the Southern Dairying Area has not yet been sufficiently rapid to enable clearance measures to be put into effective operation there.  How soon such measures can be introduced will depend on farmers increasing their efforts to get rid of reactors and replacing them with tested animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the country as a whole, the position is that ten counties, containing 1,700,000 cattle, are now attested, and nine counties which are at present at the clearance area stage are expected to be attested by the end of 1962. There are 1,100,000 cattle in these nine counties, so that by the end of 1962 we expect that there will be close on 3,000,000 attested cattle in the country, <Col N="906" /> or over 60 per cent. of the total number of cattle.</P>

      <P>The Advisory Committee on the Marketing of Agricultural Produce recommended that the export of bacon, in the form of Wiltshire sides and major cuts including the back, should be centralised in a re-organised Pigs and Bacon Commission which would export a steady weekly quantity to a reduced number of agents in Britain.  The Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Act, 1961, was enacted for that purpose and as I stated during the Second Reading on 16th March last the Government agreed that centralisation of such exports should serve to strengthen the organisation of sales in Britain.  As I indicated in my reply to a Question by Deputy Clinton on 15th November the Commission is now initiating arrangements to this end.</P>

      <P>There is always a reluctance on the part of a Minister for Agriculture to license the importation of oats and, as I stated here last year when this matter was discussed on a <Col N="908" /> number of occasions, I, too, follow that policy.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise this is an annual dilemna in which oatmeal millers will not buy oats in order to force the Minister to give licences, and that those who grow the oats are unwilling to sell at the depressed prices available?  Is there not a way out of the dilemna by asking An Bord Gráin to act as an arbitrator between the millers and the growers? The Board could act for the millers to get oats of a suitable quality for them and at the same time ask the growers, over a limited period, to make oats available to the Board for sale to the millers.  In such a situation, the millers cannot blackmail the growers or the growers the millers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always this allegation of blackmail in a year like this.  I feel that with the limited and shrinking market for oats, our requirement in that respect is a very hard one to satisfy.  The acreage of oats is going down and it has been customary always that the great bulk of the oats grown in this country has been used in the farms where it is grown.  With the declining market for oats outside that it is not difficult to see how easily that market is supplied.  I know that what I said last year and this year on the subject will continue to be the practice. The Minister will examine every application very diligently before he makes a decision to give an import licence but a time is reached when you can no longer resist.</P>

A tenant who ceases to be an employee must therefore vacate his house which then becomes available for another employee.  Under a scheme whereby tenants might purchase houses, a large number of the Board's houses might, in due course, become tenanted by non-employees and would not be available for employees who required them.  Accordingly, the Board do not propose that arrangements should be made for tenants to purchase their houses.</P>

The extent to which C.I.E. would, however, be prepared to add to their already substantial commitments for pension purposes is a matter falling entirely within the discretion of the Board.  Pension rates are related to the contributions previously made to the pension fund by the pensioners concerned and by C.I.E.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The institution of prosecutions for traffic offences and the imposition of penalties are matters for the Garda Síochána and the courts respectively.  I am not aware of the number of such prosecutions, but I am aware that prosecutions for failure to stop at stop-signs have been instituted and that disqualifications from driving have been imposed by the courts in some such cases.</P>
      <P>The stop-sign and the stop-line marking on the roadway are prescribed in the Traffic Signs Regulations, 1956, (S.I. No. 284 of 1956) and the General Byelaws for the Control of Traffic, 1937, (Amendment) Byelaws, 1956 (S.I. 316 of 1956) require drivers of vehicles to stop at the stop-line or, where no stop-line is provided, at or near the stop-sign.  The Regulations and Bye-laws may be purchased from the Government Publications Sales Office, G.P.O. Arcade, Dublin, or through any bookseller.</P>
      <P>While the interpretation of the bye-laws I have mentioned is a matter for the courts, their terms do appear to require a driver to stop at a stop-line, even if he has already stopped on the approach.  The Deputy will appreciate that these stop-lines and stop-signs are provided only at very dangerous junctions where, in general, visibility is extremely limited.  Traffic conditions on the major road might have changed even in the short time a preceding vehicle had crossed the stop line and, quite apart from the law's requirements, commonsense should guide a driver in stopping if only for the short time necessary to assure himself that the major road is clear.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise that the average member of the public is very confused as to the state <Col N="924" /> of the law at present?  Would he consider making available to the public, in some sort of ready form, a pamphlet showing the difference between the laws as they now stand and as the enactment of the Road Traffic Act, 1960, requires?  Furthermore, does he not consider that the public&mdash;and solicitors, for that matter&mdash;should be given an opportunity of being advised as to the exact state of the law in regard, in particular, to their driving obligations at junctions?</P>

      <P>The constitution of the Commission was carefully considered before it was established.  There are many bodies apart from the Association who could claim to be represented and a number did in fact seek representation.  It was essential, however, to keep the membership of the Commission at a number which would not be unwieldy so as to enable it to work effectively.  For this reason only three organisations were asked to nominate representatives to supplement the medical, legal, judicial, Garda and official representation. These bodies were chosen because they were representative of particular viewpoints on the matters to be considered and they included the two bodies of long standing as representative of the motoring community, the A.A. and the R.I.A.C.  The third body is the Safety First Association of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The purposes of this Bill are to raise the statutory limit for issues from the Local Loans Fund and to simplify the procedure for making issues.</P>
      <P>The existing statutory limit on aggregate issues from the Fund was fixed at £135 million by the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1957.  The Bill proposes to raise the limit to £170 million.</P>
      <P>Issues from the Fund from the 1st May, 1935, when it was established, up to the 31st March, 1961, amounted to £119,500,000.  The great bulk of these issues related to housing, principally local authority housing. Slum clearance and other rehousing schemes of urban local authorities under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts accounted for £33 million, while the corresponding schemes of rural local authorities under the Labourers Acts accounted for £30,500,000.  This gives a total of £63,500,000 for the provision of houses by urban and rural authorities.  Some 60,000 dwellings have been provided by these authorities since 1947.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts amounted to £27 million, these loans being issued to local authorities for relending to persons purchasing private houses. Loans to local authorities to enable them to make supplementary housing grants to persons of modest means acquiring new houses or improving existing houses absorbed £4,500,000. Advances under the Gaeltacht housing code for the purchase or improvement of private houses in Irish-speaking areas were relatively small, requiring rather less than £200,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Issues for the various housing services aggregated over £95 million.  This represents a very considerable contribution of loan capital from public funds towards the cost of providing better housing for our people.  It will be appreciated that Exchequer grants for new houses and for the improvement of existing houses are additional. In the period from 1935 to the 31st March last, these grants amounted to some £35 million.  They are estimated to cost £2,500,000 this year, which <Col N="930" /> gives a cumulative total of £37½ million to the 31st March, 1962.</P>
    <P>Of the remaining issues from the fund, which totalled about £24 million, county homes, hospitals and dispensaries took almost £5,500,000.  Sanitary and other health services absorbed £14,500,000, a large part of which went to water supply and sewerage schemes. The balance of £4 million or so was spent on vocational schools and miscellaneous services, vocational schools taking over £2 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to the issues actually made, the Fund also has substantial outstanding commitments in respect of loans sanctioned for projects in progress or to be started.  The loans may be partly drawn or drawing may not have commenced yet.  Additional commitments of this nature brought the total liability of the Fund as at the 30th September last to £133 million, that is only £2 million less than the present statutory limit.  It is expected that further commitments about to be incurred will bring the total up to the statutory limit in the near future.</P>
    <P>The total demand for loans is currently running at an annual rate of around £8 million and there are indications that it may increase.  As was expected, requirements for local authority building have declined from the very high level of some years ago following the completion or substantial completion of major re-housing programmes in many areas.  Nevertheless, housing still accounts for by far the greater part of loan requirements.</P>
    <P>Rising costs have added to requirements and the revival which has taken place in private building has created a continuing demand for loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  With the expansion of employment and incomes, more people are now in a position to undertake the responsibility of providing a home for themselves and their families and are availing of Small Dwellings loans for the purpose. Total requirements for housing are now at an annual level of some £6 million.  Requirements for water supply and sewerage schemes, at present about £1,500,000 a year, have been growing, which reflects the drive to provide piped water supplies in rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, to raise <Col N="931" /> the statutory limit for issues from the Local Loans Fund by £35 million to £170 million and the Bill provides accordingly.  This should cover commitments for the next three or four years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>£35,000,000.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains provisions designed to simplify the procedure for making loans from the Fund.  This matter has been under consideration for some time.  Under the existing arrangements it is necessary to draw up and have executed a separate mortgage deed for each loan to a local authority to secure the repayment of the loan and payment of the interest.  The procedure is rather slow and cumbersome and I feel that it could be shortened and simplified by statutory provisions as included in Section 3 of the Bill.  The arrangements now proposed envisage what will in effect be a statutory mortgage securing loans on the rates or other appropriate revenues or funds of the local authorities and binding the authorities to repay the loans and to pay the interest in accordance with conditions which they have accepted beforehand.  This will enable separate mortgage deeds to be dispensed with in most cases, thus saving time and expense for the local authorities and for the Office of Public Works by which the loans are issued on behalf of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the new system should apply to loans to health authorities and vocational education committees as well as to the major local authorities.  No change of principle is involved as regards the charging of payments of loans.  Both borrower and lender will continue to have the same rights and obligations as at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to stress the fact that the proposal to simplify the procedure for the making of loans should not be taken as implying that we need not be so careful in future as regards the amount of the issues to be made from <Col N="932" /> the Local Loans Fund.  Care continues to be necessary as the Fund is a heavier claimant than anticipated on the available capital resources.  I need hardly say how necessary it is not to jeopardise the objective of investing as high a proportion as possible of our capital resources in ways which will directly increase national production.</P>
    <P>The Local Loans Fund and the Exchequer would be relieved if local authorities, particularly the larger ones, did more to raise capital on suitable terms from other sources and I hope that they will try to do so within the limits of their approved borrowing programmes.</P>
    <P>I trust that the provisions of the Bill will be acceptable to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>The first purpose of this Bill, as the Minister proclaimed with a great flourish of trumpets, is to increase the overall limit of advances from the Local Loans Fund from £135,000,000 to £170,000,000.  The Minister gave an indication of the amount spent under various headings out of the Fund to date.  I should have liked him to have given us the proportion of that figure issued to Dublin and Cork Corporations.  I can remember very clearly the decision taken by us in Government to extend the facilities of the Local Loans Fund to Dublin and Cork Corporations, for the first time in the history of the State, and to extend it not merely by the provision of funds for the building of local authority houses by Dublin and Cork Corporations themselves, but also for the provision of advances under the Small Dwellings Act to those who wished to build their own houses.  I can also remember very clearly that notwithstanding the fact that that decision was taken, and notwithstanding the fact that the Local Loans Fund was for the first time in our history thrown open to Dublin Corporation, certain members of Dublin Corporation, led by two Deputies, two Fianna Fáil Deputies supporting the Fianna Fáil Government, deliberately sabotaged the effort that was being made at that time by Dublin Corporation to provide houses for people in need of them.</P>

      <P>It is only the fact that the Local Loans Fund was thrown open to these two Corporations that necessitates the Minister now coming along here with this measure.  The decision taken at that time was a good decision and the fact that this Bill is now necessary further to extend the limit arises out of that good decision and we approve and commend, therefore, the necessity now for this further measure arising out of that good decision.</P>
      <P>The second part of the Bill, as the Minister said, is designed to simplify the method to be used.  I want to be quite clear in one respect.  Is it clear beyond all question, because I do not think it is under the terms of the Bill, and will it be made clear beyond all question, that the existing obligations in relation to borrowing by local authorities will be maintained within the bailiwick of the local authorities themselves? At present the application for a loan and the completion of the charge by the local authority is a reserved matter for the elected members. I agree that the procedure adopted up to this, by which a charge was created, and so forth, can well cause unnecessary and cumbersome delay, but there must be no departure from the principle that it is the elected members of the local authority who have the right to say whether a loan will be applied for and the manner in which it will be repaid.  That is a matter for the elected members alone and not for any official, be he county or city manager, or otherwise, to determine; it is the elected members who determine whether a loan shall be applied for and whether the terms under which that loan may be made available by the Minister for Finance are such as should be accepted.  That principle must be protected absolutely.  It is protected at the moment because the deed of charge for its sealing requires a formal resolution of the council. There is no provision in Section 3 of this Bill requiring such formal resolution. That omission in the section may be covered elsewhere, but the position must be made quite clear to the House before the Bill can be accepted.</P>

      <Col N="934" /> The Minister, concluding his speech, referred in a slighting way to certain objectives of the Local Loans Fund.  I know that in certain respects expenditure from the Fund does not result in direct production, but there is no use having directly productive schemes unless there are, at the same time, houses in which those who are engaged in production can live in reasonable comfort.  If they are not, then they are not going to stay here no matter what employment may be available for them. It was in that spirit and with that approach&mdash;it was essential to ensure they would be kept here&mdash;that the housing drive was started in 1948 by the inter-Party Government to make up for the position which arose during the war when supplies were not available. We know it is fashionable in certain places to discount that effort. I want to say categorically that such discounting has no basis in fact.  It shows that the people concerned have not got a realisation of the human values involved and it is essential, where we have such a fluid method of travel available to our people, that they are kept here, not merely by employment alone, but by proper homes in which they can live.  Subject to these comments, we accept the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister some questions in relation to the Bill.  Like Deputy Sweetman, I hope that in the effort to rationalise the present methods by which the local authority will honour their financial obligations to the Local Loans Fund, the Minister will not devise a method which will make that a purely routine task and that the right of the local authority to commit itself to that expenditure is still a function reserved to the elected members of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have the right to feel that, if they are the body which raises the rates, they ought to have a substantial voice in determining its expenditure but if the matter of honouring mortgages is reduced to a routine operation between the county manager on the one hand and those who manage the Local Loans Fund on the other, we have to make sure that the local authority, that is, the members <Col N="935" /> of the local authority elected by the local ratepayers, will have the last word in deciding to what extent their credit will be pledged and that they will be committed to expenditure in respect of particular schemes of work &mdash;in other words, that the powers which the elected members have now will not in any way be impaired or whittled down as a result of whatever new more rationalised method of executing the mortgage is devised by the Minister.  I should like to have an assurance from the Minister on that point.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ascertain from the Minister whether at this stage he can give us any information as to the further sum of moneys which it will be necessary to expend in order to complete our housing programme and if he could say how much of that expenditure will be in respect of rural housing, and how much in respect of urban housing, including metropolitan housing.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are now embarking upon schemes to supply water and sanitation services throughout the country.  There again the local authority will indent upon the Local Loans Fund for the moneys to finance these schemes.  Can the Minister give any idea as to what the overall expenditure will be in respect of water and sanitation schemes?  Can he say what the rate of expenditure will be per year over, say, the next ten years?</P>
    <P>I should also like to ascertain from the Minister whether the Government contemplate the continuance of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act on the present basis or whether it is intended to widen the scope of the Act to make loans available over a wider area than they are available today&mdash; in other words, whether the Act can be used for the purchase of a dearer class house than it can be availed of to purchase today in view of the fact that house property has increased in price and many of the houses which could be bought in other years at prices within the level covered by the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act cannot now be purchased within the <Col N="936" /> scope of that Act as at present administered because of the increased cost of these houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Bill, I want to record the figures and record again and protest, in the light of what the Minister has said, against one of the most iniquitous occurrences I ever remember.  That was the conspiracy between Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Noel Lemass to frustrate the purpose of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act in this city at a time when it was urgently necessary to give it effect. I shall welcome another opportunity to discuss that disgusting conspiracy.</P>
      <P>I now want to refer to another aspect which is relevant to the Minister's introductory speech.  I refer to the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for 1960, Table 269, Page 279, Local Authorities: Loans Sanctioned in years ended 31st March.  In 1954, it was £3.5 millions. In 1955, £2.7 millions; in 1956, £3.7 millions and in 1957 £2.9 millions. That was at the time when Deputy Noel Lemass and Deputy Briscoe were proclaiming in this city that there was no money to enable anyone to purchase their houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.</P>
      <P>Some poor &ldquo;goms&rdquo; in this House swallowed that falsehood hook, line and sinker.  Some of them were &ldquo;goms&rdquo; who ought to have had more sense but then Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Noel Lemass came into power in a Fianna Fáil Government.  Now read the record.  The sum of £3.789 millions was supplied in 1956; £2.927 millions was supplied in the year ending 31st March, 1957; £1.6 million was supplied in the year ending 31st March, 1958 and £1.7 million in the year ending 31st March, 1959.  I have not got the later figures.  They are not here but they are of the same order. The very Deputies, who proclaimed there was no money available for Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act purchases, provided just one half of what the inter-Party Government were providing each year when some &ldquo;goms&rdquo; believed Deputy Noel Lemass and Deputy Briscoe when they alleged that the inter-Party Government were not making money available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> Then I look at the Labourers Acts under which money was made available for the building of houses.  In 1954, the sum was £3.2 million; in 1955, it was £2.2 million; in 1956, it was £2.1 million and in 1957, it was £2.3 million. And then arrived the two Lochinvars from out of the West who were going to provide money for everybody.  The sum of £1.8 million was provided in 1958 and £757,000 in 1959.  That is their record.  Bear in mind that Deputy Sweetman recalled that our Government, owing to the financial stringency in countries abroad, was able to make available to Dublin Corporation and Cork Corporation access to the Local Loans Fund in order to raise money. Why?  The Dublin Corporation could not borrow sixpence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not borrow it and we borrowed it for them and gave them all they wanted.  Dublin Corporation could not borrow on the public market and we borrowed it and we lent them the money.  Deputy Carter had better keep quiet for a minute because I am going to read the figures.  He is a tough old customer.  It is a long time since I saw him blush in Dáil or Seanad and he has been in both in his day, but if he does not blush now, he must be suffering from malignant anaemia.</P>
      <P>Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, we provided £1.9 million in 1954; £1.28 million in 1955; £2.1 million in 1956 and £6.4 million in 1957.  Then Deputy Carter arrived to shed his light upon us, flanked by Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Noel Lemass, and, in 1958, they provided £3.8 million and that fell to £2.4 million in 1959 and has gone down more since.  I am glad to see the Deputy is not suffering from malignant anaemia. He still has the capacity to blush and that is a consolation to us all, for we would not like to lose him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard these pious affirmations in the speeches of a great many Ministers for Finance.  It is always put in as a kind of colophon to the Minister's statement that, of course, we must be careful, when we are providing money to house the people, to remember our <Col N="938" /> obligation to use our credit primarily for productive purposes.  Theoretically, that is a lovely doctrine but I ask myself this question, whether we are better off bearing the burdens we have to bear now but in the knowledge that we have substantially housed the people, or to find ourselves in the position that the city of London is in at the present time where they are herding people into large hospitals for there is no place for them to go.</P>
    <P>I want to say quite deliberately that when we provided £6 million for the housing of the working classes to the Dublin Corporation and the Cork Corporation, we did it with our eyes wide open.  We are glad we did it and we would do it again and if anyone does not like that, he can lump it, including the persons who wrote the colophon to the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>I want to point out this: it is all very well to be talking about productive uses but how do we reconcile at the present time the spending of public money for the erection of huge blocks of office buildings in the city, when I can meet a woman from Ballsbridge who tells me she reared ten children in her own house on a very slender wage and she has now living in the house with her, her son, his wife and their baby and there is no room for them and he is quite prepared to pay rent, if there was a house available for them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot get it.  Yet, I see sites cleared, office buildings rising, land purchased at something like £20,000 an acre to build more office buildings in the city.  I would not mind if the building industry were greatly depressed and we wanted to stimulate employment in it by building office buildings or anything else.  Why is it that we find it right or possible or desirable to use our building resources for that kind of structure which, doubtless, is more convenient for the administrative staff of some department of the Corporation or some Government Department but which I cannot see adds anything to our production, when there are people who would have nowhere to lay their heads if they did not have relatives happily to give them <Col N="939" /> a room?  I do not understand that. When we are talking about marshalling our resources for productive purposes, we ought to ask ourselves very carefully whether we are justified in building of that character, so long as there are young married people without a home.</P>
      <P>Some of us may ask ourselves: why are there not enough resources to do both?  One of the reasons is that the skilled craftsmen of the building industry were driven out of this country.  In the good old days before the Labour Party thought it was inimical to the country to associate themselves with anybody else, I remember when Deputy Norton was Tánaiste and Deputy Costello was Taoiseach of this country, we called upon the building operatives in England to come home and help in the job and they came home and that is how we were able to get that building done and that is how we were able to use £6 million on housing of the working classes in 1957.  The results of reducing that appropriation to £3.8 million and £2.4 million in the subsequent years were that the skilled craftsmen went to England and now they will not come back and there is a very considerable amount of unemployment in the city of Dublin today because the building contractors cannot get the skilled men to carry on the building and, because the skilled men are not there, they cannot employ the unskilled labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deliberately referred to the revolting dishonesty and fraud of Deputy Noel Lemass and Deputy Briscoe in that disgusting conspiracy to sabotage the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts in 1956 and in 1957 and their other activities to obstruct housing for their base and contemptible political ends, because, not only did that operate to deprive people of houses, but it also operated to drive out of this country skilled operatives for the want of whom today we are unable to give employment to many unskilled operatives who are now following into the hod-carrying jobs in Britain when they would be much better employed at home under the conditions which obtain here than <Col N="940" /> under the crude conditions which obtain for unskilled labourers in Great Britain and the big industrial centres of the world.</P>
    <P>I want to reaffirm the belief that while as a theory marshalling of capital for productive purposes and the expansion of the national economy is theoretically sound and defensible, this House is not run by economists; we have other interests to bear in mind. Economists may advise this House, but if this country were run by economists, it would be a sandy desert.  Providentially, it never has been and, please God, it never will be.  It will be run by politicians who understand the needs of the people and whose solemn duty is to protect their interests, both against the &ldquo;dafties&rdquo; on the left and the theoreticians on the right, and to see that our resources are wisely used for the maximum benefit of all, with due regard to the human needs of those who want to marry and, if they are to get a chance of making a happy home, should be afforded the opportunity of starting their married life in decent conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak about a subject to which the Minister for Finance has referred, that is, the provision which it is his duty to make under this Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill for piped water supplies.  I want to put it to the House that the piped water supply, as a general scheme for the whole country, is quite daft and arises from a complete misunderstanding of the rural situation.  There are certain areas in rural Ireland&mdash;I could name them; there is one place in northwest Cork, one place in Westmeath, probably certain areas in Clare&mdash;where the superstructure geographically makes the occurrence of wells highly unlikely. In these areas, it may be necessary to carry water by piped water supply along the side of the county road in order to make water accessible to houses situated where wells are not readily available.  But in over 90 per cent. of the rural areas there is an abundant water supply available either at individual wells for individual homes, or at wells adequate to cater for a group of homes, in what we in the West of Ireland would call a village of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are in existence two schemes, one under the Department of Agriculture and one under the Department of Local Government, to enable anybody who wants to get running water supplies in his own home in the country, to get it on the basis of a 50 per cent. grant of the total cost.  In addition to that, there are facilities for borrowing the remainder of the cost, if the person <Col N="942" /> has not got the money to put down. These are quite enough and abundantly effective to bring water supplies to anybody who wants them.  They are of such a construction that their maintenance costs virtually nothing because there is no concealed, buried water main.  Once they are installed, the people who have installed them enjoy a free water supply for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>We are now proposing to substitute for that the installation of miles and miles of buried water main, the capital cost of which is great, and we are faced with the fact that they cannot come near the homes of a very large section of the rural community.  The cost of connecting a house 100 or 250 yards away from the main road where the water main lies is extremely heavy and the person who is getting the water has to pay a water rate as a permanent annual charge.  As far as I can find out, no regard is being paid, from the point of view of the local authority finances, to the probable annual cost of maintaining the water main, which can be very heavy.</P>
    <P>You have two schemes, one of which can be financed by the individual farmer or group of neighbours and which produces a free water supply in perpetuity and with virtually no maintenance charge.  The second is a scheme for carrying a water main for miles, which involves a heavy charge on the person who makes the connection and an annual water rate in perpetuity.  I want to ask the House have we gone daft to borrow millions to finance a scheme like that?  We are all conscious of the fact that there may be areas in the country with a peculiar geographical structure where such special arrangements must be made, but to suggest it should be of universal application is something which involves lunacy.  The danger is that unless somebody is prepared to raise this issue and stick out his neck and describe it for what it is, you will get irresponsible local authorities&mdash;whose momentary desire is to provide employment in their district&mdash;embarking on these vast schemes, when with one-quarter of the loan, much better schemes could be operated in the area, providing <Col N="943" /> people with much better water supplies which they would enjoy in perpetuity for no charge at all.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to review the whole character of this scheme to which he has referred of carrying water through rural areas by piped water main and to urge on his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to re-cast the whole plan and confine it to those areas where adequate supplies of well water are not available.  I think this House in adopting this Bill should not do so without a full realisation that it involves burdens on the taxpayer and the ratepayer because borrowed money must be paid for sooner or later.  We commend it to the House in that full knowledge because we believe that, relatively poor as this country is, we still have a right appreciation of the proper hierarchy of the public weal and that one of the most vital matters of any civilised society is that where a Christian family is founded, there should be a home wherein it can live in dignity and security.  I am proud of the fact that the Governments with which we were associated made great progress towards the realisation of that ideal.  I am conscious of the fact that much remains to be done and it is because I am conscious of that fact that we in this Party quite resolutely recommend this Bill to the Dáil in order that finances to complete the job may be made available.</P>
    <P>There is one last word I want to say and which I recognise is a matter to which the Minister himself may not be in a position to give an immediate, categorical answer.  It is one which I would ask him to discuss with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, because if we are to maintain a wise policy in regard to local loans, we must carry the active assent of the people with us.  I would value the opinion of men like Deputy Barron and Deputy Sherwin on this.  There is one problem for which I have never heard any ready solution.  I am told that at present Dublin Corporation have a large number of vacant houses on their hands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister for Finance that he might with advantage discuss this specific proposal with the Minister for Local Government.  It seems to me that it does create confusion in the public mind for the ordinary citizen, who does not understand the complications of the administration of housing, that there should be two or three hundred houses in the Dublin Corporation housing estates empty and yet people walking the streets unable to get a place to lay their heads.  Deputy Barron offers a very understandable explanation in which he says a routine has to be gone through.  The tenant goes out.  There are depredations.  You cannot reset the house in the condition in which the tenant left it.  It has to be referred to that Department of the Corporation which, in due course, will go ahead with the rehabilitation of the house, putting in windows and so on.  When that is done it is offered in rotation to a prearranged list of applicants who have been approved.</P>
      <P>That may be so.  But I suggest to the Deputy that the Dublin Corporation is allowing itself to get tied up in red tape.  I think it ought to be more prompt in its operations to reassure those of us here and elsewhere, who are appropriating money to go on building, that the houses are still urgently wanted.  I think they are wanted and I want to convince everybody else that they are wanted.  But then somebody comes to me and says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You are appropriating money to build more houses; I will bring you out to Finglas and show you dozens of houses with nobody in them and all the people say you are being <Col N="946" /> improvident in providing more money for the Local Loans Fund, because, if they used the money they had providently, it might not be necessary to spend any more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am putting it to the Minister for Finance that we cannot reasonably ask the taxpayers and the ratepayers to provide the money if we cannot convince them that it is being providently used and is urgently wanted. I think it is.  But we have got to do more than know that ourselves.  We have got to explain to the public that there is still housing waiting to be done.  I have never been without a house in my life.  The plain truth is that there are few of us in this House who ever knew what it meant to be without a house, to be without a home into which to bring a wife and family. I often admire the patience of people who find themselves in that plight.  I commend it, but if I were in that position in my own native city and saw hundreds of thousands of pounds being spent on a huge block of offices, with chromium, electric light, elevators and every facility obtainable, I would find it very difficult to be patient.</P>
    <P>We ought to bear that in mind.  I often used to say to a friend of mine that, if I were Minister for the social services, I could not rest in bed if there were a destitute person in Dublin, the reason for whose destitution I did not understand.  I do not think we ought to rest in this House if there is a homeless person, a person without a home through no fault of his own, while we sanction the continued expenditure especially of public money&mdash;I do not exclude the expenditure of private insurance funds and funds of bodies of that kind: there ought to be a hierarchy for their utilisation, too&mdash;especially if we continue to sanction the expenditure of public money on the building of relatively unnecessary office amenities that could well wait upon the more urgent need of housing.</P>
    <P>I concede to the Minister for Finance that if there were a proposal to build a factory to give employment to four or five hundred people, I would say to the homeless person who had <Col N="947" /> not a house: &ldquo;Look, if you can wait on with your mother-in-law for another six or 12 months, here is a chance to build a factory which will employ 500 people who would otherwise have to emigrate.  I am prepared to ask you to wait a little longer if the choice is between building a new housing estate or letting this factory go up to give employment.&rdquo;  I would do that, but I could not go to him and say: &ldquo;There are lots of public servants, lots of local authority servants and lots of insurance company employees working in great discomfort.  If we could get all of them into one magnificent office building with all modern amenities, they would all be much happier, so we are going to build that before we build a cottage for you.&rdquo;  I do not think it is right to say that.  These are things this House ought to consider, and I think this is the occasion on which they ought to be considered.</P>
    <P>Whatever decision we may come to on these things I hope we have seen the last for my time in Dáil Éireann of the shameless, unscrupulous and heartless fraud perpetrated by Deputy Noel Lemass and Deputy Briscoe in the Dublin Corporation when they refused the people of this city the money to build their homes, not because there was any scarcity but because they wanted to purchase votes by falsehood from a deceived and frustrated electorate, who put the blame on the Government when it really belonged to the Corporators, who had the means, but not the will, to serve the people whose servants they were elected to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of the Housing Committee.  If I missed half a dozen meetings in six years, it is as much as I have missed, even though we meet nearly every fortnight. I think I know the whole history.  In 1957 we could not raise money on the open market and had to get it from the Local Loans Fund.  But, following that, there was a decline in the demand for dwellings in Dublin.  We reached the stage where it was true to say there were hundreds of houses idle and no one wanted them.  Anybody who did require a dwelling was choosey and decided he would only take a place in town and would not go to Ballyfermot or Finglas.  It is true there were dwellings idle for as long as six weeks at that time, but that is not true today.</P>
      <P>As I said a moment ago, there is not a rathole in Dublin today.  There is a man with six children living out in the open in Finglas today.  He was ejected for owing rent.  It is the usual practice to offer a man shelter, but they have not even shelter.  He is living out there and coming backwards and forwards every morning.  There is not a non-subsidised room in Dublin available from the Corporation.</P>
      <P>It is not true to say that any place is idle today.  Places that are apparently idle are not idle in the sense conveyed. As stated by Deputy Barron, the allocation officer actually lets them the next day.  If he is told on a Monday that such and such a place is vacant, he immediately writes out the next day saying: &ldquo;Madam, we are now prepared to offer you this dwelling.  We give you two days to come in and sign for it.  If not, it will be offered to someone else.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been said, some of them are left in a deplorable condition.  The people to whom they are offered will not take them.  Therefore, the maintenance department has to do up the house.  As has been explained to us, <Col N="949" /> if the carpenters go in, they cannot be in the way of the painters: if the painters go in, they cannot be in the way of the plasterers.  Each team goes in separately.  No matter how you look at it, it will take a month or five weeks before the new tenant arrives.  When the maintenance department is finished, the new tenant is told she may call at any time and collect her key.  Perhaps she will take her time and come in after two weeks. She might have a lot of big furniture to get rid of.  It may take five or six weeks, but the dwelling is let the next day.  Not a dwelling can be had in Dublin city to-day.  So much for that.</P>
    <P>I come now to this statement that one Government provided £6 million and the other Government did not provide more than £1½ million.  The truth is that two or three years ago we had as many as 2,000 vacancies per year.  The people were leaving and going to England in droves because the economic conditions were good in England.  We could not let dwellings outside the city. The Corporation said: &ldquo;All right. Why build houses outside the city if we cannot let them?  It would be a waste of money and we might have dwellings on our hands.  We will never get our money back.  We will leave off building outside the city and we will concentrate on town.&rdquo;  But in town you cannot get sites, because there is such a thing as acquisition and all the delay in acquiring sites.  You cannot do things in a hurry when there is only a limited number of sites.</P>
    <P>For practically two years we were faced with the position that people would not go outside town and we had idle houses out of town.  Suddenly, about 18 months ago, the situation changed again and the people stopped going away, because there was a loss of overtime and because economic conditions changed in Britain.  At the moment, we have 200 large families back from Britain waiting to be housed.  Either they are coming back or not going, or, if they are going, instead of the whole family going only the young people are going, while the parents remain.  This has meant that in the past 18 months Dublin Corporation <Col N="950" /> has been faced with the position that there are relatively few vacancies this year.  The vacancy rate is now about 400 as against 2,250 two or three years ago.</P>
    <P>We, the Dublin Corporation, decided we would not build, because we had houses on our hands.  It was not a question that this Government gave so much and that Government gave only so much.  We were the people.  We decided we would not ask for the money but now we are asking for it. Now that the situation has hardened again and that these people are coming back from England, we will have to gear up again.  I want to inform the Minister we will require twice as much money next year and as much again the following year.</P>
    <P>We are building about 800 houses in the next 12 months, but we hope to build 2,000 in the following two years. We now need 5,000 or 6,000 dwellings urgently.  When you cease doing a thing and start to gear up again, you cannot get into your full stride straight away. You have to work your way up.  We built only a few hundred houses last year, because when planning the previous year we thought we would not need them.  Last year we built approximately 800.  This year we hope to plan for 1,500 or 2,000 in 18 months' or two years' time.  That is the position.  I welcome the Bill and point out to the Minister that Dublin Corporation now requires the money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure to provide additional funds for local authorities.  The provision of additional moneys not alone in Dublin city but throughout the country is a vital necessity.  I am particularly interested in Small Dwellings Act loans.  I see that £27 million has been advanced to private people to buy their own homes. I should like the Minister to consider whether the present rate of interest is conducive to people borrowing.  I should like him to consider whether it would be possible to revise the rate, whether local authorities themselves could help to reduce that rate and whether central funds could not make money available at a somewhat cheaper rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened very carefully to the attack <Col N="951" /> made by the Leader of the Opposition on Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Noel Lemass.  I am sorry they are not here to make their own case.  Whatever the Leader of the Opposition may say, I know from personal experience of the years 1955, 1956 and 1957 that Dublin Corporation did not have the wherewithal to meet their obligations.  They did not have the wherewithal even to honour the loans they approved and granted and I can say from my own personal experience of dealing with Deputy O'Donnell, the then Minister for Local Government, that the money was not there.  You may read and quote figures, but they are the figures from practical experience and, if there was a loss of confidence by private people in building in Dublin under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, it was directly attributable to the Government of 1954-57.</P>
    <P>The economic collapse of those years brought in its train vast emigration and I am in debt to Deputy Sherwin for the facts he has presented to the House this evening in regard to thousands of Dublin Corporation houses being empty.  They did not have the tenants then to occupy them.  However, now we are in a position to authorise further building and I am pleased to hear Deputy Sherwin say that Dublin Corporation have taken active steps.  I hope this measure will enable private builders in Dublin to proceed with greater confidence in getting building under way again.</P>
    <P>One other facility I should like to see extended throughout the country rapidly, despite the careful remarks made by Deputy Dillon, is water supplies where they can be economically installed.  It is real drudgery for a farmer and a farmer's wife when they have to go to a well and haul water.  I think it is one of the reasons why there is so much emigration.  We should make a real effort to see that water supplies are extended to as many homes as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to enter into this controversy as to who is right, who is wrong and who is to blame for the housing situation today.  However, I feel it would be wrong of me not to <Col N="952" /> support what has been said by my colleague of the Dublin Corporation, Deputy Sherwin, in connection with housing in Dublin.  It is perfectly true to say that the situation is absolutely chaotic.  We have a situation existing in the Dublin Corporation in which two very hard pressed officers are trying to allocate houses.  On the one hand there is an officer trying to house people from condemned houses.  Every other day he has to say he has nowhere to put people.  On the other hand, there is an officer dealing with ordinary applications and he is confronted with a similar situation.  There is serious overcrowding in most of the corporation dwellings in Dublin and you will find families sleeping on the floor.  I was glad to hear the opportunity arises now to obtain some money to ease that situation.  It is rather unfortunate that we have to buy money to do something that the people in this city and the country need very badly.</P>
      <P>Listening to some Deputies, I was reminded of the fact that some years ago an organisation of which I happen to be an official set about extending to the Government of the day a £50,000 loan free of interest with a view to inducing other people who had money to follow the line, all with a view to furthering the housing problem but we did not get support in that regard.  There is a tremendous lack of public spirit on the part of a goodly number of the big employers in the city who are getting a lot of money out of this country but are not prepared to put it back in providing for the needs of the people out of whom they are living.  Until such time as these people are made to realise that it would be a reasonable gesture on their part to give loans free of interest or at a reasonable rate of interest to build houses we will have this problem with us because we cannot afford to buy money at the price that is being asked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the rural cottage subsidy.  Up to very recently the higher rate of subsidy, namely, 66? was available for all rural cottages.  That is now being changed and the rate is not based on income but on where the tenant comes from.  Whether they come from over-crowded <Col N="953" /> conditions, from condemned houses, from a house in which there is T.B., on the one hand, or whether they are a young married couple living in one room having no children, on the other hand, determines whether they get the 66? or the 33? subsidy.  This means that an unfortunate farm labourer earning £5 15s., £5 19s. or something like £6 odd if he is in Dublin, is being asked to pay a rent of 25/- a week for a rural unserviced cottage.  While it is true you can have a differential renting system in places like Ballyfermot, Drogheda, Dundalk, and in the cities of Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Cork it is impossible to work any sort of differential renting system in dealing with the farm worker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could have views on that I would have the strongest views on it.  Piped water has been discussed and I presume it is still in order to discuss it.  As the Leader of the Opposition asked, why should there be piped water along country roads when there is an abundance of wells?  Why should a group of people not be able to band together to form a group scheme to provide water for themselves&mdash;not as the Government Deputy stated, buckets of water drawn from a well but water piped into their houses&mdash;rather than that the taxpayer's money should be spent on running a piped water supply along country roads where perhaps there is not a house for half a mile?  I can give an instance of one of these schemes where <Col N="954" /> there are doubts as to whether or not the water has gone stale or is unusable. We deprecate the fact that when there is an issue of money from this Local Loans Fund the Minister who gets the money from the Local Loans Fund issues it in such a way that an unfortunate farm labourer is asked to pay 25/- a week rent.</P>
      <P>With regard to the argument about Dublin Corporation, nothing amuses me more, as a member of two local authorities, than to see this lovely situation whereby a tap can be turned off and a tap can be turned on and whereby at one time Dublin Corporation needs a vast amount of money for housing and another time we are told all the people have gone to England and that we do not require any more money for housing.  Who is running Dublin Corporation?  Is it all the people on one political side?  Is it the City Manager, his officials, or who?</P>

I am quite certain that if the situation suggested by Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Noel Lemass obtained in the year in regard to which they made their allegations, or if even one small part of it obtained, the position would be that you would not have that lessening of demand to such an extent that you would require only half the money in the succeeding years.</P>
      <P>As a member of a local authority, I am fully aware of all the thimble-rigging that goes on with regard to the making of money available from the Local Loans Fund.  I am fully aware that sanction is issued when the money is there and sanction is delayed by the return of plans, and so on, when the money is not in the Local Loans Fund.  I am fully aware of what happens.  I am quite certain that the position in Dublin Corporation is the same as that in every local authority and that you cannot suddenly turn a demand off and on just like turning a tap off and on. For that reason, Deputy Sherwin's statement cannot carry weight.</P>

I have not the reference with me now, but I am quite sure Deputy Dillon will remember that not so long ago in this House I read copies of the letters that passed between the then Government and the City Manager.  What the letters prove conclusively is that the then Government had to make funds available to Dublin Corporation from the Local Loans Fund because the Bank of Ireland refused to accept their guarantee as sound collateral.

The electorate in Dublin South-West, a working-class constituency, by more than six to four condemned the then Government's handling of the situation.  Subsequently, on a motion in this House, the Chairman of the Housing Committee, Councillor Larkin, made quite clear that <Col N="956" /> Fianna Fáil, Deputy Briscoe or myself were not trying to make political capital out of the situation.  What we were trying to do was to prevent house-building in Dublin from coming to a standstill.  The situation actually reached the stage when it was possible that some of the workers might not receive their wages on the following Friday.  That was the situation with which we were faced.

      <P>If it is the earnest intention of the Minister to proceed more expeditiously with the building of houses for those entitled to benefit from the money it is intended to vote today, then I would say that the Minister should impress on his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, the necessity to sanction more readily proposals that come to him from the local authorities.  This week, the Southern Committee of Cork County Council, of which I am a member, felt obliged to hold a meeting to deal with the backlog in relation to submissions from Cork County Council to the Custom House and with the serious housing situation that exists in that area at the moment.  If the action of the House today will have any effect in easing the situation that exists in our area, then we look to the future with some little more hope.  For some years past, we have been frustrated by the manner in which proposals have been shuffled to and fro between the local authorities and the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give an example of our intention in relation to combating all the difficulties that may arise for people in special circumstances, people such as Deputy Sherwin mentioned to us.  We have given great consideration, and our architect has advised us on the matter, to a means of overcoming some of these difficulties.  We have decided to erect an experimental pre-fabricated house, capable of meeting specialised needs, not as an alternative to the better and more permanent type of house but to meet special <Col N="957" /> requirements.  I hope immediate sanction will be given to us to proceed with the erection and testing of this building so that we may employ it for the purposes for which we intend to use it. The outcome of this experiment will be a matter of considerable interest to the local authorities throughout the country, but we are satisfied that for some special purposes, it could be quite useful.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Gallagher, on the other side, and by Deputies on this side, to the recent publicising of, and the emphasis thrown on, the necessity for vast piped water supplies throughout the country. I am in complete agreement with Deputy Dillon's statement that there are parts of the country where individual water supplies cannot be secured, due to the geology of the terrain.  In that connection, I have in mind an extensive area in the present constituency of South-East Cork where there is no alternative to a piped water supply.  We are entitled to ask that proper value be given for any outlay of money from the Central Fund and collected from ratepayers for these water supplies.</P>
    <P>Very many estimates of cost and recoupment of cost are based on a general connection by the people in the areas to these piped water supplies. There was an immediate enthusiasm for the project but it abated somewhat when people who had hoped to be connected realised what the cost would mean to them per annum.  The grants first introduced by Deputy Dillon have been availed of by many thousands of people throughout the country.  Those people who have embarked upon individual water supplies which, generally, are working very effectively, have no intention of abandoning these supplies in order to connect to a scheme which will mean a very considerable outlay per annum for them.  There are many instances where there is no alternative to these schemes, but, generally speaking, the grants available from the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Local Government are being used quite effectively at the moment.  We must be careful not to imply that under this scheme, which <Col N="958" /> the Minister for Local Government has spoken so much about, it will be possible for the local authority to bring supplies to the doors of people who intend to avail of it.  Far from it: we know that in very many instances the nearest point to a pipeline which will be available will be some distance away so that considerable expense will have to be undertaken by the persons hoping to benefit before they do obtain a water supply and afterwards in the operation of it.  We all know that the maintenance of the present local authority schemes of water supplies can be pretty expensive and we know there are also administrative and technical difficulties and, as we know, with the extension of supplies to rural parts, technical difficulties are bound to mount considerably.  It will be more difficult to exercise proper control over rural supplies, to check wastage and other factors that affect supplies as they extend into more and more parts of the country.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I think that anything done in applying these moneys should not be done in any way to the detriment of existing schemes.  Before people are encouraged to connect with those schemes, they should be made aware of the full cost, not alone the capital cost or the cost of the initial stages but also the annual charge for the supply of water and the maintenance of the system in those areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to go on record as favouring the establishment of these water supplies which seem to be, in the main, the subject of discussion this evening.  I am not a member of a local authority but I am as conversant, I think, with conditions in rural areas as the average Deputy and I think there was a crying need for the provision of such supplies down the years.  Up to recent times the usual method of supplying water to people in the country was the sinking of pumps and local authorities were not very generous in that regard.  I know that in my own constituency, the local authority, composed of the three main Parties, had the practice of supplying four pumps per year.  In a county the size of Wexford, that meant that in many areas people would not have <Col N="959" /> even a modest water supply for decades of years yet.</P>
      <P>If this were a scheme that was being imposed on the local authorities, perhaps we might be more critical, but, as I see it, this is the situation.  The Department of Local Government, I suppose, through the Minister for Finance will give 50 per cent. of the cost.  They do not say the local authorities must establish water supplies.  There is no obligation on members of a local authority to engage in the provision of water by this method.  So far as I know, local authority members, in the main, very jealously guard the ratepayers' interest and I should say the majority of public representatives on local authorities are far too conservative when it comes to public expenditure on facilities that people really need.  They are offered 50 per cent. of the cost and they are fools if they do not understand the full implication of the provision of water supplies.  They have their engineers and advisers from the Department of Local Government or from the Board of Works, and if they do not know what this will entail in capital cost, I think it could be said that they are not doing their job properly.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to believe, having heard the speeches so far, that the opposition to these schemes comes mainly from people in rural parts who could afford to avail of the grants given either by the Department of Local Government or by the Department of Agriculture, but so far as the people I know are concerned, in my constituency, the people to whom I talk, my supporters, they would never be able to avail of the scheme that may appear to be generous that is running now either under the Department of Local Government or the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>Under the other scheme, if they wanted to provide themselves with a water supply, they would have to sink their own wells or get it from some other source, and they would have to engage in schemes which would mean having to go down scores and scores of feet before coming across water and which would be very expensive for them.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, the opposition by various organisations in the country is opposition by individuals who have water themselves and who do not want to appear to have to pay twice, either in rates or taxes, to provide water supplies for people who cannot afford it themselves.  I merely want to say&mdash;and I think I speak for my colleagues&mdash;we are fully behind these schemes for the provision of what are termed regional water supplies.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this measure and to say at the outset that anything that will further housing or help to provide more houses for our people&mdash;a number of them are still living in badly dilapidated dwellings&mdash; is to be commended.  People well housed are a contented people and money devoted to housing will eventually pay dividends as it will reduce the money required for new hospitals or the hospitalisation of the people.  It is a very welcome measure and we, on this side of the house, commend it highly.  Despite what some members of the Opposition said, it was from this side of the House that the Act came and down through the years, we have put all our energies into the provision of decent homes for the people so that they can live in decent, frugal comfort.</P>

      <P>Water supplies in rural areas are very essential and as we approach nearer to the Common Market it will be more necessary than ever for farmers' and labourers' houses, and all houses, if at all possible, to be provided with running water.  The means of providing it can be worked out at local authority level or otherwise&mdash;by group scheme, if it is cheaper&mdash;but in the main, it is essential that the schemes now being outlined at various county councils and the surveys being made should be examined and if group schemes could be initiated in areas where it would be impossible to bring a pipe line, so much the better and so much more the saving.  The principle of providing piped water supplies in rural areas is one to be commended.</P>

      <P>I might as well say here and now, if I am to reflect the opinion of my supporters, that my supporters are not in favour of these grandiose piped water schemes.  I know portions of my constituency in which there will have to be piped water schemes because the rock is not the kind that holds the spring, but they are only portions.  In the main, the people in my constituency do not want these piped water schemes because they will be too expensive.  They prefer to look to themselves in group schemes. As far as labourers' cottages are concerned, these have always been built in County Waterford near a source of supply.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy N. Lemass mention the desperate state housing was in in 1957.  He said he was prepared to discuss that with anybody.  As far as housing is concerned, in 1957 the credit of the country was being run down by both Deputy Lemass and Deputy Briscoe, and others of that ilk.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  We had 270 men employed building houses in the city of Waterford in 1957 and we have not 10 employed today.  That is the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> Those who proclaim that nobody builds houses but Fianna Fáil should have a look at the years and the figures. In the short period during which Fianna Fáil were out of office, better and cheaper houses were made available for the people; they were made available for the people in general and not just for Party hacks.  I heard a &ldquo;Heh&rdquo; from the ex-Parliamentary Secretary.  If he wants proof, I shall give it to him.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that we should provide money for houses.  It is a good thing that more money should be voted for that purpose.  Last week I asked the Minister for Local Government was he considering raising the grant to enable private persons to build houses.  I got the usual brush off. I suggest to the Minister that this is the kind of thing to which he should bend his energies from the point of view of providing money.  There has been a considerable rise in building costs over the last eight or ten years. There has been no increase in grants.</P>

      <P>The grants are insufficient in the light of increased costs in both materials and labour.  In 1957, when the Fianna Fáil clap-trap machine was working here, far more houses were built than are being built anywhere today.  We have almost 400 applications for houses in the city of Waterford.  We are not building houses because the terms are so difficult and the costs are so high.  It would not be a good proposition for people who have to live frugally, as a previous Fianna Fáil speaker pointed out.  I was told recently by a contractor that houses built during the period of office of a Government other than Fianna Fáil and let at £1 2s. 6d. per week would cost today £2 per week. I appeal to the Minister to take cognisance of that fact.  It cannot be denied.  Costs have increased.  The grant remains the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to advert to the question of piped water.  In my constituency of South Tipperary we have been pioneers in the provision of water supply schemes.  When we first started there was no rural electrification.  The only source of power was gravitation.  That was the system we adopted.  We have a number of regional schemes drawn up at the moment.  We did hear about group schemes but they seemed to be scrappy.  We thought they might mean a high maintenance charge and that the quality of the water might not be too good in different places.  In general, the supervision of them, if they were non-gravitational, might be more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At our last special water meeting we had, however, a deputation from the National Farmers' Association. They produced a great deal of information based on a considerable amount of work which they had undertaken and now we are not quite sure whether or not we are proceeding on the right lines.  They produced figures and they mentioned that, even on a flat terrain, group schemes based on borings might be more economical and the maintenance cost would not be as high as we thought it would be. We have asked our engineering staff <Col N="964" /> to investigate the question of group schemes which will necessarily in our area be largely borings.  I mention these points because we seem to be proceeding to supply water so far as we can in the rural areas and I think this question of investigation, costings, and general geological survey should be undertaken by a central Government Department and not left to local bodies. When money is being provided for this work that aspect should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked by Deputy Sweetman what amount of money was given out of the Local Loans Fund to the cities of Dublin and Cork.  The amount given to Dublin so far was about £14,000,000 and the amount given to Cork about £3,500,000.  If the amount spent by the Local Loans Fund generally were taken over the last ten or twelve years and the amounts given to these two cities were deducted one gets a different graph from that quoted by Deputy Dillon and others here to-day. In other words, it was the fact that Dublin and Cork were brought into this scheme that created some rather striking figures over the last seven or eight years.</P>
      <P>This Bill, of course, makes no difference whatever to the authority of the elected members of a local body <i>vis-à-vis</i> the manager.  Whatever power they had before with regard to the management of housing, borrowing or any other matter remains as it was.</P>
      <P>While I should like to deal with some points raised, I should like to say at the same time that I am not in a position to deal in detail with housing and water supplies.  These matters would be better raised on the Local Government Estimate or on some other occasion with the Minister for Local Government who would be in a position to give more precise information than I could give.</P>
      <P>I was also asked what was the estimate of the amount that would be needed by the Local Loans Fund.  It is about £8 million a year.  That is what we estimate it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says £8 million, does that include or is it <Col N="965" /> in excess of money that comes into the Local Loans Fund by repayments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; the repayments are not counted.  It is the issues out of it that we are dealing with all the time. When I started off by saying £135 million had been spent, that does not take account of the money repaid.</P>
      <P>There was a very great difference of opinion with regard to Dublin housing.  I myself find it very difficult to understand the needs of Dublin because over the years&mdash;the last ten or 12 years&mdash;every time I see an estimate, it appears to be different from the previous estimate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin went some part of the way to explain why that was the case.  Evidently, as he explained, there was a drift out of these houses for a while.  Many houses were vacant. The Dublin Corporation came to the conclusion, perhaps, that they should not go too fast on building more.  Now the drift is reversed.  There are no houses vacant and Dublin Corporation are proceeding to build very much more rapidly than they have been building for some years past.  As Deputy Sherwin said, they will require twice as much money next year and twice as much again the year after. As far as I am concerned, the money will be available.  I have never even asked the Minister for Local Government to go easy on giving out money and the Minister for Local Government has never, indeed, had occasion to ask me to give him more money. Whatever members of the Opposition may say about there being a sort of hold-up on housing proposals by local authorities, I do not think there is any foundation whatever for the suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher raised the question of interest charges.  The interest charges are subsidised to a great extent out of local funds.  We lend money to the local authorities.  Apart from that, some of the Deputies may not be aware that grants are given for subsidies in order to pay the interest on these loans. The subsidy this year amounts to £2,846,000.  On the housing of the working classes&mdash;as I said in the <Col N="966" /> beginning, I am not too familiar with all the details&mdash;to a great extent the subsidy is two-thirds of the interest payable.  It goes down to one-third in some cases.  On the water schemes, it is 50 per cent.  These subsidies then absorb that amount of almost £3 million per year.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of discussion on the piped water scheme.  Deputy Corish said that some local authorities had asked for this scheme.  The Minister for Local Government, after considering the scheme very carefully, indeed, put it up to me and the Government that he should subsidise them to the extent of half the expenditure. The local authority itself can then finance the other half, either by putting a charge on the people who will benefit or by putting part of it on the rates or all of it on the rates, as the case may be.  As Deputy Corish pointed out, it is for the county council to decide whether to do it or not.  I do not think it was ever visualised, as Deputy Lynch seems to think, that the Minister for Local Government should supply every house in the country.  Deputy Lynch said his supporters in Waterford were against it, except in certain areas where they wanted a supply.  That is the same everywhere: in certain areas, they want it, and in other areas, they do not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned Wexford County Council on which the three political Parties are represented.  I have never known Wexford County Council to have been too generous or too foolish in their spending of money.  They have done a very big scheme in Wexford which was recently opened.  It will cost a large amount of money.  I have heard it discussed several times over the past ten or 12 years because this scheme has been going on for the past ten years.</P>
    <P>It appeared that there was no other way of getting water into the villages or into the labourers' cottages.  They decided in the end that if they did the villages and labourers' cottages, they should give water to the farmers, if they wanted to take it.  That is the scheme as it stands.  I believe that those who take the water are being charged for it.  There will be a certain loss on <Col N="967" /> the scheme&mdash;not a very big one&mdash;which the ratepayers will have to pay for.</P>
    <P>They are a sensible county council. They are by no means an extravagant county council.  They carried out the scheme after great deliberation and I am told that the three political Parties represented on the county council were unanimously in favour of it.  I am very much more impressed by their actions and the need they felt to have that done than I am with the criticism of this scheme by Deputies Dillon, Donegan, Lynch or any other Fine Gael speaker. They all condemned this water supply scheme.</P>
    <P>My observations are not confined to County Wexford alone.  Limerick is another county in which I see one of these water supply schemes going on, too. Where you have these county councils composed of sensible men, men who do not want to spend money foolishly, if they are taking up these schemes, we should see that everything needed is made available to them.  We do not compel them to take up these schemes.  If they want to do so, let them do so and let them be given the subsidy.</P>
    <P>I feel that details in regard to housing and so on could be more profitably raised on another occasion because the Minister for Local Government could better answer the criticisms than I.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to two matters.  There are many charges which fall upon the Local Loans Fund. I always regarded housing as being one of the most significant and important. It is important for this House to realise that, despite all that the present Government's supporters have said in the past, the record reads that the number of houses built with State assistance&mdash; and that includes new houses built by local authorities, new houses built by private persons and public utility societies, new houses built by other authorities&mdash;these three taken together, in 1954 was 11,179; in 1955, 10,490; in 1956, 9,837; in 1957, 10,969, that is, in the year ended 31st March for each of these years.  With the return of the Fianna Fáil Government in March, 1957, the number of new houses built fell to 7,480 in the year 1958; to 4,894 in the year 1959 and to 5,992 in the year 1960, which is the last date for which I have figures available in Table 150 of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> of Ireland, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter I want to mention is this and it is typical of the reckless <Col N="969" /> irresponsibility of an individual like Deputy Noel Lemass.  Can you conceive of a Fianna Fáil Deputy who was Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation, getting up in Dáil Éireann and saying that in 1957 the Government bankers, the Bank of Ireland, refused to accept the guarantee of the Irish Government for a loan for the Dublin Corporation? The statement, of course, is without a shadow of foundation; there is not a scintilla of truth in it but it shows the reckless lengths to which political Party ambition can carry an irresponsible person.  If that were given credence outside this House or if the Deputy bearing the name he does were regarded outside this House as a responsible person, serious damage would be done.  We know what he is.  We know his utter irresponsibility and folly, so we discount what he says but it may be necessary, for the record, to mention that there is not a scintilla of truth in the statement made by Deputy Noel Lemass in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I did not make this contribution on the Second Stage and I trust that what I say is appropriate to Section 2.  I rise because I should like the Minister to give certain assurances and to clarify some things that may at present seem somewhat obscure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a proposal here to reduce what has been regarded as the pilotage area in the Port of Dublin.  I do not think anybody would take exception to that.  At least, I have not heard any criticism against that proposal. <Col N="970" /> There is also a proposal, and I think it is contained in this section, to raise the minimum limits on the tonnage of ships that must have pilots.  Of course, there is a stipulation to the effect that a ship that does not have a pilot and that does not have to pay the full pilotage fees will now make a certain contribution towards the harbour authority but it will mean that there will be a certain number of ships entering and leaving the Port of Dublin that will not be required to have pilots.  I should like to know from the Minister if he can give us an assurance that this proposal will not interfere with what has been up to this the good record of the Port of Dublin as an accident-free port.</P>
    <P>I do not profess any great knowledge of the Port of Dublin, of ships, sailing or harbours.  The Minister has an appreciation of the condition of the harbour around my home town.  In any case, I know that pilots in Dublin and those associated with the Port of Dublin are very proud of that accident-free record and I wonder if as a result of the proposal not to insist on certain ships having pilots we will have a spate of accidents in the port such as we have not had up to this.</P>
    <P>The majority of these ships, I am informed, will be foreign ships.  The Minister and, I am sure, the Dublin Port and Docks Board, have proposed that certain of these ships should not have pilots but I think he should assure the House that this proposal does not mean any grave danger to the ships themselves or to other ships or to the Port of Dublin generally.</P>
    <P>It does seem to me&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister referred to it or not&mdash;that this will necessarily mean a reduction in the number of pilots in the Port of Dublin.  At present there are something like 19 and the proposal contained in Section 2 or some other section will mean that the number of pilots will be reduced from 19 to 12, which is cutting off an avenue of employment for many seafaring men who are well qualified to take up such posts and of whom there seems to be no scarcity at the present time nor <Col N="971" /> does it seem that there will be in future.</P>
    <P>In view of the number of pilots who will be discharged or laid off or whose vacancies will not be filled, there is a proposal for the substitution of what is described as a shore station system.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy, I have been reassured by the pilotage authorities, and our own first-class technical advisers in the Department, that everything will be done to maintain the splendid traditions at Dublin with regard to accidents, and any changes that take place in regard to exemption will be made with the utmost care.  The pilots in general are satisfied with the provisions of the Bill. In so far as the opportunities for employment for seafaring men are concerned, Irish Shipping Limited is growing at such a rate that people who want to go to sea can get employment on Irish ships.  In fact, there is full employment and it is extremely difficult to get certain classes of officers for Irish Shipping.  The fact that some of the pilots will disappear in the process of wastage will not affect the opportunities afforded to Irishmen who want to go to sea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But Section 2 does not do anything but authorise the appropriate authorities to levy pilotage dues <Col N="973" /> in cases in which it was claimed that under the 1913 Act they were exempt. Nobody quite knew whether they were exempt or not, but now it is proposed to make it abundantly clear that after 1st January, they will not be exempt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one exception to that, where a bye-law appears to exempt a ship which was not made to pay pilotage dues under the 1913 Act.  Formerly if such an exemption was given, in that case a bye-law had to be confirmed by the Oireachtas.  In this case, we have the alternative form of Parliamentary control, which is dealt with later in the Bill, whereby the change in the arrangements is published and people can object.  It comes before me for confirmation and is laid on the Table of the House.  That is the one exception.</P>

Are we taking into consideration the fact that the business of the port is growing, and will most likely continue to grow, having regard to our entry into the Common Market and so on?  Furthermore, does the Minister realise that whilst the pilots are satisfied in a general way with this idea, they are still anxiously looking for easement in connection with other matters?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to Section 4, or rather, I should say that I object to it until satisfactory explanations are afforded to me.  There was an obligation heretofore on pilotage authorities to furnish to the Board of Trade &mdash;that would now be our Minister for Transport and Power&mdash;triennial accounts.  This section proposes to abolish that obligation and substitutes an obligation to have these accounts furnished, whenever the Minister for Transport and Power requires.  I do not mind whether they are triennial or quinquennial, but there should be a statutory obligation on the authority to lay accounts before the Minister at stated intervals, so that in the event of failing to do so, the matter would automatically come to the attention of the Minister and subsequently of this House, because there is an obligation on the Minister, when he receives the accounts, to lay them on the Table of the House.  If they did not turn up, some diligent Deputy would raise the question with the Minister as to why they had not been rendered.  Now the Minister can say they have not been rendered because he did not ask for them, if this Bill is passed in its present form.  Under the law as it stands, every three years, the officials of the Minister's Department were in a position to say to the pilotage authority that the Minister must have these accounts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The pilotage authority has to make returns at regular intervals and this section is to end a rather elaborate and archaic provision whereby they furnished this information automatically.  Nobody has ever taken any interest in the matter and it was thought sufficient that the Minister of the day should ask the pilotage authority to deliver to him, in a form he can describe and at intervals, the pilotage returns that have to be prepared each year.  That would mean Deputies could ask a Parliamentary Question and have the returns for a particular year provided for them, if anybody chose to take any interest in them, but nobody has taken any interest in the pilotage returns for as long as anybody can remember.  They continue to be made every year.</P>

      <P>I think that is wrong. These are accounts.  There are two things: there are returns and statements of account.  We all know the <Col N="976" /> pilotage authorities are obscure bodies. Ordinarily, the ordinary citizen does not interest himself in their activities. Yet they handle public money.  You let one of those bodies roll along over a number of years and then you call it to account.  You may discover that somebody has gone off with several hundred pounds.  If there is a triennial obligation on a pilotage authority to furnish accounts, there will be some civil servant in Kildare Street whose job it will be to turn up the appropriate file and say: &ldquo;Here is the account for that year.&rdquo; The knowledge that such an account has to be laid on the table of the Oireachtas, that such an account has to be furnished for each three year period, would prevent abuse arising, but if there is an unfortunate devil falling into defalcation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

Subsection (2) of Section 22 of the 1913 Act says that every pilotage authority shall furnish to the Board of Trade, as the Board directs, a statement of their accounts, etcetera.  We are not repealing that section.  Those accounts will continue to be presented annually.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point here which I should have raised on the previous section.  I understand that Section 4 exempts the Minister from the obligation of laying these pilotage returns before the Oireachtas.  Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Because nobody has ever taken any interest in them; there was never any comment on them and because the returns could be furnished by way of answer to Parliamentary Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree it is a thoroughly unsound principle to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas something which has been habitually within its jurisdiction. There are thousands of returns which are laid on the table of the House in which nobody appears to take any interest, but the obligation to place them in the Dáil Library has prevented the possibility of abuse arising and it is that very precautionary step that has prevented abuses.  If you keep a policeman on the beat there will be no petty crime, and that is a good excuse for taking him off the beat.  But if you do take him off the beat the footpads will get to work, petty crime will return and the poor old lady will be robbed and assaulted.  I want to put it to the Minister that in principle it is unsound. If there has been a statutory obligation on a body of this kind to lay its reports on the table of the House, it is a much better thing to continue that principle because I feel it would operate to prevent abuse in the future. Abuse may creep in which might have <Col N="978" /> been avoided by the simple deposit of that document on the table.  We have civil servants, even Ministers, who are not immune from lack of interest. Homer sometimes nods.  I wonder how many times has the Minister for Tranport and Power asked for the pilotage returns, or would he know if they exist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is quite enough to do in the Department besides reading every document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, and therefore the Minister does not ever ask. There is a duty on somebody to requisition these returns and then that civil servant has the frustrating duty of going around the Department asking who wants to read them and of being told to go to hell.  He has the consolation, however, that when he comes to the Librarian of Dáil Éireann, he is greeted with enthusiasm.  There is one person who applauds his diligence, who acknowledges he has done his job, and that is the Librarian of the Oireachtas. Remove him, and that unfortunate civil servant becomes one of those frustrated persons about whom nobody on God's earth gives a damn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is exaggerating a little.  There are so many returns, and to remove some of the more archaic provisions in the Act whereby documents which are never read must be laid on the table, might mean that people would take more interest in those which it is important to read.  It might make it easier if some of the mass of papers were not there.  Secondly, the Minister for Transport and Power could not refuse to make available pilotage returns if there was any abuse.  It is inconceivable that any Minister who was asked by way of private resolution or Parliamentary Question to make available pilotage returns because of some alleged abuse would refuse to do so. He would be in grave trouble, as the Deputy must admit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10,300,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of this very large Supplementary Estimate is accounted for by four items: payments on dairy produce; payments on bacon; guarantee payments under the Bovine Tuberculosis <Col N="981" /> Eradication Scheme on cattle and beef; and payments made as a result of the arrangements in respect of the 1960 wheat crop.</P>
    <P>During 1961, serious falls have occurred in the prices received for our main agricultural exports to Britain. At the same time, our own agricultural output has been on the increase, so that, in 1961, we have exported more dairy produce, bacon, cattle and beef than in previous years.  The derangement of commodity prices in the export market has given rise to serious problems.  The prices which our producers receive, including any element of support from the Exchequer, are moderate, and in some case even rather low, by European standards.  If the taxpayer did not provide some element of support, there would have been a most serious fall in the prices received by our producers for our principal exports&mdash;a development which would have been so injurious to our agriculture, and indeed to our whole economy, that it could not be contemplated.</P>
    <P>It is only right and equitable that, in times of very depressed market prices, the agricultural industry should receive a reasonable degree of price assistance from the resources of the economy in general, even though, as on this occasion, the total cost of providing such assistance even at a moderate level can be considerable.  I say this in the knowledge that, in addition, a sum of over £20 million is also being spent by the State in the present financial year on forms of assistance other than price support, that is on measures to increase productivity and cut costs.  This year, indeed, total financial assistance to agriculture will be an all-time record. I believe that this assistance is justified both in equity and on general economic grounds, though, in an agricultural country like ours, I am not saying that such expenditure can increase without limit.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, a considerable proportion of the amount sought in this Supplementary Estimate is required to finance the difference between very low export prices and the moderate prices which we have undertaken that our farmers should receive. Why have export prices come <Col N="982" /> down to such low levels?  This is a very complex matter, but one of the main reasons is the lack of coordination between national agricultural policies throughout Europe&mdash; and, indeed, all over the world.  Agricultural productivity in many countries has increased considerably since the war, and production has been inflated in a number of countries, particularly the larger industrial importing countries, by various forms of protectionism ranging from extremely high guaranteed prices to their own farmers to rigid import control.  It follows, therefore, that at the very time when more food is being produced in the world, there are fewer opportunities for international trade in agricultural products at prices bearing any kind of reasonable relationship to cost of production.</P>
    <P>It would, however, be a pessimistic policy to assume that these rather chaotic market conditions will continue indefinitely.  International efforts are being made, both in the context of the Common Market and on a wider scale, to try and solve this acute problem of alleged surpluses of food.  This country will play a full part in all such discussions.</P>
    <P>As you are aware, the British Government yesterday made an Order imposing an anti-dumping duty on Irish butter because we found ourselves unable to accept as equitable their request that our exports in the six months ending 31st March, 1962, be restricted to 4,000 tons, while some other countries were allocated quotas which, so far as we can see, will enable them to export about the same quantity of butter to the British market as they would have exported were there no restrictions.  I do not think that we have taken an unreasonable attitude in dealing with this problem, and, indeed, we have at all times expressed ourselves as very ready to enter into any fair and reasonable arrangement under which all countries concerned would agree to submit to an even burden of restrictions for the purpose of improving the market for butter.  I do not think that I need go into this question in any more detail, as the full facts have been published in the White Paper which has been circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> The payment on wheat which is provided for in the Supplementary Estimate (K. 15) relates to the 1960 crop, of which only some 29 per cent. was used for milling.  As there is to be a debate tomorrow in regard to wheat, I do not think that the House will expect me to deal with this question in detail today.</P>
    <P>The bill for the guarantee payments under the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme on cattle and beef in the present financial year (K.K. 11) is a very big one, but I believe that these payments have enabled farmers to get rid of a very considerable number of reactors without having to face the prospect of serious losses, and that, as a result, the position of the country with regard to bovine tuberculosis has improved considerably.  The bill, of course, would have been very much less were it not for the fact that, from about the end of May, 1961, until fairly recently, cattle prices fell to extraordinarily low levels in Britain, for reasons which are not altogether clear.  At the stage which we had reached in bovine tuberculosis eradication in 1961, farmers would, undoubtedly, have undergone very heavy losses in the summer and early autumn if they had to take only the export market price for their uncertified fat cattle.</P>
    <P>Among the other items in the Supplementary Estimate is £160,000 for the Farm Buildings Scheme and £118,000 for the Lime and Fertilisers Subsidies.  The increased provision for farm buildings is due largely to the recently increased rates of grant for piggeries and cowbyres and for the repair of farm buildings generally. The increased cost of the lime and fertilisers subsidies is due partly to an increase in the subsidies on potash and ground limestone which were announced in the 1961 Budget and partly to the fact that the use of ground limestone, after declining for some years, has shown an increase this year; in fact, deliveries of ground limestone in June, July and August, 1961, at 155,000 tons were about double the quantity delivered in the same period of 1960.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also <Col N="984" /> contains provision for an increase in the Grant-in-Aid to An Foras Talúntais from £450,000 to £500,000.  In view of the expansion of the Institute's activities the original estimate did not prove to be sufficient.</P>
    <P>The item of £21,200 for Agricultural Schools and Farms relates to the purchase of a farm adjoining the Munster Institute at Cork which we had been renting for a considerable number of years.  This is a very useful acquisition.</P>
    <P>The figure for artificial insemination represents a grant to the North Eastern Cattle Breeding Society similar to, but on a smaller scale than, the grant previously given to the North Western Cattle Breeding Society.  Conditions in the areas covered by each of these Societies warranted some assistance of this kind.  My Department's A.I. Station at Ballyhaise Agricultural School has of course ceased operations with the coming into existence of the North Eastern Cattle Breeding Society. This is in accordance with our policy of transferring the operation of the A.I. service from the State to co-operative societies.</P>
    <P>The token increase in the provision in K.3 for payments to the Agricultural Credit Corporation relates to the recently announced scheme of loans for repair of farm out-offices damaged by storm.  Loans repayable over 15 years and bearing interest at the low rate of 2 per cent are being advanced by the Corporation for this purpose.  The difference between the normal interest rate and the 2 per cent charged on these loans is made up by the Exchequer. In addition to these loans, grants for repair of storm damage are also available under the Farm Buildings Scheme.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the Supplementary Estimate also provides for an increase in the contribution to the Irish Countrywomen's Association and for a contribution to Macra na Feirme.  These two voluntary organisations are doing excellent work, and I believe that it is only right that the State should give them financial support.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate represents a big bill.  The original net Estimate <Col N="985" /> for Agriculture together with the net amount of this Supplementary Estimate, will total no less than £26,445,000.  This is one measure of the assistance which the Government are prepared to give to agriculture, and it is a proof of their confidence in the future of the industry.  With all the marketing difficulties we have to contend with, agriculture in this country is going ahead.  Under the stimulus of the very considerable assistance which is now being given for the purpose of increasing agricultural productivity, cutting costs and affording a moderate element of price support, agricultural production, both in volume and in value, in 1961 will be a record.  The value and volume of total agricultural exports in 1961 should also be a record.</P>
    <P>It is estimated by the Central Statistics Office that the value of gross agricultural output in 1961, including stock changes, should be about £9 million higher than in 1960, and the value of net output about £8 million higher; if stock changes are excluded the estimated figures are £16 million and £15 million respectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say the Minister's statement seems to me to be a most dismal fiasco.  I want, however, to ask him one net question of a technical character which perhaps he will avail of his concluding remarks to answer specifically.  What proportion of the £10.3 million now bespoken in this Supplementary Estimate is being treated as capital?  I notice the Minister concludes his observations by saying the farmer's income is rising.  The plain fact of it is that the farmer's income in the last ascertainable year stands at about the same figure as it stood at in 1957; yet the cost of living was 135 in 1956, mid-August.  It then went up to 143.  In 1958, it went up to 146; in 1959, it went back again to 144; in 1960 it went up again to 146; in 1961, it went up to 151, and we have not got the cost of living figure for the November quarter which should be published in the course of the next three or four weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plain truth is, however, as the Minister well knows, that the income of the farmers, especially the small <Col N="986" /> farmers, has at best remained static, while their cost of living has steeply increased.  The consequence is, as every Deputy on every side of the House who has any familiarity with rural Ireland knows, that the country is now dotted with abandoned homesteads and there is growing undoubtedly in the Fianna Fáil Party a tendency to declare that the day of the small farmer is gone, that we ought to wipe him out.  It is a pernicious, detestable doctrine into which this country should never suffer itself to be deluded because if we accept the proposition that the small farmer is of no value to this country, socially and economically, we are writing the death warrant of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>There is no other country in Europe falling for that fraudulent cackle.  There are more small farmers in Denmark, in Holland and in Germany than there are in Ireland; yet they can prosper there and nobody suggests that their continued presence constitutes an economic or social problem for these nations.  They appreciate their true worth and are solicitous to protect them and to preserve them.  It is only in this country that we seem to regard it as the norm that the small farmers should first be reduced to beggary and then be driven out of the country to become hewers of wood and drawers of water in the industrial slums of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I reject that philosophy.  I declare it to be fundamentally wrong and suicidal from the national point of view both socially and economically.  I am convinced that if we go the right way about it the small farmers of Ireland can be made just as productive as the small farmers of Denmark, Holland, Germany or France.  I believe that the farmer with 35 or 40 acres of land in Ireland, if it is properly used, can get for himself and his family an income of close to £1,000 a year, if he uses the land to the best advantage and knows the best methods of getting the maximum return from his land and the labour he expends upon it.</P>
    <P>But unless and until we can bring to the farmers of this country the means and knowledge and credit facilities to do that, we have no one but ourselves <Col N="987" /> to blame if the small farmers of Ireland find themselves progressively squeezed out of their own country and forced out to earn wages in the industrial cities of England and elsewhere. It is madness, madness socially and economically, for us to stand by and let that happen.  It is a humiliation to me that our Department of Agriculture, over which I was proud to preside for six years, should be forced to stand by and contemplate that national catastrophe materialise without being afforded the opportunity of doing what they are well equipped to do to enable the small farmers of this country to play their full part in our national life.</P>
    <P>When the history of this country comes to be written it will be discovered that the most precious social asset this country has are the small property-owning farmers of Ireland. They are the sheet-anchor of stability in our society.  If they are driven out of existence and their farms consolidated and they are allowed to return only as tenants or labourers on that land, we shall have reversed the issue of the Land War and it is only when that is done that we shall discover the noxious evil that will follow in the train of any such catastrophic decision.</P>
    <P>The farmers of this country are getting poor.  Everybody in Ireland seems to know that except the Minister for Agriculture.  I often wonder if there is any means by which we can carry home to his mind the knowledge which everybody else has but which he does not seem to share.  I have been criticised for asking the citizens of Dublin to vote against Fianna Fáil because I said that Fianna Fáil made the farmers poor.  People shrugged their shoulders and said: &ldquo;How can you expect them to know anything about it?&rdquo; There is one very dramatic piece of evidence to corroborate the truth of that proposition.</P>
    <P>There is a large Fianna Fáil draper in Dublin&mdash;who shall be nameless, of course.  He used to run excursions&mdash;&ldquo;X's&rdquo; excursions&mdash;to bring the farmers up to Dublin.  He did not bring them up for the love of their lovely blue eyes.  He brought them up to Dublin because they had money to spend and he wanted to get his share <Col N="988" /> of that spending power.  You will notice that since Fianna Fáil came back to office there are no &ldquo;X's&rdquo; excursions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Within reason.  I avail of this opportunity to express surprise that the Government so do their business that they consider it necessary to circulate a Supplementary Estimate for £10.3 million to the Dáil on the morning of the day on which they ask the Dáil to take it into consideration. It is a measure of the Opposition's desire to help a rather floundering administration that we are now discussing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister, however, when he speaks of increased output and the volume of agricultural output, as supplied to him by the Central Statistics Office, that that is the kind of claptrap that a Minister, if he knew his business, ought not to suffer himself to be deceived by.  Such statistical returns may have their value. What matters to anybody who cares about this country and the people who live on the land is the circumstances of the individual families who live and get their living from the land.  They do not depend on gross output.  They depend on the profit they earn from their <Col N="990" /> labour.  That can be affected by two things.  It can be affected by price fluctuations in the world which I readily concede can often be a factor over which our Minister for Agriculture has little or no control.  It can also be affected by the cost of living which impinges upon these small farmers and that is something over which our Government has a very direct control.  This Fianna Fáil Government has steadily forced it up and they are turning our farmers into paupers and emigrants.  I protest most emphatically against that.</P>
    <P>Several topics have been raised specifically, in accordance with the subheads of this Supplementary Estimate. There is no use in our closing our eyes to the fact that the gravest by far is the announced decision of the British Government to levy a penal tariff on Irish exports of butter to Great Britain, details of which appear on the papers today and in respect of which the Minister has issued a White Paper.  I want to say with a great deal of deliberation that this occasion is one of such gravity for the whole economy of Ireland and for the good relations which should exist between our people and the British people that I most deliberately eschew the employment of whirling words of violent language. Yet, I am obliged to put to the Minister for Agriculture certain considerations arising out of this decision by the British Government which do not seem to me to have been recorded in the White Paper which he has circulated and which I find it hard to believe he did not raise with the British Government when, as I understand, he went to London to argue this matter with them.</P>
    <P>The British Government have announced that they propose to put a duty of 200-odd shillings per cwt. on Irish butter exported to Great Britain because we demur to their proposal that we should be restricted to a total export of 4,000 tons of butter between now and 31st March next.  Our total exports of butter to Great Britain in 1960 amounted to 7,000 tons.  I do not know what level our exports of butter to Britain in 1961 are running at; I take it that the figures contained in the appendix to the White Paper circulated <Col N="991" /> by the Minister relate to calendar years.  Would I be correct in that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look at the terms of the Trade Agreement negotiated between this country and Great Britain in 1948.  In the Agricultural Annexe to that Agreement there is a special paragraph dealing with butter, paragraph (g), which sets out that the Government of the United Kingdom undertake to import butter from Ireland at the annual prewar rate of 20,000 tons or more if available at prices to be fixed by negotiation between the two countries as soon as the possibility of exports arises.</P>
      <P>In Article V of that Agreement, the Government of the United Kingdom</P>
      <P>. . . undertake that where goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland, are dutiable at preferential rates of duty, they will not vary the existing preferential treatment of these goods in such a way as to put any class of goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland, at a disadvantage in relation to goods of that class from other sources enjoying preferential treatment.</P>
      <P>That is contained in the Trade Agreeement, the first Article of which reads:</P>
      <P>Having regard to the wish of the Government of the United Kingdom to obtain increased quantities of cattle, eggs, and potatoes and to resume as soon as possible the traditional imports from Ireland of bacon, butter . . .</P>
      <P>I find it hard to see how the action of the British Government in imposing a duty of over 200/- per cwt. on our butter is not in direct conflict with the terms of that Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision under that Trade Agreement that if either party wishes to abrogate it, it is open to them to do so on tendering six months' notice to the other party.  Nor do we forget that under that same Trade Agreement, Britain bound herself at the time it was negotiated to furnish us with certain specified quantities of coal&mdash;<Col N="992" /> that is in Article 6&mdash;and shortly afterwards the British Government found themselves in a position of acute difficulty and they were unable to get the coal to fulfil that agreement on their part and, on their submitting that difficulty to us, my recollection is that we substantially waived that provision on the ground that we fully accepted their good faith and firm intention of doing what they undertook to do but which they had found themselves temporarily unable to perform.</P>
    <P>I find it very hard to believe, with my experience of negotiating with the British Government of that time and since, not only personally but through officers of my Department, that we would meet in London an attitude of entire indifference to the obligations of that Trade Agreement and the obligations mutually borne by both parties to so old a trade association as that which has existed between ourselves and Great Britain.  It seems fantastic that we should be described as dumpers of butter in the British market when it is demonstrably true that we were selling butter in the British market before certain countries which came to be its main suppliers now were even discovered and that we have been suppliers of butter to Britain down through the ages.</P>
    <P>I say that very deliberately I want to refrain from the expression of any sentiment that might make the situation more complex than it already is. I speak as one who has been consistently concerned for the maintenance of the most cordial relations between ourselves and the people of Great Britain, an attitude for which I make no apology here or elsewhere. I have never concealed my view in public that I regard cordial political and trade relations between this country and Great Britain as being of infinite value to both of us and, speaking in that role, I cannot refrain from saying that if it had been announced in the British House of Commons that it was proposed to impose a duty of virtually 100 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on a substantial export from Yugoslavia, Poland, or Czechoslovakia or Guinea, there would have been an outcry of indignant protest from various interests in Great Britain who would have seen <Col N="993" /> in this a gesture of monstrous indifference to the interests of a friendly power.</P>
    <P>The main distinction seems to be that we sit with Great Britain as fellow members of the Organisation for European Economic Development with the astonishing result, as we discovered, that Great Britain declares what almost amounts to an economic war with us.  I deplore that; I think the decision taken by the British Government and the form of its announcement is regrettable in the extreme.  I would warmly urge on our Government to adopt whatever measures may be necessary to restore the position and, in that regard, I do not think it would be unseemly for us to realise that Great Britain has her difficulties also.</P>
    <P>We all know that Great Britain is engaged in delicate negotiations in regard to the Common Market in respect of which New Zealand is peculiarly sensitive at the present time.  We can understand the desire of Great Britain to spare the feelings of New Zealand and give her every reassurance of their solicitude on trade matters of vital interest to her.  We are aware that Great Britain, involved in the same negotiations, and linked to Denmark, under the European Free Trade Area is anxious to afford Denmark the most earnest reassurances of British good will and solicitude for her economic interest.  Her obligations to Poland and some of the other countries mentioned are not so immediately manifest but we must face the fact that the unfortunate origin of this 4,000 tons proposal, which we have rejected, was an <i>obiter dictum</i> handed out by the secretary of GATT who knew &ldquo;sweet Fanny Adams&rdquo; about the problem that he was dealing with but who, I have no doubt, concentrated eagerly on the material supplied by the Central Statistics Office of GATT which told him that the average annual sale of butter in Britain was such and such and that he averaged these figures and produced out of his hat this marvellous proposal which nobody approves and which had only one thing to commend it&mdash;that it was universally rejected by everyone.</P>
    <P>But it did provide some kind of <Col N="994" /> yardstick eagerly seized upon by the British Government because it had this characteristic, that it gave New Zealand everything she wanted, New Zealand having been the only Power that consistently said that she did not want to discuss any equitable distribution of butter imported for the British market at all.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has any experience of dealing with international organisations knows that it is the ambition of the international civil servant to be friendly with the bad dog.  I have a healthy respect for the negotiating capacity of my old friend, Mr. Holyoake, who is now Prime Minister of New Zealand and whose zeal and courage and resource in the defence of the interests of his own people have often commanded my admiration at international conferences where he used to appear as&mdash;I think&mdash;Minister for Agriculture of New Zealand at one time.  He is certainly Prime Minister now.</P>
    <P>The GATT proposal provides that New Zealand will be entitled to send actually 11,000 tons more this year, I think, than it sent in the period 1934 to 1938.  I cannot vouch for that figure, but it certainly provided a ratio which was very acceptable, naturally and understandably, to New Zealand. It is very understandable that in that context the British Government grasped at a straw, a straw which would shift from their own shoulders the responsibility of portioning out between a large number of friends the available butter market in Great Britain.  The unfortunate fact is that every one of the 15 or 16 other countries participating in this butter market in Great Britain found themselves prepared to accept the GATT provision and we were forced into the difficult situation of being the only one to say we could not accept it and regarded it as a matter of principle to reject it.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister for Agriculture that, understandable as that attitude was, is it not desirable that we should try to break the deadlock? The British Government are in the difficult position of being committed to this scheme which makes <Col N="995" /> provision for only 4,000 tons from Ireland.  Everybody else has accepted it for reasons that we well understand, because, under it, most of them have got all they wanted, and some rather more than they had hoped for. Admittedly, we have got the worst part of the deal.  But we have got our Trade Agreement.</P>
    <P>Is there no means of saying to the British Government that we do not want to embark on a period of virtual warfare between us, arising from no ill-will on either side, tracing its origin to a proposal which did not originate either here or in Great Britain, but which was made by a third party with little knowledge of the traditional trade patterns involved and eagerly adopted by 15 of the interested countries, of which we are the 16th?  Is there no means of saying that there remains a clear obligation on the British Government under the 1948 Trade Agreement, which they have indicated no intention of abrogating and which we do not want to see abrogated?  Could we not consider some such figure as 4,000 tons for the purpose of maintaining their face, if needs be, on the understanding that at an early date that figure would be reviewed and, under our special trading relations with Northern Ireland, where a large proportion of our total export butter goes, a <i>modus vivendi</i> might not be discovered between now and March which would enable a satisfactory trading in this butter to be resumed on terms which did not involve a penal tariff which, whatever the British Government intended, must leave a deep sense of grievance in this country, if it is persisted in.</P>
    <P>I want to go on record as saying that, if we make any mistake in our method of marketing our butter abroad, it is that we are too honest.  By that, I mean that, if we provide an export subsidy, we do it for all the world to see, and make no bones about it.  I assert that there is no country in the world exporting butter to Great Britain today that is not substantially subsidising its exports.  The difference between our method and that of the other countries is that they conceal their methods of export subsidies.  In New <Col N="996" /> Zealand, I believe the device is a loan. You lend the money; you do not give it.  In Denmark, the device is, I believe, a headage subsidy related to cows, not butter.  In other countries, the subsidy method is so devious and difficult to follow that no one but a professional economist and statistician can understand it, much less describe it, but in each case it operates effectively as an export subsidy.</P>
    <P>It is all nonsense to say that we are dumping butter at cut-throat prices. We would be delighted to take 460/- for butter, if anyone would give it to us.  It gives us no pleasure to sell butter at 215/- per cwt.  I can never understand the mentality of people who talk about our dumping butter. We have not the slightest desire to dump butter.  We believe butter is worth 460/- per cwt., but that belief does not persuade anybody else to pay us that sum.  Like anybody else trading in the markets of the world, we have to take what we can get for our butter.</P>
    <P>Now we are not being asked to take what we can get.  We have been suddenly informed that in order to get access where we have traded for the past ten centuries&mdash;and we must be the only country in the world that can make that claim; we have probably traded in butter in Great Britain for at least ten centuries&mdash;we will have to pay an import duty of close on 100 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> before we are allowed to trade there at all.</P>
    <P>These considerations might give rise to expressions of furious indignation if we dwelt on them excessively.  I do not think that indignation can do anything on either side to help resolve this deplorable situation.  A Davenport may cheer from the back benches of the Tory Party but we have our own lunatics in Dáil Éireann, too.  Every group has its share of daft individuals.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that in the British Government we need have any reason to apprehend sentiments of enmity to this country.  I believe that, by and large, the leaders of public opinion in Great Britain are as anxious for cordial relations between ourselves and them as we are.  Speaking as one who has spent most of his public life in the effort to promote good relations between our people and the British <Col N="997" /> people, I earnestly hope and pray that a way may be found out of the present impasse and that the normal trade between us may be restored at the earliest possible time.  The all-important thing, in my respectful submission, is for both sides to avoid taking up inflexible positions now.  The sooner a degree of flexibility is restored to this situation on the basis of mutual goodwill, the sooner, I believe, it should be possible to resolve what is a most distressing and deplorable situation.</P>
    <P>I think it is a strange world in which we live&mdash;we talk about dumped butter and surpluses of food&mdash;when we turn to the news bulletin of the International Federation of Agricultural Producers for October, 1961 and find on Page 4 a headline which reads: &ldquo;People outgrow food production.&rdquo; We have just had a session of F.A.O. in Rome where some of my old and valued colleagues have been waving the Malthusian flag again.  I.F.A.P. warns us: &ldquo;People outgrow food production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the next part of it, on the same page of the news bulletin of I.F.A.P.?  It is: &ldquo;More grains, more butter, more sugar.&rdquo; The last page of the bulletin of the I.F.A.P. is devoted to F.A.O. commodity forecasts:</P>
    <P>There is an unmanageable surplus of wheat.  The 1961-62 season begins with 3,000 million bushels of excess corn.  The coffee surplus at the start of this season is at least 3.5 million tons.  Cocoa production this year will be higher than last year.  The surplus of cotton at the start of this season is 2.2 million bales.  The shorter outlook for sugar is basically bearish because of a sharp increase in 1961.  The increases in butter production last year again resulted in serious problems.  Rice in the past year has been at its highest post-war level and North American beef production will increase.</P>
    <P>Yet on Page 2 the Lords Boyd-Orr, Russell and every daft peer of the peerage is disinterring the hoary body of Malthus to warn us all that we must sterilise one half of the population and introduce the remaining half to the methods of birth control for <Col N="998" /> fear we might beget too many children and be eaten out of house and home. Yet, after they have all delivered their impassioned orations in Rome, ask them to look around them and consider that if their fathers or their grandfathers were as lily-livered as they themselves, they would never have been born.  They do not acclaim that sobering thought.  They are always wanting somebody else not to be born but none of them wants to avoid being born himself.</P>
    <P>In that situation, we are constrained to speak here of unmanageable surpluses while O.E.E.C., F.A.O., U.N.O., G.A.T.T. are prepared to produce masses of paper but ask them to transport one stone of surplus from a source of origin to the hungry multitude and they throw up their hands in despair and say it is impossible, but if there was a pint of oil situated in the most inaccessible recess of the Sahara Desert requiring the investment of countless millions to bring it to some Mediterranean port, it would be done in the flash of an eye.  Yet we are told that the surplus production of this country constitutes a menace internationally and requires the output of something approximating an economic war between our people and the British people with whom we have been trading for a thousand years.  If this is not the language of madness, I do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>But, the urgent necessity at the moment is that this impasse be ended and that friendly resolution of what appears to be insoluble should be found.  I think it can be found; I think it should be found and I think it can only be found by both sides to the present situation making it abundantly clear that neither wants to have &ldquo;face&rdquo; involved but that both are concerned to make concessions in order to restore the <i>status quo</i> so that the future may proceed&mdash;on the kind of lines that most people, I believe, wish it to do.</P>
    <P>I could say more on this subject but I do not propose to say any more because I think I have said enough to make it quite clear what our view is and I do not think it is necessary for me to re-emphasise to the Minister the extreme gravity of this situation if it is not corrected forthwith, as I believe it can <Col N="999" /> and should be, by goodwill on both sides.</P>
    <P>The export figures to which the Minister has referred do not strike me as being peculiarly exciting.  Our exports of cattle in 1957, taking fats and stores together, amounted, as far as I can find out, to 551,600 head.  In 1960, taking fats and stores together, the total exports amounted to something like 380,200.  I find it hard to believe, and yet the statistics seem to suggest, that our total exports of butter in 1957 amounted to 315,900 cwts. and in 1960 to not quite half that, to 150,400 cwts.  What I find it even more difficult to understand is that our exports of bacon and ham, which were 305,500 cwts. in 1957, rose to 579,500 cwts. in 1958 and are now running, in the year 1960, at 458,400 cwts.  I thought they had increased.  Possibly in 1961 they will show that increase but these figures would not suggest that, and that in spite of the fact that in 1960 the subsidies on exports of fat cattle to Great Britain were very substantial; they amounted to £2,080,000 on 172,000 head and the export subsidy on beef was £1,761,000 on 721,000 cwts.</P>
    <P>It is borne in mind, of course, that both those subsidies were got as a device for stimulating the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme but at the same time it is well to remember that, so far as I know, it is the first time in our history, since the economic war in any case, that we have ever subsidised exports of cattle to Great Britain and it represents a significant departture from the record that we had maintained so far.</P>
    <P>This Estimate is of so wide application that we could discuss the whole agricultural industry relevantly in connection with it.  I do not propose to do that because I want to highlight the matters to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I do want to point out that while I welcome increased appropriations for An Foras Talúntais and the work that it is doing, there is no use doing research in this country if we have no effective machinery to bring the fruits of that research to the farmers of this <Col N="1000" /> country so that it can be used for the expansion of production.</P>
    <P>I want to say that at present over a great part of this country there is no effective advisory service and it is a matter of the utmost urgency that such should be provided.  I travel through the country a great deal and see with horror the thousands of acres now that are under rushes and scutch grass that are really going back to the mountain for the want of the knowledge on the part of the people who own it as to how best it could be used.  I see with horror and dismay hard working men working twelve and fourteen hours a day for seven days in the week and getting a return for their labour not much more than 50 per cent. of what it ought to be because their hard labour is not illuminated by the knowledge and skill which modern techniques would make it possible for them to avail of.</P>
    <P>The more I consider this problem the more convinced I am that without an adequate national agricultural advisory service we can make no real progress to getting from the land of Ireland much more than one-half of what it is capable of producing.  That is a catastrophe from the point of view of the nation as a whole but it is a disaster from the point of view of the farmers themselves.</P>
    <P>It would be outside the scope of this Supplementary Estimate to examine the whole question of marketing but I am satisfied that in the years that lie ahead, despite the Lords Boyd-Orrs and the Lords Russells of this world, there will be a growing demand from a growing world population for the kind of food that this country is peculiarly equipped to produce.  I am convinced that as the free countries of the world, unite in a developing Common Market, which will ultimately include the United States of America, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and all the free countries of the world, it will cease to be true that mankind would be prepared to spend millions to bring oil from the centre of the Sahara and yet refuse to spend shillings to bring food to the hungry of the world.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am convinced that a competent programme of expanded production on the land of Ireland <Col N="1001" /> would be amply justified.  I am convinced we have the men; we have the land; we have the climate and we have the know-how.  The one thing that is lacking is the machinery to bring these things together for the advantage of us all.  For some strange reason, the present Minister for Agriculture has had hitherto an insurmountable prejudice against any effective plan to achieve that end.  The tragedy is that the people who are most likely to benefit most from it have themselves a strong prejudice, which has to be overcome, against modern methods and advice as to how best to use them on their own holdings.  Any sensible Minister for Agriculture would accept that fact and seek to surmount it.</P>
    <P>I see with something approaching despair the agricultural community of this country growing poor and I see the growing disaster of a rising generation turning its back upon the land. If that is allowed to happen, then as certainly as we are in this House, the national sovereignty of this country will disappear.  Unless the land of Ireland is made to play its part in the economy of Ireland, Ireland as a separate entity cannot survive.  I am certain that the land of Ireland can and should play a great role, not only in the economic but in the social life of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish that we on this side of the House had the opportunity of putting our hands to that task.  When we had that opportunity, we had no reason to be ashamed of our record.  It may be a year or two before we get the chance again.  In the meantime, I wish the Minister for Agriculture we have at present would do something, or else make way for a colleague who is somewhat less somnolent than he.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest against the fact that this Supplementary Estimate was circulated only this morning and that any of us who wanted to address himself to this figure of over £10 million did not get the opportunity that should have been afforded to him to do so.  This sort of thing can perhaps result in any one of these subheads going through without a proper examination.  When we are <Col N="1002" /> dealing with that amount of money, paid by the taxpayer, it is not only desirable but a very good thing that the attention of all members of the Opposition should be focussed on the various subheads.  I know that the Department of Agriculture and the Civil Service are not guilty of this, but I feel that the Government should either have ordered this business after a proper opportunity had been given to the Opposition to consider it, or alternatively, should have circulated the terms of the Supplementary Estimate at least on Monday morning, rather than on Wednesday morning.</P>
      <P>The first thing I should like to emphasise is that there has been no increase in the sale price of agricultural produce as notified to us by the Statistics Office, since 1953.  In fact, the figure fluctuates from month to month and one must compare month with month.  The last figure I saw indicated that the farmer was getting 97 per cent. of the price he was getting for his agricultural produce in 1953.  When this Supplementary Estimate has been passed, I presume, with the unanimous approval of the House, the farmer will still be getting only 97 per cent. of the price he got in 1953.  We must remember, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, that his cost of living has increased to an extraordinary extent. The figures have been given and there is no point in giving them again.  As well as that, the cost of his production has increased to an extraordinary extent.  The cost of his machinery and the maintenance of his machinery has increased; the cost of his oil has increased and the cost of his raw materials; the cost of fertilisers, even with the subsidy, has also increased since 1953.  It must also be remembered that whatever one says about gross agricultural output, we all live on profit and the farmer's profit has been steadily depleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This could be defined as a rescue operation, unfortunately a rescue operation, for our basic industry.  The only hope is that the extraordinary situation as far as international agricultural prices are concerned will not continue. I do not at all accept that a part of <Col N="1003" /> this total Supplementary Estimate would have been necessary, if the Government had carried out the job they undertook to do in 1957 with regard to agricultural marketing.  For instance, when one considers the very necessary subsidy on the marketing of dairy produce, one asks what funds were made available by the Minister from 1957 to the present day to enable diversification to take place in the production of milk products.</P>
    <P>Did the Government, since 1957, place at the disposal of the co-operative societies capital funds at low interest rates to enable them to set up, for instance, machinery to make chocolate crumb, as advised by the Committee on the Marketing of Dairy Produce, or to produce a distinctively Irish cheese?  Did the Minister do these things or did he not do them?  If he did not do them, what did the Government mean in 1957 when one of the changes they made in a group of Estimates was to include the figure of £250,000 for agricultural marketing? In reply to a question some months ago by Deputy Lynch of Waterford, before the general election, the information elicited from the Government was that in fact all that had been spent were the expenses of the advisory committees on occasional trips to investigate conditions in Britain or elsewhere, amounting to about £7,000.</P>
    <P>If one looks at this Estimate in a Party political critical way, one must point to the fact that the Government have not done anything to change the situation since 1957, that if we now find ourselves in the storm, we have not been provided with great lifeboats or great ships, either.  We must weather the storm in exactly the same situation as we were when the Government, then in Opposition, and particularly the present Minister for Transport and Power wailed for two or three years about agricultural marketing and voted a quarter of a million pounds for it and have since done nothing about it.</P>
    <P>With regard to losses in bacon, I do not accept that they would have been so great if the Minister or the Government, on taking office in 1957, had, as they were advised and as the Minister <Col N="1004" /> for Transport and Power said they would do, prior to their accession to office, taken an area in Great Britain&mdash; even if they could not take the whole country&mdash;such as Liverpool and poured Grade A bacon into it, and if they had carried out a campaign there advertising Irish goods.  I know that there still would be a considerable loss at the moment but I am certain that packaged food is the only food that sells in 1961 and if the Government or the Minister had prevailed on the Pigs and Bacon Board to do that job and provided them with moneys from the fund, the loss would have been less, the opportunities for the bacon producer increased and the drain on the taxpayer considerably relieved.</P>
    <P>The situation in relation to last year's wheat is so complex that, on the basis of the information given by the Minister, it would be impossible to discuss it.  I have done everything I could to find out what the losses were. I am reasonably satisfied they are greater than the figures before us. However, that is something for another day.  I should hope that those losses will not be merged with this year's losses.  In my opinion, this year's losses have been defrayed by profit. The Minister pointed out that we will talk about wheat tomorrow.  To-morrow we will be talking about this year's wheat, whereas in this Supplementary Estimate we are talking about last year's wheat.</P>
    <P>All I will say is that it was quite incorrect for the Minister not to allow Bord Gráin to sell wheat until January 9th of the following year.  I do not know what was the thinking behind that. I think it was because there was an arrangement whereby the importing distributors would take up the coarse grains and barley and the Minister did not want to interfere with the marketing of that barley.  He did not want to &ldquo;queer&rdquo; the market with the large compounders.  I am certain the Minister did not allow the marketing of wheat from last year's harvest until January 9th of this year.  That was a grave mistake and one which increased the losses we are now debating.  It left the people who buy these grains for import in Liverpool in the position <Col N="1005" /> that they knew the stores had to be cleared before 1st September of that year and it reduced the number of months in which the wheat could be marketed, with the horrible result that these people held us up to ransom and some of our Irish wheat sold at less than £17 f.o.b.  I should like to hear the Minister on the details of that, but perhaps it would be too much to expect him to go into that tonight.</P>
    <P>The losses we are discussing should not dismay us.  They are a result of the international situation.  When one looks at the position over the past few years, it is amply evident that the butter export subsidy has been subject to fluctuation to an extraordinary extent and that weather conditions here and elsewhere have had a marked effect.  But it was the old rule of supply and demand that decided the issue.  In 1955-56, the losses were £70,632, while in 1958, which was a wet year, the losses were £2,025,000. In 1959-60, a dry year, the losses fell to £55,606.  It is really like a game of roulette.  If we have a wet year here and other countries such as Denmark have a dry year, then perhaps we can profit from that situation.  On the other hand, if the ball does not roll our way, we can lose.  You cannot judge a firm on the balance sheet for one year.  This Supplementary Estimate cannot be regarded as something that will recur each year.  Something must burst, and whether it is the Common Market or not, I should not like to say.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate decision of the British Government is not the end of the story.  I believe it is rather the start of a serial story and that we have many more chapters to read before we reach the end.  Let us be fair to the Minister.  He has had an unfortunate situation in having to produce this Supplementary Estimate.  At the same time, the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition as to how much of the Estimate was in fact being treated as capital is a very pertinent one.  That part being treated as capital is merely an extra investment to be repaid in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>Included in this Supplementary Estimate is a figure for the Bovine T.B. <Col N="1006" /> Eradication Scheme, which we hope will not be present in a few years' time.  On that particular subhead, I should like to say this: While the statement on the subhead says that there are guarantee payments in respect of exports of fat cattle and carcase beef, as far as I can see from the Book of Estimates, it would also include payment for reactors.  If that is so, it is something we would hope will be non-recurring.  By getting rid of reactors, we reduce the incidence of T.B.  That is a capital charge, I must insist, on the nation as a whole rather than on the farmers.  We all know that the farmer who gets compensatory payment for a reactor cow usually loses money, because it is impossible to buy a good cow today.  They are not sold; you have to breed them.  The person who sells a reactor beast which is not a cow, dry stock, does not gain anything because he merely gets the value of the animal.  Much of that figure before us does not benefit the farmer individually. It is, however, a protection and an incentive for his industry, but at the same time it must be regarded as a capital charge on the nation as a whole.  If the farmers' industry goes down, down we all go.  I would very much like the Minister to inform us what the actual losses on wheat will be and if there will be any further Supplementary Estimates in respect of wheat of last year's crop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We find ourselves dealing with an Estimate for the marketing of dairy produce.  The original Estimate was for £1 million and the revised Estimate is for a figure of £4 million.  I would like to say a word on that.  Deputy Dillon has covered a good deal of the problem facing the Minister in regard to our sale of butter in Great Britain.  I believe we neglected Great Britain too much in the past couple of years.  The Minister and his Department took no action, even though they were warned in this House and warned by leaders in the newspapers that &ldquo;something was cooking&rdquo; on the other side.  Then suddenly the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce went over to England when it was too late. The Danes had wiped their eye.  They <Col N="1007" /> had got the ten per cent. differential wiped out.  We had not been consulted. We have not been trying sufficiently hard.  I think we should have made a more firm approach to Great Britain. This 4,000 tons of butter is a very small amount by comparison with the total of Britain's purchase, but it means a lot to us.  I believe there was neglect on the part of the Minister and the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>I have been asking the Minister questions about the £250,000 voted to him in 1957 for the expansion of agricultural markets abroad for Irish produce.  Deputy Donegan referred to my questions in the previous Dáil.  No later than last week, I asked why only £22,000 of that £250,000 had been spent in the four and a half years' period on the expansion of agricultural markets.  If that is not neglect or incompetence, or both, I do not know what is.  While every nation in the world has been trying to improve its markets and sales techniques, the efforts of the Department of Agriculture here and of the Minister have been futile.</P>
      <P>New nations are arising on the African Continent.  To these countries, instead of sending men expert at attending cocktail parties, we should have sent men who have a knowledge of salesmanship to investigate the shortages peculiar to those countries. I have been informed by people who have lived a long time in Africa that the great shortage in many countries there is meat.  There are also shortages of milk produce.  I have not heard that we have been doing anything to expand our markets there or to establish new ones.  It was one of Fianna Fáil's policies always to look for alternative markets.  I wish they had stuck to that policy and acted accordingly.</P>
      <P>We have been told that this £22,000 to which I have referred was spent on improving the markets for turkeys.  I hope it will help people who have produced turkeys this year.  Deputy Donegan pointed out that the income of our farmers has been falling.  I can tell the House of one of the causes of this.  With a flourish of trumpets, we recently stopped the export of horses to the Continent.</P>

      <P>We have here reference to payments to the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  I detest that name &ldquo;Bacon Commission&rdquo;.  They practically destroyed the bacon trade.  They looted the Irish farmers.  There have been two Pig Bills in the House and then this miserable Commission was set up.  Out of the two Pig Bills, one in 1936 and the other in 1937, the Government got their Commission and in 1938, the bacon curers were hauled before the Commission and got hundreds of thousands of pounds out of the unfortunate producers.  Not only would I like to see the Pigs and Bacon Commission reviewed now, but I should like to see the personnel of the Commission examined to find out what they know, if anything, about selling bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some experience of bacon being sold in England, by both Irishmen and by Continental producers. To my horror, I read in the newspapers last Sunday that we did not come up to scratch in the butchering of our bacon. I should like to point out that we are shipping only Grade A sides and I think they can compete with the best any other producers in the world can provide.  Butchers working in the Irish pork factories are turning out better sides of bacon than anybody but it is not being sold because of lack of proper sales promotion.  In any of the English newspapers today, you will see large advertisements for Danish bacon. They keep on advertising it.  I have eaten Danish bacon and Irish bacon in Britain and I am not talking with a prejudiced mind when I say that Irish bacon is far better.  I have taken it to houses in which I have stayed in <Col N="1009" /> England and have asked them to try it.</P>
    <P>Our sales promotion in the London food markets has not been good.  I have seen commodities other than bacon, commodities selected specially for export by the Government, displayed in England and they were far better than anything being sold against them, but the salesmanship there again was the worst in the world.  There is an idea common in this country among people in the co-operative movement that everything will sell itself.  These people will wake up to the fact that nothing sells without a proper sales organisation. We should not pick salesmen because they are the sons of certain people.  Salesmen must be picked for their potential ability to sell the articles they are sent out to sell.  You will not find that salesman by saying he must have a university degree or that he must not have a university degree. Salesmen are born not made; sometimes they are born and made.  However, the fact that the Irish Dairy Disposal Board collect a whole lot of butter and land it over there is not sufficient to sell it.</P>
    <P>There is no substitute for the travelling salesman.  The greatest firms in the world know that and they keep travelling salesmen and pay them.  That is another thing we were always very chary about: if a salesman asked for a good wage and an expense account we would not pay it but his competitors had the good wage, the expense account and the commission and the people who employed his competitors were always proud of the fact that their salesmen were the highest paid men of the whole organisation.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to secure these accounts and say: &ldquo;There you are. They will sell it.&rdquo; That is only doing Pontius Pilate.  There will have to be a better policy behind our whole setup. We talk about going into the Common Market.  There is hardly anybody in this House who knows anything about the Common Market.  I know very little about it.  How could we be expected to know anything about it? We have no reports from the Minister for Agriculture or from the Taoiseach. They do not know anything about it <Col N="1010" /> either.  They had an opportunity in this famous year of 1957 of finding out something about the Common Market. This House was asked by motion of the leaders of the Opposition to set up a commission to investigate the Common Market in 1957 and they missed the chance.</P>
    <P>Going back to the Pigs and Bacon Commission, it could happen that we would find ourselves penalised by Great Britain again as far as our pigs and bacon are concerned.  I am not a bit chary about saying that in this House; people who say it are supposed to be West Britons.  I would not like to be called a West Briton but, having spent a lot of my time in England, I always thought they were a fair people and that it was one of the greatest mysteries of history, of government or of administration that their treatment of Ireland was so despicable in the past century.  It is a mystery that they could come up with such a danger as they came up with in relation to this miserable 4,000 tons of butter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned here tonight the cheers from the crackpots in the Conservative Party.  I want to say here as an Irishman that a lot of these &ldquo;no-accounts&rdquo; in the Conservative Party were probably on the benches in the years 1939-1946 when there were many Irishmen in the Eighth Army and in the army that was driven into the sea at Dunkirk.  Nevertheless, they look to the Danes now and to the Swedes where the Quislings were.  They were glad to look to Ireland many a time.  In many a hard fought battle they were glad to look to Irishmen. They seldom gave us very much credit for it and they give us no credit for it now.  I heard Deputy Dillon say also that if the Conservative Minister had made his announcement in the British House of Commons and that he had said the British Government were putting a penal duty on the products of countries like Africa or of some part of what was England's far-flung empire, there would be no cheers but raging protests about it.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the British Minister that we in Ireland buy more British goods than practically any <Col N="1011" /> other people and we are aware that Britain is our biggest market.  They are penalising us in respect of what is only a small amount of butter to them, 4,000 tons, but a quantity that makes a great problem for the Minister for Agriculture here and the farmers.  I do not want to say any more about that except that I hope this matter will be kept open.  I hope an agreement can be reached whereby our butter can go to England and be subsidised.  We are subsidising it openly and honestly, not by means of the hidden subsidies operating in Denmark, New Zealand or any of these other countries sending butter into England.</P>
    <P>We would not have been caught so badly in regard to this butter if we had been spending some of that £250,000 investigating alternative methods of using milk.  There is the chocolate crumb industry and there are other methods of using it, such as for milk powder and tinned milk.  We could have looked for a market for tinned milk in these tropical countries where they need it and where there are thousands and thousands of undernourished children.  But no, we did not do anything about it.  We did nothing about it for the whole term of the previous Government, notwithstanding the fact that my colleagues and I exhorted the Minister to seek for the expansion and improvement of markets for our agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>I should have liked to have this in my hands, say, on last Monday.  I was handed an envelope when I arrived at Dáil Éireann at 2.50 p.m.  It was only when I opened it that I knew the details of this Estimate.  I want to put on the record of the House that it is not good Government business nor is it fair to an Opposition and it makes ducks and drakes out of an Estimate of £10,300,000, that such short notice was given to Deputies of this matter. I hope it will not happen again.  I would have been much harder on the Minister were it not for the fact that he now has the problem of this 4,000 tons of butter on his hands.  The Minister should reopen negotiations with the British Government, as would any salesman.  Let him be the salesman <Col N="1012" /> of this 4,000 tons of butter.  The good salesman will go back to the man who has refused to buy his stuff.  The good salesman will go back to that man and will sell it.</P>

      <P>Although this is only a Supplementary Estimate, it is possibly one of the most important Estimates that has come before this House in the past 20 years.  For, behind this army of figures lies the sorry story of the absolute lack of policy and thinking on the part of our Governments over the years&mdash;and I say that as a criticism of all Governments.  In this Supplementary Estimate alone, in what is primarily an agricultural country, over £10,000,000 of the taxpayers' money will go in a form of subsidy to enable us to export our agricultural produce.  Over £5,000,000 will go, if you like, to subsidise beef to get an entrance into the British Market.  There is a sum of nearly £5,000,000 to get our bacon and our dairy produce in as well.</P>
      <P>When we have that sad picture in an agricultural community, it is not unfair to suggest that the Government of this country should be condemned in the strongest possible terms for having led the community up this <i>cul-de-sac</i> today from which neither the Government nor the Opposition can find an outlet.  It is not today or yesterday that it was pointed out in this House or outside it that, if agriculture was to develop in Ireland and if there was to be a living for small farmers, we would have to change our system of farming; we would have to diversify and process the various agricultural products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of all the warnings given in this House and outside it, Government after Government went on in the same old way and left all our eggs in the one basket.  The fruits of that lackadaisical policy are there today.  We can do nothing whatever in the immediate future to remedy the situation.  We cannot threaten Britain.  We cannot impose any sanctions on her.  We cannot whip John Bull.  We cannot twist his tail.  We have been treated as we should be treated &mdash; we have been treated as small boys.  The illusions of grandeur created in this country <Col N="1013" /> over the years have been shattered at last.  We are not the big nation we thought we were.  We are not the grand people we pretended to be to the world.  We are just a small insignificant group incapable of looking after our own business, as has been proved up to the present.</P>
    <P>As a result of a recent decision of the British Government, we have a surplus of butter on our hands.  Is it today we should be thinking of an alternative?  Is it today we should be thinking about the processing of milk into other products?  It may be suggested that an attempt has been made over the past few years to diversify&mdash;with what results?  Where are our markets?  What alternative markets have been got?  What attempt has been made by the Government to secure openings in the Middle-East and in the newly-emerging African states for processed milk in all its forms?  That proposition has been discussed outside and inside this House for years.  We have yet to see the practical results.</P>
    <P>Have we a ship available to carry our products from here to Africa or the Middle-East?  Is it not a fact that, up to recently, if we wanted to send processed milk or bacon or bacon products to any of these countries, they had first to be sent by boat to Liverpool and then transhipped from there to the various ports in Africa and in the Middle-East?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mention it as part of the fact that we left ourselves completely dependent on one market. With respect, I wish to suggest that if we had the shipping available we could divert our processing from milk to butter and have it as processed milk or else cheese and that we would get a market.  However, we cannot get a market because we have not the shipping to provide a service to these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these difficulties have been building up over the years.  They have finally come to a head in the restrictions <Col N="1014" /> that have now been placed on our butter and all those other restrictions that are likely to come in the near future as far as our next door neighbour is concerned.  It may be suggested that an attempt was made to produce cheese as an alternative to concentrating on butter production. Any self-respecting mouse would turn away from the majority of the cheese produced in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pale, insipid, invalid type of cheese.  Deputy Moher should realise that foreigners are not interested in the type of cheese we are producing.  Undoubtedly, there are a number of producers in this country who are able to compete with the best Swiss and the best cheese-producers. They are producing a top-class specialised type of cheese that meets the palate of these people who, we hope, will be our customers.  However, we never made an attempt on a large scale to meet the palate of these people.</P>
      <P>Normally, there is no opening for the expansion of cheese production if we stick to the types of cheeses&mdash;I shall not name them&mdash;which, largely, are produced here in Ireland.  I think some people in this House and outside it pat themselves on the back at the idea that we are probably the largest consumers of butter in Europe. I challenge denial that 30 per cent. of our population do not eat butter from one end of the year to the other.  I do not give two hoots about the statistics that are given with regard to the consumption of butter.  For years back, the people in the lower income groups, the people with large families, do not use butter; they are on margarine.  But if it is suggested that in foods like butter, we are great consumers, let us remember that the other countries who may not consume as much butter, consume 100 to 200 per cent. more cheese and other products than we do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is scope in Ireland at present for a campaign to increase the consumption of butter and, for a start, instead of cold storing this butter, instead of subsidising the British <Col N="1015" /> people to buy it, I should prefer to say: &ldquo;Let us give an opportunity to our own people to sample Irish butter, for a change.&rdquo; If there is a subsidy to be levied, let us do it for the purpose of giving our own people butter at reasonable cost.  It will save cold storage charges and it will save the situation arising in six months' time, if the present position does not improve, of having to find accommodation for more supplies of butter.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is very low consumption of milk in this country.  Very little milk is drunk&mdash;especially in this House&mdash;and, generally speaking, much could be done to interest the public in the value of milk, provided it is supplied at reasonable cost.  As a food, it is second to none.</P>
    <P>I was unable to be present when the Minister made his opening statement or for Deputy Dillon's speech, but reference, I understand, was made to the 1938 and 1948 Trade Agreements with Britain in connection with the export of beef and butter.  I have listened here on a number of occasions, and outside, to the two major Parties trumpeting about the wonderful bargains they made with Britain; Fianna Fáil in 1938 and Fine Gael and the Inter-Party Government in 1948. Is it not a fact that the decision made by the British Government has made nonsense of both these Trade Agreements? Is it not a fact that all this trumpeting was bluff and that the bluff has now been called by the recent decision against which we have no comeback ?</P>
    <P>I do not care who in this House may say the British have broken their side of this or that agreement.  I do not believe they have.  I do not believe it is in either the 1938 or the 1948 Agreement, as has been suggested here, that we must get terms of a nature that would prevent the British from imposing restrictions on us with regard to the entry of butter or bacon. There is nothing that can be read into the 1938 or 1948 Agreement to prevent the British from taking the step they have taken.</P>
    <P>If we followed the newspapers in <Col N="1016" /> recent weeks, we read the exhortations of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and we can realise what they think of this country and its development. Only to-day I took the opportunity of examining the reply given in the British House of Commons on 21st of this month by Mr. Earl, President of the Board of Trade, who was answering a question put by Mr. Hughes, M.P. Mr. Hughes asked if the President of the Board of Trade would place in the Library of the British House of Commons a list of tariff items to be reviewed between Ireland and Britain.  The British Minister refused to leave a copy in the Library but he said that consultations were going on and that there was a certain order of priority established in regard to the items from which the tariffs would be removed.  He said that, in general, the policy of the Government in these matters was to secure for exporters full opportunity of reasonable competition. Deputies may wonder what I am getting at when I quote that statement. I hope to bring it within the scope of this debate.</P>
    <P>Very recently, the Irish Sugar Company embarked on a project for the processing of beef, amongst other items, with this new accelerated quick-freeze method.  What did we find?  We found that our Irish Government prohibited this Irish company from putting more than ten per cent. of the products on the home market.  I sought to establish in this House the reasons for that decision by an Irish Government against an Irish company, owned and controlled by the Irish people.  We have the answer there in that statement made in the British House of Commons that, so far as Britain is concerned, British companies, and subsidiaries of British companies must invest their profits, wherever they are made, in British industry.</P>
    <P>Here, in Ireland, we have a number of British subsidiary companies in the processing business along the same lines as those the Sugar Company is now developing.  These companies made representations to the Irish Government that the Sugar Company was harming their business.  In the annual report of one of the biggest processors <Col N="1017" /> here, it was stated last week that they had made representations to the Irish Government that the Sugar Company's operations were doing them harm.  As a result of the representations made by these British subsidiaries, the Irish Government restricted the sale of an Irish product on the home market.  Is it not clearly established there that British subsidiary companies here are directly controlled by the parent companies in England and, despite the 1938 or the 1948 Agreements, these companies are not affected by the terms of these Agreements ?</P>
    <P>Only within the past few months, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer exhorted British manufacturers and businessmen working outside Britain to plough their profits back into Britain.  We have the position here that we have vast numbers of subsidiaries with headquarters in Britain, set up with the taxpayers' money, with no tax levied on them for ten years, provided they export.  We have the position that all the profits they make here are invested in Britain.  The only advantage we have&mdash;perhaps it is some advantage&mdash;is that they give employment. We can exercise no control over the direction, expansion or contraction of these companies.  That is what has us in the position in which we find ourselves today.  We lack control of our own destiny in these matters.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago questioning the Taoiseach&mdash;he was then Tánaiste&mdash;with regard to the output of turf here.  I shall not elaborate on it, but I suggested then that Bord na Móna could be expanded.  I suggested there should be areas in which consumers should be confined to the use of native fuels.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to challenge the Chair at all.  I merely want to make the point that, since every cloud has a silver lining, there is a possibility that we need not lie down under this latest restriction.  I do not see why we should not say to the British that we are able to produce our own fuel for industrial and heating purposes, that we are taking a great deal of coal from them as a result of the 1938 Agreement, and we feel we are entitled to refuse to take coal, if they will not take our butter. The Minister should bear that in mind. He knows the situation better than I do.  It is a very serious situation.  It will not get any better unless the Minister is in a position to take action along certain lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give my views on the comment made here that we are a traditional supplier of butter to Britain.  I do not want to say anything that might be used to harm or weaken the Minister's bargaining power, but I should like to quote a statement by the agricultural correspondent in <i>The Times.</i> He commented on the restriction on Irish butter exports to Britain and he said that, &ldquo;since Britain provides virtually the only <Col N="1020" /> considerable free market in the world for butter, excessive supplies from generally minor sources can have serious effects for the country's traditional suppliers.  Of these, the most important are New Zealand, for whom dairy products are a main source of national income, Denmark, and also, to a lesser degree, Holland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One can see the impression created in the British mind by the statement that excessive supplies from generally minor sources are the cause of difficulty at the moment.  It is beyond dispute that they will believe we are one of the minor sources and that we are putting excessive supplies on the market.  Have we got a proper publicity campaign directed towards contradicting in the most effective way possible that type of propaganda?  Is the Minister in a position to have an article by the Secretary of his Department in the paper tomorrow morning challenging the accuracy of the statement made by this agricultural correspondent? These papers are read by the public. These are the papers in which the answers must be made in full.  It is no good making a statement here.  It is no good writing reams of correspondence to the British Government, unless the man in the street is properly informed and his sympathy is won.  The ordinary man reading that statement, and similar statements in the future, will form the opinion that, as far as Ireland is concerned, we export butter to Britain only when there is a surplus. Therefore, we are merely a marginal minor supplier, getting rid of surplus butter when it suits us.</P>
    <P>Let us face the facts.  That is the way in which the British people will look at it.  Have we a case to make that over the years, since the War, we have progressively increased our output of butter and are today in a healthy position so far as our butter industry is concerned?  Can we put that case? Or is their case correct that Irish supplies are up this year because of a good drop of rain and good grass and, when the weather is not suitable, the supply goes down?  Will any consumer of Irish butter be happy, if he cannot get continuity of supply?  Is any consumer happy if he cannot get continuity? There are men listening to me <Col N="1021" /> now who are engaged in industry.  They are the first to admit that if the customer or the consumer does not get an article regularly and constantly, that customer or consumer is lost.  Are we in the position that we never built up a proper consumer demand in Britain because our supplies were lackadaisical and uncertain?  That applies particularly to butter and bacon.</P>
    <P>We have the crying and the whinging, now that we are getting a raw deal.  If we feel we are getting a raw deal, then we must look for the alternatives.  I mentioned earlier the emergent countries of Africa.  Is the Minister in a position to tell the House that he could have foreseen a difficulty like this and that he was prepared to find alternatives, or suggest an immediate turnover to alternative processing arrangements of milk? There was no answer to that.  There was no attempt made and the Irish people and the Irish farmer will suffer because of the ineptitude, the laziness and the lack of foresight on the part of Governments here for the past&mdash;I said 20 years, but I think I could safely say since we achieved this modicum of illusory freedom that we have today.</P>
    <P>It is admitted all round, I think, that we had unrestricted freedom over the years into the United Kingdom for most agricultural produce.  We have built up a big trade with Britain.  The impression created in the minds of many people so far as Britain is concerned is that Ireland was a very important customer, that we bought so much from her.  I remember suggestions being made once that we could hit Britain in her pocket as well as her pride but the fact is that our total exports on an average represent less than 2½ per cent. of the total value of British imports.  We are a very insignificant factor in the British import field.  When I mention 2½ per cent., that is an overall figure in respect of industrial and agricultural products. Confining ourselves to the agricultural products&mdash;and they, in the majority consist of beef, bacon and butter&mdash;we looked on ourselves with pride as a tremendous exporter of beef.  Between the three of them, we represent a little <Col N="1022" /> less than five per cent. of the British imports of these commodities.</P>
    <P>Yet, look at the position we are in today, with less than 5 per cent. of the British market in this field.  Let us look on the wider picture that is likely to unfold itself if we have the misfortune to enter what is described as the Common Market.  There are people in this country foolish enough to believe that entry to the Common Market opens up six European countries to a free flow of our beef and, perhaps, a not so free flow of our bacon, butter and other agricultural products.  If we are up a <i>cul-de-sac</i> in the British market, where we had unrestricted entry up to now, where do we think we are going if we go into the Common Market, where, so far as agriculture is concerned, all these countries are going to protect their own interests and their own farmers' welfare before they look after ours?</P>
    <P>Two or three of these countries at the moment have a surplus supply of butter on hands.  Is it not a fact that they are looking to get into the Common Market?  What is all this talk about the wonderful opening there is for agriculture which the Taoiseach and his Ministers speak of at dinners or to chambers of commerce down the country?  Why try to mislead the Irish farmers that there is to be an opening in the E.E.C. for their beef, bacon and butter, the three primary products?  I cannot see any reason to believe or hope that, with the removal of tariffs in these countries in the Common Market, the picture will be any brighter or that the volume of supplies from Ireland will increase by any given percentage.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the future holds for this country.  So far as I can see, all that is happening at the moment is argument about the Minister for Agriculture who is best able to make a bargain with Britain.  Some suggest it is the man who has a lovely pair of blue eyes and a big smile who will strike the best bargain, others suggest it is the fluent man.  It is nonsense.  There is no difference between either side of the House so far as making a bargain or getting terms with Britain now is concerned. We have not got the bargaining power.  There is an old saying in <Col N="1023" /> regard to not showing your teeth unless you are able to bite.  What are we going to face in the European Common Market?  Do you think that we will get any better terms for the three major items in this Supplementary Estimate because of the fluency or the camaraderie of our representatives?  Do you think that we have built up a lot of goodwill in France, Belgium and those other countries all over the years?  Big business and big <i>cartels</i> run the industrial end in these countries and if big business is going to run it, we will not be able to cope with these.  All we can do is to be swallowed up.  It is a terrible comment in 1961 to have to say that, while one half of the world's population is virtually starving, countries like France, Belgium, Denmark and other countries are trying to restrict production.  There are these tricky, diplomatic behind-the-scenes moves to get rid of surpluses of food, while, as I have said, half the population of the world is starving.  It is a fair comment on the mentality of the people who are in charge of the wonderful development programmes that lies ahead of us in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>If there is no solution to this particular problem in regard to butter, what is likely to be the result?  What will happen with the dairy farmers if it is prolonged?  Will they turn over to beef?  Will we have the position that the dairy industry will collapse or falter? Men who are traditionally in the dairying business will turn over to beef?  Is that not one of the things that is desirable in the eyes of many people&mdash;that at long last Ireland will be a nation of ranchers once again and that Ireland will be turned into a land for the production of beef and a stud farm for human beings for export?  It is fast becoming that.</P>
    <P>It is very significant to me that in the past three or four years there was no limit to the amount of money made available to farmers who were prepared to expand beef production.  We had no limit by the banks, which are controlled outside this country.  There was no limit to the amount of money <Col N="1024" /> made available for beef production; there was no limit on the credit made available for the setting up of cattle marts.  I am not arguing for cattle marts as against fairs.  I am merely pointing out how easy it was to get money for those things and how difficult it was, and is, for a farmer to get a few pounds if he wanted to go into the production of pigs and how difficult it is for any farmer interested in horticulture to get the necessary money from a bank manager.  Suppose he went in to the local bank and said to the bank manager that he was going to start growing carrots, peas, fruit and vegetables or that he wanted to get into the production of pigs or poultry, how would he fare?  If he said he was going to get into beef and cattle, he was welcomed with open arms.</P>
    <P>Was the bank manager giving that money off his own bat?  Who directed the policy behind this generosity?  Was it our Government, the banks in Ireland or was that done from beyond? Perhaps I am reading too much into this.  Perhaps I would be wrong to suggest that a number of people who are very influential in banking circles are connected in a big way in Britain with the cattle trade.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, as a practical step to stimulate increased production through the improvement of the fertility of our land by badly needed drainage schemes and at the same time to help to relieve unemployment in rural areas, the necessary moneys to put the Local Authorities (Works) Act into operation should be provided immediately.&rdquo;&mdash; (Deputy McQuillan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to speak at any great length upon this motion because there are a number <Col N="1025" /> of Deputies on both sides of the House who would like to express their views on the necessity of restoring the Local Authorities (Works) Act and I do not intend to deprive them of doing so in the limited amount of time available for this discussion.</P>
      <P>It is accepted by all members of this House that the majority of our county councils in the last few years and the General Council of County Councils have time after time, passed resolutions urging the Government to restore the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It cannot be denied that even the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis on a number of occasions in recent years passed resolutions directing whatever group control that organisation to have the Local Authorities (Works) Act restored. The members of the Fine Gael Party, of the Labour Party and of all other groups in this House are unanimous in their desire to see the Local Authorities (Works) Act revived.  Yet, we have the absolutely impossible situation created that the Minister does not believe that this is a good Act.</P>
      <P>Surely, he knows from the members of his own Party that it is their desire that it should be restored, that it is the desire of the members of local authorities on which many members of the Fianna Fáil Party sit, and that very necessary and desirable drainage work is being held up because this Act is suspended?</P>
      <P>If I am to accept the Minister's line of thought, it must be that he has little or no confidence in his own Party and in their judgement when they press so strongly for the restoration of this Act.  Members of the Minister's Party, colleagues of mine in this House, who do not agree with me on many things, have expressed the view to me outside this House on a number of occasions that they believe the Act should be restored and without delay. I hope they will get up here tonight and express their view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is a repetition of a motion discussed in this House in December, 1959 and the present Minister, Deputy Blaney, made a contribution to the debate on that motion in which he outlined his objections as <Col N="1026" /> Minister and the objections of his Department to the restoraton of the Act. I shall just comment on them and will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>The Minister's main argument against the Act was that a big percentage of the money spent was wasted. One of his reasons for stating that money was wasted was that there was no maintenance work carried out after a drainage scheme had been put into operation.  That is not a sound or solid argument for suspending the Act.  Is it not a very simple thing to make provision for maintenance after the work had been done?  Does it present any difficulty to a Minister to bring in a simple amending section to state that no money would be expended under the act unless provision was made for maintenance?  That, to my mind, clears away this fog of nonsense that emanates from the Department of Local Government that the money was wasted.</P>
    <P>But, apart from that, how can the Minister suggest that money was wasted when the county engineers passed the schemes and when the work recommended by the county engineers was further inspected by the engineers of his own Department?  All I can say is that that is a reflection on the technical men of his own Department and I do not believe for a moment that the Minister meant to cast a reflection on the engineers in his Department.  I think the Minister was talking political rubbish in the hope that some of his own followers would have their consciences satisfied and would be able to return to their constituents and say: &ldquo;The Minister told us there was a lot of money wasted in Wicklow&rdquo; and the people in Cork could swallow that and the Deputies in Wicklow could say that the money was wasted in Cork.</P>
    <P>I want some Deputy to tell me was money wasted in his constituency and, if there was, let him make confession here about it.  Open confession is good for the soul.  I have no doubt confession of that nature would help his political future the next time he is on the hustings if he is able to tell us here that the money spent under the Local <Col N="1027" /> Authorities (Works) Act was wasted in his area.</P>
    <P>The other argument put forward by the Minister against restoring the Act was that the work was done piecemeal and, therefore, was liable to clash with major arterial drainage schemes and would prove unsatisfactory, perhaps cause flooding elsewhere, and upset generally the wonderful drainage plans that have been prepared over the years.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that argument either for the reason that the Minister was prepared and has already sanctioned what I can describe as piecemeal drainage and he did it as a result of the &ldquo;old reliable&rdquo; known as &ldquo;pressure&rdquo;.  The screws were put on and, as a result, the Minister sanctioned what I can describe as piecemeal drainage.  In spite of the advice of the Board of Works engineers and officials, the Minister has sanctioned drainage works that are piecemeal. When he did that, why does he suggest that, as far as the Local Authorities (Works) Act is concerned, all the work being done under that Act could be piecemeal?  I do not think it is fair of him to utilise that argument.</P>
    <P>The third argument he put forward was that engineers who were the employees of local authorities are not capable&mdash;I will not say that but perhaps, not got the engineering experience&mdash;of carrying out the drainage works.  Every Deputy who is a member of a local authority will support me when I say that all the engineers in the local authorities, especially the seniors, are quite capable of making a proper survey, carrying out the necessary technical investigations and preparing a scheme for minor drainage of a nature that could be carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I do not think the Minister meant it that way but it was a reflection on the skill, knowledge and ability of the engineers attached to the various local authorities to say they were not capable of carrying out the necessary drainage work.</P>
    <P>As far as the Minister is concerned at the moment and as far as the Board of Works and every other Government <Col N="1028" /> Department are concerned, they cannot get any kind of engineer to do any kind of work.  It is no use for the Minister to come in here and tell me the engineers, the county surveyors and assistant county surveyors, are not fit to carry out drainage when there is not an engineer available in the Board of Works to carry out drainage at the moment to increase the volume of work.  There are no engineers available in the Department of Local Government to carry out housing schemes.  So, under the circumstances, we should be very glad to have available the services of first-class engineers in the local authorities to carry out work that, if we were waiting for the Board of Works to do it or waiting for engineers from the Department of Local Government to do it, we would all have had our turn at landing on the moon.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply to me two years ago said that he would not interfere with existing drainage schemes and that as far as he was concerned, local authorities would not be entitled to carry out what he described as piecemeal drainage.  In my constituency, there is a river called the Crannagh Cross.  I think it kept the Minister awake for some time and it also kept the Taoiseach awake when he heard what was going to happen as a result of the flooding of that river. The Roscommon County Council had commenced a drainage scheme on this river under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and had spent some thousands of pounds&mdash;I cannot recall the exact figure&mdash;when the Act was suspended by the Fianna Fáil Government. That left that scheme dud.</P>
    <P>What did the Minister do?  As a result of pressure brought to bear on him&mdash;the farmers grouped together and said: &ldquo;We will pay no rates; we cannot pay our rates unless drainage work is done&rdquo;&mdash;he said to the county council: &ldquo;You can go ahead and drain that river.&rdquo;  Out of the generosity of his heart, he said that the Department of Local Government would pay 40 per cent. of the loan charges for the drainage of this river.  In other words, he gave permission to the county council to raise a loan for the <Col N="1029" /> drainage and the Department of Local Government were prepared to pay 40 per cent. of the repayment charges of that loan.  Up to that, the first portion of that river was done under a full cost grant.  Why should the Minister saddle the ratepayers of the entire county with 60 per cent. of the cost of draining a river that did not affect the entire community?</P>
    <P>That was on one side of the River Shannon.  On the other side, we had the River Inny which was drained under arterial drainage and under a full cost grant.  I did not begrudge the farmers of Meath, Westmeath and Longford the work done under full cost grants. The farmers there are better able to bear the burden than the small farmers whose lands adjoin rivers like the Crannagh Cross, with valuations of £10 to £20, and who, if half their holding is flooded, are in the position that they are practically out the door financially that year.  The Minister agreed that there was a necessity for some alternative, if he did not approve of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>Having decided against restoring the Act, he announced here that he was bringing in an intermediate drainage scheme.  I understood that the Minister for Finance was going to implement the scheme and that the work would be the responsibility of the Board of Works.  The Minister made that announcement here in December, 1959, and at that stage, his Department and the Board of Works, according to him, had been working on the preparation of the scheme for the previous eight months.  That is nearly three years ago. I should like to ask the Minister now what drainage schemes have been carried out, and in what counties they have been carried out, over that period, since he started planning this alternative, namely, the intermediate drainage scheme?</P>
    <P>It is only fair that he should let us know whether this alternative has come into operation at all.  I should like to be sure that I am not unjustly criticising the Minister if I say that, in my opinion, no scheme under the intermediate drainage scheme has been completed in the two years and eight <Col N="1030" /> months which have elapsed since he announced this scheme.</P>
    <P>At the time also the Minister told us that the rivers which would be surveyed for drainage works under this intermediate drainage scheme would be rivers which ran directly to the sea. In other words, no tributaries of the Shannon, for instance, would be included for survey work.  I should like to ask him has that position been altered?  Have other rivers been allowed, or will they be allowed, to come in under the intermediate drainage scheme?  My impression at the time was that rivers in Kerry, Wicklow and Donegal and other maritime counties were the only ones likely to benefit; in other words, mountain rivers and streams which had a direct run and a quick fall into the sea, with no great problem involved.  Has the scheme been altered and have rivers flowing into the Shannon, or the Suck, and smaller tributaries generally of the larger tributaries, been included?  It is very important that the House should know the situation, that the Shannon is on the long finger and while it is on the long finger, many rivers and tributaries flowing into it will be left untouched for the next 20 to 30 years.  That is poor hope for the small farmer who has very little spare land available.  At the moment a bottleneck has been created in many counties as far as the Land Project is concerned.  Many farmers, as well as the Department of Agriculture, are held up because of the fact that the outfall of the major streams is not capable of carrying away the flow of water.  Consequently, Land Project work cannot be completed in many areas.</P>
    <P>When I hear the Taoiseach and Ministers on the radio exhorting farmers to produce more, I feel that they have not got the foggiest idea of what the farmer has to face.  How would the Taoiseach feel if he were in a small farmer's house near the river Suck or the Crannagh Cross or such rivers and heard these pronouncements at 10 o'clock at night: &ldquo;Expand; produce more; the farmer is the backbone of the country and agriculture is our primary industry&rdquo;?  And when <Col N="1031" /> that farmer goes outside in the morning, he finds his backyard flooded and without even a dry stand for his cattle. What does he think then of the Taoiseach ?</P>
    <P>I think drainage is an absolute fundamental and all the exhortations in the world for increased production are sheer nonsense, unless the man can see the land from which he is to get increased production, or any production. At the moment all over the country, a large amount of damage and flooding has been caused by storms and many of the smallholders are at their wits' end in regard to meeting their rates.  I suggest to the Minister that he would give great hope to small farmers and workers if he would reconsider his decision and restore the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The alternative in many areas is that the Government will have to take steps to have the land derated because it is impossible for small farmers to pay their rates, due to the losses they have suffered.  Whether the Government have their ears to the ground or not, they will know that very shortly when they realise the reaction to the increase in rates that is bound to come all over the country. I warned the Minister about what was going to take place over the Crannagh Cross river and luckily he took the hint before things became too bad.  In conclusion, I should like the Minister to allow a free vote of the House, if he is not prepared to accept the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any problem of greater importance to the people of the western areas like Mayo and Roscommon than this particular problem of drainage.  I am a native of a spot where there are three catchment areas within one square mile.  Where I was born is within one hundred yards of a river whose source is 250 to 300 yards away and which ultimately empties into the Moy. At the other side of the house is the beginning of a long catchment area which ultimately drains into the Shannon. The third catchment area, which <Col N="1032" /> is about a mile and three quarters away, is the Corrib-Claredalgan, the Clare end of it, to be exact.  Drainage problems are always worst at the source of a river&mdash;in other words at the top of the catchment area&mdash;and I have seen them at their worst in regard to three of our catchments.  Only one of them has been at all improved, that is the Claredalgan, which, in the course of the past year or two, was done as far as Ballyhaunis.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to mention, in connection with that, that a proposition was put forward by myself and some others that the White Lake might be drained into the Corrib catchment area which could have been very conveniently done.  That proposal was turned down because it was stated by the Board of Works that it was not the policy that one catchment area should be drained into another.  For that reason, the farmers in the area, looking across at their more fortunate neighbours, naturally felt disappointed that they had to face a further period, perhaps 15 or 20 years, before they could have similar benefits.</P>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with any sensible proposition put forward in this House with regard to drainage, but I was thinking to myself tonight when listening to Deputy McQuillan whether it would be of any benefit to his constituents, those people along the Shannon basin who have suffered so much in the years gone by, who are still suffering and who apparently have many years of similar disadvantage ahead of them&mdash;whether the operation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, as distinct from the Arterial Drainage Act, would be of benefit or disadvantage to them.  My feeling is that it would be a distinct disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, about ten years ago, or perhaps a little more, the Minister for Agriculture, who was not getting on with his Land Project as quickly as he had hoped, decided to divert a figure of £50,000&mdash;I am subject to correction on that but at any rate, a very substantial figure&mdash;towards the partial drainage of the Lung River, that portion of the river from Lough Gara up towards Crennane Bridge.  One <Col N="1033" /> can imagine without difficulty the joy that came to those who derived benefit from the partial drainage of the Lung carried out as a result of that decision. But I think one can also imagine the chagrin of those in my constituency, just over the border in Kilmovee and in the other areas in east Mayo up to the point I mentioned earlier which I can see from my house, that they had not been included, that a partial drainage scheme had been done and stopped.  They were asking why was it that the people of a particular area were able to get an advantage and they were told they could not have a like advantage.  One of the reasons was that a far greater flow of water was released by the work done than had been expected, with the result that Deputy McQuillan's constituents were flooded out to a far greater extent than they would have been, had that work never been put in hand.</P>
    <P>There is nobody more anxious about drainage problems than I am because they affect my area in the way I have mentioned.  But if some piecemeal scheme, under the Land Project or any other scheme you can think of, is to be implemented in this fashion without a concomitant scheme to cope with the flow of water lower down, you are simply robbing Peter to pay Paul, and unfortunately it is the people further down who are being robbed.  I have great sympathy with any scheme designed to alleviate immediate problems for farmers, but I think we must look at this problem of drainage from an overall point of view and not against the background of the temporary advantage it may give a locality.  In other words, I must say that if the disappointed people of the East Mayo area had not been disappointed and that that particular work had been carried on by the expenditure of a further £50,000, the only effect it would have, as far as Deputy McQuillan's constituents are concerned, is that their problems would be far greater.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, we should be thankful for a small mercy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. I feel, if anything, sorry for the people <Col N="1034" /> in the Shannon basin for the reason that the drainage of the Shannon basin is quite obviously the biggest problem in drainage this country and the Board of Works have been faced with.  But I do think that we should tackle the problem as an entity, not piecemeal. I know that certain good work was done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It is hardly conceivable that £7½ million should have been spent without some good accruing to somebody, but I think the Minister for Local Government pointed out two years ago that of that £7½ million, something less than half was actually spent on drainage.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to know what the comparative figure is where arterial drainage under the aegis of the Board of Works is concerned.  I very much doubt if the figure is anything as low as that which applied to the Local Authorities (Works) Act while it was in operation.  The position of the ratepayers is only the obverse side of the same problem, because all the work that was done under the Act was by virtue of full cost grant.  That meant that the ratepayers had no liability whatsoever.  It also meant they had no responsibility.  I have seen, in the very river I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, an operation carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I cannot say the job was particularly well done in the first instance, though I do admit the flow of water was improved.  It is, however, sad to relate that it was of very temporary advantage and that at the end of less than twelve months the river was back in a condition at least as bad as it had been before the work was put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often wondered in respect to drainage whether drainage without maintenance does not cause the weeds to grow more quickly.  If you leave the river bed alone, the weeds are inclined to choke themselves.  It is certainly a fact that if you do not make up your mind that you are going to maintain the remedy it is no use making a savage assault and then withdrawing into your foxhole, never to return.  It appears to me that the idea of partial drainage is wrong in principle, that an all-out assault followed by a complete withdrawal <Col N="1035" /> is the wrong attitude to our drainage problems.  Surely those people who are obtaining advantage from drainage are prepared to accept the responsibility of maintenance.  I believe they are, and I believe most people would be quite prepared to accept the responsibility and the expense if only the job were done properly and from the right point of view at the beginning.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Local Government spoke on this matter some time ago, he pointed out that in his opinion that £7½ million could have been better spent had it been diverted to the operations of the Board of Works under the Arterial Drainage Act.  I am in wholehearted agreement.  I say that knowing I am talking against my neighbours to some extent, knowing that if that policy is followed some of my neighbours cannot expect to obtain real advantage for fifteen or twenty years to come.  But I would say they would be better pleased to know the job will be done properly in ten, twelve, fifteen years' time rather than that a botch job should be done now without any guarantee of permanent advantage.  The truth of it is that maintenance work was not accepted as a responsibility, that it was not done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be done now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be done, but if it is to be done it must be within the scope of a bigger scheme which will cope with the flow of water below. In regard to smaller drainage work that has been done over a number of years, I have to urge the Minister to support me in the view that those who contribute to drainage schemes should have the first opportunity of obtaining employment in such schemes.  That applies particularly to Rural Improvement Schemes where the local people are asked to contribute.  I have experienced great difficulty in getting people to sign for the reason that they cannot be guaranteed the opportunity of working when the scheme is sanctioned. In fairness, however, I do not think this matter is relevant to this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> The gist of what I am saying is that it is not a reflection on the engineering ability of the officials of the Department of Local Government to say that schemes of this nature ought to be a co-ordinated national effort.  It is no reflection at all on them, because it is not their jobs as engineers to solve a problem which creates an even greater problem.  No engineer can hope to satisfy all unless he is tackling the problem with a view towards complete solution.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to reject this motion and to use his good offices with the Government to increase the amount of money to be given to the Board of Works to enable a national scheme being operated by the Board of Works to be accelerated.  In the meantime, I feel far too much politics has been made of the fact that the present Government some years ago put an end to the operation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It is, to say the least of it, remarkable that a motion almost exactly the same, almost in the exact terms, should reappear in a little over two years and, if I may say it, sponsored by the same Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there was no move made in the last three years to substitute another scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the figures will prove otherwise, and I think that the expenditure on arterial drainage has increased substantially over the past three years.  The amount of money earmarked by the Board of Works will, I think, considerably exceed that spent last year and very considerably that spent in 1959 when this motion was discussed before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the two Departments involved to co-ordinate their efforts to improve the allocation of moneys for arterial drainage purposes.  I do not believe it would be of other than haphazard advantage to individuals to reintroduce the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I say that for the reasons I have already given and in the knowledge that, while individuals certainly would benefit, the return to <Col N="1037" /> the taxpayer would not justify the individual reward.</P>
    <P>I began by saying I had great sympathy with the people who are affected by drainage problems&mdash;and that is true&mdash;and that the people of the west of Ireland are more affected by them than perhaps the people of other counties, but I think our salvation lies with the Commissioners of Public Works rather than elsewhere and that the experiment that was tried, for instance, ten or 11 years ago which resulted in the lowering of the level of Lough Gara, while it gave an advantage to the few, was a disadvantage to many of those on whose behalf Deputy McQuillan urged his motion tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom aguisín a chur leis an méid atá ráite annso ar an ábhar seo.  I wish to support Deputy McQuillan's motion.  I must say I am very surprised that a Deputy from any county west of the Shannon should take any other action. On this day week in reply to a question of mine the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance admitted that in one small area of my county of Sligo, there were 116,000 acres involved in a catchment area drained by the main artery of the Arrow and the Owenmore.  Out of that question came the point that in 1903 the same answer was given in the British House of Commons as was given here last Wednesday.  Under the Wyndham Act, this river was placed No. 8 in the county priority list and it is No. 16 in 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in our county an area of approximately 450,000 acres with a valuation of approximately £162,000. Allowing about one-third for land which is mountain and bog and one-third for land which is underdevolped due entirely to flooding and neglect of drainage of potential agricultural land, I estimate an area of 100,000 acres which could be improved; the Minister's answer says 116,000 acres. Normally in our part of the country and in my constituency, due to underdeveloped land, it takes about three acres to maintain an adult beast per annum.  On a very conservative estimate, <Col N="1038" /> there is a loss of £1 million to the farming community in that area. If further proof is needed, may I say that the figure for adult agricultural employees has dropped in the past ten years in my county from 1,500 to 1,000; in other words, by one-third.  If the £1 million I have estimated as a loss to the farming community were spent in the way of drainage, there would be, from the long term point of view, increased production and, secondly, in the initial stages, increased employment and emigration would be arrested.</P>
    <P>When the Local Authorities (Works) Act was introduced, something in the region of £50,000 was spent in County Sligo and no matter what anybody says, I feel it did a tremendous amount of good.  It was a capital investment not involving risk.  A lot of money has been invested in other industries.  I need not remind the Minister about Killybegs in his own county, where the money invested was subject to risk and approved as such. Any money put into drainage in the West of Ireland is not subject to risk. It is significant perhaps that so far here tonight only three Deputies have spoken and all of them are from west of the Shannon.  Drainage is a serious problem in the West.  It definitely is a problem in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim though it may not be a problem in the rest of Ireland.  I think, still, that probably we shall have to go back to 1st May, 1954, to find the real reason for the problem that has arisen in Connaught.  In my experience, the Local Authorities (Works) Act was one of the finest Acts ever enacted in so far as the people in my constituency are concerned.</P>
    <P>This day last week, I raised a question about the River Arrow.  I tried to show how the Local Authorities (Works) Act could alleviate immediate problems in my county. The fact is undisputed that 116,000 acres of arable land is undeveloped due to flooding by the Arrow and Owenmore which have their confluence at Collooney and enter the sea at Ballisodare.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to go overland from Dublin to Donegal without crossing <Col N="1039" /> the river at Ballisodare.  If you look down on your left you will see the sea several feet beneath you.  If you look on your right you will see a rock and about a foot of water with a river about 30 yards wide.  In 1956, a scheme was prepared to excavate the rock from Ballisodare to Collooney, a distance of approximately two miles. We intended at that time to use the money provided under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  A scheme was drawn up at a cost of £12,500 for the two miles.  Then there was a change of Government.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act was put in abeyance and we are still where we were in 1903.</P>
    <P>I know the Local Authorities (Works) Act is there.  If money is advanced to carry out works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and if work of that type could be undertaken it would not be a waste of money and certainly, in so far as my county is concerned, it would prove a tremendous benefit.  There would be no such thing as a botched job about it.  When the Arterial Drainage Scheme comes along at a later stage it could follow on from there.  The amount of benefit that would be derived from the farming community over one-third of the county would be so great that the money would be well spent.  Probably, with the increase in wages, and so on, that scheme would cost £15,000 to £20,000 today.</P>
    <P>If money is not provided to implement the Act, I would ask the Minister to consider some concession for our problems in the West of Ireland.  You can call it anything you like.  I would ask him to consider the drainage of even that much of the Arrow, two miles.  Above that, there are artificial obstructions, mostly, but, in that two miles, there are natural obstructions of the rock, and so on.  If that two miles were done it would benefit the farming community.  The money spent would be very well worth spending and then, when the Arterial Drainage Scheme comes along, which I estimate would be in 20 to 25 years' time, you could continue from there.  That <Col N="1040" /> is a very fair suggestion.  The people in my county think it rather strange that any Minister should ask for increasing production when, year after year, due to rivers becoming blocked, the tendency is towards diminishing returns, not increased production.</P>
    <P>I remember attending a meeting of a Committee of Agriculture in Sligo. The Minister for Agriculture was present. He made the statement that he thought the money spent under the Local Authorities (Works) Act was badly spent, that it was a waste of money.  The point there is&mdash;and I think other western Deputies will agree with me&mdash;that it might have been a waste of money in his county.  It might have been a waste of money in the midlands and in the south of Ireland but definitely it was not a waste of money in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
    <P>I saw people saving their hay in bottoms. I saw them trying to get the highest point on which to build their cocks of hay and afterwards taking off only the tops of hay cocks.  That is all they saved from destruction, water backing up even 8 to 10 miles from the main artery.  If the Minister saw all that I think he would realise the significance of the problems facing us in that part of the country.  I would ask him to use his good offices to provide money under any scheme he likes to alleviate distress caused by flooding in my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion.  As a member of a local authority I realise only too well the inestimable value of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I can assure the Minister that when he abandoned this Act he did a serious injustice to county councils. He hindered them very much in the carrying out of essential works and minor schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some suggestions were made for the abandonment of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It was suggested here tonight that the money was wasted.  If that is true, someone is guilty of serious dereliction of duty.  Was it the local overseers, gangers, engineers, or was it perhaps the Minister's own Party?  I choose to think that where State money of this kind is made available there is <Col N="1041" /> a responsibility on the Minister's Department in particular to see that it is spent wisely and well.</P>
    <P>There are a number of minor relief schemes that local authorities cannot do, however much they would like to suggest the drainage of our rivers and their tributaries.  I speak for a county which is rather low in priority in relation to the national Arterial Drainage Scheme.  We shall have to wait many years before our river and its tributaries are drained.  The loss of the Local Authorities (Works) Act is felt very keenly because we cannot find money out of the rates to do these essential works to alleviate flooding and recover the fertile land of Tipperary which is inundated with water in places for months of the year.</P>
    <P>There are also bridges, roads and boreens which need attention.  The owners or users of these are not able to avail of the various grants and schemes available for the purpose and the local authority is not willing to take them over until they conform at least to the minimum requirements laid down by the county engineer.  These are works that have been done and could be done again under the Local Authorities (Works). Acts.  I am vitally concerned in the motion because that Act has provided employment for workers, particularly those in seasonable employment, county council and Bord na Móna workers and forestry workers.  When work ran out on the roads men were given work on important schemes of this kind.  The suggestion that the money was wasted is absurd.  If it was wasted, the people responsible should have been brought to book at that time.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that the Board of Works is a more appropriate body to do this kind of job.  From what I know of the Board of Works it is a very big and cumbersome institution and if we wait for it to carry out the type of work we have in mind we shall be waiting a long time.  I would again appeal to the Minister on this point because I know it is the feeling of the House and of his own Party members on the various councils on which I have the honour to speak that this Act <Col N="1042" /> should be brought into being again. I am not speaking in a political vein; it is a matter of indifference to me who sponsors the motion, but I am conscious of the intrinsic value and worth of the Local Authorities (Works) Act. If my watch becomes broken I do not take out a mallet and smash it up; I have it repaired.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he is conscious of any defects in the Local Authorities (Works) Act from what he has learned, he should rectify them; let him correct any omissions in the Act and see to it that it is operated properly, efficiently and economically in future.  That, I feel, is the limit of responsibility of his Department.  It might be suggested that local authorities did not take a proper interest in the works concerned.  Again, the Minister is making the money available and he should put an obligation on local authorities to see that the work is carried out and that they will maintain such work in the future.</P>
    <P>Particularly from the point of view of flooding and for areas, whose rivers, like the Suir, are low in the order of priority, I would ask the Minister to put this Act into operation, to give the necessary money to relieve flooding in our county, retrieve fertile lands, stimulate production and give our farmers a fair chance.  Above all else, give us an opportunity to do the kind of small, essential jobs which the local authority is either unwilling or unable to do and give us the further satisfaction of knowing that we shall be able to ensure continuity of employment for the workers I have mentioned, county council road workers, workers in Bord na Móna or anywhere else who need a job and the money to maintain a wife and family at certain times of the year, particularly in winter.</P>

      <P>The previous speaker mentioned a broken watch.  A broken watch, as everybody knows, should be sent to a watchmaker.  I suggest drainage problems should be left to drainage authorities and the drainage authority in this country is the Office of Public Works.  I think that all drainage should be entrusted to one body.  Actually, arterial drainage, rural improvement schemes drainage <Col N="1043" /> and minor employment scheme drainage are entrusted to them.  I think it was a mistake ever to entrust drainage work to a group or groups who had not, have not, and never will have, the personnel, machinery or the opportunities to carry out drainage work. In addition to that I would say that any road works done under minor employment or rural improvement schemes should be handed back to the Department of Local Government who have the men, the machinery and the material to do road work.  The point I want to stress is that drainage work should be left to the Office of Public Works who have drainage engineers, machinery, technical personnel and the other facilities necessary for drainage work.</P>
      <P>Up to now in the Opposition we had the attitude towards the Local Authorities (Works) Act that no matter how much money the Government spent on drainage it was no good unless it was labelled Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Money expended on drainage was no good and the Government were falling down on the job unless that money was spent under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilhawley made a very good case for the extension of the arterial drainage scheme because the rivers and catchment areas <Col N="1044" /> he mentioned are of a type that would fall into&mdash;not a minor but the next-step-to-it&mdash;drainage scheme.  When he talks in terms of 116,000 acres he is not talking in terms of the Local Authorities (Works) Act but in terms of arterial drainage and so I suggest that what we should have, and what is being started at the moment, is an extension of arterial drainage to cover minor rivers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan must have the Local Authorities (Works) Act; if the Government spend extra money on drainage under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, that would be O.K.  It is true that there should be provision for maintenance and the county councils would be only too glad to allocate money for such a purpose.  We believe that the extension of arterial drainage to cater for all rivers is better.  Drainage should be left in the hands of the recognised drainage authority.  They are the people who have the equipment and materials to deal with it.  I would urge the Minister to advise the Government to stick to present policy and not be misled by this periodic political propaganda which crops up from time <Col N="1045" /> to time here and which, when this motion is finished, will not be finished; we will have it again.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that Deputy Cunningham should think this is purely political propaganda.  Deputy Cunningham will remember sitting at his Party's Ard Fhéis when the delegates representing every Fianna Fáil cumman in the country passed a unanimous resolution requesting the Fianna Fáil Government to re-implement the operations of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  What bug affected that convention?  Why did they advance that resolution publicly at their Party Ard Fhéis?  Was it done to embarrass their own Government?  I contend it was done quite seriously.  It was put forward as a very excellent suggestion from the Deputy's Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>To get more money for drainage, which they got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a resolution suggesting the re-implementation of an Act they had seen in operation, particularly those of them who were members of local authorities.  The Deputy must also realise that, when this matter comes up for discussion at county council meetings throughout the country, there is no allegation then that it is politically inspired.  Many of the councillors who are the first to speak in favour of the resumption of activities under the Local Authorities (Works) Act are members of Deputy Cunningham's Party.  The moment the matter enters this Chamber, it becomes political.  The only politics in it are the politics of the Party who says: &ldquo;No, no, no; it is wrong and it will never be implemented so long as we have authority to prevent it.&rdquo; That is done in defiance of the most cogent arguments advanced in favour of resuming activities under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilhawley speaking here with reference to his particular part of the country&mdash;that part of Leitrim which is now annexed to Sligo&mdash;emphasised the value of the work done under the Act in his constituency of Sligo-Leitrim. Deputy Gilhawley, and others who <Col N="1046" /> represent the West, are not alone in this.  The matter is as important in mid-Cork as it is in Sligo.  There is no county which has not an intense interest in the resumption of operations under an Act which was implemented so successfully for years.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest advantages in the Act was that schemes initiated under it did not involve any great administrative cost.  The moneys voted were disbursed through the media of the county councils and went directly into the pockets of the men who worked on the schemes.  There was never a scheme devised by this House under which the moneys voted went in their entirety into the pockets of those working on the scheme.  The administrative and engineering staffs of the county councils administered the schemes.  They had the advice of every member of the council as to locations.  No member of the Fianna Fáil Party serving on any local authority felt his obligation to his Party prohibited him from advancing a scheme.  They were as quick off the mark as any other councillor.  They did not regard the expenditure as a waste of public moneys.  They did not dissociate themselves because of the foolish manner in which a large amount of money was spent. They were among the first to advance schemes for their particular parishes or localities and they all wanted their schemes to get first attention when these moneys were being expended.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the best feature of these schemes was that the moneys voted went almost <i>in toto</i> into the pockets of the workers.  I am horrified that Deputy Cunningham should assert that county councils have not got the necessary personnel to deal with drainage and that only the Office of Public Works is competent to take charge of drainage.  Is Deputy Cunningham aware that the Department of Agriculture are doing drainage work at the moment? Under the Land Project, groups of farmers have organised and pooled the Land Project grants in order to do drainage work.  If Deputy Cunningham's argument were to be accepted, all such works should cease immediately because the proper personnel is not there to supervise the work.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest snags in the <Col N="1047" /> drainage being done under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture is that there is no legal provision which entitles those anxious to drain land to go in on another man's land.  Under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, there was provision whereby drainage could be carried out, despite objection by a landowner.  Considerable difficulty is being experienced in my area.  It has been found difficult to prevail, perhaps, upon a certain landowner and get his co-operation in draining a stream; he may not like his neighbour.  We all know these difficulties arise.  There are certain intractables who are prepared to suffer if they can make their neighbour suffer also, in this combined Land Project work in relation to drainage, I know of at least three instances where the work cannot be carried out because of a sole objector.  Under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, you could go in to do the work and complete it.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I earnestly urge upon the Minister and the Government to re-allocate the moneys for distribution under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Let us get this work done. We know that priority was given to the carrying out of schemes where roadways were affected by flooding from rivers and streams under that Act.</P>
    <P>The rates and the Minister's Department have now to meet the cost of repairing the ravages on these roads caused by flooding by streams and rivers that could be cleaned under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  There are many difficulties operating at the moment against the clearance of these streams.  This very week before I came up to the Dáil, I met a deputation of farmers who had land on both sides of a public roadway.  They were prepared to participate jointly under the Land Project to get a stream cleaned but because it crossed the roadway at one point, the Land Project officer told them that he could not entertain the application.  The work could have been done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act because it is the council engineer responsible for that roadway who would also supervise the drainage of the scheme.  Here were four farmers who are denied the benefits of the <Col N="1048" /> Land Project in relation to drainage because they could not get the work to coincide with the local authority work.  Every winter, this roadway is torn up by the flooding by the stream. There is no Deputy, no matter to what Party he belongs, who could not cite dozens of examples similar to the one I mention.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in regard to arterial drainage, some of the objections are eliminated.  The outfall is improving. We are not aggravating any flooding in lower reaches.  These are in the main, minor jobs.  They would, bring immediate fertility to land which cannot be worked at the moment.  It would have that effect.  We would be in favour of retaining the provision in the earlier Act to give priority to streams and rivers affecting public roadways.  As well as improving the land, this would have the effect of reducing the cost of the upkeep of public roads.</P>
    <P>Let me mention the labour content in regard to those who were employed under the Local Authorities (Works) Act when it operated.  These were, in the main, men of an age and a status who had no alternative work to go to. Shortly after the Local Authorities (Works) Act was abandoned, we had a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare to give unemployment assistance to men who had been employed under that Act. We had to give them two-thirds of what they were getting when they were employed.  For one-third more investment, they could have been employed full-time on work such as this.  We took them out of that employment and told them to walk, or if they had bicycles, to cycle to the employment exchange to draw money when they could have been usefully employed on work such as this.  They were men of an age who could not emigrate as did so many others who lost employment.  They could not adapt themselves to employment in other spheres as more energetic men could.  This was a source of employment for such men, employment in which they handled the same implements all their lives before the machine took over.  They were adept at that work.  They could have continued <Col N="1049" /> to give service to the community in one of the very few remaining types of work open to them and in which they could competently participate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham is enamoured of the provision in regard to intermediate drainage.  It is easy for a Deputy from a county such as Donegal to talk having regard to the physical character of that region. There is no problem there in relation to the intensification of flooding in the lower reaches of main rivers.  They have direct access to the sea.  The outflow is directly to the sea.</P>
    <P>We know the machinery is available. The Act is there; the legal provision enacted by this House is still in existence. The engineers are there in the local authorities traversing the country on other work.  They could easily look after this work with the other work they are doing.  It would not mean the engagement of one additional engineer to look after works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It would appear that in recent times there is something abhorrent to the Minister and Government in providing a 100 per cent grant for any purpose but they are profligate with schemes and plans to encourage the ratepayers.  They tell them: &ldquo;If you put up so much, we will cover it pound for pound.&rdquo; But because this was a scheme that imposed no charge on the rates, it appears it will not be viewed with favour by the Government.</P>
    <P>In the years during which the scheme was allowed to lapse, we had flooding and a deterioration in the outflow of many streams.  This is work in which we can employ many men who were displaced from road work.  Since this scheme was abandoned, many men were displaced from work on the maintenance of roads.  In previous years, I made an appeal to the Minister to re-introduce the operations of the <Col N="1050" /> Local Authorities (Works) Act.  We will continue to do so until such time as a Government are elected who will do it.  I appeal to the Government to restore these operations in present circumstances, in the knowledge that it will bring the benefits mentioned in this motion&mdash;an improvement in the fertility of the land, provision of badly-needed drainage schemes and relieve unemployment in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is increased employment in particular regions where heavy industries are established but in the remote rural parts, road work, apart from the work available on the land, represented the only outlet for local labourers.  Every day it appears that whatever opportunities existed at one time are rapidly receding.  Surely it would be a good thing to afford some opportunity of employment for such people by engaging them on these schemes.  We are not asking the House to pass this motion purely as an employment-giving scheme.  It is not merely for the purpose of giving employment but for the purpose of giving productive employment&mdash;employment in connection with which there is little or no administrative expense and employment which would, within a very short time redound to the benefit of the community in the form of better employment on land which is at the moment subject to flooding by streams and rivers.  It would relieve the ratepayers of the additional impact on them involved in having to maintain, improve and repair so many roads in the coming months, roads which will be torn up by the flooding by many of these streams and, consequently, save such roadways from the ravages of flooding in the winter months.</P>
