      <P>The amendment on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Sweetman has been ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>Bill received for final consideration.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is in amendment of the principal Act and it constitutes, with the principal Act, one code, so to speak.  I want, therefore, to raise the matter to which I referred in the amendment which has been ruled out of order but on a different basis. <Col N="2396" /> When I looked at the Undeveloped Areas Acts last night, following the discussion we had here yesterday, I found that the provision there is that the report of Foras Tionscal will be &ldquo;in such form and will contain such matter as the Minister may direct.&rdquo;  The situation in relation to the Shannon Free Airport Company is that there will be an annual report and that the Minister can get such information as is necessary and that the reports will contain such matter as he directs.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his directions to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company should give exactly the same direction as has been given by his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce to Foras Tionscal.  If the Minister will look at the latest report of Foras Tionscal for the year ended 31st March, 1961, which was recently tabled, he will find in Appendix 2 the exact information for which we asked yesterday in relation to this company.  Incidentally, I would draw attention to the fact that the Foras Tionscal report is in neostyled form at an earlier date than it could be produced and printed, for the specific purpose, no doubt, of enabling the House to consider its contents before the House rises for the Summer Recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could well indicate to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company that they could do the same thing as Foras Tionscal.  Though their actual printed reports and accounts might not be available until the later date he indicated, the neostyled form should be available to the House before that.  In regard to Foras Tionscal every individual grant payment made is set out clearly, showing the name of the grantee, the location of the assisted undertaking, the products, the grant approved and the specific payments made in the year.  The location does not arise in this case because they are all located in the same way but there would appear to be no reason whatever to differentiate between Shannon, on the one hand, and Foras Tionscal, on the other.  It is highly desirable that when public moneys are being paid out in grants in this form, information as to the grant payments as <Col N="2397" /> such, apart from the commercial arrangements in relation to individual lettings, and so forth, should be made available to the public.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that the public have the right to know what is being done with public money, it is quite clear, as a result of experience over a long number of years, that the only way of ensuring that undesirable rumours are not prevalent in regard to the basis of any grants, is that those grants will get the fullest possible publicity.  Then everybody knows where he stands.  The Minister has power under this Act and the principal Act to do that and I would urge very strongly that he take the same line as has been taken in the case of Foras Tionscal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole, I think I would find it possible to arrange for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company to publish in their future reports the individual grants made available to the factories.  The factories are all situated close together and I can see some difficulties that might arise because they are all cheek by jowl with one another.  However, I think the argument put forward by Deputy Sweetman is reasonable, that when Foras Tionscal publishes the individual grants, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company should do likewise.</P>
      <P>I should also like to state that Section 10 of the Principal Act provides that grants for machinery and equipment for new industries are limited to 50 per cent.  I want to make that clear because the matter arose last night in the course of the debate.</P>

      <P>We lost a factory last night in the course of the argument which, perhaps, could have very serious repercussions on the economy.  I <Col N="2398" /> will have to read this&mdash;it is rather complicated&mdash;in order to make it quite clear what the position is.  In the report of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company for the year ended 31st March, 1960, it was stated that there were 22 factories built or in course of construction, together with a special factory.  One of the intended sites has since been diverted to a site for a boilerhouse to service all the factories. Another factory premises which was evacuated by the occupier has been diverted into use as a canteen for the workers in all the factories.</P>

    <Title>Local Authorities (Education Scholarships) (Amendment) Bill, 1961&mdash; Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 28, before &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provided that nothing in this section shall operate to constrain a Corporation or Council to reduce the total amount allocated in the financial year 1960/61 for the provision of assistance under the Act of 1908, or to refrain adding thereto in any subsequent year a sum not greater than one-third of additional monies provided from the rates and the State Grant.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister in his Second Reading speech stated at column 1686 of the Official Debates:</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I wish to make special reference is the proposal that the amount to be allocated for university scholarships should not be more than half that provided for post-primary scholarships in one-third of the total monies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the matter, I wanted to know was that a composite fund, was the rate and the State grant to be <Col N="2399" /> regarded as a composite fund in the case of assigning scholarships under the 1908 Act.  The Minister made it clear in the subsequent discussion that all the moneys in the hands of the local authorities, whether from the rate raised under the Local Authorities (Scholarships) Act or under the Act of 1908 and all the moneys received from the State were one fund.</P>
    <P>At column 1739 of the Official Debates, he said:</P>
    <P>I visualise one main fund in each local authority area.</P>
    <P>At the end of the column, dealing with the third year of the State contribution, he said:</P>
    <P>In the third year the State contribution will be one and a half to one and in the fourth year it will be the same thing.  The aim will be a five to four ratio between State and local contribution, making one fund which will be divided into two-thirds for post-primary education and one-third for university education roughly.</P>
    <P>When the Minister finished his concluding speech on Second Reading and again when he asked for the Committee Stage of the Bill on that day, I attempted to warn him and I suggested that in order to avoid unnecessary clashes, we should have a little clarification of what the Minister had in mind, particularly in relation to the way it affected local authorities in the earlier years of his scheme.  The Minister is apparently going to stand over the principle, and wants public opinion developed so that it will accept the principle, that in the distribution of State and local authority moneys for scholarships for post-primary and university education, not more than one-third of the money will go to university education and at least two-thirds to post-primary.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of Section 4 of the Bill reads as follows:</P>
    <P>A grant to the corporation of a county borough or council of a county under this section in respect of any local financial year shall be used by the corporation or council, as the case may be, in the defrayal of the cost of paying scholarships <Col N="2400" /> under a scheme or schemes under section 2 of the Principal Act in that year or both of paying such scholarships and providing assistance for students under section 10 of the Act of 1908, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The implication is that all State moneys will be used by a local authority entirely for post-primary education and that none of the State money need be used in any way for assisting in the provision of scholarships to the universities. There is in that subsection an emphasis that the Minister is primarily concerned with scholarships for post-primary education.  I am referring the Minister to sub-section (2) of Section 4 and the implications there.  The Minister gives the idea that he is considering whether the State should give scholarships direct.  He feels it would be more in accordance with the democratic principle to require a certain amount of local authority finance and also to give a certain amount of acquiescence in local authority ideas as to how they should spend the money to work under the scheme in this Bill and on the basis of the distribution of money and the making of schemes on the lines of the Local Authorities (Scholarships) Act. He stands for paying a certain amount of deference to local opinion.</P>
    <P>I want to draw his attention to the fact that the principle he lays down here may be a principle worth fostering and worth approaching, although I do not subscribe to it myself.  I want to tell him it is very definitely contrary to the natural trend in the allocation of moneys raised by the local authorities themselves in the matter of scholarships.  While there are six, and only six, counties that, in the allocation of their money as between university scholarships and post-primary scholarships, accept his idea, in the natural working out of their schemes up to the present, there are six that go flagrantly against it, by giving more money to university scholarships than they do to post-primary scholarships and all the counties in between do not accept, in the actual working out of the local schemes, financial and educational, the theory the Minister puts forward.</P>
    <P>The only counties that accept the Minister's approach seem to be Clare, <Col N="2401" /> Offaly, Kildare, Longford and Sligo. These are the only counties where the amount given for university education is in accord with the Minister's principle that only one-third of the money is available for such education.  At any rate, they give one-third or less to university education.  The counties that fly in the teeth of the principle to the extent of giving more for university education than they do for post-primary education by way of scholarships are Limerick city, Limerick county, Galway, South Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford. Those are six of them.  They give more for university education.  They give a bigger total for university scholarships than they do for post-primary education and all the others in between give more than one-third of the total amount.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to consider a glaring case.  There are other counties that will be in difficulties in the first and second years and that may not be able to reach his principle for three years unless they are forced to give less moneys to universities next year and the year after.  The Minister seems to indicate that he thought I was in my sleep last night, that I was either misreading or was pressing home a point in a not too fair way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will remember that when we were dealing with the tail end of the Second Reading, I tried to put certain things before him to avoid unnecessary clashes.  I think we had unnecessary clashes last night.  Just at this particular stage, I want to tell the Minister what I mean.  I will take a few counties and I will ask him to bear with hearing mentioned again the name of South Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would again direct the attention of Deputies generally to questions that were answered on 11th July showing the total amount spent by each county or county borough for university scholarships; the total spent by the same counties for post-primary scholarships; and the amount that one <Col N="2402" /> penny in each of these local authority areas raises by way of rates.  They will also, I think, find in the same Dáil debates, in answer to questions, the number of scholarships given in every county.  The Minister wants only one-third of the total amount spent by a local authority to be given for university scholarships.</P>
    <P>Now, Tipperary, in the year 1959-60 spent £9,100 out of their rates in assisting by scholarships young people to get university and post-primary education.  They divided the money&mdash; £6,600 for university scholarships and £2,500 for post-primary education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall ask the Minister the question in regard to South Tipperary first and, if it is necessary, I shall ask him the question with regard to Donegal.  In the year 1959-60 the Tipperary people, under statutory authority and in the free and unanimous exercise of their whole voice, spent £6,600 to assist young people to get university education and they spent £2,500 on post-primary education.  I take it the Minister will provide scholarships straightaway in relation to examinations that are being held at the moment or is the scheme to come into operation in 1962-63?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Next year, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the year 1962-63, the Minister will provide South Tipperary with £1,500.  That is the amount of one penny in the rates there.  If they raise the same amount of money, £9,100, as they raised the year I speak of, and they get £1,500, the Tipperary local authority will have £10,630 to spend on scholarships, post-primary <Col N="2404" /> and university.  If the Minister tells me at any particular moment in my discourse that I am interpreting the Bill incorrectly, I shall spare myself and the House the trouble of listening.</P>
      <P>Take that £10,630 which they will have to spend after they get the first year's State grant.  This Bill says the South Tipperary local authority may not spend more than £3,510 on university scholarships and that they will not be allowed to spend the £6,600 they have been spending up to the present. Am I talking in my sleep or through my hat or distorting things? If the Minister says I am, I shall hear his intervention and spare even Deputy Cunningham the trouble of facing the problem he may have in Donegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the Tipperary people are spending £6,600 now on university education.  When this Act comes into operation, and if they handle the same amount as they are getting, they will get £1,530 from the State and they will have £10,630 to spend.  They must cut their expenditure on university education by £3,100.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they will have to do it.  However, I shall finish for the Minister.  Assuming they raise the same amount from the rates as they have been raising for the last two or three years then in 1962-63 they <Col N="2405" /> will not be allowed to spend more than £3,510, where they now spend £6,600. In the second year they will not spend more than some £4,000 and in the third year £4,800.  In the last year they will be able to spend only £5,500.  The Minister is shaking his head and it would save all of us a little frustration and irritation if I were allowed to subside temporarily to hear the Minister on the subject.  The matter is one of the greatest importance.  Donegal will be in the same position to some extent. Its position will not be as bad as Tipperary because the day will come when Donegal may expect to get the same amount of money from the State as they expend.  If the Minister wishes to intervene I shall give way to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point I should like to make is that all local authorities will get money from the State.  They will all improve their financial position.  I do not think the Deputy saw that quite clearly.  There <Col N="2407" /> is absolutely nothing in this Bill to make any local authority worse off in respect of the amount of money it will have.  In fact, the Bill is to make every local authority better off from the point of view of the fund for scholarships for education.  The point of difference I believe is that there should be a ratio between the number of students taking post-primary education&mdash;that is in respect of education after the national school, after the primary school&mdash;and the number going to the university.</P>
      <P>There is in fact a ratio existing already and that ratio is about roughly one in eight.  I have to take a figure like that in almost all countries, so that in making moneys available I think they should be made available so as to have that ratio between post-primary students and university students.  One in eight was the figure I worked on.  Some other figures available gave the cost of the university students' education and it appears to be about four times the cost of the post-primary education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We get the information from students generally.  It does not matter who is paying because the cost will be the same.  We are legislating for assistance for students.  The figures I am giving are for a ratio of one in eight and a cost of four times.  That gives a figure of four to eight, or in other words, one to two.  That is how I came to the conclusion that the amount of the fund should be one as to two, or one-third as to two-thirds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In this Bill the Deputy said that the local authorities up to now have not accepted the principle. If they had, I would not have to bring it in now.  I think it is time that the Department of Education gave some guidance to the local authorities in the matter.  This is one matter on <Col N="2408" /> which there should be some guidance because it is based on the factual numbers taking post-primary education and university education as a general pattern throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that that ratio is just the accidental working out of the matter and that you have no control over it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how it has worked out in several countries.  In principle two things are involved.  One is that I thought the local authorities should have guidance from the Department of Education on the matter and the guidance should be based on the needs of the situation, as far as could be ascertained.  That brings about the situation in which certain local authorities at the moment are giving very much more money for university scholarships than for post-primary education, to such an extent that they are out of relation altogether to that proportion to which I referred.  There is no semblance of relationship between them and, in those cases, the new scheme which will be prepared will have less money for university scholarships but very much more money for post-primary scholarships.  That is in the new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That will only be when the balance has to be adjusted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And merely for the purposes of balancing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a new scheme which will be prepared.  Deputies will understand that a scholarship scheme is an active thing and it is changing all the time.  There are people coming into it and people dropping out of it and scholarships are being allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schemes already in operation will, for three or four years, be committed to expenses for children in schools and not finishing this year, some finishing next year, some the year after, and so on.  Similarly, the new scheme coming in will have to be built up over <Col N="2409" /> the same period.  In the first year, there will be a group of students who will go on to the second year, with, in the second year, a new group being added on to that and similarly in the third and fourth years.  So, in planning a new scheme, a local authority will have to look ahead four years and ask: &ldquo;When all our scholarship students are in school together, that is, within about four years, what will it cost?&rdquo; They will have to base their new scheme on that.</P>
    <P>South Tipperary was given as an example.  The figures at present are £6,600 for university scholarships and £2,500 for secondary schools.  That is completely out of proportion to what I would have because, as I said last night, with a fixed fund to work on, if you give extra money for university scholarships, you must take it from those who need post-primary scholarships. In fact, what you are doing is catering with university scholarships for children whose parents can afford post-primary education at the expense of people who cannot afford post-primary education because you are taking extra money from the fund for post-primary scholarships.</P>
    <P>I worked out that the local authority in Tipperary would get about £7,000 odd from the State under this scheme and, with its present fund being raised from the rates of £9,000, they could look forward in four years' time to a total fund of £16,000.  That will be their new scheme based in four years' time on £16,000 and the fraction of one-third will refer to that fund and not to the present fund at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What will they do in 1961-62 and in 1962-63?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have a better chance of keeping this going if the Deputy did not interrupt.  In four years' time, they would have a fund of £16,000.  Each year, there will be a new set of scholarships.  So, to prepare a scheme properly, the local authority would have to allow one-fourth of their total final fund for each year. Therefore, for the first year, 1962/63, they will allow £4,000; in the next <Col N="2410" /> year, they will have to have that £4,000, plus another £4,000, that is, £8,000; in the third year, £12,000; and in the fourth year, £16,000.</P>
      <P>General Mulcahy asks what will they have in the first year.  They will have the commitments of three years of their old scheme, about, perhaps, £5,000 in university scholarships and maybe something less than £2,000 in post-primary scholarships.  That will be carried on as a commitment.  But, their new scheme will be £4,000, and one-third of that will be allowable as university scholarships.  The one-third, therefore, will refer to that £4,000 and not to the total sums being used, because you have two schemes, running side by side&mdash;a new scheme starting at £4,000, and an old scheme containing probably about £8,000.  In the second year, there will be £8,000 in the new scheme and the old scheme will be reduced by the number of students who have left school and university.</P>
      <P>Again, the proportion laid down in the Bill will refer to the new scheme of £8,000.  The commitments in the old scheme will continue until all the students assisted by the old scheme have left the schools and universities. Each year, as the old scheme is reducing, the new scheme will be increasing by £4,000, until it has reached its full size and the proportions, two-thirds to one-third, will refer to that new scheme as it develops.  It does not refer to the money given by the State alone or, as the Deputy thought, to the combined total fund of the old scheme plus the new money by the State.  It will refer to the first year of a new scheme which will be a full scheme in four years' time.  It will be made out according as the local authority decides how much money it will spend in four years' time and it will be on one-fourth of that money.  Is that clear?  I want to make it clear if I can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right that at the present time, according to the figures quoted, £6,600 is being contributed by the South Tipperary County Council for university scholarships and £2,500 approximately <Col N="2411" /> for post-primary scholarships.  Assuming that that amount of money is made available by the South Tipperary County Council for, say, the next two or three years&mdash;for the purpose of clarity, I will not add to that in this argument&mdash;under the proposals here, the State would provide in the year 1962-63, £1,530 and in the following year, £3,060.  Do I understand, from what the Minister has said now, that the £6,600 that goes to university scholarships at the present moment will be allowed to peter out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The £6,600, which the Deputy is taking as the old scheme, will be diminishing as students leave university and side by side there will be developing a new scheme, one-third of which will have to be for university scholarships.  There will be two things happening side by side, one tapering out, the other developing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the position is that in a county like South Tipperary, on the basis of what the Minister has shown here now, on the present scheme of the 1d. and 2d. and 3½d. in the £, there will be £1,530 available from the State to go into the South Tipperary &ldquo;kitty&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the new fund, and one-third of that in the first year goes to university scholarships, no matter what is being paid under the existing scheme.  In the next year there will <Col N="2412" /> be £306 and one-third of that can be added on to the old scheme to go with the petering out money under the old scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just one-third of the old contribution.  While the old scheme is running out the total money coming to the council will be the same but there will be some rates money coming into the new scheme so that the new scheme will contain more than the State grant.  The new scheme will be planned to come into full cost in four years.  Whoever will be drawing up the scheme will see how much money he will have in four years' time and in round figures that will mean £16,000. He can spend £4,000 in the first year, £8,000 the next year and £12,000 and £16,000 in the following two years.  He must have a fund of £4,000 for the new scheme which will be made up partly from the rates and partly from the State contribution.</P>
      <P>There will be £1,530 from the State and the difference will be made up to the round figure of £4,000 and on that £4,000 will be made the division of two-thirds as to one-third.  It is the division of a new fund starting, which in the first year will be £4,000.  The money coming from the rates, I hope, will not be reduced.  They will still get the £9,000 for scholarships but the commitments for that money under the old scheme will be reduced more in the first year, in the second year and the third year.  Say you have £9,000 coming in and there is £1,000 less going out because of students leaving universities. That £1,000 will go on to the new fund of £2,000 or £2,500.  The rates will still collect £9,000 but the commitment of the rates to the old scheme will become less and less and the commitments from the rates to the new scheme will become more and more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the South Tipperary County Council, a popularly elected body, close to the people and with a very great educational tradition in the institutions that are there, have pursued, under their own natural volition and with the statutory powers given them by British Parliament in its day and by Irish Parliament in its day, a certain line of policy which favoured substantially university education, and stands out clearly on the list of places in the country that have favoured university education by scholarships for its young people.  Now the Minister is stepping in to say that the educational effort is to be artificially altered in a period of four years.</P>
      <P>I say the Minister is flying in the face of what is a natural tradition of the people in Tipperary and that nobody in South Tipperary suggests that the Minister has given any indication of how this scheme will favour South Tipperary.  Country Donegal has pursued a similar policy, spending £2,019 on university education and £2,750 on post primary education.  In a similar way, Monaghan, Leitrim, Cavan, Louth, Mayo, Roscommon, Westmeath, Meath, Galway, Wicklow, Limerick, North Tipperary, South Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, Cork and Kerry have all pursued a policy which has outstepped the Minister's figures, and the Minister, by a rule of thumb, seems to be going against that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Col N="2414" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand what the Minister means by guidance.  Under the educational policies available, our local authorities have pursued a set plan of giving greater emphasis to university education from the point of view of scholarships than the Minister is prepared to give.  What I have asked the Minister in this amendment is to provide that nothing in the section shall operate to constrain a corporation or council to reduce the total amount allocated in the financial year 1960/61 for the provision of assistance under the Act of 1908, or to refrain adding to it in any subsequent year a sum not greater than one-third of additional moneys provided from the rates and the State grant.</P>
      <P>I thought it desirable that a certain amount of money should be spent by way of university scholarship on the education of our young people.  I thought it important that under the new circumstances a greater scope should be provided for general education under this Bill.  If a local authority has been given more than one-third of the money that they are raising from their own resources today, do not restrain them in a way that will make them give less when the State is entering into the educational sphere by giving £300,000 additional contribution to scholarships throughout the country.</P>
      <P>If the State has got the idea that it should do more in regard to scholarships, and if in the view of the matter which the Minister has put before us that this is just a beginning or a breakthrough in a situation which was poor up to the moment, surely this is not the time to tell the people who are spending a certain amount of money out of their local resources on university education that they cannot spend as much in the future?  Why should a progressive county like Tipperary be prevented by a new progressive Bill from opening educational avenues to their children which they opened in the past?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware of the facilities available in South Tipperary for secondary education.  I have indicated the various counties the Minister is crossing. At present according to the figures provided here Waterford are spending £2,349 a year on university scholarships, and £1,350 on post-primary scholarships.  They are making a total contribution of £3,699 from the rates, and it is divided in that way. The Minister proposes that he should give them a penny on the £, that is, £1,128 in the first year, £2,256 in the second year, and it will not be until the third year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Those figures are the figures for the complete scheme which is in existence.  I think it is unfair to compare a complete new scheme with a quarter of a scheme, if the Deputy wants to make a comparison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I get this clear?  Let us go back to South Tipperary.  At the present moment South Tipperary are spending £6,600 on university education.  The Minister's idea is that, in this four or five years' scheme, a layer will come off that expenditure next year and the <Col N="2417" /> year after, and that a layer will go on from the new moneys coming in from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>A new scheme will be built up with money from the rates and the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That new scheme will not allow South Tipperary to spend as much on university scholarships in four years' time as they are spending today, or as they spent last year or the year before. That is the position.  As I say, Waterford is in the same position.  It will be petering out in the same way.  Can I take it that the Minister has made it clear, at any rate, that none of the present scholarships will be interfered with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  They are commitments.  They have nothing to do with the new scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the Minister that it will not be possible to add to the university scholarships scheme in Tipperary as long as the amount being paid in scholarships is higher than one-third? There are two questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean a separate scheme where the rates would give extra scholarships over and above the new scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not over and above the new scheme.  At present, taking Tipperary, let us say there is a sixpenny rate struck for this purpose and, as the university scholarships peter out, they can add to them.  That is the first consideration.  The second is that they can add to them not more than one-third of the amount of money that comes from the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I should need a blackboard to explain this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not one-third of <Col N="2418" /> the money coming from the State that you will have.  You will have £9,000 collected in Tipperary&mdash;I am not legislating for Tipperary but I am committed to Tipperary for all the examples because the Deputy has mentioned it so often&mdash;and that money is now fully committed in the old scheme. In a year's time a big number of students will have finished their scholarships and of that £9,000 there may be say £2,500 not committed under the old scheme.  That £2,500 will be transferred to the new scheme.  For simplicity, say they get £1,500 from the State.  That will make £4,000 in the new scheme.  Is that clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it this will continue until ultimately you have one scheme and not two running side by side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Each year there will be a drop of, say, £2,500 in the commitments under the old scheme.  That money will be applied to the new scheme and will be combined with the money coming from the State.  Of the total amount one-third will be allocated for university scholarships and two-thirds for post-primary scholarships. While the Deputy says he would prefer to have a much higher proportion of money spent on university scholarships I am prepared to disagree with him.  I know what he is dealing with; he has one opinion and I have another. I think he feels the councils are going to lose and I must say again that in compensation for having a reduced number of university scholarships Tipperary will have a very much increased fund for post-primary scholarships. In fact from £2,500 spent on post-primary scholarships they will be able to spend £11,000 as compensation for a drop of about £1,000 in university scholarships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from compensation in Tipperary in post-primary scholarships almost all other counties&mdash;the vast majority of them&mdash;will have very much expanded post-primary scholarships and expanded university scholarships and while it may be a matter of opinion that we should have more university scholarships in Tipperary, I think the ratio as set out is the proper one. <Col N="2419" /> But I can see that the Deputy may hold another opinion.  If there are fewer university scholarships in Tipperary there will be vastly increased post-primary opportunities.  If you want to take away from the post-primary opportunities you could add to the university opportunities and I would not agree with that.</P>
    <P>Donegal has been mentioned.  The total fund in Donegal at the moment is £4,770.  The Deputy said that Donegal would lose under this scheme but Donegal could ultimately get £12,375 and of that £4,125 would be for university scholarships as against £2,000 at the moment.  They will double the number of university scholarships instead of losing, as the Deputy said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In the new scheme. What the Deputy was doing was comparing a fully-established old scheme with one-quarter of the new scheme which is not a fair comparison.  A fully developed new scheme will take about four years as it takes about four years for a student to go through the full course.  You cannot just pay for the first year.  It is only from the fourth year and onwards that you will be getting the full expense of the scholarship scheme because you will then have first, second, third and fourth-year students.  The proportion of university to post-primary moneys allocated will be changed.  I have done that purposely because I have related it to the realities of the post-primary university relationship as it exists in most other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I come in briefly on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that we have now exhausted the possibilities in regard to North and South Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to speak about North Tipperary.  I am a bit confused about this and I want to see if I have the right angle on it. The Minister says he is presenting a new scheme to augment the funds available to the different local authorities, <Col N="2420" /> on certain conditions.  One condition is that gradually, over a period of, say, four years, scholarship schemes will be brought into line with what the Minister regards as the proper ratio between university and post-primary scholarships.  That ratio in this country and in other comparable countries generally seems to be two to one&mdash;one-third university and two-thirds post-primary.</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear about this.  I think Limerick allocates 5d. or 6d. in the £ for scholarships of which I think, the bigger proportion at present goes to university scholarships or it will, with the addition of a new scholarship this year.  The new scheme starts in 1962-63 and the Minister will give £ for £ in the first year up to a maximum of 1d. in the £ on the rates.  Is that not correct?  In the second year he will give £ for £ up to a maximum of 2d., plus £3 or £2 excess up to a certain limit.  That is still substantially below the total amount given by Limerick Corporation at present.  Do we get to the stage where, say, after four years, the Limerick Corporation scheme is amended with the addition of funds from the Department to the two-to-one ratio and if it is, what proportion will the Limerick ratepayers' contribution bear to the State contribution? That is what I am not clear about.  Does the State in fact pay 50/50 for four years when the new scheme presumably will be in full operation, or do the ratepayers pay 5d. or 6d. and will the State pay only a maximum of 2d. plus the excess £3 or £2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill allows for the payment by the State of £ for £ on the produce of 1d. in the £ in the first year and on the produce of 2d. in the £ in the second year.  In the third year the State pays 30s. on the produce of the third penny and 30s. on the produce of the fourth penny.  The produce of 4d. on the rates would be augmented by the State by a sum equal to the produce of 5d. The ceiling is 5d.  The State gives the equivalent of 5d. in the £ on the rates if the local authority levies a rate up to 4d. on its own.  If the local <Col N="2421" /> authority raises 6d. or 7d. in the £, it will not get anything extra.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night the Minister spoke in terms of money ratios and I raised the point of the ratio as between the value of the scholarships.  Encouragement of higher education is a logical policy.  The purpose of the education schemes is to try and provide a higher education for an increased number of people.  There is, however, a wide difference between the value of a scholarship necessary to send a student to a secondary or vocational school and that necessary to send a student to a university.  You might award four secondary scholarships to one university scholarship by reason of the value.  If we put a limit to the amount of money which may be spent on university scholarships, are we curtailing the opportunities for students?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not limiting the absolute amount.  We are limiting the ratio between university and post-primary scholarships.  A person cannot go to a university unless he has post-primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>But by assisting people to obtain a secondary education we are decreasing the opportunities for university education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a valid argument if they all got post-primary education.  But if you decreased the opportunity for post-primary education, then these people would never receive a university education because they would not have a post-primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were possible, I should like to see education available <Col N="2422" /> at all levels for everybody.  At present county councils make university and secondary scholarships available on a certain ratio, and provide an opportunity for brighter students to proceed to a university.  By introducing fixed amounts and following the direction the Minister speaks of, are we limiting the number of scholarships which may be available?  In my own constituency, where they have the opportunity of a secondary education in a number of smaller centres, we are anxious to assist them to get it at a cheap rate.  Will the introduction of fixed amounts allow for the same provision of university scholarships?</P>

      <P>Having taken them to the top of secondary education, we would wish to give them a higher education.  But within the State opportunities in regard to openings for these young people are limited.  Are we curtailing their opportunity to receive a degree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Post-primary education is the greatest need at present, particularly the opportunity for young people to specialise in the technical sphere.  Although Deputy Mulcahy mentioned South Tipperary several times, he did not tell us whether his view was the same as the view held in South Tipperary.  Some places spend over two-thirds on university education whereas in other places the <Col N="2423" /> proportion is less than one-third.  Both these extremes cannot be right.</P>
      <P>When the State is stepping in to increase the overall number of scholarships, both secondary and university, they should see to it there is a proper apportionment.  I agree entirely with this apportionment.  For people leaving the national school, there are not sufficient opportunities for post-primary education, both secondary and vocational.  Those Committees which have leant over towards university education have penalised the parents who have not been able to bring their children up to the stage where they are able to enter for university scholarships.  I would be interested in seeing that more children from national schools had an opportunity of doing the secondary school course or the vocational school course with an opportunity of specialising in technical subjects.  I believe the Minister is doing the right thing.</P>

      <P>The Minister has the right under this section to utilise the greenlands for military exercises and I suppose that is the basis of his right to dig trenches, for example, in the greenlands.

      <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill I raised the question of preserving the rights of soldiers and their families and outsiders generally of going across and watching the races from outside the enclosures.  I asked the Minister to take steps to ensure that whatever enclosing process was contemplated it should not deprive these people of the right they have exercised from time immemorial to utilise the Curragh lands for the purpose of seeing the races there.  The Minister undertook to look into the matter and gave me an assurance that the fencing would be done in such a way as to exclude the sheep, but to preserve the right of human beings to walk across the Curragh and see the races.  Could the Minister say what is the position in that respect?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister given consideration to another point, the constitutionality of this?  As the position is, certain people have the right to graze sheep at large over the whole 4,000 acres of the Curragh.  The effect of this provision is that it takes away their right to graze at large.  I know that it only deals with it proportionately to the number of claims that are cancelled but even so a person who retains a claim and whose claim is not cancelled has, at present, the right to graze at large.  Under this Bill he loses that right.  It is, to some extent, therefore a confiscation of the proprietary rights without compensation which, as far as I understand, is prohibited by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that so long as there is, beyond doubt, sufficient grazing left for the number of grazing rights that remain it is within the power of the Oireachtas to give me this power to enclose portion of the Curragh on the extinguishment of an appropriate number of rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided it is beyond doubt that there is sufficient grazing left available to the remaining numbers of grazing rights in existence. I realise that if you kept on enclosing more and more, you would eventually reach the stage that Deputy Sweetman has described where there would not be grazing at large.  The remaining graziers will still have the right for their sheep to graze over a very large area.  They will still have the full length and breadth of the Curragh apart from this portion which will be enclosed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that there is not the right to surrender claims in perpetuity and that, furthermore, some of the persons who have made the offer do not understand they will be giving up the claims for all time, that it may be only for the big race next year.  It is not clear they have the right to surrender the claims at all.  It is suggested that the claims go with the holdings and not with the person for the time being in tenancy of the holding.</P>
      <P>A further point is the fact that the portion being enclosed contains some of the gallops.  If those gallops are not to be used now further gallops will have to be provided on the outer lands that are not enclosed.  If additional gallops are to be put on those lands it will further decrease the amount of grazing available.</P>

      <P>It is to the Minister they will be surrendered.  In regard to people not understanding that they are, in fact, surrendering their claims entirely, none of these claims has been surrendered yet.  I think they are by now fairly well aware of the position. If there is a training gallop included within the area to be enclosed, the number of the rights which will be extinguished will be a number which will be equivalent to the total area being enclosed, including the gallop on which there is no effective grazing at the moment.  If a replacement gallop is established, rights in respect <Col N="2431" /> of an equivalent area will already have been surrendered.  There will be no question of any more land being taken than rights have been surrendered to cover.</P>

      <P>This matter was discussed twice on an earlier stage. It was discussed first on 22nd June, 1961.  At columns 840 and 841 of the Official Report it will be seen that I raised the point of why we should deem a person to be vacating his office owing to infirmity if he is removed from office on account of incapacity.  At column 842, Deputy Dillon is reported as saying:</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: May I seek clarification? Does the word &ldquo;incapacity&rdquo; envisage a judge who is mentally unstable and incapable of tendering a valid resignation?</P>
      <P>Mr. Haughey: That is the whole point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: ... We should remove him but we should not be prejudiced by the fact that he has become <Col N="2436" /> incapable validly to resign on the grounds of incapacity.</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey: That is exactly the point....</P>
    <P>There could be the case of infirmity of the nature instanced by Deputy Dillon, insanity.  There could also be a case of paralysis or some other form of infirmity by reason of which the judge was physically incapable of resigning. The only alternative is for the Oireachtas to move for his removal on the grounds of incapacity.  In those circumstances, it would be completely unfair to deprive him of his pension rights.  The provision is intended to deal purely with that situation.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: ... I think there would be unanimous agreement on the proposition that we should retain in our hands the power to remove a judge suffering from physical incapacity, if he is not able validly to resign.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that and see if some clarifying word could be introduced to give a more precise significance to the word &ldquo;incapacity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At column 844, I entered into the argument and said:</P>
    <P>Mr. McGilligan: ... As the section stands, it can apply to another judge who, in the extreme conditions the Parliamentary Secretary talks about, is incapable of performing his duties.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary this question: supposing the section or the subsection is not there and a case occurred&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this is the limitation&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;of a judge who became so mentally and physically incapable that he could not pen a letter of resignation, is there anything to prevent the Dáil voting him a pension?</P>
    <P>Then, at column 845, I said:</P>
    <P>I suggest it is not proper to leave this in its present form.  Either incapacity should be defined as being <Col N="2437" /> incapacity of the extreme type talked about or, alternatively, drop the sub-section with the understanding that if a person gets so ill that he cannot send in a letter of resignation the question of a pension would be considered. In that case the person would not really be dismissed at all.</P>
    <P>Eventually, as reported at column 847, I said:</P>
    <P>Let us take the circumstances of a man who is gone so bad that he cannot even write a letter of resignation.</P>
    <P>I said we had not had any such case in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>At a later date, 29th June, 1961, as reported at column 1328 of the Official Report, I said:</P>
    <P>I was wondering why should we treat a judge who becomes handicapped in this lenient way?  A judge who finds his mental or physical strength weakening can always retire by sending in his resignation. If he has a certain number of years' service he will qualify for pension. It was explained on the last occasion that this provision was put in to meet the exceptional case of a judge who becomes so infirm that he cannot send in a letter of resignation. That is a very special case.</P>
    <P>As reported at the end of column 1328, the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey: ... I think it is a very sensible and a very fair provision. Here, we are dealing with the case of a district court judge who, through no fault of his own, becomes completely incapacitated and incapable of resigning because of paralysis, mental disorder, or something like that.  Why should he be victimised?</P>
    <P>Is it not only just that we should, as part of the privilege of his office, defend that privilege by statute to ensure, in the event of calamity, that he will be entitled to his pension in the same way as if he vacated his office of his own volition because of permanent incapacity?</P>
    <P>It was to be looked at and the <Col N="2438" /> whole argument on the section before us was that this was to meet the special case of a man who had become so incapable that he could not send in his resignation due to paralysis, insanity, and so on.  Therefore, I move to insert in page 7, line 5, after &ldquo;incapacity&rdquo; the phrase &ldquo;which is such as to render him incapable of vacating his office by resignation in writing under his hand.&rdquo;  That meets the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, this matter has been discussed fairly fully on the Committee Stage.  On that Stage, I expressed the view that the provision was quite satisfactory. On re-examination, I am still of that opinion.  I am prepared to admit that we are primarily concerned here with the case of a judge or justice whose incapacity is such that it would actually prevent him from resigning. We are, in those circumstances, concerned to see that such judge would have his pension rights statutorily protected.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything to be gained by the insertion of the words proposed by Deputy McGilligan.  He could argue with some justification that, with the insertion of his words, the subsection would become more specifically directed to the type of case I have in mind.  That is true.  Even granting that, I still think the subsection as it is framed is preferable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will bear mind that, no matter what sort of incapacity a judge would suffer from, of its nature, it might impair his judgment in some way.  If we narrow it down in the manner suggested by Deputy McGilligan we might render ourselves likely at some future date&mdash;I admit the likelihood is pretty remote, but it is there&mdash;to cause an injustice to some judge.  I am anxious to avoid that at all costs, particularly when it will not matter in any way, because, as I argued on the Committee Stage, no judge is going to deliberately, and as it were frivolously, submit himself to the indignity and humiliation of being brought before the House of the Oireachtas to be dismissed ignominiously <Col N="2439" /> when he could avoid that by resigning.  The possibility of any judge ever doing that, of being so perverse, is so remote that we need not worry about it.  For that reason I do not think it is necessary to narrow down the scope of the subsection in the way Deputy McGilligan's words would do, particularly when the narrowing down might somewhere, some time, interfere with the pension rights of a particular judge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to take the peculiar case of a judge who is being dismissed or removed from office on one of the grounds which the Constitution permits.  As far as the sub-section is concerned, we are providing that if we take the course of bringing a judge before the two Houses to be dismissed, we are still deeming him to have vacated his office owing to permanent infirmity.  This is to ensure that he will have his general rights preserved. It is all very well to say that we can keep it in a general way and that it will be applied only in special cases.  Deputy Dillon raised the point as reported at Column 842, Volume 190, when he said:</P>
      <P>If there is a judge ... who is incapable, or on the threshold of incapacity, and cannot tender a valid resignation, and there is no other means open to him, I think the proposal in those circumstances is fair and valid.  We should not remove him but we should not be prejudiced by the fact that he has become incapable validly to resign on the grounds of incapacity.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's answer was very precise:</P>
      <P>That is exactly the point.</P>
      <P>It was detailed later:</P>
      <P>There could be the case of infirmity of the nature instanced by Deputy Dillon, insanity.  There could also be a case of paralysis or some other form of infirmity by reason of which the judge was physically incapable of resigning.</P>
      <P>Later Deputy Dillon said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there would be unanimous <Col N="2440" /> agreement on the proposition that we should retain in our hands the power to remove a judge suffering from physical incapacity, if he is not able validly to resign.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that to see if some clarifying word could be introduced to give a more precise significance to the word &ldquo;incapacity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Right through those excerpts it is a question of a person who cannot pen a letter of resignation.  I am trying to meet the position by saying &ldquo;Where a judge of the Supreme or High Court is removed from office on account of incapacity which is such as to render him incapable of vacating his office by resignation in writing under his hand&rdquo;.  That is the solitary reservation which I want to put on the matter. Now we are leaving the section just generally.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 32, after &ldquo;the Constitution&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a question of the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to secure that the Supreme Court will consist of the full court of five judges when dealing with any matter involving a constitutional issue.  Under the present law, and as the Bill stands, the Supreme Court need not sit as a court of five on constitutional issues except where the incapacity of the President or the constitutionality of a Bill referred to it by the President is involved.</P>

      <P>In Page 9, to delete lines 14 to 17.</P>
      <P>This is to delete all of subsection (4) which gives the Chief Justice the power to interview justices when he is of the opinion the conduct of a justice has been such as to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. I do not think the power should be given.  It is well known that the Chief Justice or other judge can interview justices and I do not think it should be included in this formal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment because this is one of the important and valuable changes which the Bill makes in the law.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage, this sort of thing has always been inherent in a traditional way in the office of the Chief Justice.  As Deputy McGilligan mentions, there have been cases when the Chief Justice has done exactly what is envisaged in subsection (4).  What we are proposing now is to give statutory basis to that procedure and I think it can be of very great value in the administration of justice generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure we could all visualise a situation where a district justice would possibly be behaving in a certain fashion, either through carelessness or a temporary lack of appreciation of his position, his obligations and his duties, and the Minister for Justice for the time being would not want to invoke the cumbersome procedure laid down by the 1946 Act.  We want to have some way of dealing with that situation and to have some machinery whereby a justice could be spoken to and the error of his ways pointed out to him.  I think it is infinitely preferable in many cases of this sort that a judicial person should carry out this function, for reasons which have been talked about here in the course of this Bill, and subscribed to by the Leader of the Opposition, that it is important to distinguish <Col N="2442" /> between the Executive and the judiciary.  This provision here is subscribing to that principle.  We want to provide statutory machinery whereby a judicial person, namely, the Chief Justice, and not a member of the Executive, the Minister, would carry out this sort of function.</P>
    <P>I could well visualise cases arising where this procedure would be of great value to a district justice.  Human nature being what it is, any of us at any time could well fall into the sort of position that we would not be discharging our duties as efficiently, as promptly and as correctly as we should.  It is important that there should be some person in authority in a position to advise a person in that situation and, by the very fact of the admonition being administered, the situation would be put to rights.  I think it is a valuable power to vest in the Chief Justice and it is desirable to do it by statute so that everybody will know where he stands.  The Chief Justice will have expressly conferred upon him by statute this power that, as I say, has always been inherent in his office anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my amendment to delete this subsection there is no question of any conflict between the Executive and the judiciary&mdash;no conflict whatever.  In point of fact, the matter does not arise.  There has been, it is said, inherent jurisdiction in the Chief Justice to do this.  I do not know where that is derived from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The English situation goes on a system that they lay down and then there are things they call conventions, matters they understand as things that ought to be done to make the machine work.  That was here all the time. That is being given legislative form, more or less to throw upon the Chief Justice the duty of keeping an eye on the district court and calling in a district justice when he thinks the administration of justice has been brought into disrepute.  I do not want to encourage the Chief Justice or the Minister to do that sort of thing but the power has been exercised; no objection has been taken to it; but it is there and it is one that is exercised very, very seldom indeed and with great <Col N="2443" /> reluctance if it is not given legislative form.  Giving it legislative form, it seems to me, draws the attention of the Chief Justice to it and it is more or less a direction to him that he has this power now and, therefore, he could be criticised afterwards if he does not call in a district justice when he thinks his conduct would bring the courts into disrepute.</P>

      <P>I want to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to this: If an ordinary citizen of the State comes to the conclusion that a district justice is behaving in an unseemly way, his recourse is to approach Dáil Éireann, directly or indirectly, or the Minister with his complaint but it appears to me now that if you place a statutory duty on the Chief Justice to admonish a district justice there arises the corresponding right by implication of persons who fancy themselves to be aggrieved by <Col N="2444" /> the conduct of a district justice to make representations to the Chief Justice. That is manifestly an undesirable situation because it is not impossible that the very matter in respect of which the individual citizen makes his complaint is a matter which may in due course arrive at the Supreme Court and of which the Chief Justice will have to take judicial notice.</P>
      <P>It is well established practice to all who have any understanding of the proprieties of our kind of life that you do not discuss with a judge any case before the courts which under any circumstances could reach his court for judicial consideration and even in our ordinary social contacts with judges the average person has to be very circumspect that until a matter which has become before any court has been finally and irrevocably disposed of you do not discuss it with judges.</P>
      <P>I can remember a case arising in which I believed myself and still believe myself to have been well advised to have raised a matter here in Dáil Éireann.  It was thought that the matter might have been more discreetly remedied by bringing it to the attention of the judiciary.  I replied emphatically that nothing would induce me to bring it to the attention of the judiciary as the subject matter of it might subsequently come before them in their capacity as judges and that it would be most improper for me to solicit an opinion from any one of them on the merits of the issue for which I was concerned, that the correct procedure was to raise it with the Dáil and the Executive and then, for the Executive, through the proper channels, to bring it to the attention of the judiciary in so far as that was thought necessary or expedient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Am I not right in believing that if we put a statutory duty on the Chief Justice as distinguished from the customary right he had by virtue of his office to admonish a district justice, we create a corresponding right in any citizen to turn to that statutory source for his remedy against what he conceives to be inappropriate conduct by a district justice?  If I am correct in that inference, then it must be manifest <Col N="2445" /> to the Parliamentary Secretary that, far from having improved the existing system based on custom and long practice, which created no corresponding right in a citizen to approach the judiciary direct, we have materially disimproved the situation because we appear to have created a right in the individual citizen by creating a statutory duty on the part of the Chief Justice.  I feel that is an aspect of the matter which may not have been present to the Parliamentary Secretary's mind when this proposal was brought before the House and he would be well advised when this Bill is before the Seanad to reconsider this proposal.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that there is available to the Chief Justice this discretionary power by custom, or however you care to describe it, to intervene if he sees something occurring which might reflect on the judiciary as a result of the conduct of a district justice.  Nobody wants to take that power away or to question it.  But, we raise the doubt: if we create a statutory right, and even duty, in the Chief Justice are we not creating a corresponding statutory right in the individual citizen which clearly he ought not to have?</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 28, to delete &ldquo;liberty of the person&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;life, liberty, fortune or reputation of a citizen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to discuss amendments 1b, 1c, and 1d together.  They do run more or less together.  In amendment 1b I want to delete the phrase where it occurs &ldquo;liberty of the person&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;life, liberty, fortune or reputation of a citizen&rdquo;.  In amendment 1c I want to put in in line 31 before the word &ldquo;functions&rdquo; the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; and in amendment 1d I want to take out lines 32 and 33 of the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2446" /> What I mean is perfectly clear.  This is an attempt to give over jurisdiction to various persons&mdash;the Master of the High Court and various officials.  They have been given power to do certain things.  I want to go back to conditions which involved limited functions and I have already quoted the judgment of Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore in the Supreme Court in a solicitor's case in which he used the phrase &ldquo;anything which affects life, liberty, fortune or reputation of such persons&rdquo;.  That could be considered to be a limited power or jurisdiction.  What I want is to have accepted the phrasing of the Supreme Court and conditions which permit people who are not judges to deal with certain things.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage, the argument turned on the proposal that because a man was not contesting this proposal it could not be regarded as harmful, and I raised the analogy that the criminal case would have to be considered by district justices, by judges and juries whether persons pleaded guilty or not.  Clearly that test could not be taken into the framework of the criminal code.  This does not deal with criminal matters, but there are other matters and situations which involve limited powers and functions of a limited nature.  I see that harm might be done by handing over certain rulings to court officials since they might go against the matters which I have set out as being exceptions.  I think we are going very dangerously towards a breach of the Constitution in this section.  Generally speaking, apart from these people not being judges, they will not be as experienced or so very well trained.  That is one of the reasons why one keeps separately certain executive powers from judicial powers.  Is this a matter purely for administration or is it a judicial matter?  I think it goes close enough to being a judicial matter and what I want accepted are the words marked out by the Supreme Court Judge.</P>

      <P>At the beginning, I would explain to the House that this sub-section is, of course, devised purely for purposes of facilitating the administration of justice.  The object would <Col N="2447" /> be to make litigation cheaper.  I think we can all agree that is a matter to be desired; anything that would tend to make it easier for people to have recourse to the courts in a less expensive way than would otherwise obtain is, of course, most desirable.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would point out to the House that the sub-section empowers the Superior Courts Rules Committee to make these particular provisions. The sub-section itself does not provide anything but confers the jurisdiction and the power on the Rules Committee. We can assume that the Rules Committee, under the conditions as they stand, will have full regard to the Constitutional implications of this matter.  Indeed I think they could be more relied upon to adhere rigidly to the Constitutional necessities than this House because they are a body much closer in contact with these matters and have better trained and more skilled men in Constitutional affairs than we have in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I object to and find Deputy McGilligan's amendments unacceptable for a couple of reasons.  I would explain that I am dealing with three amendments.  The first proposal is to insert the words &ldquo;life, liberty, fortune and reputation of the citizen.&rdquo; In the first place, I do not like the word &ldquo;citizen.&rdquo;  I prefer the word &ldquo;person.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It was never envisaged that non-citizens would not have recourse to our courts.  This is dealing with the general administration of the courts.

If we were to introduce the word &ldquo;fortune&rdquo; we would nullify the whole <Col N="2448" /> sub-section.  I think the fortune of a citizen could cover every possible case that might ever come before the courts and I think the same would apply to the introduction of the word &ldquo;life&rdquo;. The introduction of these words would undoubtedly render the whole sub-section completely meaningless because they would embrace in this proviso, in addition to criminal proceedings, every possible type of case so that we would have the ridiculous situation that the sub-section would read &ldquo;rules of court may, in relation to proceedings and matters not being criminal proceedings or any other matters...&rdquo; if we were to accept Deputy McGilligan's amendments.</P>
      <P>On the question of inserting the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; before &ldquo;functions&rdquo; earlier on in the sub-section, I think that is completely unnecessary.  The functions are either limited or not limited.  I think the way in which we have set them out makes them limited functions within the meaning of the Constitutional provisions and the addition of the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; does not take from or add anything to it. In regard to the third proposal to delete the last two lines, my argument is much the same as it has been with regard to Deputy McGilligan's first proposal&mdash;that it would render the sub-section useless.  The idea is that there are all sorts of matters which do not really require the exercise of judicial functions&mdash;matters such as the taking of accounts or making orders of an interlocutory nature. That sort of thing will certainly not involve the exercise of any judicial capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea is that the Superior Court Rules Committee should be in a position to delegate these functions to certain officers.  This subsection is not delegating anything; it is merely empowering the Rules Committee to delegate limited functions of this nature.  Surely we can rely on them to make sure that the delegation will be fully constitutional? Therefore, I am opposing these three amendments on the grounds, first, that the section as it has been drafted&mdash;as I already explained on the Committee Stage it was drafted in close co-operation with <Col N="2449" /> the Rules Committee itself&mdash;is, in my opinion, completely constitutional. Secondly, I reject Deputy McGilligan's amendments because two of them would have the effect, in my opinion, of rendering the section nugatory and the other one is not necessary.</P>

      <P>I am told not.  In any case that is the description given to its powers and it is intended to illustrate the fact that they have no written Constitution whereas we have.  There is reserved to the Judiciary the function of interpreting the Constitution particularly in relation to legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that, if we adopt the words of Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore's judgment in the Solicitors Act case, it may make the section meaningless.  That is just too bad.  The result of not adopting his words and thoughts on the Solicitors Act was that we left the solicitors profession for many months without any disciplinary machinery&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall not go into that question because that is a type of intervention that could elicit a tart reply.  At least the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that having drafted a Bill in close consultation with the legal profession we overlooked the principle to which Deputy McGilligan draws our attention as it is now enshrined in the judgment of Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore in the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We took the decision to have a written Constitution and whether we like it or not it is there.  If we do not like the terms of the Supreme Court's decision in that judgment, the only <Col N="2450" /> course open to us, if we want to proceed in a way which is at variance with that decision, is to amend the Constitution.  I do not agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that we have any right to legislate and say we can safely leave it to the Rules Committee or somebody else to avoid infringing the Constitution.  We should not by statute of the Oireachtas purport to entitle anybody to infringe the Constitution. Our function, as legislators, is so to legislate as to make infringement of the Constitution impossible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition will pardon me if I point out one little thing, that is that the Kingsmill Moore judgment incorporates the phrase &ldquo;in a profound way&rdquo;. I think that is the essence of the judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not the exercise of the powers here envisaged affect, in a very profound way, the fortunes of an individual whose affairs were being disposed of?  Remember it was the fact that the solicitors profession purported to deal with the right of a solicitor to practise&mdash;that was his fortune&mdash;that the Supreme Court was referring to when they said that it was the exercise of a judicial function in respect of the fortune of a person or a citizen, whichever you like to call him, which was reserved to the judiciary and which could not be delegated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary, in the light of his own interpretation of the consequences that would follow from the adoption of Deputy McGilligan's amendments, ought to ask himself again whether this perhaps laudable effort to abbreviate litigation does not go beyond what is possible under the Constitution.  That is the only issue.  Again, I remind the Parliamentary Secretary that he is confronted with a pretty formidable opinion which is rarely wrong on matters relating to constitutional law. Is there any advantage to be gained adequately to compensate us for the possibility that at some future date immensely expensive litigation will be launched in regard to something that <Col N="2451" /> is done under the powers here created which will result in a crushing loss to the parties involved and the subsequent obligation upon us to take back our own Act and try to reconstruct it in order to bring it within the terms of the Constitution?  I doubt if there is and I think the Parliamentary Secretary should walk warily lest it transpire that the warnings offered now prove to be well-founded.  In my considered judgment it is almost certain that they are.  The Parliamentary Secretary now finds himself driven back to the position of saying that he depends on the word &ldquo;profoundly&rdquo;&mdash;at least that is what I understood him to say in regard to the Kingsmill Moore judgment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not at any stage indicate that I was relying on that word.  I merely pointed that out because I thought Deputy McGilligan had adopted the Kingsmill Moore judgment holus-bolus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy McGilligan adopted was that the Supreme Court spoke of the fortune of a person as being one of the things in respect of which the exercise of judicial functions was requisite.  The important thing to remember is that this is purely a question of whether what it is proposed to do is possible under the Constitution.  Authority is quoted for a proposition that it is not.  Is it worth jeopardising the whole Bill in order to insert this?  I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be wise to adopt the amendments if the effect of them is what he says, to make the subsection virtually inoperative. Then probably the truth is that, within the terms of the Constitution as it now stands as interpreted by the Supreme Court judgment in the Solicitors Act case, it just is not possible to do what he seeks to do under Section 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points have been raised against my amendments. The first is that this is not enacting anything, that it is merely empowering other people to make rules of court in regard to these matters.  Then we are told the rules of court will be made by the Superior Courts Rules Committee. <Col N="2452" /> That is no protection.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of these two or three points.  Many years ago, when the Sinn Féin Funds Act came into this House, it was argued against on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. It was sought under that Act to have dismissed out of court an action then pending on the application of the Attorney-General and to have the funds set aside and given over to another institution.  It was later found out that the Chief Justice of the time had so little conception of the Sinn Féin Funds Act as being unconstitutional that he had agreed to act on the other committee and had indeed inter-meddled with the matter.  When that was revealed the Chief Justice of the day could not sit on the Supreme Court, which eventually pronounced the Sinn Féin Funds Act to be unconstitutional. The Chief Justice is the chairman of the Superior Courts Rules Committee.  There is a case in which his individual judgment with regard to a particular matter was proved by the courts over which he should have ordinarily presided to be wrong.</P>
      <P>That is one example.  The second example is this.  The case upon which this matter of limited powers and functions of a judicial nature was most concretely raised was the case which declared the disciplinary portion of the Solicitors Act to be unconstitutional. That was an appeal from the Chief Justice of the day sitting as a member of the Disciplinary Committee. Apparently, a Chief Justice for a second time had decided that something was properly constitutional which was found out afterwards not to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary possibly knows enough history to realise I am speaking accurately on those two matters.  This may cause him to inquire into this.  The Solicitors Act, which was eventually proved to be unconstitutional, was drafted with the consent and approval of the then Attorney-General, who later became a judge and who was a judge of the Supreme Court which had to condemn the law as being unconstitutional.  There is a case of two people who by their office would <Col N="2453" /> be members of the Superior Courts Rules Committee; yet, in three instances, those two people apparently had not as individuals the view of the Constitution which, as members of the court, they afterwards had to accept. That means you have not any great security by the fact it is the Rules Committee that has to establish these matters.</P>
    <P>The second point raised was the use of these four or five words, as suggested in my amendments, that we should include not merely criminal matters, but matters touching on the &ldquo;life, liberty, fortune or reputation of a citizen&rdquo;. Those are the four words used in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore.  He also used the phrase &ldquo;effective in a profound or far-reaching way&rdquo;.  He used a certain phrase of that kind.  In other words, it seemed that there might be matters that touched on the reputation or fortune of a citizen but that might be so trivial as not to matter.</P>
    <P>Let us get this into its own particular framework.  One of the things mentioned was an assignee in bankruptcy. I could not think of anything more likely to affect an individual in a far-reaching or profound way than a bankruptcy declaration.  But if the Rules Committee think proper, that may be handed over to people who are not judges and are not courts established under the Constitution.  I think that is wrong.  The Parliamentary Secretary goes very far when he takes these words of mine and says they mean that everything is excluded.  The peculiar situation we are in is that we are omitting criminal matters which are excepted in the Article of the Constitution.  If we omit criminal matters, the judgment of the Supreme Court certainly governs the area marked out by the four words &ldquo;life, liberty, fortune or reputation&rdquo;.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has been advised that accepting these words means you might as well say that everything is excluded, then it means somebody is advising him that the Article of the Constitution which proposed to give powers of an administrative nature to persons not judges is valueless, because <Col N="2454" /> the Solicitors Act case has got to be read as an interpretation of that Article of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I agree it was desired when the new Constitution of 1937 was being passed to make provision for certain administrative matters.  The position of the Master of the High Court has been a question under inquiry and even under criticism several times.  I find it difficult to understand why the easy way out of that difficulty was not taken&mdash; to make the Master of the High Court a judge.  Then there could be no constitutional objection to his functions. Now we are adding on not merely the Master of the High Court, who is a person of legal standing and reputation, but a host of court officers.  I am advised that a number of these are people who do not pretend to have any legal qualifications.  If these matters are not limited, powers and functions of a judicial nature could be handed over to a person full of law if he is not a judge or a court established under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I believe these words are required. As far as the insertion of the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; before &ldquo;functions&rdquo; is concerned, it is simply to draw the attention of those who come to deal with the matter afterwards to the Article of the Constitution which prohibits work being done by lay people, except limited powers and functions of a judicial nature.</P>

    <P>The establishment of a level of income for farmers comparable to what they would receive in other sectors of the economy, the preservation of the family character of farms within the European Economic Community and the gradual settlement of the problems raised by marginal farms which do not show an economic return are included in the directive principles for an agricultural policy for the Community, <Col N="2456" /> which were agreed upon at the Stresa Conference in July, 1958.  The implementation of the various principles is to be effected through the Common Agricultural Policy.  Proposals for this policy have been drawn up by the EEC Commission and are at present being examined by the Council of the Community.</P>
    <P>I might add that the proposals which stress the importance of family farms do not involve any conflict such as is implied by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In page 13, line 16, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any other enactment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I indicated that paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (3) of Section 22 would probably need to be redrafted as they merely allowed for variations on the exercise by the circuit judges of the jurisdiction conferred on the Court by paragraph (a) of the subsection and did not, also, as was the intention, provide for adding to the list of enactments in the Fourth Schedule any other pre-1924 enactments which conferred jurisdiction on <Col N="2484" /> chairmen, recorders, county court judges or quarter sessions and which might inadvertently have been overlooked.</P>
    <P>The Fourth Schedule was drafted with the greatest care and is intended to be exhaustive but it would be unwise not to recognise the possibility that some enactment may have been overlooked.  The addition of the words the amendment proposes to insert in subsection (a), namely, &ldquo;or any other enactment&rdquo; is a better way of getting over the difficulty than amending paragraphs (c) and (d).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recall that this matter was discussed on Committee Stage.  I have been considering the matters which were raised in this regard on Committee Stage.  The proposal was that we would put certain restrictions on the right of accused persons to apply for transfer of their trials.  The proposal was that at the district court when the case was being returned for trial, provided the case was one which could incur a sentence of more than five years penal servitude, the accused would have an absolute right &mdash; and of course the Attorney General would have the same &mdash; to apply to have the case transferred to the Central Criminal Court.  Then we went on to propose that if for any reason the accused neglected to make an application at the district court or <Col N="2485" /> if the case was one which did not carry a sentence of more than five years, either the accused or the Attorney General would have the right in the circuit court to apply to have the case transferred.  The difference was that in the circuit court the matter would be at the discretion of the circuit court judge whether or not he would grant a transfer.  I felt that these were reasonable amendments to make because there is no doubt that a lot of the time of the Central Criminal Court is taken up with cases which are transferred there for what I may call unworthy motives and that a lot of cases are transferred to the Central Criminal Court which should properly be dealt with in the circuit criminal court.</P>
      <P>However, I have taken serious cognisance of the views of the House on this matter and particularly of the view which was very strongly urged by the Leader of the Opposition, namely, that we should not interfere with the rights of accused persons in this way.  While I think my proposals would have had a very great deal to recommend them, nevertheless, I am prepared, in view of the discussion and the arguments put forward, to give way on this matter, to withdraw my proposals and to revert to the position as it is at the moment, namely, that any accused person will have an absolute right, provided the case would involve more than one year's imprisonment as a sentence. That is the effect of amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 16.</P>

      <P>Amendment 6b is an alternative to this amendment.

It proposes that we do not impose the obligation on justices to attend these meetings. The other amendment is an alternative to that.

If Deputy McGilligan is prepared to say: &ldquo;Let them have those discussions&rdquo;, he must mean he thinks they are of some value.  I think they can be of very great value.  The idea of district justices meeting, discussing a situation in their various districts, the types of crimes they are coming up against and the standard of penalties, can be of immense value.  If that is admitted then the necessary provisions about making these meetings compulsory cannot be objected to.  We are making it statutory to enable these meetings to be properly convened and we are enabling the district justices to get travelling expenses for attending them.  I am quite certain that, when the situation is fully understood by the district justices themselves, they will realise that we are giving them something of value and which will be of assistance to them, something that will be widely welcome.</P>

I have pointed out on more than one occasion here that the court with which the bulk of our people come most often in contact is the district court.  Inevitably associated with its procedure is an atmosphere of informality which is calculated to give rise to an incorrect attitude in the minds of the people.  Our concern ought to be to emphasise at every stage that despite the frequency of the district court and the informality of its procedure, the presiding officer is a judge and that he has all the dignity and power and all the independence to resist the executive where that is necessary just as the judges of the circuit or the High Court or the Supreme Court have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often heard Deputies on the Independent benches proclaim what seemed to me the obscurantist doctrine <Col N="2491" /> that the attendance of the judge of the circuit court or the attendance of the High Court Judge on assize should be stripped of its panoply and that the attendance of guards of honour and the ceremonial associated with the arrival of the judge should be done away with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Swift dealt with that. I think that is on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Swift dealt with a lot of things but he was not always right.  Do not forget that he ended up in what was the 18th century equivalent of Grangegorman.</P>

      <P>No, but it is a significant factor, when you place excessive confidence in the beliefs of anybody, to inquire where did he end up.  Many a good man was misled by listening to specious advice and if he could track down the ultimate destiny of his adviser he might recognise more readily the wisdom or otherwise of the advice.  Let us accept that Dr. Browne took this from Swift.  I hope that Deputy Dr. Browne will not end up as Dean Swift did.  I should be long sorry to see it happen but I say that excessive desire to abolish the panoply associated with the administration of justice can derive from a complete misconception of the purpose it was designed to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That happens even in the solid ranks of Fianna Fáil.  Sometimes they do not attend to ask questions that they have put down, never mind move their amendments.  Chesterton said something deserving of attention and in many ways he was a wiser man than Swift.  He died in his bed in his own home.  Chesterton said when you come upon a practice, be careful not to abolish it until you find why those who established it created it, because the very evil it was established to abate may manifest itself again and you have no guarantee that <Col N="2492" /> in this generation you will have the wisdom of those who went before to provide so effective a remedy for the evil which may not only have disappeared but disappeared also from human memory.</P>
      <P>I do not think we have to seek so far to justify the panoply which we associate with the judiciary because what we are always concerned to do is to remind the humblest creature that there is one arena where he or she is equal to the most powerful, even to the State itself, and that is in the court of any judge of competent jurisdiction in this country.  There is no law here that empowers anybody to summon the Supreme Court to assemble and discuss their sentences; there is no law on our Statute Book authorising anybody to summon High Court judges to assemble and discuss their sentences and procedure; there is no law authorising anybody to summon circuit court judges to such a periodic conference and I do not think there should be a law authorising a newly-appointed officer under this Act to summon district justices under penalty to attend and engage in such discussions.</P>
      <P>We are marking out district justices as a different kind of judges and I think that is a mistake.  I know, and I speak with full deliberation, that it is bitterly resented by some of the more experienced justices who strenuously object to being put in the position that they are summoned under penalty to attend once or twice a year for such a discussion. I imagine the same justices would gladly sit in conference with their colleagues provided they did so voluntarily. I think their instinct is sound. They are right to feel that we should not put on them a statutory obligation of this kind because it makes them a different kind of judge.  They are right in believing that their utility to our society is largely rooted in the theory&mdash; which ought to be the fact&mdash;that, as judges, they are all the same and that the only distinction is the limit of the jurisdiction delegated to their care.</P>

      <P>We do not.  We stipulate that the High Court will be there, that the High Court Judges will go on circuit.  We stipulate times for certain purposes.  That is merely making provision in regard to the administration of justice.  That is not the administering of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is not the administering of justice.  Where we stipulate that a judge must hold a court on a certain day, we have a duty to ensure that the public shall have justice brought to them.  That is why we appoint judges.  That is why we give them their dignity&mdash;so that what will be brought to the people is justice. This has nothing to do with the public.  This is a summons to district justices to consult amongst themselves, and the implication is so that they will not do an injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  That is where the Parliamentary Secretary is making the mistake.  He is now creating or seeking to create by this sub-section a category of judge different from any other judge.  In that he is making a grave mistake.  He is making it because he is adding to the burden which the district justice bears. The district justice bears the burden of adequately maintaining the dignity and integrity of his own court.  The district justice has to contend with the relative frequency of his appearance at the same venue.  Familiarity breeds contempt.  The arrival of the circuit court judge is a relatively rare occurrence.  The arrival of the High Court judge is a very rare occurrence. But the district justice arrives every month.  The natural instinct of the contempt born of familiarity has to be <Col N="2494" /> contended with by the district justice.</P>
      <P>Secondly, of its very nature, the atmosphere of his court is much more informal.  As we all know, it may lead to a recognition in practice of conversations taking place between the State solicitor and the superintendent of the Garda and the district justice, which, I think, on reflection all of us are agreed now should not take place until the criminal business of the justice's venue is disposed of.  But that is one of the difficulties of informality. That is one thing the district justice has to resist in order to maintain not only the integrity of his court but the confidence of the people in the integrity of his court.</P>
      <P>Now, if it is to be known that, in addition to these two differences that exist between him and a judge of a higher court, he is also notoriously summoned by the President of the District Court to biennial conferences designed to secure that the judgments of the district court shall be more uniform, we add to the general impression that this is a court of lower degree, judicially speaking, as opposed to jurisdictionally speaking.</P>
      <P>That is wrong.  We are not going to get any corresponding advantage.  If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks this is going to be accepted gratefully and appreciatively by the body of the district justices, he is quite mistaken. It may be accepted silently by those who do not much care.  But I know that some of the most distinguished members of this body resent it bitterly and feel it prejudices their position in the eyes of the public and shakes their confidence in themselves.  These are things difficult to measure.  I suppose one could conceive of a circumstance in which a judge could become too confident of his own capabilities, but it is a tendency to be encouraged because, no matter how confident he may become, if he be in error, we have provided the machinery whereby the litigant or the prisoner at the bar can go further to have his error corrected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not that they have any inherent objection to the conferences. It is that they should be singled out by the statute law of this Oireachtas as being different from any other judges.  We do not tell judges of the Supreme Court or the High Court that they must read so many journals every year or that they must read so much case law from parallel legal systems. Doubtless they do.  If they did not, they would deteriorate very rapidly as judges.  But we do tell the district justices &ldquo;You must assemble and take common counsel.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to drop this provision.  I believe any advantage that can be got by such consultation will be got on a voluntary basis.  Make it mandatory and you are going to create a very disagreeable situation in which certain justices may go to the length of standing on what they conceive to be a matter of principle and saying &ldquo;We are not prepared to discuss the exercise of our judicial functions with anybody.  We are discharging them in accordance with what we consider to be our duty.  If anyone believes us to be a scandal or to have acted contrary to our oath, let the appropriate constitutional machinery be put in motion to remove us.  But we will not be directed to enter into discussions of this character, whether we think them wise or foolish.  Those who appointed us ought to assume that work is necessary to maintain our efficiency as judges in the district court.  That we <Col N="2496" /> will do.  If by our conduct it ever appears we do not, there is machinery under the Constitution for removing us.  The Oireachtas should not mark us out as a different kind of judge by providing an intermediate sanction under which no other member of the judiciary labours.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is stressing the point that the proposal that the justices should meet should be made voluntary.  Probably they would object to meeting at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Because judges have so much power in their own courts, after a while they become like little tin gods.  It might not be a bad idea if they did get together and realised their limitations.  We think we are little tin gods in our own constituencies, but when we get together here we realise our limitations.</P>
      <P>Judges are merely ordinary human beings and they have something to learn, too.  I have been in court now and again and I have seen how one district justice differs from another.  It would be good to have some sort of uniformity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin put his finger on a point.  Judges may find themselves getting into the belief that they are little tin gods.  But that does not apply only to the district court.  It may apply elsewhere.  I do not know how, if that feeling develops in the district justices or any other group of justices, you are going to meet it by making one a bigger tin god than the rest and telling him to summon them together and ask them to discuss various matters.  We believe the people appointed to most of our courts, although the routes by which they get there are devious, get responsible at the end and behave.  We are told they are in the habit of meeting.  Let that go on.  That is all right.  But one is to be picked out as the Government's choice and given power to convene meetings for the purpose of discussing various matters.  Of course, if that is done in a piece of legislation it means that somebody who <Col N="2497" /> is aggrieved can say to the President of the District Court: &ldquo;Look, you were given power under the law to summon these people together and you did not do it.  Why?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Once you write something into a piece of legislation you impose a duty on the people affected by that writing-in to exercise certain powers in certain circumstances.  I think it is wrong to do that.  The district justices meet at the moment.  I say let them continue to meet.  We do not ask them to read so many law reports per year.  We do not ask them to pass examinations at a certain time.  We do not impose on them different individual obligations of a certain kind.  If they are responsible people, and they are responsible people, they will meet and resolve between them any little difficulties they may have found in the administration of their courts.  Here it is specifically provided &ldquo;such matters as the avoidance of undue divergences in the exercise by the justices of the jurisdiction of that Court and the general level of fines and other penalties.&rdquo;  What does that mean?</P>
      <P>It means that the President of the District Court&mdash;whoever he may be&mdash;will say: &ldquo;I think there is a serious divagation in the exercise of the administration of the district courts and I will call you all together and lecture you on that.  I think there is a very big discrepancy in the general level of fines and in the penalties imposed and I am going to call you together to tell you where I think the divergence is too great.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary is going to give somebody the right to say to these people: &ldquo;Look, you are going wrong.&rdquo;  We have appointed all these people and each man makes a declaration that he will do justice, without favour and all the rest of it and obey the Constitution and the law. Now we will give one man the power to say: &ldquo;I want to impose upon all of you my standards.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;I am telling you <Col N="2498" /> now that you do not come up to the standard I think you should come up to.&rdquo;  We are asking them to discuss divagation between penalties and in the administration of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  That is the word used but this is to be applied to everything else.  Up to this a district justice could be dismissed under the law for stated misbehaviour and incapacity, and there is machinery laid down to provide for that.  The Minister can request the Chief Justice to appoint a judge to inquire into the conduct of a district justice in circumstances which are likely to lead to a resolution being tabled here and in the Seanad to have a person dismissed for either misbehaviour or incapacity. That is one bridle on.  It is the same as for every judge.  The district justice is on the same footing as every other judge in that respect.</P>
      <P>Secondly, he is subject to the rules of a Rules Committee, a committee established for a specific purpose, consisting of a member of the district court bench in Dublin, a district court clerk, and four others appointed by the Government&mdash;three members of the profession, two solicitors and one barrister&mdash;to examine the practice, procedure and administration of the courts and report as to whether they think further amendment should be made. That is a very good proceedure.  It is not observed, but it is a very good procedure.  It is wrong, first of all, that it is not observed and very wrong that its non-observance was allowed to pass without criticism.</P>

We say &ldquo;The maximum penalty shall be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;.  Sometimes you have minimum sentences for minor penalties. That is the first objective.  You must allow for the different circumstances and the different circumstances are, at first, observed by the man who is living in those circumstances and who knows what the circumstances are.  If someone makes an analysis and says: &ldquo;It is a peculiar thing that down in the west the penalties are such-and-such for such an offence and here in the east they are different&rdquo; that can be explained by the circumstances of the people in whose area the offence is committed.</P>

      <P>Put the whip on and they will begin to like it after a bit.  If the Parliamentary Secretary really believes in what he is saying, then leave it as it is&mdash;voluntary association. That kind of association is a great thing.  These are free men, able to utilise their mental capabilities.  A district justice will know if there is something wrong.  He will know what others may be saying about him and he will ask himself why there should be these discrepancies.  He will not be made any better by being forced to come along to this conference.  He can be summoned to the conference, but it will not do him a bit of good unless he is anxious freely to associate with the other people belonging to the district court.</P>
      <P>This should not be put in legislation. The President has power to summon the district justice.  If he does not summon him on certain occasions he will be criticised.  This is an obligation, giving him the right to summon him.  Cut out subparagraph (c) which says that every justice must attend. Let the President call them.  The good people will come and the people, who think themselves better than those who come, will stay away.  The bad people will stay away.  It is better that they should stay away because there is the danger that if people come who think they are better than the majority they will coerce others into the wrong point of view.  Let the President summon them but let us not have this nonsense of mature men being treated like schoolboys having to bring an excuse from their parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may be doing it unconsciously but that is what he is doing. He is creating a different grade of judge.  Of course there must be grades of judges in relation to their jurisdiction but there should not be grades of judges in relation to the judicial respect in which they are held or the <Col N="2504" /> independent discharge of their judicial functions.  The very essence of that integrity is rooted in the fact that we cannot sack them.  The only way you can get rid of a judge is by an extremely elaborate procedure involving the Oireachtas itself.  Deputy Sherwin should remember the only judges that ever got sacked under the system he loves are the judges who went out on a limb to defend him against the Government.</P>
      <P>The reason Deputy Sherwin and I should be solicitous to see that a judge cannot be sacked is that we might find ourselves hauled up before a judge by the Government and that nothing could stand between us and jail but that judge.  We should be solicitous to ensure that, if that judge effectively interposes himself between us and the Government's effort to put us in jail, it would not be in the power of this Government or any other Government to sack him.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should listen closely to Deputy Sherwin's interruption. He has already created in the mind of Deputy Sherwin the impression that this is an inferior type of judge: call him and if he does not come let him produce his excuse, and if he does not conform to the terms of that, sack him.  That is not the impression this Oireachtas should seek to spread in regard to the justices of the district court.  I would much sooner have Deputy Sherwin interpose to say: &ldquo;What shall we do if he does not come?  We cannot sack him.  He is a judge.&rdquo;  That was not his interruption. If it were, this proposal would be relatively harmless.  Deputy Sherwin's suggestion is: if he does not conform, sack him.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who stand most urgently in need of the uniform support of the Oireachtas in maintaining their dignity, their independence and their prestige.  Paragraph (c) of this subsection is well calculated to undermine all three.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to meet us on 6a, why not drop paragraph (c) and leave it open to the President of the District Court to invite the justices to meet him not more than twice a year, leaving them free to come or not to come.  If paragraph (c) is dropped you will have men coming to such gatherings who will absent themselves if commanded to come.  I believe it is not impossible for the President of the District Court to get pretty regular and full meetings on the basis of invitation.  He might get informed, friendly and helpful discussions amongst district justices who felt they were there out of courtesy to the man who invited them.</P>
      <P>I am as certain as I am standing here these discussions will bear no valuable fruit if they are held on the basis of a command.  Probably the best informed of the justices will absent themselves or will attend under duress and react accordingly.  Drop paragraph (c) and you will have rid this provision of much of the evil inherent in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon and his colleagues were very eloquent on some of the principles they have been brandishing.  In regard to principles we will agree with them but I do not think they are in issue here at all.</P>
      <P>What is in issue is this, that quite apart from the intervention of a Government, and it is just to avoid undue specific intervention of a Government, it is desirable that the district justices themselves seek out means of getting uniformity.  I shall try to be specific with a couple of examples. When we were putting through a Bill here dealing with road traffic, there was a great deal of regard to compulsory sentences and many people were strong on the point that maximum sentences should be provided by Parliament but that the actual sentence should be a matter for the judge.  That is a good principle and I think the Parliamentary Secretary after consultation&mdash;particularly in cases of drunk in charge&mdash;accepted that.</P>
      <P>However that does not dispose of other problems.  You have both social and police problems arising out of district court decisions.  I take it as an axiom that the district justice does his best to decide every case squarely on the facts before him and what I have to say is not to be taken as a criticism of the district justice.  A discrepancy such as this can occur.  Take a case of an assault on a Garda where a dangerous weapon is used, and, for some reason or other, the accused gets a suspended sentence.  Perhaps within weeks of that a man is sent to jail because he did not open the door of a public house quickly enough for a Garda&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They have a reaction on the morale of the police and on the public and at <Col N="2507" /> the same time they are matters in which it would be better if the Government did not directly intervene&mdash; questions of uniformity and general policy in regard to crime&mdash;because again the question of punishment in regard to crime can be a matter of policy.

If you can get the district justices together to discuss the needs of the country from the point of view of crime, the policy in regard to a particular crime and to establish a standard of uniformity, it is better than bringing in the Executive.</P>

      <P>I presume Deputy McGilligan is addressing the Chair in his usual orderly fashion.  I merely want to rise in order to defend Deputy Sherwin and to ensure that what he said will not be twisted unduly. Deputy Sherwin was envisaging a situation where these meetings are called.  A district justice, as outlined by Deputy McGilligan, attends one of these meetings and deliberately refuses, out of malice as it were, to take part in the discussion no matter how valuable or helpful it might be. Deputy Sherwin interjected to say that a district justice who behaved in that fashion would be guilty of misbehaviour in his opinion.  I think that is a valid comment.  I think it has emerged clearly from this discussion, that Deputy McGilligan is now prepared to accept that these meetings, if they are held, could be of very considerable value.  That is my opinion. It is the hope of the Government in providing this machinery that these meetings will be of very great assistance to district justices.  It is in that spirit they are asking the district justices to attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2510" /> There is only one net issue to be decided in relation to the amendment and that is; should attendance at these meetings become compulsory unless a district justice has some valid and sound reason which prevents him from attending?  I think the argument that they should is unanswerable. Deputy Dillon gave the considered opinions of certain important and much respected district justices of his acquaintance. The compulsory provision would not be aimed at this type of people at all and they should realise that.  We are all conscious of the fact that the great majority of district justices would be scrupulous in their desire to avail of anything like this which would be offered to them and which would enable them to do their job better.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that once the district justices that Deputy Dillon has in mind come to realise the value that these discussions can be to them and come to know the spirit in which the Government are offering this machinery to them, they will gladly accept it and there will not be the slightest difficulty arising from them.  But, there will be in this regard as there already is in regard to court sittings, the odd recalcitrant, the odd district justice who will not be fully conscious of his duty.  It is to make sure that the meetings are properly representative of all the district justices that we have this proviso with regard to compulsory attendance. If we are going to do the thing and if it is going to be of value, we might as well do it well and this is the way to do it well.</P>
    <P>I want to make this point: we stipulate by statute and by Ministerial order that district justices shall attend at certain times and places for court hearings. There is no difference in principle in making this further stipulation that they shall attend at a certain time and a certain place for these discussions, if they are requested.  If objection is taken on some constitutional ground to our directing justices or judges of any sort by statute to attend at any particular place, then that applies to the sittings of the district courts just as much as it applies to this particular provision here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2511" /> I think, as Deputy de Valera says, the Opposition are seeing in this and reading into it far more that is, in fact, involved.  After the machinery has been set up and has operated for a short time it will be quite clear to the district justices themselves the value that this machinery can be to them and I would hope that they would accept the machinery in that spirit and avail of it because it is offered to them for their own assistance.</P>

      <P>The way this is now put is that this is a most valuable thing for the district justices.  It is offered by the Government and with the approval of the House as something that is of great good to them, something which, after they have experience of it for a while, they will realise how valuable it is.  Then, the final thing is, &ldquo;If you do not come to the meetings, we will sack you.  We are going to make this a test of misbehaviour or incapacity.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There it is and the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with it. There you are.  That is what is to be made of this confused situation.  I do not think a man ought to be sacked for not attending a meeting which is <Col N="2512" /> called for the purpose of discussing certain divagations in penalties.  I do not think there is any misbehaviour or incapacity involved in his not being there.  He is entitled to stay away.  He is a free man.  If he is coerced into this sort of thing he will come there and not pay any attention.  Of course, that can be done.  The background is that if he comes there in a sort of unco-operative mood, something that might lead to somebody thinking it is misbehaviour and incapacity, then we take serious notice of it.  In the mean-time we are offering it as something very valuable to the district court.</P>
      <P>They are reasonable men, mature men, experienced in law, experienced in procedure, meeting already from time to time.  Let that go on.  We are going to say to them, &ldquo;The President of the District Court is going to tell you to come together once or twice during the year and if you do not come without producing an excuse we will take serious notice of it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to fathom the reasons why people do things or do not do things.  There is a famous phrase quoted from a very famous headmaster of one of the English public schools. Aaland of Rugby said at one time to a group of pupils, &ldquo;I will flog you if you are not pure of heart.&rdquo;  It is very difficult to know whom he was going to flog on that basis.</P>

      <P>The section says that justice may be administered otherwise than in public in certain cases and I read in the words &ldquo;such justice shall be administered by judges appointed and courts established&rdquo; and add &ldquo;save in such limited cases as may be prescribed by law, justice shall be administered in public.&rdquo;  We are making provision for the administration of justice otherwise than in public and are then setting out the cases in paragraphs (a) to (f).  The section says:</P>
      <P>Justice may be administered otherwise than in public in any of the following cases:</P>
      <P>(a)  applications of an urgent nature for relief by way of <i>habeas corpus</i> bail, prohibition or injunction;</P>
      <P>(b)  matrimonial causes and matters;</P>
      <P>(c)  lunacy and minor matters;</P>
      <P>(d)  proceedings involving the disclosure of a secret manufacturing process;</P>
      <P>(e)  any case in which provision to that effect was made by or under any statute, whether of the Parliament of the former United Kingdom or of the Oireachtas of Saorstát Éireann;</P>
      <P>(f)  any case prescribed by or under an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>My first objection to what is proposed in this Bill is that this is not prescribed by law.  I was told that the interpretation of this was that whenever in these cases the judge thought there should be hearings <i>in camera</i> such hearings should be held.  I cannot see how that is in accordance with the Constitution. I do not see these as limited cases prescribed by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is proposed as a piece of law and if this becomes law it should be in compliance with the Constitution.  I <Col N="2516" /> say it will not, because a compliance with the Constitution demands that the limited cases should be as prescribed by law.  Saying that in any case where a judge thinks that an <i>in camera</i> hearing was desirable such a hearing should be held is far too wide.  A judge may say that certain things should be heard in public and certain things <i>in camera.</i> That is not right.  The cases in which <i>in camera</i> hearings should be prescribed ought to be laid down by a piece of statute law which should set them down in detail.  It is to get that done that I have put down this amendment.</P>
    <P>I want to see that in these cases, if provided by Statute of the Oireachtas, there should be a limit and that the limit should be in accordance with the Constitution in regard to cases heard other than in public.  I have pointed out that the great majority of cases of the matrimonial type are held in public.  I do not know so much about the lunacy or minor matters.  I am not at all clear that all lunacy or minor matters are held <i>in camera</i>.  I know that <i>habeas corpus</i> applications, bail, prohibitions and injunctions are more ordinarily held in public than <i>in camera</i> and I want set out by way of statute what are the special limiting circumstances in which hearings of such cases are <i>in camera.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment because it is in fact nonsensical, an example of the type of thing which we have begun to associate with Deputy McGilligan.  The section proposes to prescribe the types of cases which can be heard <i>in camera.</i> The Constitution lays down the requirement that, generally speaking, the administration of justice must be in public except where the law prescribes certain limited exceptions.  That is what the section purports to do.  If the Deputy's amendment means anything at all, which is doubtful, the section itself would lay down only types of cases in which other statutes might be permitted to prescribe that other cases would be held <i>in camera.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment seeks to limit the types of cases that would be held <i>in camera</i>.  There are six categories of matters set out in the section <Col N="2517" /> and the last two of them, (e) and (f) deal with cases in which provision was made by any Statute of the former United Kingdom or of the Oireachtas of Saorstát Éireann or any cases involving Acts of the Oireachtas.  I want to put the other four paragraphs in the section on the same footing.  We should have statutory functions inside the other four paragraphs on the possibility of an <i>in camera</i> hearing and the conditions under which the <i>in camera</i> hearing could take place.</P>
      <P>It means any or all &mdash; so that justice may be administered otherwise than in public in any or all of the following cases: applications of <i>habeas corpus,</i> bail, prohibition or injunction, matrimonial causes and matters, lunacy and minor matters and proceedings involving the disclosure of a secret manufacturing process.  There is full power given in this section to a judge to hold closed hearings.  I think it is far too wide and I do not think it comes inside the Constitution under the heading of special and limited matters.</P>

      <P>In page 22, to delete lines 5 to 9 and insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The cases prescribed by subsection (1) of this section shall be in addition to any other cases prescribed by any Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>(3)  Any provision contained in any statute of the Parliament of the former United Kingdom or of the Oireachtas of Saorstát Éireann which provided for the administration of justice otherwise than in public and which is not in force solely by reason of its being inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann or the Constitution, as the case may be, shall have full force and effect.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Committee Stage debate doubts were expressed as to whether the provisions of the 1946 Act were constitutional. These cases which we set <Col N="2518" /> out were cases where justice could be administered other than in public.  I am as reasonably certain as I can be that the provisions in the section comply fully with requirements of the Constitution. On the Committee Stage further doubt was expressed that the section as it was framed might in certain circumstances give discretion to a judge where we did not want him to have discretion and where, in fact, we would want it to be mandatory to have the cases in question held <i>in camera</i>.  We have gone carefully into the matter and have come to the decision that there are amendments that should be made in respect of categories (e) and (f).</P>
    <P>We feel, in regard to paragraph (a), that is, applications of an urgent nature for relief by way of <i>habeas corpus,</i> bail, prohibition of injunction, that these applications could be left to the discretion of the judge.  The same would apply to (b) matrimonial causes and matters, and to paragraph (c), lunacy and minor matters and also to (d), proceedings involving the disclosure of a secret manufacturing process, but there were cases under (e) and (f) where the Acts in question actually make it mandatory that the particular cases should be held <i>in camera</i>.  A typical example, of course, is the hearing of income tax cases.  The effect of this amendment, then, is to make it absolutely certain that in mandatory cases covered by former paragraphs (e) and (f), there will be no discretion for the judge and, in fact, it will be mandatory to hear the cases <i>in camera.</i></P>

      <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that I proposed to move on Report to delete Section 47.  The House will recall that I then gave the history of the matter. The Rules Committees have now made rules governing this matter which are acceptable to the Government and therefore there is no longer any necessity for Section 47.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment meets with our approval.  The real principle here at stake is the utter impropriety of the Oireachtas interfering in a domestic matter of this kind.  I think it is a poor service to the language that it should be invoked for the purpose of disrupting a long-established professional practice. It becomes all the more ludicrous when the terms &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Phríomh-Bhreithimh&rdquo; are offered as substitutes for the customary form of address of &ldquo;my lord&rdquo; because it is quite clear that here we have a double fraud.  One is the pretence that we are introducing Irish into our procedure whereas, in fact, the constitutional procedure is that anyone can address the court in Irish to the exclusion of English altogether if he wishes or in English to the exclusion of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second fraud attempted was to suggest that &ldquo;my lord&rdquo; involved some <Col N="2520" /> obsequious adherence to a feudal practice inherited from the British administration here.  In fact, so far as the historic root of this custom arises, it derives from the fact of the close association between the courts and the Church prior to the so-called Reformation. It is highly likely that in our courts the practice of using this form of address survived for no other reason than habit but for us, particularly, it should have a sort of pious value in that it recalled happier days.</P>
    <P>The necessity to refer to this would never have arisen and, in fact, it would have been of interest only to those concerned in a scholarly study of legal history but for the absurd <i>demarche</i> of suggesting Section 47 and its adoption by the House.  I have repeatedly directed the attention of the House to the fact that we do no service to the cause of the language by making it a kind of political football and making demonstrations from time to time of our readiness to ram the language down our neighbour's throat.</P>
    <P>I gladly testify to the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary himself speaks and uses Irish but he should have the common sense to realise that he became fluent in it, not because he was taken by the ear and told that he had better become fluent, but because he was allowed to absorb it, because he liked it and wished to become proficient in it. Perhaps he is human enough to admit that if it were thrust upon him he might have reacted vigorously against it.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that I detect the hand of the Parliamentary Secretary on this section.  He will agree that all these Bills were drafted prior to his entry into the Department of Justice. In respect of some of them he thought he would put in some frills and furs and this was the most unfortunate frill of all that he saw fit to fashion. However, let justice be done though the heavens fall.  He has had the common sense to drop it, although there has been some rather undignified scrambling with the Rules Committee to get them to make some facesaving gesture in order to enable him to get out of his dilemma.  I have even heard it rumoured that one suggestion was that he would beat a strategic retreat <Col N="2521" /> provided his nose would not be rubbed too vigorously in it in Dáil Éireann. These pacts have no validity.  Dáil Éireann is a place for open discussion of legislative proposals and other matters of common interest.  The proposal in Section 47 reflected seriously not only on the discretion but also on the wisdom of the Parliamentary Secretary. His rather laboured withdrawal from the dilemma into which he had got&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If a man sets fire to a house, he must not expect to be applauded by the witnesses if he throws a bucket of water on it.  Let me not seek other similes.  Suffice it to say it is right attention should be directed to the fact that this, like other efforts to ram Irish down other people's throats, is ill-advised.  It does no service to the language.  On the contrary, it creates unnecessary antipathy for it.  It makes the Legislature look foolish, and I hope this is the last occasion upon which attempts of this character will be made.

      <P>The amendment is a simple one&mdash;to withdraw the whole of Section 47.  So disappears this effort to put modes of address into the mouths of the members of the Bar.  I understand that the Rules Committee met and passed some resolution with regard to this matter of modes of address.  If it did, I should like to point out that the Rules Committee, on replies to questions I put to the Minister for Justice, have been in breach of their statutory duty under the Act of 1936 since that Act was passed.  If they have met and sent the Minister for Justice any recommendation with regard to the modes of address, it is the first time they have carried out their statutory duty in all those years.  I think it is a rather <Col N="2522" /> shameful occasion they choose to have a meeting about a shameful matter.  I personally take no great pride in the resolution they passed.</P>

      <P>First, I want to rebut emphatically any suggestion that I made any sort of deal with anybody with regard to the debate that would take place here on this matter.  That is, of course, completely false.  I may say I would have expected a more responsible approach to this matter from the Opposition.  I think I have already given evidence on the earlier amendments with regard to the transfer of trials that when Opposition Deputies are prepared to put up a genuine case they do not find me unreceptive. However, I suppose it is too much to expect that that sort of action on my part would in any way be reciprocated.</P>
      <P>I have already explained the circumstances in which this matter arose. There was widespread objection to the use of the terms &ldquo;My Lord&rdquo;, etc., in the courts.  The Government took note of that objection and sought to do something about it.  It was not an attempt to ram the Irish language down anybody's throat.  I explained in the debate on the Second Stage that that was a completely wrong interpretation of the Government's action.  It was merely an attempt by the Government to take cognisance of and have regard to the objections made to the use of these terms in our courts.</P>
      <P>The solution proposed by the Government did not meet with general acceptance.  Fortunately, because there were on all sides people of goodwill and very responsible people, a compromise solution was possible, and a rule perfectly satisfactory to the Government was made without fear or favour or compulsion by the Rules Committee.  It is in those circumstances that the Government have pleasure in deleting this particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Dillon has been wrong and irresponsible.  I think he might have accepted this and commended all sides on arriving at this acceptable compromise rather than to be speciously trying to gain some temporary advantage over me or anybody <Col N="2523" /> else.  I have nothing but contempt for Deputy McGilligan's attack on the Rules Committee in this regard.</P>

      <P>In page 25, after line 9, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10) (a) Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act of 1961 shall not be taken to refer to a person who, immediately before the passing of the Act of 1961, was a judge of the existing Supreme Court, High Court or Circuit Court or a justice of the existing District Court and is appointed a judge on the operative date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  The reference in subsections (2), (4) and (5) of section 4 of the Act of 1961 to the Court <Col N="2524" /> Officers Acts, 1926 to 1951, shall be deemed to include a reference to this Act.</P>
    <P>(c)  Section 5 of the Act of 1961 shall have effect as if there were inserted at the end of subsection (2) &lsquo;or under section &mdash;* of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(d) in this subsection &lsquo;the Act of 1961&rsquo; means the Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1961.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment of a drafting nature and is consequential partly on the passing of the Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1961, and partly on the provisions inserted on Committee Stage relating to the pensions of county registrars and other court officers.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of the new subsection is necessary to ensure that the appointment of existing judges or justices to the new courts will not have the effect of applying to them the new superannuation provisions of Section 2 of the 1961 Act in the same way as they are applied to any judge appointed for the first time after the passing of the Act of 1961.  Under the Act existing judges and justices are free to decide whether they will adopt these provisions and thereby obtain a lump sum on retirement with reduced pension or retain their present rights to receive a pension only.  Paragraph (a) will ensure that this position will not be disturbed by the Bill.  Paragraphs (b) and (c) are necessary to enable county registrars and certain other court officers who cease to be pensionable under the Court Officers Acts 1926-1951 and become pensionable under the first section being inserted in the Bill by amendment 13 to convert to the terms of Section 4 of the Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1961.</P>

      <P>In page 28, to delete lines 25 to 39 and substitute the following sections:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  a person who holds the office of Master of the High Court, Taxing-Master or county registrar ceases to hold that office (otherwise than on being removed from that office by the Government on the ground of misconduct or inefficiency) either after attaining the age of sixty-five years or upon medical certificate that he is incapable, from infirmity of mind or body, of discharging the duties of <Col N="2527" /> that office and that the infirmity is likely to be permanent, and</P>
    <P>(b)  he has completed five or more years of continuous service in one or more of the said offices</P>
    <P>he shall, subject to the provisions of this section, be eligible for a pension consisting of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  if he has completed twenty or more years of such service, two-thirds of the annual remuneration in respect of the office which he ceases to hold, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  if he has not completed twenty years of such service, one-sixth of the annual remuneration in respect of the office which he ceases to hold together with one-thirtieth of that remuneration for each (if any) completed year of such service in excess of five.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a person in receipt of a pension under this section is employed in a situation remunerated out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, then</P>
    <P>(a)  the pension shall not be payable in respect of any period during which his remuneration in respect of such situation is equal to or greater than the remuneration by reference to which the pension was computed, and</P>
    <P>(b)  so much only of the pension shall be payable in respect of any period during which his remuneration by reference to which the pension was computed as with his remuneration in respect of such situation will amount to the remuneration by reference to which the pension was computed.</P>
    <P>(3)  A reference in this section to service of any person shall be construed as a reference to service of such person in respect of which he was remunerated, exclusive of any period during which he was absent on account of illness and was remunerated at a rate determined by reference to the rate which would be appropriate if he were on pension.</P>
    <P>(4)  Pensions under this section may <Col N="2528" /> be granted by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>(1)  Notwithstanding the terms of section &mdash;* of this Act, that section shall not apply in relation to a person who, on the operative date, holds the office of Master of the High Court, Taxing-Master or county registrar unless and until he elects under this section to accept the provisions of the said section &mdash;*.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person who, on the operative date, holds the office of Master of the High Court, Taxing-Master or county registrar may, by notice in writing sent to the Minister before the expiration of three months after the operative date, elect to accept the provisions of section &mdash;* of this Act.</P>
    <P>(3)  Notwithstanding the repeal by this Act of sections 4 and 5 of the Act of 1945&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  those sections shall continue to have effect in relation to a person who, at the passing of the Act of 1945, held the office of Taxing-Master or county registrar and holds such office on the operative date, unless and until such person elects under this section to accept the terms of section &mdash;* of this Act;</P>
    <P>(b)  section 4 shall continue to have effect in relation to a person who was appointed to the office of Master of the High Court, Taxing-Master or county registrar after the passing of the Act of 1945 and holds such office on the operative date, unless and until such person elects under this section to accept the terms of section &mdash;* of this Act.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that on Committee Stage the Bill was amended so as to give the Master of the High Court, Taxing-Masters and county registrars the same pension terms as district justices were given by the Courts of Justice Act, 1953.  These terms represent a considerable improvement in that they permit full pension after 20 years' service, as compared with 30 years' service at present but, as against that, the new terms involve a raising <Col N="2529" /> of the minimum retiring age from 60 to 65 years.</P>
    <P>There may be some of these officers now serving who would prefer to retire between the ages of 60 and 65 under their existing pension terms rather than wait until 65 and take advantage of the improved terms provided for in the Bill.  It is only fair that the present rights of these officers should be preserved and, accordingly, in the second of the sections being inserted by this amendment, it is proposed that serving officers will retain their present pension terms unless they elect to accept the new terms within three months after the Bill comes into operation.  A similar right of election was given to district justices in 1953.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the provision of a right of election it has become desirable, purely from the drafting point of view, to repeal and re-enact, with the amendments inserted on Committee Stage, the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of the Court Officers Act, 1945, which deal with the pension terms of these officers.  Section 59 of the Bill is, therefore, being replaced by the first of the sections now being inserted and Sections 4 and 5 of the 1945 Act are being repealed by amendment No. 17; but, as I have said, this repeal and re-enactment make no change of substance in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 3, to delete all words after &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo; in line 23 down to and including &ldquo;person&rdquo; in line 25.</P>
      <P>I urged this in Committee Stage.  I have since discussed it with people. No one can tell me what it means.  I got no answer here as to what it means.  The suggestion was that it meant apportionment of responsibility. That was denied.  That being the case, I can see no reason for this phrase being there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is as I indicated on the Committee Stage.  It is a form of words meant to denote, in the first instance, a proprietor as sole proprietor and, secondly, people who own a newspaper in partnership.  The amendment cannot be accepted because, if it were, the definition would be incomplete.  I should like to point out that the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; is used immediately after &ldquo;proprietor&rdquo;. It is not the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo;.  The word is &ldquo;means&rdquo;.  If we were to accept Deputy McGilligan's suggestion and delete the words after &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo; the definition would very definitely be defective because it would cover only those people who owned part of a newspaper and not the people who owned the other part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, Deputy McGilligan's amendment is not acceptable.  I have reconsidered the form of words and <Col N="2532" /> have consulted the draftsman with regard to them and I am quite satisfied that they do what they purport to do, namely, to cover both a sole proprietor and also a group of people who own a newspaper in common.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very odd there is no way of getting an explanation of what these words mean.  Let it be agreed at once that one wants to be able to catch the sole proprietor of a newspaper where one person solely is controller.  One also wants to catch, in the case of a divided proprietorship, each and every person who has any share.  The provision says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Proprietor&rdquo; means, as well as the sole proprietor of any newspaper, in the case of a divided proprietorship, the persons, who, as partners or otherwise, represent or are responsible for any share or interest in the newspaper....</P>
      <P>Take a newspaper that is owned by eight people with equal shares.  Every one of the eight is caught by leaving out the words I want removed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 4, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2534" /> We had arguments on this on the Committee Stage.  Section 18 provides that there is privilege given to a fair and accurate report published in any newspaper.  Newspaper means a newspaper either printed and published here or printed and published in Northern Ireland.  That has already been arranged.  However, if it is broadcast by means of wireless telegraphy as part of a programme or service provided by means of a broadcasting station within the State, I am asking in this amendment that &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; be included. What are we protecting in this provision? We are protecting a newspaper report or a broadcast of proceedings publicly heard before any court.  To what court proceedings are we giving this protection?  It is to &ldquo;any court established by law and exercising judicial authority within the State.&rdquo;  I cannot see why in the case of newspapers Northern Ireland is included but excluded in the case of broadcasting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all let me mention a question Deputy Costello raised on the Committee Stage, the question of reciprocity.  He asked to have it checked that in the matter of newspapers the British had not given us the rights he thought they had.  I have had that position examined and it is quite clear.  The British only extended the privileges in the 1952 Act to newspapers printed and published in Great Britain and the word that misled Deputy Declan Costello was the word &ldquo;Dominions&rdquo; in the Second Schedule, where it is used in an entirely different context.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this is reciprocity and the House will agree that in these matters reciprocity is a very important aspect.  It would be desirable that on as many fronts as possible we would have reciprocity with the British but the fact is that in their Defamation Act of 1952 they did not extend these rights to this country.  In regard to newspapers, the privileges in their 1952 Act are restricted to British newspapers and, in so far as broadcasting stations are concerned, the privileges are restricted <Col N="2535" /> to broadcasting stations in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of reciprocity it is important that we should do the same as they have done in relation to our own circumstances.  Accordingly when we came to decide on the particular provisions we decided that as a principle we would extend protection only to Irish newspapers and only to our Irish broadcasting station.  I think that is perfectly defensible and logical. There may come a time when we can say to the British: &ldquo;Very well.  Let us have reciprocity in this.  We shall extend our law to your newspapers and your broadcasting stations on condition that you extend it to ours.&rdquo;  That would be a matter for negotiation and something outside my particular province.  I am concerned only with being consistent. We decided that the privileges in this Bill should extend only to Irish newspapers and to Irish broadcasting stations.</P>
    <P>On looking at the situation we came to what I think the House will agree is a reasonable solution.  We decided that Northern newspapers because of their particular position and so on, should qualify for the same privileges as we were affording to our own newspapers in this part of the country.  Deputy McGilligan is now saying to us in effect: &ldquo;You should do the same for Northern broadcasting stations.&rdquo;  My answer is &ldquo;No,&rdquo; because there is all the difference in the world between newspapers and broadcasting stations. In this respect, the Northern broadcasting stations, such as they are, are nothing more than extensions of British stations and we would, in effect, be nibbling at the principle with regard to reciprocity if we extended these privileges to Northern broadcasting stations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you should have extended the thing to Northern Ireland and not worry about the associations of the broadcasting stations in Northern Ireland.  Probably the Parliamentary Secretary is technically correct in saying that the B.B.C. from Northern Ireland is merely an offshoot of the B.B.C. in Britain.  In fact it is something more, because it is located in and <Col N="2536" /> directed at Northern Ireland.  Of independent television, that is even more true because it is describing itself as U.T.V. and is very largely oriented to the listening public in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I think we have been very solicitous in trying not to accept that Northern Ireland is part of Great Britain.  I do not think we do accept it.  I do not think I ever have and I do not think the B.B.C. ought to be allowed to make us accept it.  I do not care what installations they plant in Northern Ireland, it does not alter the fact that Northern Ireland is part of Ireland and the admirable gentleman or lady who talks from U.T.V. or B.B.C. from Ulster, are Irish of the Irish, and could not appear anywhere else but in Ireland.</P>
      <P>An old warrior appeared recently on a symposium up there who was raving against the Taoiseach here, wrapping the Union Jack round himself and saying he was going to follow Great Britain into the Common Market, and all this in the broadest Belfast accent. There he was, looking like Colonel Blimp but looking like nothing else except a glorious obscurantist Orangeman from Northern Ireland, one of our very own who could not have been produced in any other country in the world.  Therefore, even though we find the B.B.C. broadcasting from Northern Ireland, or U.T.V., they are broadcasting from Ireland and they ought so to be deemed.  You can imagine the frenzy of our old friend who was wrapping the Union Jack around himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I could not say more and I think we would be much better employed in saying: &ldquo;I do not care what you plant in Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland still remains Northern Ireland; if Castro were to set up a broadcasting station in Northern Ireland, it is still Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  I think the Parliamentary Secretary is right in saying that in matters of reciprocity we should treat Northern Ireland <Col N="2537" /> as part of Ireland.  I think the mistake the Parliamentary Secretary is making is this: he says if we extend the privilege to broadcasting in Northern Ireland we are glibly extending the reciprocity to the B.B.C. in Britain. I think that is a mistake.</P>
      <P>We state that there shall be an identity of law in respect of all our people in the Thirty-two counties of Ireland without regard to nationality, whether they are visitors or native born. For the first time it appears to me that we are making a distinction; we are saying that because people associated with this are from somewhere else we are not prepared to admit that they are in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 7, after &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; to add &ldquo;absolutely.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put in the word &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; or before it.  I put down this amendment to clear up certain confusion that occurred on the Committee Stage.  I should not like the Dáil reports to be read by anyone with any legal qualifications whatever, to have the report of the 26th of July appearing as if it represented the views of this House.  I asked one time whether this word used in Section 14 meant absolute privilege or qualified privilege and I was told it meant absolute privilege. Then a discussion went on contained in columns 1981-82.  At the bottom of column 1980 the Parliamentary Secretary said: &ldquo;I said when the word &lsquo;privilege&rsquo; is used without qualification. Where could you get a clearer qualification than the wording here?&rdquo; This is on a different section.  Then he went on to say: &ldquo;If a thing is absolutely privileged unless you prove it is made with malice it is no longer absolute privilege but qualified privilege.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;You do not have any consideration <Col N="2538" /> of malice arising in connection with absolute privilege&rdquo; and I was told, &ldquo;You have one situation privileged which is absolute privilege. If a thing is absolutely privileged unless you prove it is made with malice, it is no longer absolute privilege but qualified privilege.&rdquo; May I say that that is nonsense? There is no question of malice arising out of an absolute privilege.  The Parliamentary Secretary said: &ldquo;These reports are absolutely privileged unless malice can be proved.&rdquo;  At that point I again said nonsense.</P>
    <P>Again in column 1892 the Parliamentary Secretary said &ldquo;The situation is that these things are absolutely privileged unless malice can be proved.&rdquo;  On page 1983 he said: &ldquo;All I am saying is that these particular things are absolutely privileged until malice is proved. Then they are no longer absolutely privileged.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now that is a terrible confusion.  I thought I might be confused and I have hurriedly scrawled down definitions of some of the recognised text books on this matter.  Gatly on libel dealing with occasions of absolute privilege says&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a very good book.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Granted.  &ldquo;No action will lie from words published on any one of these occasions even if the plaintiff prove that the defendant published them with full knowledge of the falsity and with an intention of injuring the plaintiff.&rdquo;  There could not be anything better than that.  Odgers puts it this way:</P>
      <P>Absolutely privileged occasions:</P>
      <P>All actions in respect of words spoken thereon are absolutely forbidden even though it be alleged that the words were spoken falsely, knowingly and with express malice.</P>
      <P>Frazer, on libel and slander, says:</P>
      <P>Privileged occasions are of two kinds.</P>
      <P>On the first occasion of absolute privilege he says:</P>
      <P>No action lies however untrue and malicious the statements may have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2539" /> Finally, the Simonds Edition of Halsbury, in Volume 24, says:</P>
    <P>If the occasion of the publication is one of absolute privilege the statement also is absolutely privileged and no action for defamation, either for libel or slander, lies, whether the defendant was actuated by malice or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has often availed of that privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a short statement in the very well-known Underhill's Law of Torts:</P>
      <P>No action lies for a statement made upon an occasion which is absolutely privileged although made maliciously.</P>
      <P>Then there is a quotation from a case in which a famous gentleman called Bottomley was involved:</P>
      <P>The privilege ... is to be exempt from all inquiry as to malice.</P>
      <P>There is also the situation as laid down in most of these textbooks that if there is a suggestion of defamation of any type, libel or slander, and if it is so alleged in a Statement of Claim that although the occasion was an absolutely privileged one, the word was spoken or the matter was written maliciously, one can get that out as being a pleading that will not be permitted.</P>
      <P>It is clear that if there is an occasion of absolute privilege you just cannot consider malice.  Even if malice was proved up to the hilt, it does not make any distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to have that recorded lest it should be thought that we were giving in on 26th July to what the Parliamentary Secretary said.  He was confused about the matter and I want to clear up the confusion.  I think the word &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo; should be put in here because there are occasions where the word &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; is used followed by &ldquo;unless the publication is proved to be made with malice&rdquo;.  That cannot be an occasion of absolute privilege. That is only qualified privilege which malice does not destroy.  I am told that anywhere the word &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; is used but not described it <Col N="2540" /> means absolute privilege.  It does not mean it in Section 24 which says &ldquo;shall be privileged&rdquo; and the rest of the sentence goes on to lay down a provision with regard to malice, which clearly shows it extends to an occasion of qualified privilege.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I think a lot of the confusion here has arisen over a phrase which I used in a very particular and restricted context on Committee Stage.  This Bill sets out in the Second Schedule two different classes of statements.  In the one case the matters referred to are privileged without any explanation or apology or anything of that sort, provided there is no malice.  In the other case the matters referred to are privileged subject to explanation or contradiction. Of course, the proviso with regard to malice applies to both parts of the Schedule&mdash;the First and Second Parts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; it covers both. It is a general provision in Section 24 in fact.  For convenience, in order to try to make the thing clear, I used the phrase &ldquo;absolutely privileged&rdquo;.  I used that in connection with Part I of the Second Schedule.  In other words, I meant privileged without explanation or contradiction as distinct from the matters in Part II which are privileged subject to explanation or contradiction. I think at the time in the House I explained that it was in that restricted non-technical sense and merely to distinguish between the two Parts of the Schedule that I was using this word &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting to the Parliamentary Secretary that, in fact, the six instances here set out are cases of absolute privilege in which the question of malice does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  It can be defeated with malice but there is this difference between that and Part II&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary certain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are published maliciously there is no privilege but there is this difference between that and the Second Part that there is no duty on the publisher in regard to the matter in the First Part to publish an explanation or contradiction if asked to do so, but there is in relation to the matters in Part II.  It was in that sense I used the word &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo;&mdash;that non-technical sense&mdash;merely to distinguish between these two Parts of the Schedule.  So, I maintain my use of the word was perfectly in order because I explained at the time the sense in which I was using it.  I think there can be no argument about it that &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; means absolutely privileged. In the Constitution, for instance, Article 15, 12 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>All official reports and publications of the Oireachtas or of either House thereof and utterances made in either House wherever published shall be privileged.</P>
      <P>We all, I am sure, accept that, in the sense Deputy McGilligan is using the phrase &ldquo;absolutely privileged&rdquo;. Utterances in this House are absolutely privileged but the Constitution simply uses the word &ldquo;privileged&rdquo;.  That is an excellent precedent for the Bill. When we want to connote the idea of absolute privilege we merely use the word &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; as it is not necessary to append the word &ldquo;absolute&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear at the outset that since we opposed a similar measure in 1960 we do not wish to create the impression that we believe there should be interference in the internal affairs of University College, Dublin, merely for the sake of interference.  We are only concerned with drawing the attention of the House to what we believe are improprieties contained in this Statute. Under the 1908 Universities Act, the Statute is laid on the Table of the House and it lies there 40 days as provided under Section 5 (2) of the Act. <Col N="2545" /> We wish to draw attention to the provisions of that statute and to what we consider are certain improprieties.</P>
      <P>The Statute lays down that certain College lectureships and assistant lectureships shall be established in the college in the event of there being dissent.  The 1960 Act alters the provision in relation to the conditions of employment of lecturers, assistant lecturers and professors and alters the conditions of the President in certain respects.  While certain of the provisions appear to us in themselves to be objectionable&mdash;I shall deal with them as briefly as possible&mdash;our main objection lies in the fact that if we accept this Statute we are acting in violation of the Charter of the University.  The provisions themselves&mdash;the establishment of certain posts&mdash;appear to be a matter entirely for the University.</P>
      <P>I do not think there can be any quarrel with those decisions because it is a matter for the University and it appears, as I say, to flow out of the provisions of the 1960 Act in certain respects, that is, either to appoint members to vacant posts or to discontinue certain posts as they must do in accordance with the statute and as they had not been doing up to 1960.</P>
      <P>The main objection arises from the fact that the Senate does not appear, as far as we are aware, to have ratified the decisions already taken by the Governing Body in this statute.  I might explain to the House that the Senate is the co-ordinating body for the universities.  It is the lynchpin of the whole idea of federation of the universities.  It is the superior body, the body which is responsible for the establishment and institution of these posts and for the final alteration of the conditions of service of persons appointed to these posts.  We are being asked to consider this statute in anticipation of the decision of the Senate and if we do that, we believe we are acting improperly and in violation of the Charter of the University.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, in respect of the provisions with which we are actually concerned, altering the age limit of the President under Chapter III appears to us to be undesirable.  We believe that, in effect, <Col N="2546" /> it alters the age limit of the President in so far as it says that notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter IV of Statute I of University College, Dublin, the President may, at his option retire on pension after attaining the age of 65 years on giving three months' notice in writing to the Governing Body provided he has been in office as President for not less than 10 years.</P>
    <P>There are many arguments as to why there should be age limits.  We have accepted them in respect of the judiciary and the Civil Service and even in respect of politicians in so far as they must be ratified from time to time by the people who put them into office.  Generally speaking, the age limit idea is accepted but this appears to set aside age limits in respect of the president of the University.  Even if we were to leave out of consideration the debatable qualifications of this particular President and the fact that there have been many incidents in the College which, to many people, do not suggest that he is the most desirable President, we believe there should be an age limit.</P>
    <P>The fact that in Chapter III we have no age limit for the President and Chapter IV lays down a specific age limit for professors shows inconsistency which, to put it at its mildest, is incomprehensible.  We think the suggestion in Chapter IV is correct, that there should be an age limit for employees of the University whether Presidents, Professors or lecturers and that the general principle accepted by all other classes of society should be carried out in relation to the President.</P>
    <P>There are certain considerations altering the whole question of superannuation benefits which are not of very great importance but there is another change which I think is of considerable importance and that is an alteration in the conditions of appointment of assistant lecturers, lecturers and professors.  Assistant lecturers and lecturers are to be reappointed at yearly intervals.  We think this is an undesirable alteration of the present system whereby lecturers are reappointed at seven-yearly intervals.</P>
    <P>There is also a most important <Col N="2547" /> change in that professors will be reappointed at regular intervals, every five years, instead of the present position where they are appointed up to the age of 65 and thereafter are reappointed at yearly intervals for a further period of five years at the discretion of the appointing authority. We believe that the year-to-year basis and the periodic reassessment of the qualifications of lecturers and professors within a relatively short time is most undesirable, that it could lead to diminution of academic freedom if they felt they were to be subject to review each year or five years and that their opinions or ideas might in this way be effectively censored.  It could lead to a diminution of democratic and academic freedom in the University and it is an undesirable power to confer on any body within the University. It is important that there should be security of tenure of appointment and that holders of these appointments should not be subject to dismissal at the whim of any individual.</P>
    <P>The sequence of events in the production of this statute appears to be this: the Governing Body met on the 29th of June and passed this Statute, which was then sent to the Senate. The Senate met on the 13th July and gave the Statute a first reading but I understand made it clear that they considered these changes to which I have referred, particularly the changes of periodical review, were of very great importance and significance and that they should not be lightly made without much more mature consideration particularly on the part of the Senate.  They suggested a further discussion of the whole question should take place at the next meeting of the Senate which, I understand, will not be until the 23rd October.  That means, as far as we can find out, that this measure has not yet got the approval of the Senate.  If it does get that approval it changes the whole complexion of the matter.  We can withhold our approval of anything contained in the statute but it gives us here the satisfaction of knowing that the provision of the Charter has been honoured and that we are not acting, as we believe, in violation of, or in <Col N="2548" /> anticipation of, the decision of Senate.</P>
    <P>The next happening was on the 14th of July.  A special meeting of the Governing Body was convened to advertise posts.  Incidentally&mdash;this is a small side-issue, I suppose, but it is important in some ways&mdash;the decision was taken to advertise these posts in two out of three national papers&mdash; perhaps the Cork Examiner was included&mdash;but the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo;, I understand, were favoured with the advertisement but the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; was not so favoured. I may be wrong in that, but I should like the Minister to reassure me.  We accept it as a general principle that there shall not be any vindictive act on the part of a political Party against a newspaper hostile to them.  It is a general principle followed by both sides of the House and followed by all Parties.  I think most of us would approve of it.  However, the important thing is that it was apparently decided by the governing body to go ahead with the making of these appointments, with all the consequent important repercussions, without having got the consent of the Dáil, first, and second, without having got the approval of the Senate.  I suppose that the latter is very much more important if we are to consider the Charter of the University. As the Statute repeats on many occasions, &ldquo;the appointments shall be made in the event of their institution by the Senate.&rdquo;  These appointments have been advertised but they have not yet, as far as I know, been properly instituted by the Senate.</P>
    <P>We think that is wrong and that it is a misuse of public funds.  In view of the fact that there was a possibility that we might not approve of the Statute and also in view of the serious attitude taken by the members of the Senate at the time the matter was given its First Reading, there was a possibility the Senate might not approve of these appointments.  In which case it seems to us to be wrong and to be a rather impertinent anticipation of our decision, in the first place, and of the Senate's decision, in the second place.</P>
    <P>The other point in relation to these advertisements is a point referred to on the Universities Act of 1960, a matter <Col N="2549" /> that had to be rectified, and that is that there is advertisement in respect of only some of the posts&mdash;not all the posts were advertised.  We feel that all the posts should be advertised when the posts have been properly established and instituted by the Senate in accordance with the Charter.</P>
    <P>We believe if this general practice is accepted, it can have a number of serious repercussions.  First, there is the possibility that if the Senate, which is the co-ordinating body for the federal system on which the Universities are based, is to be treated with what I believe effectively to be contempt, as it has been or appears to have been treated in this case, it can lead to the break up of the whole federal system. The function of the Senate becomes purely a nominal one and its powers are purely nominal.  This reference, &ldquo;in the event of their institution by the Senate,&rdquo; is merely lip service to the true powers of the Senate.  In that way, it seems to me the Senate must eventually accept that, so far as University College, Dublin, is concerned, it does not have any real functions.  It seems to me it could lead to the breaking up of the present and, I understand, desirable, federal system under which the three Universities are controlled.</P>
    <P>There is one final point.  It concerns a matter which, it seems to us, should be put to the Attorney-General.  It arises out of a phrase in the Universities Act, 1908.  &ldquo;If either House of Parliament within 40 days exclusive of any period of prorogation...&rdquo;  As far as I know, we do not have in our Constitution this system of prorogation&mdash; the suspension of Parliament at the end of a session.  Since there is no period of prorogation, the 40 days during which the Statute lies on the Table of the House cannot in Ireland contain this period of prorogued Parliament.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether he has given consideration to this point and whether, in so far as the period of propogation cannot be included in the 40 days, this Statute would be legal were it to lie on the Table of the House for 40 days.  That is the generally accepted view.  But it <Col N="2550" /> seems to me there is a possibility in the absence of this idea of prorogation that the Statute is not a legal and valid Statute, even after it is laid on the Table of the House for 40 days.  It is possible that the whole legality of the Statute could be questioned in the courts.</P>
    <P>In sum, then, I suggest to the Minister that if we accept the passing of this Statute without question, and accepting that this is not a valid point in regard to prorogation&mdash;although I should like the Minister to consider it &mdash;and it lies on the Table of the House for 40 days, we are violating the Charter of the University in so far as we have not yet got the final decision of the Senate of the University concerning the making of these appointments, the conditions of appointment of the assistant lecturers, lecturers and professors, whether they are in agreement with this idea of the period of reassessment&mdash;a very important alteration in the existing conditions of service of the University appointments&mdash; whether they approve of this age limit in respect of certain employees of the University and whether they approve of the prospect, which would strike many people with consternation, of an octogenarian Professor Tierney still controlling the University in a very important period of its existence, that is, the great expansion and building projects which are envisaged for the improvement of the amenities of the University.</P>
    <P>We face the possibility of passing a Statute here which, when its provisions are considered by the Senate in October, may be altered or rejected in part or in their entirety.  We may then be faced with the prospect of retracing our steps and reconsidering our legislation or of being quite rightly told by the Senate that we have no right to anticipate their decision.  Whatever may be the attitude of the President of the University to the rule of law as laid down in the Charter, I believe we, as the law makers, cannot treat the Charter with that same contempt.</P>

      <P>In regard to Chapter 3 of the Statute now before the House, I should like to point out, simply for the record, that there is a reference in the opening paragraph &ldquo;notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 4 of Statute 1 of University College, Dublin...&rdquo;  Statute 1 is not available to any Deputy, and the earliest available record in the Library is that of the Statutes from Statute 8 onwards. Statute I was made far earlier than 1922, and I understand that is the reason it is not available.  It is a pity when documents are referred to here that these Statutes are not available to us.</P>
      <P>I would not subscribe in any way to the provision whereby the President may, at his option, retire at any time after he shall have attained the age of 65.  Why they should bother to put in writing that the President of the University should communicate with the governing body, together with the proviso that he shall have been in office for not less than ten years, is something I cannot understand.  The interpretation of the clause that he shall have been in office for not less than ten years is something I should like to have some light on.  Can the President not be appointed and gain some benefit from this section if he is 55 years of age?  Are we to take it that the President is appointed at 60 years of age and, being so appointed, has then to wait before he starts thinking of sending in his resignation in writing to the governing body?  He will have to wait until he is 70.  That is a most stupid clause.  It is one of the most stupid that has ever come before this House and it emanates from people who are charged with educating the youth of this country. If a President is appointed at 64 years of age he cannot qualify, if we bring this to its logical conclusion, for this new improved pension unless he is President for ten years.  He will then have to give three months notice in writing to the governing body and he will, therefore, have to wait until he is 74.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having exposed that piece of crass stupidity I shall go on now to Section 2 of Chapter 3.  This will set a most <Col N="2552" /> extraordinary precedent.  It may create a most extraordinary position if the higher civil servants get hold of it. It states that the President will be entitled to reckon as years of service for the purpose of pension and gratuity his years of service as professor or lecturer in the college, in addition to his years of service as President, together with such added years as may be accounted according to the provisions of any statute of University College, Dublin.  It appears to me that under this provision the President will go out of office with a pension as high as the full salary he received as President.  The word &ldquo;pension&rdquo; seems to me to be quite superfluous.  He will lose nothing by retiring.  That might be a good thing. It might encourage people to retire earlier.  &ldquo;His years of service as professor or lecturer in the college&rdquo;. Surely there is room for injustice there.  A very prominent professor in U.C.G. would not have his years of service as a professor, or lecturer, in a constituent college taken into consideration. That would be a grave injustice.  It states specifically &ldquo;the years of service as professor or lecturer in the college&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The college is University College, Dublin, a constituent college of the National University of Ireland.  I do not know what say, if any, the Senate of National University has in this matter.  I should like to recall to the House that when the late Monsignor Padraig de Brún was President of Galway University and retired from that college he was cut off completely by that noble, considerate and charitable body&mdash;the governing body of University College, Galway, without one penny for all the years of wonderful service he had rendered to that college.  Nemesis took revenge on those people for that injustice in due course. I think one of the objects at the back of Deputy Dr. Browne's mind is to have a crack at U.C.D.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the denial. I want to have a crack at them.  The whole set-up, generally speaking, in University College, Dublin, is in very <Col N="2553" /> grave need of revision.  Perhaps when the Fine Gael junta which runs U.C.D. at the moment is changed&mdash;not, of course, to a Fianna Fáil junta&mdash;to a governing body of able men appointed on merit and qualification there may be some improvement.  The Minister told us that the terms of reference of this commission enable that body to make recommendations for changes in the charter.  Until that is done nobody can alter the position.  The Minister and the Government do not have to wait until they get recommendations from this commission, but it is logical to presume that they will wait.  I presume Deputy Dr. Browne dealt with Chapter 2 and recalled the reason why this House is now presented with Chapter 2 which deals with the abolition of vacant statutory offices.  We know a conscientious citizen succeeded in having a Board of Visitors appointed and that Board of Visitors discovered these irregularities.  Chapter 2 is introduced now at this late date&mdash; it is an extraordinarily late date&mdash;to abolish the vacant statutory offices, which the Board declared should have been filled.  It is unfortunate that this measure should come before us on the last sitting day of this Dáil.  That is not the fault of the Minister, the Government, or the Opposition, but it is a remarkable coincidence.</P>

      <P>I gave the Government's attitude towards the University last year.  In particular, we should like to see the autonomy of the University preserved and, at the same time, the responsibility for the management of the University placed squarely where it belongs on the governing body&mdash;that is the governing body of each college&mdash; and the Senate of the National University of Ireland.  As far as I can see this statute is in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The machinery for the control or management of the college by statute is such that the statute must be initiated by the college concerned. That is why the statute making an <Col N="2554" /> appointment always has the phrase that &ldquo;subject to institution by the Senate of the university&rdquo; certain posts shall be created.  The initiative is always with the college to produce the statute.  Having produced this statute it must lie on the Table of the House and, as the House knows, it can within 40 days be annulled by a prayer of the House to the Government.  It cannot be effective in regard to appointments until the Senate of the National University institute these posts.  Therefore no appointments could validly be made to these posts until they have been instituted in the University by the Senate of the University.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give a clear picture of what may validly be done, if the Deputy would not mind.  It is clear from Chapter I that these college lectureships and assistant lectureships are posts which can be established under the 1960 Act subject to their institution by the Senate of the University, but the Senate of the University cannot take the initiative. The initiative is taken by the college. As the House may remember when we were discussing this matter before, it is clear from the Charter that a college can deal in two ways with a vacant office.  It can fill the office by having the Senate make the appointment to the office or it can extinguish the office. That is what Chapter II of this statute is doing, extinguishing certain offices which have been vacant for some time.</P>
      <P>I understand Chapter III to mean not any extension of the age for the President but a shortening of the time, permitting him to retire at 65.  Statute 1 lays down that he should retire at 70. Chapter IV of statute 1 says among other things that the President &ldquo;shall hold office until he shall have attained the age of 70 years and on the occurrence of a vacancy the Senate shall appoint the President of the college.&rdquo; All I see Chapter III doing is making it possible for the President to retire before the age of 70, at 65.</P>

      <P>That is not my interpretation of the Act.  Another question is the establishment of other posts which again have to be instituted by the Senate.  The placing of the responsibility with the Senate of the institution of these posts is the proper placing of responsibility in university management. I do not think there were any other points raised.  I am satisfied this statute is in accordance with the law.</P>

      <P>The Minister concedes that the Senate has not considered the provisions of this statute.  Under the charter, the Senate is the supreme body and must make the final decision.  The governing body send these propositions to the Senate and the Senate considers them, and accepts, amends or rejects them.  We are acting as the governing body has acted if we accept this statute.  We are acting in anticipation of that decision and there can be no controversion of that simple point.  Why should we act in anticipation of the decision of the Senate?  These are not valid appointments; these are not valid <Col N="2556" /> provisions until they have been passed by the Senate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy allow me to explain that the Senate statute will come before this House. This House is the final judge on this statute.  If the Senate institutes these things by statute, it will be laid on the Table of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very desirable. It is a consolation to know we shall have an opportunity of discussing this again.  However, I must draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the governing body appears to have acted in anticipation of a decision of this House and of the Senate in advertising the posts.  A number of people will go through the very formidable and costly process of applying for appointments, a process so cumbersome and so costly that a commission has been established by the House to investigate how it can be streamlined.  A number of people will go through this process possibly quite unnecesarily in so far as these posts may not be instituted by the Senate.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister could express his disapprobation of the decision of the governing body who acted in this way and in fact violated the charter of the University in so far as they have not waited for the decision of the Senate on the appointments which they have advertised and which they will proceed to make.  We know they will proceed to make the appointments they have advertised; otherwise they would hardly have spent public money on the advertisements.  We do not know whether they will make the other appointments and not advertise them. It may be that they intend to do that as well.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any assurance from the university that they will not go ahead with these appointments before they are ratified by the Senate? If they are not going ahead with these appointments before they are ratified, why have they gone ahead with the advertisements which may be invalidated by a reversal of these decisions by the Senate?  The Minister has not answered that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2557" /> Now on the question raised concerning the legality of this statute when it is laid on the table of the House, it is stated in Chapter V of the 1908 Act, subsection (2), that a statute becomes law if it is laid on the Table of the House for 40 days, excluding the days in which the Parliament is prorogued.  We do not prorogue Parliament, so those days cannot be included in the 40 days; consequently surely the whole legality of this statute must be questioned and surely this House should take cognisance of that fact.</P>
    <P>Surely we should have the opinion of the Attorney General on that matter? We should not proceed to make a decision of this kind, subjecting ourselves to the opprobrium involved in going ahead to validate a statute which could be declared to be illegal.  It is a most important point which I think should be cleared up by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to accept this question of the retirement at the age of 70.  I feel that this could be clarified in Chapter 3&mdash;this question of the President being able to retire on pension at any time.  &ldquo;At any time&rdquo; is at any time; it is not at 70, 69 or 68.  It is at any time after he &ldquo;shall have reached the age of 65.&rdquo;  To my simple mind, that appears to be perfectly clear and I feel that if there is a governing clause in another statute that he must retire at 70, we should have that matter clarified to everyone's satisfaction and relief.</P>
    <P>I think also that Deputy O'Malley raised an important point concerning the 65 years&mdash;a person who might be appointed and find himself having to wait on until 74 before he could retire. In Chapter 2, there is one point which I did not refer to and to which I should like, in passing, to refer, that is, as I think all probably disagree with, the abolition of vacant statutory offices. The fact that it is proposed to abolish the Professorship of the Theory and Practice of Education would appear to me to be a backward step in a university.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any doubt in spite of what the Minister has said that <Col N="2558" /> we should not pass this statute, that it should be sent back to the Governing Body to be clarified on the points that we have raised here and that the matter should then be reconsidered.  If the provisions are acceptable to the Senate of the university then it is quite another matter but as it is at the moment we are in danger of giving sanction to the improper decisions of the Governing Body.  We are leaving the Senate open to the suggestion that these provisions have been considered by the Dáil and accepted by the Dáil and that consequently certain pressure would be brought on the Senate to accept these provisions as they have the sanction of the law of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I think that the Senate should not be subjected to any pressure whatsoever and that the points that I have asked to be clarified and which I regret to say I do not think the Minister has clarified, should be cleared up.  We have been faced here it seems to me with a <i>fait accompli</i>, that there is the possible legal disability contained in the clause of the 1908 Act and there is that serious doubt concerning the decision to change the age limit, and the very serious repercussions to which the Minister did not refer at all contained in the new provisions contained in the relatively short periodic reappraisal of the good conduct, as it is mentioned here in the statute of the lecturers, assistant lecturers and professors. It surprises me that the Minister does not express at this stage disapproval of that trend of the university to attempt to establish a sort of mind control by subtle, or not so subtle, pressure on the minds of the academic staff of the university, a most undesirable trend and one which we here should disapprove of.</P>
    <P>The Minister must recall that what we have said on this Bill and his very few very short remarks on the Bill will carry some weight in the Senate and if they find that this House approves of the proposals in this statute it must weigh heavily, with some of them at any rate.  We may be allowing ourselves to be used as an instrument to vitiate the powers of the Senate, to by-pass the powers of the Senate and <Col N="2559" /> to enforce decisions taken by the Governing Body contrary to the charter of the university.  That as I suggested in an earlier speech would be an undesirable trend leading to the weakening of the federal system of the university.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask a question.  This statute says: &ldquo;when laid on the Table of the House.&rdquo;  If it is before the House for 40 days excluding any period of prorogation of Parliament and it is not objectionable, it automatically becomes law.  Would the Minister explain how the word &ldquo;prorogation&rdquo; comes into effect when it is not specifically mentioned in any sense in the Constitution?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that the Deputy might at least allow me to start before beginning his interruptions?</P>
      <P>I know Deputies would wish me to give them information about my intentions regarding the general election and I propose to do that as precisely as is possible at present.  On the basis of a five-year term the dissolution of this Dáil is due in March, 1962 and if Section 7 of the Electoral Act of 1927 is still valid, which may be doubtful, the dissolution would take place automatically during that month.  I consider, however, that given the power of free choice it would be undesirable to postpone the dissolution of the Dáil until the last possible date when an election would have to take place irrespective of the circumstances prevailing at the time, unless, of course, legislation was introduced to prolong the life of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be appreciated that between the date of dissolution of the Dáil and the assembly of a new Dáil after a general election, there is no functioning national Parliament and while Ministers retain their offices and their duties there is also a <i>de facto</i> hiatus in the exercise of Government authority.  It is clearly desirable, therefore, if it is at all possible, that a general election should take place only when all the prevailing circumstances, <Col N="2562" /> international as well as internal, minimise the risk of serious national disadvantage arising from the fact that the Dáil stands dissolved.</P>
    <P>It is my intention, therefore, unless something very exceptional happens, not to permit the Dáil to continue until March next but to ask for a dissolution during the coming autumn, probably between mid-September and mid-November, with the likelihood that it will be earlier rather than later in that period.  For the reasons which I have indicated I cannot now be more precise and, indeed, I think I should emphasise that if some international situation, arising out of Berlin or any of the other troubled spots of the world, or other circumstance, should make a dissolution of the Dáil a likely source of risk to the nation I would have to change my intentions accordingly, nor would I hesitate to do so.</P>
    <P>The motion which I have moved fixes November 8th as the date for resumption but Deputies will appreciate that the dissolution of the Dáil would annul this motion and the order for the general election would fix the date of assembly of the new Dáil.</P>
    <P>I should point out, of course, that if amendments are inserted by the Seanad in any of the Bills which we have just passed, I may request the Ceann Comhairle to arrange a special meeting of the Dáil to dispose of them.</P>
    <P>It is my hope and, indeed, my expectation, that during the election campaign, if, in fact, it should take place before we reassemble, all of us who will be seeking re-election will combine to give the world a fine example of Irish democracy in action.  The public get their information about the current issues of policy from the activities of political Parties and candidates at an election.  All of us will, I hope, accept our obligation to inform the electorate of the issues of policy which the new Dáil must face and of our particular views and intentions regarding them so that the electors thus enlightened by us can give a clear indication of the national will regarding them.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember it was agreed that the debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach <Col N="2563" /> would be postponed until now and taken in conjunction with the motion for the Adjournment.  It has been the practice for many years for the Taoiseach, when moving his Estimate &mdash;usually the last business of the Summer Session&mdash;to give a review of the state of the national economy based upon the latest available statistics.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances of this year and the understanding that we all have that the nation stands on the threshold of events in which important changes are inevitable, any review of that kind would be, to some extent, academic and of value only in so far as it gave us guidance for the future.  The past is now overshadowed by major issues of national, economic and social policies, and with important implications in the field of political policy also, arising from the prospects of Ireland's membership of the European Economic Community, and perhaps in the background of our minds at least the still more difficult policy issues which would arise if our membership of the European Economic Community did not eventuate.</P>
    <P>I think few here can have any doubt that the country is entering into a situation in which major tasks of adjustment to new conditions in respect both of agriculture and industry will have to be faced.  Even on the presumption of peace&mdash;that is the only presumption upon which rational men can plan for the future&mdash;the new Dáil and Government are not going to have an easy time.  On our success in organising this community through sound planning, effective leadership and a capacity to inspire adequate national effort will depend the country's prospects of furthering its economic and social progress in the new situation which is now taking shape.</P>
    <P>Emphasis is now on change and innovation in every sphere of national activity.  Plans and policies which were developed in the past, and which were often defended vigorously and enthusiastically in the past, are now ceasing to be appropriate.  The world to which these plans and policies were relevant no longer exists.  This is a time for new ideas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2564" /> Personally I must confess I find the prospect exciting and stimulating and indeed it is understandable that all of us who have been really interested in national development will want to have a part in it.  The work of government must now be directed to preparing for the momentous years ahead, seeking in so far as is humanly possible to forecast the course of events and to plan the road the nation must follow.</P>
    <P>The nation just cannot afford any woolly thinking, any failure of leadership, any slipshod estimating of possibilities and problems, either in the Dáil, in the Government or in any of the organisations within the State to which important sections of our people look for their guidance.  We must all look with cold objectivity on the national assets and the national deficiencies so that we can plan properly together to exploit the one and remedy the other.</P>
    <P>We know that the country, in its present stage of development, is not as well organised as many other countries to cope with the new situation. That means that we will have to move faster than the others and work hard to catch up with them.  That is something we can do.  We know that the country's limited size, its geographical location and island character impose some economic handicaps on it.  Probably they give us some economic advantages also.  The handicaps can only be overcome, as I think everybody now agrees, by making maximum efficiency the objective in every sector, in production, in transport and in management.  All that is within our capacity.</P>
    <P>We know also that we have made some real progress during the past two and a half years under the Programme of Economic Expansion.  That is something that should give us confidence and encouragement.  We know, however, that we did not move nearly fast enough or far enough on our journey to economic security and that there is a great deal more that needs to be done before we can feel any sense of real security.  The country is like an aeroplane at the take-off stage. It has become airborne, but I would emphasise that that is the stage of <Col N="2565" /> maximum risk when any failure of power can lead to a crash.  It will be a long time yet before we can throttle back in level flight.  We know we have not yet achieved the certainty of continuation of economic effort&mdash; and certainty in that respect is what we require.</P>
    <P>We know also we have in this country the particular handicap of a falling population through the persistence of emigration at a high level.  We must accept that as evidence of the inadequacy of the national economic effort so far.  Until the emigration rate has been pulled well below the natural population growth rate, until the population begins to rise, we cannot claim to be succeeding in achieving our economic and social aims.</P>
    <P>That must be the main objective, as, indeed, it will be the main test of the soundness and sufficiency of the policies applied in the years ahead.  While we can welcome the not inconsiderable reduction in the net emigration rate in the past 12 months, it is still running at a very high level.  The impact on our population numbers of the very heavy emigration rates recorded in the peak years of 1956, 1957 and 1958, and the still very high, even though lower, emigration rates in 1959-1960 will be made known when the preliminary and provisional census figures are published some time towards the end of this month.</P>
    <P>We do not have to wait for these census figures, however, to know the position.  It is certain that because of the known level of emigration a fall in population of relatively significant dimensions has taken place since the previous census was held in April of 1956.  The extent of that fall will be disclosed by the census, but if the population estimates, which were prepared in the intervening years are a reliable guide, as they probably are, it will not be less than 3%.  I have no desire&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;to minimise the seriousness of that situation. It will be a powerful additional stimulus to our economic progress when we can arrest that decline and get the population moving upward again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2566" /> Because of the results which have been achieved under the Programme of Economic Expansion we can now face that aim with some increase in confidence, some additional belief in our capacity to realise it.  The reduction of the nett emigration trend this year is substantial enough to be significant in relation to the prospect that our population is becoming stabilised. During the period of twelve months, which ended on May 31, emigration was 65% of the rate during the corresponding period which ended in May, 1960, and the greater part of that fall took place in the first 5 months of this year.  During that 12 months period the rate of emigration was 27% below the average annual figures for the past decade.  We know that since the middle of 1959 the numbers occupied in all economic activities, including agriculture, have become stabilised following upon a long period of continuous decline.</P>
    <P>It is not my purpose to encourage any complacency.  Success in the economic and social effort designed to check emigration is vital and I use that word deliberately because there can be no real life in our economic programme unless we bring it about.  I put this factor in the forefront of this commentary on the national situation, because that is where it should be.  It is not enough that we should try to organise increased production and employment in agriculture and industry, try to provide better living conditions and better social welfare services, better housing and health services and so on.  We believe that the need for national effort extends far beyond official measures to encourage economic expansion&mdash;an effort which will be aimed at increasing the attractivness of life in Ireland so that the pull of conditions abroad will be more effectively countered.</P>
    <P>The fact that the proposals, which were contained in the economic programme and which, whatever views might be held about their adequacy, were vigorously and consistently carried out by the Government, gave in many directions results greater than we attempted to forecast is an assurance that advanced planning of that kind <Col N="2567" /> involving the estimating of national development possibilities and forecasting measures to exploit them in a comprehensive way, is the proper course.  Whatever arguments may be taking place in other neighbouring countries about the feasibility or desirability of advanced planning of the kind which we attempted it is essential in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>The five years to which the programme of economic expansion relates will end in 1963.  We have decided that it is not too soon to start preparing now the national economic development programme for the next ensuing five-year period.  Some weeks ago the Government decided to put that work in hand.  A start has been made in collecting the data, making the necessary estimates and analyses, and all that material will be available for the Government at the end of this year or early next year.  If it should be my responsibility I shall aim to produce that second stage of our economic development programme by the beginning of 1963.</P>
    <P>It may relevantly be asked what impact the prospects of Irish membership of the European Community may have on that decision.  When we were preparing the first programme for economic expansion published at the end of 1958 we had to take into account the plan for a European Free Trade Area which was then being actively negotiated even though we were not aware of the final form that it might take.  It is, of course, certain that the course of events in the European Economic Community will have a very direct bearing upon the character of future development plans applicable to this country as will also the work which is now being done in planning the adaptation of Irish industry and agriculture to the circumstances of our prospective European Economic Community membership.  The outcome of all that work will have to be taken into account.  That work cannot, of course, be delayed but its results, the particular policies devised as a result of that work for particular industries, must be incorporated in the second stage of the general development programme.</P>

      <Col N="2568" /> Our concern, as I have emphasised, must be with the future, the future in which both our opportunities and our problems will be very big.  If I have to contrast the circumstances of 1961 with those of the period when we came into office, the year 1956, I would contend that by every test the country is better off, that production, exports and employment are rising whereas in 1956 they were falling.  I am not making a great deal of that claim.</P>

      <P>If the country was not a good deal better off now than it was in 1956 we would be in a very bad way indeed.  The main thing is that progress has started.  The important objective must be to ensure it will continue.  It is not merely that the country as a whole is better off in terms of real national income.  The important thing is that the increases in the national income which were brought about in the past two years were the highest yet achieved.</P>
      <P>I think the effect is already to be seen in the countryside.  Even the modest increase in national income already achieved has had the result that the country, over the main part, looks to be better off.  That gives us a foretaste of the future&mdash;a foretaste of what conditions may be like when we achieve our purpose of doubling the national income, which we have now shown to be eminently feasible within quite a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>We have now no exceptional problem in regard to our international payments. The widening of the visible trade gap which emerged during the first five months of the year was largely rectified during the month of June.  No serious deficit in international payments is anticipated in this year.  As the Minister for Finance stated earlier today, there is no situation here which would require consideration by us of measures similar to those recently taken by the British Government. Indeed, we can hope that we may be able to continue to move in the opposite direction, as we have been doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both emigration and unemployment are a great deal lower than they were <Col N="2569" /> five years ago.  While we have to do, and must try to do, a great deal better than we have done, we have the satisfaction of knowing that we are moving in the right direction.  Industrial production and employment are reaching new records in every quarter.  We can now feel confident that they will continue to expand.  The strong feeling of confidence which permeates our industrial circles is illustrated by their confident and constructive reaction to the prospects of our membership of the European Common Market.</P>
    <P>In all directions in which national progress is desired&mdash;in education, housing, health, afforestation, telephones, transport, social welfare arrangements, water supplies and sanitation&mdash;progress has been continuously accelerated. The comprehensive plans for future development now being applied could not have been contemplated four or five years ago because we could not then have afforded to implement them.  The possibility of embarking on these plans now is the fruit of the progress already achieved.  I emphasise again that nothing is settled permanently and nothing is secure.  Nothing ever is.  The price of progress is continuous effort.  That will be true no matter what the international situation in which we have to seek it.</P>
    <P>If we have now to face the problem of adjusting our economy and adapting our economic expansion effort to a new international trade situation, we can, I think, find some consolation in the fact that the nation is better able to face it now than ever it was previously. I think that is true, not only by reference to the increased strength of the national economic organisation but also by reference to the more confident mood of the people and to their growing belief in their own capabilities. Our farming, industrial and trade union leaders have measured themselves with their opposite numbers in neighbouring countries and have not been discouraged by the experience.</P>
    <P>The work of planning the reorganisation and perhaps, the re-equipment and re-adaptation of Irish industry so as to ensure its continued growth in the new circumstances is in hands, as I have <Col N="2570" /> said.  Although, even on the worst assumptions as to the terms of our membership of the European Community, there are several years available before the full impact of European free trade will be experienced in our industrial sector, the work is being pursued vigorously, even enthusiastically. But both vigour and enthusiasm are required because there is no question about the magnitude, the difficulty and the importance of that work.</P>
    <P>In agriculture, for which the prospect is a managed market rather than freedom of trade, problems of a somewhat different character will present themselves.  But there also changes are to be anticipated with which we will be very greatly concerned as a community and in which our National Farmers' Association and other farming organisations will have an important role to fill.  Given general understanding of the inevitability of the changes with which we are faced and of the necessity for adapting ourselves to deal with them&mdash;there is, as Deputies realise, no hole into which we can run to shelter ourselves from them &mdash;I personally have little doubt about the capacity of the country to organise itself in time to reap the long-term benefits of participating in an expanding and prosperous integrated European community and to cope with the transitional difficulties with which we will certainly have to contend.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon indicated yesterday that he was interested in the political implications of the Rome Treaty, although I must say I thought he was rather coy about expressing his own views in that connection.  The obligations which we would accept by our accession to the Rome Treaty are those which are set out in the Treaty.  Nobody &mdash;I repeat, nobody&mdash;has been given authority, so far as I know, to define these obligations other than as they are set out in the Treaty.  Certainly, I do not claim any special competence or knowledge in regard to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall leave the Deputy clear as to my views regarding <Col N="2571" /> them before I am finished.  We have noted the trend of the opinions expressed in the many speeches which have been delivered by European leaders in recent months.  But the personal character of these speeches and the views expressed in them should not be misunderstood.  We know, of course, that the founders of the Treaty, with every evidence of growing enthusiasm, regard the economic integration of Western Europe, for which the Treaty provides, as just a milestone on a road which leads to wider objectives.</P>
      <P>Indeed, we are under notice since the communiqué issued as a result of the recent meeting of the Heads of Government of the countries of the Community that they visualise that the next milestone on the road will be the negotiation of a convention for political unity.  When the drafting of that convention may be concluded, what may be its form, or what obligations it may impose upon those who subscribe to it, we do not yet know.</P>
      <P>As a country which has applied for membership of the European Economic Community we will have the opportunity of participating in the discussions preliminary to the drafting of the new convention.  We can, as we understand it, do so without commitment. I do not think that we, as a nation, should be deterred from entering the road to economic unity through the Rome Treaty by reason of our knowledge that the road does not necessarily end at that point.  If, and when, a convention aiming at political union of the countries of Western Europe, a convention which is acceptable to all the other countries of Western Europe, is presented to us for our consideration and our decision we will then have a very similar question to ask ourselves as that which the Rome Treaty, the Treaty that provides for economic integration, presents to us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have decided that, if all the other countries of western Europe with which we trade are going to join together in an economic union, it would be suicidal for us to remain isolated outside it.  That decision, I think, was <Col N="2572" /> taken with the agreement of the vast majority of our people, certainly with the agreement of all the articulate elements amongst them.  If all these countries join at some future time in an agreement for a political confederation, or some other form of political union, will it be possible for us to decide to stand apart from it?  We do not have to answer that question now but some day, be it sooner or later, we will be faced with it.</P>
    <P>The immediate political implications of our accession to the Rome Treaty are those which are inextricably involved in the very concept of an economic union, and without which an economic union would not, in fact, be workable.  They mean that to the limits required by the Treaty, and the decisions taken in accord with it by its institutions, members give up the right to independent action in regard to their external trade.  It means that they accept the jurisdiction of the European institutions set up by the Treaty and accept also the principle of acting in concert with the other countries in the community in determining their economic relations with the rest of the world. That conformity of economic policy will be expressed in a common external tariff and a common commercial policy.  It does not mean that we give up our right to fight vigorously for our interests.  It does not mean that we cannot pursue the economic aims we have set ourselves in the internal management of our State.  It is true that we will have lost the weapon of protection as an instrument of industrial development.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, I am sure, have noted the concern expressed in Britain by some people there who may not yet fully appreciate the changes which are taking place in the world about this aspect of the Treaty, this inevitable sharing of sovereignty which accession to the Treaty involves.  Whatever difficulties that idea of sharing sovereignty with other nations in the economic sphere may cause for the great Powers, for the countries which were in the past the centres of great empires, countries which were accustomed to having their own way in the world, to having to accept no law but their own interest, no similar difficulties arise for the <Col N="2573" /> smaller countries like ourselves.  Indeed, if this participation in an economic union will promote our economic and social progress we have everything to gain and little to lose by it.</P>
    <P>We could rightfully regard it as an extension of our freedom rather than the reverse.  In the past we have had the experience, often the bitter experience, of the difficulties which our lack of economic bargaining power caused for us in seeking satisfactory trade agreements with our European neighbours.  The prospect that henceforth our trading relations with them will be regulated in accord with non-discriminatory rules drawn up under an international agreement is not a development which, in my view, need cause us concern because of its political implications.  Every international agreement of any kind in which we participate, whether it be multilateral or bilateral, involves us in giving up some freedom of action in respect of the matters to which the agreement relates.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, in essence merely a question of degree.  Our only anxiety &mdash;it is an anxiety we are entitled to feel and to express&mdash;arising out of this decision of ours to seek membership of the European Economic Community is the extent to which it will, in fact, help us to stimulate economic growth and social progress in this country.  It is the economic and not the political aspects of the Rome Treaty which should be our primary concern.</P>
    <P>If we can feel confident, when the conditions of our accession are known to us, that it will have that result, the result of assisting and stimulating our economic development, then the Government will not be prevented from proposing acceptance of the Rome Treaty by reason of the political implications arising from it.  On the contrary, these wider implications are our assurance that there will be a common desire and a common will within the European Community to promote the economic development and progress of all the participating countries so that the political aims which the founders of the Treaty have set themselves will be supported and justified by widely shared economic benefits and so that the new unity <Col N="2574" /> of Europe at which they are aiming will be strengthened by that fact.  No sound concept of European unity can be based on a plan which would merely make the rich nations richer. The statesmen who lead Europe will realise the truth of that contention and I am convinced that we may be assured of that support and goodwill by reason of their wider aims and purposes, in meeting the special problems of the peripheral countries like ours.</P>
    <P>I have stressed that, in my view, the main task which will face the Dáil and the Government during the next five years or so will be that of adapting the Irish economy to this new situation arising from the emergence of the European Economic Community. There are other important directions in which, as a part of our over-all national effort, it seems to me, a fairly fundamental reassessment of aims and policies is also needed and in regard to which there are important decisions required which the next Dáil must be prepared to face.  I shall not refer to all the matters which I have in mind but merely to those which have been recently getting particular attention from the Government.</P>
    <P>The first matter is that of increasing the productivity and the earning power of the family farm.  The family farm is described in the documentation of the European Economic Community as a holding which requires the wholetime services of, say, two people and which can give them a reasonable livelihood.  This problem of the family farm is worldwide.  It is not something that is peculiar to this country.  It is one to which a great deal of thought has been given throughout the world and indeed occupied a very large part of the recent Papal Encyclical <i>Mater et Magistra.</i></P>
    <P>As the House knows, we have set up a committee to examine in a preliminary way ideas regarding that problem which have been ventilated by various bodies.  We cannot expect that committee, and we must not expect it, to give us a once-for-all solution of the problem.  Probably there is no such thing as a once-for-all solution because any policy for family farms must be <Col N="2575" /> capable of continuous adaptation to continuously changing circumstances, particularly in the context of our membership of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The second matter to which I should like to make brief reference is that of recasting our system of local authority financing.  Again the House is aware that an inquiry is in progress.  That inquiry is directed to securing certain basic information which is necessary for policy making but the decisions which have to be taken upon the basis of that information will be essentially political in their character; I mean political in the widest and best sense of that term.</P>
    <P>Most of us will agree that we should aim at having uniform standards for the public services in all parts of the country and that we should try to get that on some basis which would give us also an equality of the burden of paying for the services.  We have not at present got either uniformity of standards or equality of burdens and that is a main part of the problem.  We need also, because of recent experience, to make sure that the rising costs of these public services will not act as an impediment to economic development in any part of the country.  We know, of course&mdash;and I am sure that this is now generally realised&mdash;that we cannot have these services at any standard much less the standard that we desire, without paying for them.  How best to pay for them so as to impose the least impediment upon the country's development is the main question.</P>
    <P>We must push ahead as rapidly as our national resources permit with the revision and the extension of our facilities for higher education and for higher technological and technical training.  Apart from the wider aspects of that problem there are already signs that national progress in some directions is being delayed by a scarcity of certain skills.  It is, therefore, also desirable, indeed urgently necessary, that we should achieve an extension and an improvement of our apprenticeship system.  That is something to which the very competent and, I might say, dedicated members of the newly constituted Ceard Comhairle are <Col N="2576" /> giving attention.  I should hope also that in the lifetime of the next Dáil it will be possible to complete the task of law reform which we have now begun and that before the end of the life of that Dáil the whole of the statute law of this country will be based upon enactments of the Oireachtas with no carry-over from British statutes of any kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be possible for us to publish a White Paper in that regard in the course of the next few weeks.  I should like also to re-assert my personal belief that the only important objective of economic policy and economic endeavour is social progress.  Economic policy must always be directed towards serving social needs.  We have applied the policy of extending our social welfare services as our national resources were expanded through the operation of economic policy.</P>
      <P>There is no problem so far as we are concerned in accepting the injunction in the recent Papal Encyclical to which I have already referred, that social progress must proceed at the same pace as economic development.</P>
      <P>It would perhaps be wrong and inappropriate for me to omit dealing in this summary of the national situation with the outstanding problem of partition, the problem of reuniting the Irish people.  I do not propose to review in any way the trend of events in that respect although it is, I believe, desirable to restate and by restating to promote understanding of the basic problem as we see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The excuse for partition was the existence of deep-rooted divisions within the nation.  The origin of these divisions may have been artificial and they may have been fostered and aggravated over long periods of our history, but to deny their existence is to ignore realities.  The aim of any constructive national policy must be to end these divisions and to restore among our people the desire for unity. When the suspicions and prejudices which have been bred of these divisions <Col N="2577" /> have been eliminated the advantages of unity will become clearer.</P>
    <P>It is not likely to be speedily or easily done and it would be wrong for us to hold out the prospect of a speedy or easy solution of that situation.  I hope that I as Taoiseach have done nothing or said nothing which could have the effect of deepening or prolonging these divisions. Indeed I trust that I have contributed something to the better understanding everywhere of our national attitude towards that situation.  In the context of membership of the European Economic Community, any economic argument for partition will disappear; north and south will have exactly the same problems and exactly the same opportunities within the wide European market.  A united approach to these problems and opportunities would be far more effective and it is in my view the only course that makes sense.</P>
    <P>I am convinced personally that these and other realities will soon be more widely appreciated and that the force of circumstances and common sense will compel a re-examination of personal attitudes to all the circumstances which have been keeping the nation divided and that is the only type of coercion&mdash;the coercion of common sense&mdash;which is relevant to the situation.  Meanwhile, the path we have been following seems still to be the most likely to lead to the result we all desire.</P>
    <P>In that connection I think that I should inform the Dáil that following on the announcement of the Government's willingness to consider a free trade agreement for six county products, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has had approaches from representatives of groups of six county firms engaged in the manufacturing of a number of products, approaches with a view to discussing the possibility of operating an arrangement of that character in respect of their particular products, the products in which these groups are interested.  These approaches have been discussed with the appropriate manufacturers' associations operating in this part of the country.  These organisations of manufacturers <Col N="2578" /> indicated their interest subject to it being found possible to work out arrangements to ensure that certain conditions of competition related to materials used in manufacturing would be equalised and that the right of duty free access would be confined to <i>bone fide</i> six county products produced by established firms.</P>
    <P>The Government would be favourably disposed to these possibilities if on further examination they proved to be practicable.  We would regard it as a very useful exercise in anticipation of membership of the European Economic Community.  Arrangements have been made for a meeting between the manufacturers concerned from both sides of the border to discuss the matter and these will be held in or before September.</P>
    <P>I have said already that I am not making the routine type of review of the economic out-turn of the past year such as might normally be undertaken on the occasion of the Taoiseach's estimate.  Neither am I attempting to outline a comprehensive programme for the next year.  Constitutional procedures may limit the Dáil to five year terms but events do not compose themselves into compact five year lots, and neither does the work of the Government. The world is not standing still and Ireland has not been standing still either.  The future is always to some extent&mdash;to a large extent&mdash;unpredictable and events rarely turn out as anticipated, even the results of elections. When trying to look ahead, on the presumption of the continuation of world peace as I have said, we can note the vast strides in technology which are opening up great new possibilities for mankind, giving new powers of controlling the forces of nature for human betterment.  We can note also the prospect of important political changes such as those making for Western European integration which are in a sense born of these technological developments, as well as the desire to escape from the old rivalries in Europe which twice in our lifetime have plunged the world into war.  Our national policy must conform to this changing situation.  We could not isolate ourselves from world <Col N="2579" /> events even if we would wish to do so.</P>
    <P>We see Ireland acquiring and using the new techniques, striving to keep abreast of the world in all respects, participating wholeheartedly in the historic developments which are now taking place, setting ourselves new targets of achievement as we expand our resources and our knowledge of how to use them, a dynamic modern state dedicated to progress but preserving also the unchangeable values which must guide all worthwhile activities, hoping indeed, to demonstrate in a practical way in this country the applicability of these values to any modern society and their complete consistency with the urge for economic and social progress.  During my period of office as Taoiseach I have tried to keep the public informed of events and Government thinking about them, tried to publicise as widely as possible the plans and the policies that we were applying, and the circumstances that gave birth to those plans and policies, and sought to accomplish our national aim by a general public participation based upon understanding and acceptance of these plans and policies in all the business of the nation.  I can testify as to the effectiveness of that course.  I believe that the public know what we are trying to do, and how and why.  That is the first requirement of a genuine national policy in the fullest sense of that term.  I recommend the same policy to my successor, whoever he may be and whenever he may emerge.</P>

      <P>I gladly seize on an occasion of agreement between myself and the Taoiseach on which to introduce the remarks that it may be my duty to make this evening, as some of them may be stringent and many of them may cause him distress.  But, his reference to partition I thought a prudent one and I think there would be little difference in this House on the sentiments he expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain it is that we cannot serve <Col N="2580" /> Ireland by shedding one another's blood in the name of national unity. It was never true and it is not true now that bloodshed could seal the unity of Ireland.  Certain it is that it is well that we should all recognise in one another members of the same family.  Certain it is that we should not recoil from deep differences within that family. Certain I like to think it is and certain indeed I believe it to be that partition will go in due time.  Certain it is that we shall never forget it so long as it is there.  Certain it is that the majority of the Irish people will never accept it so long as it is there.  Certain it is that it can be best resolved by a mutual desire on both sides of the Border to end it and that it is on that basis and only on that basis that an enduring and satisfactory end of this detestable problem can be found.</P>
    <P>I know of no man in the public life of any country who is the equal, not to say the superior, of the Taoiseach in this House at turning corners, breasting waves and conquering peaks.  He is always just going to find Utopia around the corner, given time.  Today, he hopes that the electors, enlightened by us, may give an indication of the national will.  He urges us to remember that the past is now overshadowed by the capacious umbrella of the Common Market.  Leadership, innovation and plans flow from him in abundant flood.  Plans, he says, which he vigorously advocated in the past, are now outdated.  Here is one of them yellowing in my folder.  I shall refer to it later.  This is a time, he says, for new ideas.  He is excited and stimulated. The nation cannot afford woolly thinking or incorrect estimations of the probable future.  This, from the man who was telling us two years ago that no enquiry into the Common Market was necessary for he had attended a meeting of the European Free Trade Association and that for Ireland the battle was won.</P>
    <P>Where is the battle now?  We are all floating about wondering what is going to happen to us in the Common Market and the battle we won in the European Free Trade Association is part of the past now overshadowed and to be forgotten. Blah, blah, blah.</P>
    <P>Brave words should be matched with <Col N="2581" /> brave deeds.  We get enough brave words from the Taoiseach.  He dearly likes to denigrate the achievements of the past and to dazzle us with the hopes of things to come.  Has he forgotten that in the ten years prior to 1957 this country achieved the prodigy of doubling the volume of its exports and trebling their value?  Has he forgotten that in 1955 the greatest number of people ever employed in this country were at work?  Has he forgotten that, for the first time in a century, in the census of 1951 the population of this country turned upward? Are these things he would have us forget or does he ask us to forget them because they were brave deeds unheralded by brave words?  They were the deeds of administrations that had a fault that they did too much and talked too little but, from the nation's point of view, it was a good fault and it is a fault that I am proud to plead guilty to on behalf of all my colleagues in the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to be patient when the present Taoiseach tells me that he has suddenly discovered the family farm. <i>Mater et Magistra</i> has brought it to his mind.  What is his reaction to this revelation that has flashed across his mind?  He set up a committee.  Can you imagine in this country where half our people live and depend for their existence on the family farm being told by the Prime Minister of Ireland that he has suddenly awoken to the urgency of their problem and his reaction is to set up a committee?  He has discovered that the rates are getting too heavy. Somebody has stirred his slumbers and whispered in his ear this revelation and he has sprung into action; he set up a committee.</P>
    <P>Somebody has told him&mdash;I almost begin to wonder can he have been present in disguise at the Fine Gael Árd Fheis&mdash;that educational facilities in this country are falling behind.  He thanks God he has already had the foresight to set up a Commission to solve this problem which he never discovered before.  He pledges himself in eloquent terms that if re-elected Taoiseach he will commit himself to a programme of law reform on which he boasts Fianna Fáil are now launched.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell upon the <Col N="2582" /> instrument of law reform with which we have been engaged in this House during the past three days.  I can reduce it to two draft Bills left to him and a page of another man's book. Does he think we are all fools to be defrauded?  The electorate he trusts, in his pious introductory observations, enlightened by Fianna Fáil, will give an indication of the national will.  I remember the last time the Taoiseach went on his mission of enlightenment.</P>
    <P>It took the form of planning.  We heard many plans adumbrated today. That is not the first plan we heard from the Taoiseach.  I do not blame him for telling us that in the new situation the past is to be forgotten and our eyes riveted upon the future so that we may brood upon the plans, the aspirations, the hopes of Fianna Fáil. He was planning, aspiring and hoping on October 12th, 1955, and his plan then envisaged the provision of 100,000 new jobs, all beautifully set out in a supplement to the <i>Irish Press</i> which might be extracted from the current number, framed and hung upon the wall with a pleasing picture of the Taoiseach in the midst of his adherents, one of whom I shortly afterwards promoted in the public service though he is seated in the front row of that picture&mdash;evidence of the fact that in the inter-Party Government political affiliations did not affect promotions.</P>
    <P>That plan extended to four sides of the supplement, omitting the photographs but including those classic words: &ldquo;By the fifth year, on this calculation, full employment should be achieved with the level of gross expenditure raised by £100 million and 100,000 new jobs created.&rdquo;  I do not particularly reprehend the Fianna Fáil politicians for breaking these election promises, but I must register a formal protest against the further step of, having broken the promises, denying they ever made them.</P>
    <P>That is a technique which I confess somewhat confounds me, but it is my duty when I am told to forget the past and put my mind on the plans, dreams and aspirations of the Taoiseach, to call to mind, while dwelling on the hopes, dreams and aspirations, that <Col N="2583" /> inspired speech by the Minister for Defence, still wet behind the ears and new in his Ministerial responsibility, reported at column 1284 of Volume 168 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>We were put in here as a Government to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation of mass unemployment and mass emigration brought about by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Four years after those noble words were spoken 200,000 of our people, almost all between the ages of 18 and 25, have left this country to earn their daily bread and Fianna Fáil has the barefaced audacity today to point to the tale of unemployment and say that figure has declined since they came into office.</P>
    <P>I readily concede that, but when, in the world crisis with which we were grappling in 1956, the figures of the unemployed rose here in Ireland, we, at least, had the satisfaction that they were still all at home and that we could deploy our resources to get them back into employment.  We did not send them abroad&mdash;boys and girls&mdash;to get their living however they could on the streets of London, Birmingham and Manchester and I marvel that some Ministers of this Government do not lie awake at night asking themselves how they can boast at the number of unemployed in the knowledge of where they sent them.</P>
    <P>Now that they are gone, we do not think they have been taken off the conscience of the Government of Ireland&mdash;now employed by strangers in whatever posts strangers were prepared to give them rather than being a charge upon our solicitude until such times as our resources were capable of employing them at home here in Ireland.  We do not deny there were economic difficulties in 1956.  Neither do we deny that the economic difficulties were firmly grasped.  A situation of mass unemployment would have arisen which would have forced these boys and girls to go away, and rather than contemplate these possibilities we grasped the situation to such good effect that, despite all the problems confronting us, we turned an adverse <Col N="2584" /> balance of payments into a credit balance of payments in 1957&mdash;for the first time, I think, since the State was founded, with the exception of the years during the war when imports were low, of necessity.</P>

      <P>Two hundred thousand are gone and I do not blame the Taoiseach if he interrupts me.  I told him he might find some small crumb of agreement to record between us so that subsequently we might discuss the grisly facts of four years of Fianna Fáil Government.  It is not part of my duty to get up to please Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I note that Fianna Fáil have awoken to the existence of the family farm.  I have never forgotten it and we on these benches have never forgotten it. We have known that the agricultural industry in this country employs more than half of the people at work in this country and that on the farms of Ireland more than half of our population live.  We have always believed and still believe that the economic foundations of this country are the 12 million acres of arable land with which God endowed our people and that unless that land is made to prosper and the people who live on it, this country cannot survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last four years, since Fianna Fáil took office, the agricultural industry has been going steadily downwards and the evidence of that is to be found not only in statistics but also in the grim spectacle all over rural Ireland of the family farms, of the existence of which the Taoiseach has just spoken, being closed down and the families that lived upon them driven out of this country for the first <Col N="2585" /> time, certainly in my experience, and I believe for the first time since the Famine.  I say that deliberately.  I do not deny that in the '60's, the '80's, and in parts of this century, there was emigration from rural Ireland but never before, so far as I know, in our recorded history have we seen locks put upon the doors of the people by the people and the families banished from the land.</P>
    <P>There are people on this side of the House who recall personally or vicariously the closing of houses but by an alien hand.  There are few of us here on either side of the House who have not heard from our fathers of the battering ram.  The battering ram had at least this to commend it: when the family was swept away there was no memorial left behind.  They were blotted out and their home went with them because the landlords of that day had neither the heart nor the courage to leave standing as a perennial reminder of what they had done the homes of the people they had banished.  But there is not a barony in Western Ireland today where you will not find more than one vacant house with padlocks on the doors. Come to Monaghan, Cavan or Donegal, almost to any county in Ireland and is there a Deputy who does not know, in his personal experience, of at least one home closed up with the family gone from the land?  Did we ever think we would live to see that day and to be told on the morrow that the Taoiseach was greatly concerned for the small farmers of Ireland and had set up a committee?</P>
    <P>Why are they going?  If the Taoiseach does not know I shall tell him because they are my neighbours and the neighbours of every Deputy.  They are going because they cannot live here any longer.  They cannot buy their food and clothes to cover their children.  If you do not know how that came about look at your own statistics.  The proportion of the national income which the farmers now enjoy has fallen from 25% to 20%.  That is so remote a figure that I shall attach no importance to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject it.  Many statistics with which we are furnished have little relation to the lives of our people but here is a statistic which even so sophisticated a student of statistics as the Taoiseach is cannot back away from.  The cash income of the farmers was £192,000,000 in 1957.  It was £180,000,000 in 1958, £176,000,000 in 1959.  In 1960, with the collapse of cattle prices and the accumulation of large stocks on the land, our people had to sell them for what they could get for them.  Who amongst us does not know of the beast worth £40 sold for £20 and of the calf worth £20 sold for £5?  They had to be sold to pay bills and rates.  Even with that bargain sale off the land of Ireland, where in every individual transaction the man who sold was losing money, the income of the farmers was reckoned at £190,000,000. Over that same period this Government by their own positive action had increased the cost of living to the farmers by close on 15%.  Every £1 they got in 1960 was worth 17s. 6d. in terms of 1957.  They had to pay more for bread, butter, flour; they had to pay more for rates, for electricity, more for almost everything they had to buy. They had to pay more or try to pay it out of a smaller income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man in medium circumstances could lower his standard of living; the man in relatively affluent circumstances could lower his standard of living but the man living on the bare margin of comfort was faced with the alternative of accepting poverty in his own country or relative prosperity in England or abroad.  It is those small farmers, whose existence the Taoiseach has just now discovered, who are forced to make that choice, some of them for their children only, some of them for themselves and their children.  Children constitute the bulk of those who are gone but in that emigrant army there are countless Irish families as well and that is the reason they have been driven out&mdash;because their own Government made it economically impossible for them to stay at home. One hundred thousand new jobs! <Col N="2587" /> There are 51,000 fewer people working here today than on the day the Taoiseach's predecessor took office as a Fianna Fáil administration four years ago.  But we are to forget the past and to think only of the new crop of promises that have been unveiled today for our edification.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word on the Common Market.  I am obliged to say this: when I recall the fraud, deceit and falsehood which the present Taoiseach employed to secure the majority by virtue of which he is now head of the Government, and hear him today, I cannot dispel from my mind the picture of a welshing bookie stealing away from those who took his word, sheltering under his umbrella in the hope that he will not be seen, an umbrella gaily embroidered with the words &ldquo;The Common Market&rdquo;. Everything is to be forgotten because he is now under the abundant umbrella of the Common Market.  We are all to think, to dream and to worry about that and to forget about any domestic problems because, if we even mention them, he twirls the umbrella of the Common Market.  We are not to see the old performer until he has erected his stand and quoted his odds on a new race in a new racecourse.</P>
    <P>We do not forget there were thousands of people who staked their money with the Taoiseach when he spoke in Clery's informing them that the dividend was to be jobs for all. They staked their money on Mr. Singer and he shipped their money God-knows-where.  But the day they staked their hopes on Fianna Fáil, it was not their money was shipped but themselves.  I do not think the people will readily forget that.  I do not deny that it causes me concern lest that kind of conduct rubs off on to the rest of us.  I sometimes rejoice if I am told that my approach to promises is not sufficiently dramatic.  I confess to an incurable inclination to leaning backwards lest I should ever find myself in the same company as that the Taoiseach keeps.</P>
    <P>I hate to hear it said by our own people of us, who are this generation of politicians, that which was never <Col N="2588" /> said in our father's day&mdash;that Irish politicians are rogues.  There has been a dramatic change now.  Whatever they might have said of them 50 years ago&mdash;and there were deep political cleavages amongst our people then&mdash; they never called them rogues.</P>

    <P>It will be noted that in the first year of the proposed programme, it is contemplated that public investment outlay will be expanded by £13 million, raising national expenditure by £20 million and creating 20,000 new jobs.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the gross national expenditure is again increased by £20 million, bringing the total increase to £40 million with a corresponding effect on employment, and that this will result in £18 million increase in private capital outlay, plus £15 million of further public expenditure adding £22 million.</P>
      <P>In the third year a further rise of gross expenditure by £20 million is assumed (making the cumulative increase £60 million) to which the additional private capital outlay of the previous year is reckoned to contribute £18 million and new private capital outlay a further £20 million, increased public expenditure being kept at £17 million.</P>
      <P>By the fifth year, on this calculation, full employment should be achieved, with the level of gross expenditure raised by £100 million and 100,000 new jobs being created.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind a politician failing to perform what he hoped to do, but it is an entirely new departure in this or any other country, for a politician, having failed in his promise, to put his hand on his heart and say: &ldquo;I never made it.&rdquo; Now listen, there was at one time a Taoiseach here who had the exquisite gift of being able to make what appeared to be a most positive statement on the 1st January, 1955, and when you quoted it against him on 1st January, 1956, he would look at you more in sorrow than in anger and say: &ldquo;But where did you put the comma?&rdquo;  And, by jove, when you read it a second time and shifted the comma two words over, it meant exactly the opposite to what it meant the first time.  That is a gift the present Taoiseach has not got.  I do not attribute that Machiavellian skill to him. There was one great exponent of this Machiavellian technique here and the Taoiseach could never try to emulate <Col N="2590" /> him because he has not the subtlety. Here he protests his words did not mean what the simple sub-editor of the <i>Irish Press</i> understood them to mean&mdash; 100,000 new jobs after five years.  He was deceived six years ago.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the unsophisticated sub-editor of the <i>Irish Press</i>, a lot of simple people who read that were also misled.  The only man who understood the inner meaning of that proclamation was the man who spoke it, and see how circumspect he was that nobody would know the inner workings of his mind.</P>

It is the <i>Irish Press</i> Fianna Fáil Supplement of Wednesday, October 15th, 1955.  But, as the Taoiseach passionately rejects all suggestions of dissimulation in his political activities, let me call to mind another complaint I formally make at the end of his period of office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, as he then was, was campaigning in the general election of 1957.  There was, apparently, a caucus meeting held on 27th February, which was attended by the then Taoiseach, by the then Deputy Lemass and by the then Deputy Traynor, now Minister for Justice.  They all regarded it as desirable to go on record simultaneously, and as emphatically as discretion would allow, on the subject of food subsidies.  Deputy Lemass betook himself to Waterford and he said:</P>
      <P>Some Coalition leaders are threatening the country with all sorts of unpleasant things if Fianna Fáil becomes the Government&mdash;compulsory tillage, wage control, cuts in Civil Service salaries, higher food prices and a lot more besides.  A Fianna Fáil Government does not intend to do any of these things because we do not believe in them.  How definite can we make our denial of these stupid allegations?  They are all falsehoods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;God forgive me&mdash;of 1st March, 1957.  But wait a minute.  That is not all that was in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 1st March.  Constitutional considerations forbid me to mention the source for this observation, but, when I quote it, the incomparable style will instantly reveal the author:</P>
      <P>The Coalition Parties were urging the people not to vote for Fianna Fáil because there was hell around the Fianna Fáil corner.  You know the record of Fianna Fáil in the past. You know we have never done the things they said we would do.</P>
      <P>Listen to this&mdash;this is glorious:&mdash;</P>
      <P>You know we have never done the things they said we would do.  They told you that you may be paying more for your bread.  They do not say that it was the result of a legacy in the shape of £62,000,000 deficit in our international payments and a Budget deficit of £15,000,000 that the price of bread was increased before. On that occasion we would have had to find the necessary £16,000,000.  We did not cut them out because we did not want the price of bread, so important an article of diet for the poor, to be increased.  We left on several millions as a subsidy for bread.</P>
      <P>What do you think the people at Belmullet understood him to say on that occasion?  They understood him to say that Fine Gael said that he was going to do things that he never did and that he hated the idea of increasing the price of bread but, by heaven, when you read it in 1961 he never said: &ldquo;I will not increase the price of bread.&rdquo; But was there a living creature in Belmullet who did not understand him to say it?  Could we convict him of that intention if we did not find his colleague, the less subtle Deputy Lemass, at the corner of the street in Waterford saying: &ldquo;How definite can we make our denial of these stupid allegations?  They are all falsehoods.&rdquo; Nothing Machiavellian about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then poor Deputy Traynor was sent <Col N="2592" /> out to another venue, Doyle's Corner. That was where he landed, and he described as a blood-curdling story a warning given by Deputy Norton in his election broadcast that a Fianna Fáil Government would withdraw the food subsidies and Deputy Traynor said that Deputy Norton had switched to making sinister promises on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  That is almost worthy of the classic performer himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <P>Let me recall that after Deputy Lemass had asked: &ldquo;How definite can we make our denial of these stupid allegations?  They are all falsehoods&rdquo;, he increased the price of bread from 9d. to 1/3d.; he increased the price of butter from 3/9d. to 4/7d.; and he increased the price of flour from 4/3d. a stone to 8/3d. a stone; and he left the small farmers of Ireland with less to buy with than they had when he asserted his intention to keep the cost of living down.</P>

      <P>I make no speculation. This is the last occasion on which I believe I will occupy this seat.  When we return hereafter our dispositions will be such as the electorate may determine.  Let us leave it to them to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to dwell a moment on the Common Market because it is time some reality was brought into this discussion.  I am satisfied that, if Great Britain enters the Common Market, Ireland must enter too because we believe, as we have always believed, that the economies of these two countries are so closely integrated, the agricultural industry on which Ireland depends for its survival must have access to the British market.  The first thing we did when we formed an inter-Party Government in this country was to send Ministers to London&mdash;not civil servants to Brussels&mdash;to negotiate a trade agreement to protect our place for the agricultural and industrial produce of this country in the British market.  We believe exactly to-day what we believed 13 years ago.  We make no <Col N="2594" /> apology for it and it does not represent any conversion on our part.</P>
    <P>I confess that when I hear the Taoiseach talking now I sometimes wonder can it be he whose voice I hear.  It is time we had a bit of reality in this business.  There are three aspects of the Common Market Rome Treaty&mdash;agricultural, industrial and political.  I am sorry to say I did not detect in the Taoiseach's surveys of this all-important matter the frankness that I think people ought to expect from him.  He is fortified by the accumulated wisdom of a skilled Civil Service trained in the study of documents of this kind and in the current comment of the participants in the Rome Treaty and of those acting from the headquarters at Brussels.  I am fortified with no such sources of information, but there are in my judgment certain outstanding aspects of this whole prospect which deserve to be put in correct perspective.</P>
    <P>I remember very well the Dutch Minister for Agriculture coming to this country in 1949 and agitating that we should participate in the Green Pool.  The Green Pool was in fact the agricultural provisions of the Rome Treaty of today.  My advice to the then Government was that we had no interest whatever in the Green Pool because it represented a perfectly legitimate and comprehensible effort on the part of Holland, Belgium and Denmark to get into the British market on the same terms that we then enjoyed.  My advice to the Government, as the Minister for Agriculture then, was that we had no interest whatever in promoting such an enterprise, that we had attained our position in the British market as a result of hard bargaining; if others could get it, good luck to them, but it was none of our business to shepherd them into the advantageous position we had secured for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The plain fact about the Rome Treaty and the Common Market, stripped of the verbiage, speculation and hullabaloo, is that when this act is consummated by this country and Denmark, the net result will be that Denmark and Holland will be in the British market on the basis of equality <Col N="2595" /> with Ireland which they never were before.  The consideration we get for that is twofold: (1) continued access to the British market, and (2) access on a very much more liberal basis than we heretofore enjoyed to the markets available in the Six&mdash;Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>Has anybody stopped to ask himself what the capacity of that market is? Has anyone stopped to ask himself what consideration we shall get under the Rome Treaty for finding Denmark, Holland and Belgium in our market on a footing of equality with us?  We shall get access to the market of the Six which is today producing 100 per cent. of all the butter it consumes and which, I have seen it forecast in authoritative circles, could produce five times what they are capable of consuming. We shall get access to the market of the Six which is today producing 99 per cent. of all the pork and cheese it can consume.  We shall have access to the market which is producing 94 per cent. of all the sugar it can consume.  We shall have access to a market which is producing 92 per cent. of all the wheat it consumes and 91 per cent. of all the beef it consumes.</P>
    <P>In exchange for that, we must face the fact that in that market there are the closest trading ties existing between the Six and Denmark, built up by ten centuries of trading, built up by an elaborate network of canals, railways and roads which link these countries up, into which we must force our way, bearing in mind that when they want to send certain industrial or agricultural produce to any part of it, all they need is to stop a train and hitch a wagon to it while we must charter a ship.  Anyone who has had the experience I have had of chartering ships to send Irish agricultural produce to the Continent of Europe will know what that means.</P>

      <P>The figures are inescapable.  I did not interrupt the Taoiseach when he was speaking.  We must remember that in this new situation we are faced with a harsh degree of competition in markets where we were accustomed to trade on most advantageous terms.  I do not want to appear unduly pessimistic but it is wrong to conceal from the people the facts of the situation.  I am certain that with the advantages we have built up for ourselves by centuries of trading with Great Britain we can still hold our own and more than hold our own in the British market if we are prepared to do what needs to be done, to build up the efficiency of our agricultural production and the methods of marketing this produce.</P>
      <P>We provided in our day the Agricultural Institute to make available the know-how and the scientific knowledge requisite to get from the land of Ireland the return it is capable of producing.  Unless that is brought to the farmers of this country by effective advisory services, and brought with the utmost urgency as to the technical methods of production, farm lay-out and marketing systems we shall be left behind, with catastrophic results not only for the agricultural community but for the whole economy of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because I know that so certainly that I hope and pray that in the impending general election Fianna Fáil may be defeated and swept out of office so that we can have an administration which does not claim to have woken up to the idea of the family farm until last week and reacted to that discovery by setting <Col N="2597" /> up a committee.  I am not afraid of the future in regard to agriculture because, despite all Fianna Fáil could do to agriculture, its foundations are firmly laid and in the 10 years between 1947 and 1957 great progress was made.  Land was rehabilitated.  There was an increase in the output of lime and fertilisers.  There was an expansion of agricultural education and agricultural research.  We have the land; we have the men and we have the techniques if we but use them, and we have the certainty that in the future with the expanding population of the world in countries far away the dominant need is to produce protein foodstuffs.  If there is a country on God's earth better fitted than any other to produce protein footstuffs, milk, meat and fish, then it is Ireland. Our people can do that if given the chance.</P>
    <P>However, there is another aspect of our economy, that is, the industrial aspect, and that causes any rational man concern.  It is foolish to exaggerate the difficulties and perils that lie ahead because a country of our circumstances within the context of the Rome Treaty must have a protracted period in which to adjust its industrial practice to the obligations of the new arrangements.  The fact remains that there are in existence in this country today industries built up under the Fianna Fáil system of tariffs and quotas which are not viable in a free trading world.  And the worst of it is that it is in these particular industries that we find most of the men who have spent the best years of their working lives acquiring the special skills those industries require. The man who has invested his capital may suffer loss but the man who has invested his lifetime in a factory of that kind may find himself in middle age without his livelihood.  It is our concern that he will not be told that we cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs and that he happens to be the egg.</P>
    <P>Some people may say I have not referred to the political consequences of this Treaty.  The Taoiseach was dismayed at my reluctance to deal <Col N="2598" /> with that aspect of the problem in detail and specifically.  I waited for enlightenment from him, well fortified with all the resources of the Civil Service. I got very little light from him. One thing is certain.  Certain legislative matters, which normally we would tend to look upon as the exclusive prerogative of Oireachtas Éireann, will no longer belong exclusively to the Dáil and Seanad in future.  In signing this Treaty we authorise the authorities in Brussels to tell us in respect of certain matters what Oireachtas Éireann may and may not do.  We limit our discretion in a variety of matters relating to social services, employment, practices relating to certain measures which we have heretofore employed to stimulate employment.  That is part of the price we pay in accepting the Treaty and some people will fairly ask: &ldquo;If you have all these apprehensions, why do you still say that if England joins the Common Market, Ireland must join it too&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I believe agriculture constitutes the economic foundation of Ireland and if you read the Rome Treaty and look at List F, you are there faced with the fact that if England joins the Common Market and Ireland does not, one of the obligations England undertakes under that Treaty is to raise against Ireland a tariff of 16 per cent. on cattle, 16 per cent. on pigs, 20 per cent. on beef, 20 per cent. on pork and bacon, 18 per cent. on fowl, 10 per cent. on all varieties of fish, 16 per cent. on trout and salmon, 24 per cent. on butter, and 80 per cent. on beet sugar, if we have any to send abroad. That is a tariff barrier between this country and the British market that this country could not survive and vice versa.  I do not see how it is possible to contemplate, if Britain does not enter the Common Market, how we can enter it without them. But if we do we accept the responsibility to raise those tariff barriers against her and, if we do, we can hardly complain if she should raise them against us in retaliation.</P>
    <P>I foresee that we must enter and we will enter if England does the same. I foresee that in negotiating the protocol which will govern our membership <Col N="2599" /> of that Treaty Group there will be long, arduous and difficult negotiations to carry on.  I would like to recall that whenever the members of the Party to which I belong were charged with the responsibility for negotiating for international trade on behalf of this country, they brought back good benefits to the Irish people. I am bound to recall that all Fianna Fáil brought back was the Economic War.  Subsequently, in 1958, they went and came back with one hand as long as the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am provoking him by recalling the speeches he made four years ago.  To his credit <Col N="2600" /> he came into this House and clamoured that his promises should be redeemed. The only fault I find with him was that when he was spurned and told not to be a fool, he trotted into the Lobby after them like a docile lamb. I think Deputy Corry thought he could promise, but being an innocent simple creature he was led up the garden path like the simplest creature in East Cork.  I think he kicked energetically when he found himself in the bag and all the consolation he got was to hear the string tied on to it and he was thrown down into the corner like a sack of potatoes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry may stand for that but the people will not stand for that. The people have a remedy in their hands and the remedy is to determine that they will get rid of the Batistas of this nation.  Let us learn a lesson from the example we had before our eyes.  It was because the people of Cuba did not insist, as our people will insist, on honesty in politicians that they got Bastista and it was as a result of getting Batista that Castro came upon them.  And out of Castro they have got Krushchev and it is only now they discover that having suffered Batista they have degenerated into the condition when they cannot get freedom back.  Our people, thank God, will not suffer that, but it would be a tragedy indeed if our generation of politicians, a profession of which I am proud to belong, should so sicken of democratic and free institutions as to make them turn away to some other system suitable for less mature peoples. We have a great tradition in Ireland, one we have every right to be proud of.</P>
      <P>I want to see a programme in this country designed to restore the profitability of the agricultural industry. I want to see a system of education established which will progress steadily to the point where all those capable of benefiting from higher education will get it whether they are born in families of the rich or the poor.  I want to see a social system obtaining in this country with special reference to health which would provide those who are sick with the means to get well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2601" /> I am very conscious of the fact that it is not within the power of Government to assuage all human ills but there are certain spheres of activity in which the Government can do much. First and foremost amongst them is to keep faith, preserve liberty and to build up the nation for all the people. That is the aim and objective of this Party.</P>
    <P>It was my duty as Leader of the Opposition in this House tonight to call in review the record of the Fianna Fáil administration.  I think it is a shameful record of dishonesty, fraud and unscrupulous betrayal of the people who trusted them.  I have no faith in the capacity of this Government to protect the vital interests of this country in what I admit to be a new and difficult situation from which we cannot escape in the emergence of the Common Market and its manifest prospect of absorbing all Europe in its organisation.  I believe that Ireland, perhaps, has a destiny in that new Europe, both political and economic, and that is, to save the new Europe from itself.  The greatest danger of the Common Market concept is that instead of being outward looking it will become an inward looking organisation.  There is no safety in the Common Market alone.  There is no safety for a revitalised Europe unless it is in intimate and close association with the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the rest of the free world.</P>
    <P>If West Berlin is today an offence to the Cominform which it is restless to destroy, what will a united Europe in prosperity be to the same potential foe tomorrow if the highest hopes of the Rome Treaty are realised in our time?  How long would West Berlin survive in freedom but for the presence of the United States of America there today?  Withdraw the United States of America from West Berlin and leave the French, the British, the Italians, the West Germans there and how long would West Berlin be free?  It is the physical presence of the United States of America that stands as the guarantee of West Berlin's freedom today and of Western Europe's tomorrow.</P>
    <P>We are geographically located and <Col N="2602" /> spiritually oriented to bring the new world and the old together in a sure citadel for freedom strong enough and safe enough to face whatever peril the Cominform can bring against us.  The very establishment of such strength and resources in good time is the surest guarantee that the world will be spared annihilation by war.  If there is to be a war, we will perish.  Better perish free men than live on as Soviet slaves but, best of all, to live on free men and redeem the world from servitude by our example, by the employment of our resources and by our common loyalty to a great ideal.  All this can be served if Ireland is the inspiration of a greater and a wider combination than the Treaty of Rome ever envisaged, a combination of free men everywhere to help one another not only with their arms but with their goods and with their hearts as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It has well been said by the Taoiseach and by Deputy Dillon that the Dáil is being adjourned and probably will be dissolved very shortly in a very critical period of Irish history. Indeed, it certainly is the most critical period of our time.  It seems we are on the threshold of an event which the Taoiseach says overshadows the past. I believe that if it did overshadow some of the events in the last 40 years it would have done a great service to the country.</P>
      <P>There is tremendous significance in our application, as announced by the Taoiseach yesterday, for membership of the Common Market.  I do not pretend to be an expert on the Common Market and its implications nor do I pretend to be a prophet as to what may happen, nor, indeed, do I pretend to foretell the effect of Ireland's or Britain's entry into the Common Market or what that may mean towards the advancement of greater peace in the world.  I must confess that, while we all have an interest in the peace of the world, my main concern is how Ireland will fare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite a long time since we had in this country a direct challenge.  It is fortunate that we did not have to participate in the last war, very fortunate we thought, and very fortunate it was, but it often occurred to me that <Col N="2603" /> the countries that did participate in the last war found themselves faced with a challenge, the rebuilding of their countries.  We had that opportunity about 40 years ago and it does not seem to me that we met that challenge adequately.  There were various reasons for that.  I suppose it was because of the fact that the country had been divided by the Civil War that took place in 1922 that for many years afterwards and even up to the present day we seem to have been much more concerned with political events rather than economic events.  We seem to have been more concerned with political events and past political events than we were with the actual rebuilding of the country, so much so that we find ourselves, 40 years afterwards, having had Cumann na nGaedheal Governments, Fianna Fáil Governments, inter-Party Governments and Coalition Governments, in not as prosperous a position as undoubtedly we should be.  The situation in the Six Counties seems to be more or less the same. Whether under Irish control or British control, we do not seem to have made much progress.  I do not think the blame for that can be laid on any particular person or Party.</P>
    <P>While the Common Market and our entry into it may represent a challenge to this country, our main function at the present time is to make the people aware of as many facts as are available. I do not believe it is right that sections of our community, either industrial or agricultural, should assume that our entry into the Common Market as full members or in association with it will mean a virtual paradise or Utopia for either industry or agriculture.  Whoever will conduct the negotiations, whether it is the present Taoiseach and his Government or some other Government, nobody will envy them their job because no matter what one might think as to the attitude of other countries towards this country their representatives are politicians and hard businessmen.  I do not believe there are going to be any concessions for Ireland merely because we are Irish, merely because they regard us as good fellows, good fighters.  They are politicians, businessmen, economists, and <Col N="2604" /> while they may be anxious about an anti-Russian bloc, they are also vitally interested in the prosperity of their own people.</P>
    <P>I hope, if we join the Common Market, agriculture will prosper.  It is our main industry.  Deputy Dillon quoted some very interesting figures, already pretty well known to most of us, to show that our entry into the Common Market does not mean immediate prosperity for agriculture.  Our agricultural industry has had free and easy access to the British market for years but it has not prospered.  If we are now to go into competition with the agricultural countries in Europe and try to beat them in the British market, it will be a difficult task and I do not think anyone can say that agricultural policy in this country in the past few years has been eminently successful, no matter who has been Minister for Agriculture.  The signs have been clear&mdash;farmers leaving the land in great numbers and, more particularly, agricultural workers leaving because there has not been a decent living on the land.</P>
    <P>Whether our entry into the Common Market can bring about a change in all this, I do not know, but whoever has to negotiate the terms on which we will join will have a difficult task. I find it a bit bewildering to decide how we shall conduct these negotiations. Will they be side by side with Britain or do we negotiate by ourselves? On one thing we all agree &mdash;we must go in if Britain does.  I do not think we are in a good position to talk about conditions.  We have got to follow Britain.  That is inevitable. What, then, will happen as regards our industries?  There is a very pessimistic view about them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that some of our weaker industries will fall and some people twit the Minister and say that that is the result of the policy of Fianna Fáil in establishing those industries by a system of protection.  My Party never were against that protection but I think successive Governments can be criticised, and industrialists themselves must be criticised for the fact that this protection was continued when industrialists should have been aiming <Col N="2605" /> at independence and trying to set themselves into a position to compete with British manufacturers and industrialists in other countries throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Taoiseach has been quite clear about the political implications of our joining the Common Market.  In his speech to the British House of Commons, Mr. Macmillan referred to the political implications and made no bones about saying that this economic integration was being brought about not alone for an economic purpose but for political purposes as well.  We want to know where we are going.  We boasted about our neutrality since the last war and many people think we should continue to maintain a neutral policy in the event of any future war. Accordingly, the Taoiseach should give us his view as to what our political future will be if we are accepted as members of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has appealed, and rightly so in view of the tremendous importance it is to us, that we should not make our proposed entry into the Common Market a plaything in the election campaign within the next two months.  I think the Taoiseach will abide by that.  However, he should also control his back benchers and ensure that they do the same thing. I know he has not absolute control over many of them&mdash;and I do not mean any discredit to the back benchers&mdash; but if any of them makes a political plaything out of it, he should be controlled immediately because it could be disastrous if the terms on which we joined the Common Market are made the subject of discussions or falsehoods on political platforms. Speaking for the Labour Party, I can say we will not make this a political football to be kicked around in these circumstances.  So much for the Common Market.  I do not pretend to be an expert on it but I have tried as best I can to make a critical analysis of the situation arising from it.</P>
    <P>I want now to review the activities of the Government during the past four and a half years and I want to be as factual as I can in doing so. <Col N="2606" /> I think it should be said of the Government during those years that as far as conditions are concerned they never had it so good.  There was a lot of criticism from Fianna Fáil when the Labour Party participated in an inter-Party Government.  It sounds funny now to hear from Fianna Fáil benches that we should not engage in dirty tactics.  It was my view then as a Minister in Government that we were vitally influenced by conditions in Great Britain.  Conditions in Britain during the past four years were good so the Government here never had it so good.  If we accept the economic relationship that exists between this country and Britain, we must also accept that any boom in Britain is reflected here and conversely that any depression in Britain has its affects on us here.</P>
    <P>It must be conceded, therefore, that as far as the period&mdash;1955-1956&mdash;is concerned, the economic position in Britain was so bad that it was severely reflected here and no Party in the House, with the possible exception of Clann na Poblachta, put forward any proposals as to how we should break that economic integration.  That is not to say that I think it is desirable we should do so.  I am only emphasising that economic conditions in Britain always will be reflected here and while I say the Government never had it so good as in the past four years, I would point out that a different situation may exist in the next five or six months, in view of the present depression in Britain.</P>
    <P>What advantage did the Government take of the situation in Britain in the past four years.  They claim they came in at a time of crisis.  If they did and if they had good conditions for the last two or three years, the results after four and a half years should be very good.  The Taoiseach sounded optimistic.  He described broadly what the Government had done for the past four-and-a-half years and the effect of their actions.  These results, I think, have not been as good as the Taoiseach says or pretends they are.  I shall not dwell on the promises or political catch-phrases we heard in the last general election such as: &ldquo;Wives, get your husbands back <Col N="2607" /> to work&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let us get cracking&rdquo; and the need that the Taoiseach said existed for 100,000 new jobs.  The results after four-and-a-half years are the important thing.  In that time the Government had a majority that no other Government here ever had; it was not dependent on any group for support.  What they wanted to do they could do.</P>
    <P>There was talk tonight&mdash;and from the Taoiseach also&mdash;about employment. Government members have tried to give the impression that in certain parts of the country industries are springing up like mushrooms in August or September.  I do not see them in my constituency.  Government speakers try to give the impression that there is a great increase in employment generally and especially in industry. The figures show a different picture, a picture the Taoiseach should see and appreciate.  In April, 1957, there were 1,136,000 persons employed; in April, 1960, there were 1,112,000 at work.  That means that in that period we had 24,000 fewer persons employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy mean by &ldquo;in employment&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The same meaning as in the book <i>Economic Statistics</i> produced by the Taoiseach's Department. The Taoiseach may say employment has improved and that April, 1960 is 15 months away.  There has been an improvement.  From March, 1960 to April, 1961, there was an increase of 5,800 in the number of persons engaged in transportable goods industries, that is, mining, manufacturing, electricity, gas etc.  Probably there was an increase in construction employment but I doubt if it was significant because it seems we reached the peak some time last year in that sphere.  Let us say there was a slight increase of 500 or 1,000 in construction.  I think we have arrived at saturation point in that industry and in a relatively short time, we should be confronted by some thousands of unemployed who for the past two or three years were engaged in building and reconstruction work financed to some extent by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2608" /> Apart from that, the Taoiseach must concede that in the period for which we have no figures there has probably been a fall in agricultural employment of about 7,000.  I do not think that is any exaggeration because in the three or four years before that, the decreases in agricultural employment were 8,000, 7,000 and 13,000.  Therefore, the best that can be said when comparing this year with last year, is that there has been no worsening of the employment situation.  In relation to 1957, there are approximately 20,000 fewer people employed.  I should like to know if these figures are disputed because they are taken from publications by the Taoiseach's Department.  Where can they be disputed?  There is no point in fooling ourselves that, in the first place many new industries are being established and secondly, that they are providing employment for thousands of our people, when in fact they are not. That is a far cry from what the Taoiseach said in 1955/56 about 100,000 new jobs being needed.  The Government have not provided even one of those jobs.  On the other hand, we have 25,000 fewer jobs in the country. That should be noted against recent Ministerial statements to the effect that employment is increasing all round.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said, the census figures will reveal the true position. Many figures have been given over the past five or six years for emigration. The ordinary person who has not figures available recognises that many people are going from the country.  I believe&mdash;the Taoiseach may also have said it&mdash;that the census figures to be published in the next few months will show that we have the lowest population that we ever had in this country. That is something none of us can be proud of, something we should frequently remind ourselves of so that we may have an idea of the immensity of the task facing whatever Government may be in office after the next general election.</P>
    <P>I do not want to exaggerate emigration but the figures which the Taoiseach often quotes and which I think are well accepted show that, in 1957, according to the net outward passenger movements by sea and air, 60,500 <Col N="2609" /> people left the country.  In 1958, the figure was 40,000.  In 1959, it fell to 39,000, but in 1960, which was supposed to be a boom year, the year when we were supposed to have recovered that figure increased to 43,000. I do not know the figure for 1961.  The Taoiseach said it has declined very much but I suggest that a good estimate would be about 16,000 for the first six months.  That would mean over the year about 32,000 have emigrated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must realise that emigration can be estimated only over the full 12 months. The most recent 12 months' period was that which ended last May.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am estimating the figure for the first six months of 1961 so that for the four-and-a-half years we have had a massive total exodus of almost 200,000 Irish men and women.  Some people have a funny attitude to emigration.  They believe the majority who emigrate need not do so, that it has become fashionable to emigrate, and that it costs so little to go to Britain that people just go off.  The figures cannot tell you that. But I think the majority of those who will come back on holidays this summer would prefer to remain in Ireland if they were given the ordinary wages applicable to their work.  It is pure nonsense for people to say that the majority emigrate without any reason.  They emigrate for various reasons.  They emigrate because there is insecurity of employment in many of our industries.  If they go to a motor factory in Britain or any of the steel works there, they are fairly certain they will be employed for 12 months.  I could give the Taoiseach a list of industries here which will not give employment for 12 months and which believe they are saving money by laying men off and by cutting their week.</P>

    <P>The agricultural worker will always continue to emigrate.  Who would blame him when the farmer lays him off every wet day?  Is he to stand down at the cross-roads until the farmer calls him up again to weed <Col N="2610" /> a drill of turnips?  Employers here have a responsibility they do not seem to accept&mdash;the moral obligation to give more employment for continuous periods.  I hear some farmers complain they cannot get men.  If they will not pay men and give them continuous employment, they cannot expect them to stay when they can go across to Britain and get £15 or £20 a week and be able to send home a sizeable sum to their wives and families.</P>
    <P>We have also the problem of opportunity in Ireland.  In my part of the country there have not been established within the past 10 or 15 years any new industries, except for one or two giving employment to 20 or 30 people.  Parents are faced with the problem of what to do with a boy or girl of 16 who passes the Leaving Certificate or Intermediate Certificate. Jobs are very scarce around Wexford, Waterford and Wicklow.  The people have to go to Britain.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense to say we have got into the fashion of emigrating.  Economic circumstances force our people to go, and unless we can do something about it, they will continue to go.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said we are now airborne. I do not believe we are.  We have not yet got off the ground.  But if we are airborne, it is because we have, by neglect, jettisoned our human cargo.  I do not say there is not prosperity here.  There is prosperity for some people, but there is far from prosperity for the masses.  This Government, like many other Governments, say they have no direct responsibility to provide employment.  I believe they have.  I do not think it is sufficient for a Government to say they provide grants and loans for anybody who wants to come in and start a factory. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach remember when 1,000 men were rendered unemployed in the town of Dundalk because the G.N.R. Works closed up?  The Taoiseach was concerned; certainly, the Minister for External Affairs was concerned.  The people of Dundalk did not have to wait for somebody to invite a German or a Japanese to start a factory.  They did not have to wait for somebody in Switzerland to read <Col N="2611" /> of the facilities available in Ireland for the establishment of factories.  They did not have to wait for Deputy Briscoe or anybody else to go to America to negotiate the establishment of a factory in Dundalk.  The Government acted.  Whether you call it State industry, semi-state industry or private industry, the fact is that through Government intervention and initiative four or five factories were established giving employment to the bulk of these 1,000 people.</P>
    <P>We have a situation in this country where we have 40,000 people unemployed. It is the lowest figure for the year because of the time of the year and because of the operation of an employment period order.  Could the Government not take a little more initiative in the establishment of factories?  If these Germans, Japanese, Belgians or British decide now, because we are all to be in the same Common Market, it is more advantageous for them to establish their factories elsewhere, what will happen to Irish industry?  It must be generally assumed that for many of these people the attraction, apart from the financial aid given, was the fact they had free access to the British market.  As I said to the Taoiseach, I am not against the establishment of these industries, and certainly I am not against the facilities given.  But I believe the Government should have taken a much more direct interest in the establishment of these factories and sought some control over them in an effort to ensure they would be factories that would last.</P>
    <P>New industries have been established, particularly in the West.  Special facilities were given to them because they were established in the West.  I often wonder if the Taoiseach was wise in dividing the country in the Undeveloped Areas Act.  However, it seems that a majority of the Dáil believe that was the best course to adopt.  I do not believe it is.  I believe the tradition of industry is in the other part of the country and that it is there the effort should have been made.  No mention has been made of the industries that have closed in the past four or five years.  I know of some myself. <Col N="2612" /> When we talk about industries being established in the past two or three years, we should also remember that many factories have closed and have shed workers.</P>
    <P>I do not think there has been a spectacular increase in the numbers employed in manufacturing industry in the past five and a half years.  The peak figure in October, 1945, was 147,900; in March, 1961, it had increased to 152,270.  That is according to the <i>Census of Industrial Production</i> issued by the Central Statistics Office. Therefore, it means that in five and a half years there has been a net increase of employment in industry of 4,370. I do not think anybody could say that was spectacular.  I heard the Taoiseach talk this time last year in terms of an increase of something like 9,000 in industry.</P>

      <P>The net increase in five and a half years has been 4,370. According to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, industries which have been notified grants or financial aid from the Government for 1961 are expected to give employment to 4,300. I think it would be fair comment to say that that was an optimistic figure, in view of the fact that in five and a half years we could succeed in increasing the number by a mere 4,370.  I do not think the Taoiseach could boast that the five Budgets introduced by this Government were spectacular ones except, of course, the one in 1957 which abolished the food subsidies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was the same Budget which made the special levies introduced in 1956 part of permanent taxation.  Apart from that there was no major change in financial policy or in the financial machinery of the State in any of these five Budgets.  A little bit was given here and a little bit was taken off there, but the same old pattern persisted right through.  One thing did emerge.  The Government succeeded in one thing.  Indeed, they were very successful in it.  In all five Budgets they increased tax revenue, <Col N="2613" /> and today the increase totals £19,500,000.  The Government succeeded in getting more from the tax-payers, more to the extent of £19.5 millions.</P>
      <P>In rates, for which the Government have no direct responsibility, there was an increase in that period, 1956/57 to 1961/62, of £3.5 millions.  As far as the Government are concerned, in the last five Budgets tax revenue went up by £19,000,000.  We are entitled to ask what have we got in return?  How much has gone to social welfare?  It has been protested by various Ministers that we cannot afford to do much, or do anything spectacular, in the field of social welfare until the country can afford it, meaning until the public are able to earn more and contribute more to the State.  In these five years tax revenue went up by £19,000,000, a pretty substantial sum.  How much of that has gone on social welfare? Nothing.</P>

      <P>The amount spent on social welfare and social assistance in 1957/58 was £25.5 millions.  In 1961/62 it is estimated by both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare that £26.4 millions will be spent on social welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The totals are not wrong.  I quoted the same totals to the Minister for Social Welfare on his recent Bill.  He would be the first to deny them if they were wrong.  He did not deny them.  Whether by not denying them he accepted them, I do not know, but he is not the man to swallow these figures if he believes they are wrong.  In any case the figures demonstrate to me that a mere £300,000 extra has been devoted to social welfare. Tax revenue has increased by £19,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is that, whilst there have been improvements in old age pensions, whilst we have the contributory old age pension scheme, whilst sickness benefits have been increased to some extent, <Col N="2614" /> the burden of these increases has been placed on the workers and the employers. During the year 1961/62 the insured workers will contribute £4.9 millions.  That is a pretty substantial sum but the really significant feature is that it represents an increase of £1.7 millions compared with last year.  As far as I and my Party are concerned, the important thing is that, whilst tax revenue increased so spectacularly by £19,000,000, that increase was not reflected in expenditure on either social welfare or health.  Over the last five years the Minister for Social Welfare could find less than £1,000,000 extra for social welfare and that £1,000,000 is, of course, being paid for not merely by the bulk of the workers but also by those who have to meet the increase of one penny on cigarettes and tobacco &mdash;an increase which represents £1,000,000 this year.</P>

      <P>That is not so.  I do not think there is any necessity for me, in view of my remarks at the beginning of my speech, to say anything about agriculture, but it certainly seems to me that it has not prospered, not alone in the last four and a half years but for a very, very long time before that.  The lack of prosperity in agriculture is clearly demonstrated by the abnormal flight from the land, especially in the last ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said before, the Government has been unhindered in the last four and a half years.  They have had, to all intents and purposes, the benefit of a majority of 15 or 20 members in this House.  Can the Government point to any piece of major legislation introduced in the last four and a half years?  Has there been any departure from the usual pattern, any departure from the usual routine?  As far as I can remember the legislation produced has merely been a continuation of certain Acts introduced a great many years ago, an extension of industrial grants, an extension of tourist grants, an extension of the remission of taxation on profits from exports, an amendment of the Road Traffic Act, an amendment of Social Welfare Acts. <Col N="2615" /> There has been no major legislation of any kind introduced in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>Some people believe that the less legislation the better.  There has not been much imagination shown by the Government in the last four and a half years.  There seems to have been a desire to get away from common policies that have been known to fail, not alone over that period but in periods preceding the lifetime of this particular Government.  The best one can say about the present Government is that they have marked time.</P>
    <P>There was, of course, one major piece of legislation introduced, the piece of legislation that was designed to change our Constitution.  The Dáil did not decide finally on that.  It was the people who turned it down.  The last four and a half years have been wasted, in my opinion, having regard to the fact that we have to-day 25,000 fewer people in employment than when this Government took office. Remembering that, it can be well said that the last four and a half years have been wasted years.  One remembers the promise made by the Taoiseach and his statement that there would be 100,000 new jobs and one compares that with the fact that 200,000 people have emigrated since Fianna Fáil returned to office. Remembering that, one can only regard the last four and a half years as disastrous years, disastrous years in which Fianna Fáil, unhindered, never had conditions so good from the point of view of Government.  The only hope is that&mdash;no matter who they may be&mdash;the next Government will show some imagination and will tackle seriously the twin problems of emigration and unemployment, these two grave problems to which every speaker here refers when the opportunity offers.  Let us hope something will be done to stop the mass exodus of our people to Britain and other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Taoiseach's speech to-night I could not help reflecting on the fact that it is just 30 years since Fianna Fáil took office.  In that 30 years they were in charge of the country for roughly 24 years.  One of <Col N="2616" /> the first things that hit one is the alarming drop in population during that period.  From constant repetition there is now almost a danger that it will become just a hackneyed phrase without any meaning.  Nevertheless, the drop in population is such a serious matter that it must be mentioned. From 1934 to 1954 we lost 158,100 male workers who were engaged in agriculture.  In 1934 when Fianna Fáil had been two years in power the total number of male workers engaged in agriculture was 579,400.  By 1954 it had dropped to 421,309, a reduction of 158,100.  I do not think I would be exaggerating in adding another 25,000 to that over the past four or five years since Fianna Fáil returned to office.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies who are not familiar with the conditions of agriculture seem to wonder why agriculture is not progressing and showing signs of improvement. In Connaught alone during that 20 year period, 1934 to 1954, we lost 44,232 male workers from the land. Leitrim lost 7,000, a reduction from 17,000 to 10,000; Mayo lost 12,000, a reduction from 45,000 to 33,000; and Sligo lost 6,000, a reduction from 18,000 to 12,000.  The reason agriculture is in such a backward condition is that men are flying from it because life on the land does not pay any more in this country.  The only people I see remaining on the land in the West of Ireland are those who cannot go because of family responsibility or because they are too advanced in years to change.  The majority of those I see engaged in agriculture in the fields are old people and children.  Any industry depending on these surely cannot make progress.  All the able-bodied men are leaving the land because farming for them has become a gamble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government seem to be paying only lip service to those engaged on the land.  If the Government are genuine in their anxiety about agriculture I can give them a few pointers as to how they can help to remedy the situation before it is too late.  There is urgent need for lightening the burden the farming community have to carry. They should be given security in the form of guaranteed prices.  Certain <Col N="2617" /> agricultural products, such as wheat, barley, milk and sugar, have guaranteed prices.  There is no question of a decline in regard to those products because even though the profit on them may be slight the farmer knows before he puts down his crop exactly what he will get for it.  As regards the farmer engaged in mixed farming, in the breeding of cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry and so on, prices are not fixed and there is no incentive to continue in production. The farmer producing cattle has no idea what he will get for them. He is at the mercy of the buyer.  He is the only type of producer in the country for whom the buyer of his produce fixes the price.</P>
    <P>In 1957 the gross value of agricultural output was £196.6 million.  Fianna Fáil came into office that year and by 1958 the gross value of agricultural output had dropped to £179,000,000. By 1959 it had dropped still further to £176,000,000, simply because the three preceding years were disastrous years. During those years the land was black with stock, with cattle and sheep.  They could not be sold until the farmers were obliged to dispose of them at any price.  That led to an increased flight from the land.</P>
    <P>If we take the farming community as representing roughly half the total population of the country we must remember that an additional burden was placed on their backs apart from the effects of their income being reduced from £196,000,000 to £176,000,000.  The value of the food subsidies was approximately £9,000,000.  The inter-Party Government was spending this amount to keep the prices of bread, butter and other essential commodities down.  Therefore when Fianna Fáil removed the food subsidies inside three weeks of taking office in 1957, the farming community had to bear an increased burden of £4,500,000.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the very deflated attitude of the Taoiseach in making his opening speech.  However, when I sum up the Fianna Fáil record it should not surprise me a bit.  They removed the food subsidies.  They killed the Local Authorities (Works) Act which gave useful employment and enabled necessary work to be carried out in rural <Col N="2618" /> areas.  They drastically reduced rural employment.  There is a little bit of a stir at the present time because an election is coming.  There are a few more workers employed on the roads than hitherto but the promise in regard to the 100,000 jobs has not been fulfilled. The Taoiseach also promised in October or November of 1957 an expenditure of £220,000,000 over a five-year period but we have not heard a word about that promise since.  Will he repudiate that promise as he did the promise in relation to the 100,000 jobs?</P>
    <P>During the past four-and-a-half years in which Fianna Fáil have been in office a new pattern has emerged in regard to emigration and that is the banishment of whole families.  Heretofore we were banishing only boys and girls as they came of age, leaving others to carry on the farm work. Now we have given emigration a new lease.  We are banishing the whole family, father, mother, children and all, and locking the door.  That is a feature that has come into farming only inside the last three or four years. The cost of living has increased; local rates have reached a point where I forecast that they will not and cannot be paid.  There are 25,000 fewer employed today than when we handed over the Government to Fianna Fáil and 2,000 people have emigrated.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, looking back on that record, is justifiably gloomy.  It is no wonder that he felt very awkward in coming before the House, particularly when it is one of his last speeches in the Dáil before the general election. It is a pretty grim record.  He tells us today that this is a time for new ideas, meaning another shower of new promises, to be repudiated the minute the election is over.  He tells us that we have made progress in the past 2½ years.  We have made great progress in shipping our own kith and kin out of the country.  He tells us that unless the population level rises it will not be easy to make any improvement.  He also tried to put across the House that emigration was down in the first eight months of this year.  I should not be surprised if it is down because I do not see who is left to go now, unless it is the old people and young children still going from the rural areas.  It <Col N="2619" /> must have reached the point where all that can go have gone.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach warned us that there would be a significant drop in the population when the figures of the census come to hand.  I do not blame the Taoiseach a bit for being gloomy about the report that he has put before the House.  It is a record of disaster for the rural parts of Ireland.  Incidentally, it is amusing to find that he has discovered the family farm, that he is setting up two committees, with a vague kind of promise that if Fianna Fáil are returned, they are ready to start some programme or other in 1963.  God bless the mark!  I want to tell the Taoiseach that one of the most dreaded things among the people in this country is the prospect of another five years of Fianna Fáil.  The people are very determined to see that that will not happen; it will be regarded as a disaster if Fianna Fáil get back again.</P>
    <P>What does Fianna Fáil mean to do if they do get back?  What do they mean to do for agriculture?  A lot of foolish talk about the Common Market is not going to help anyone. The Common Market is going to produce a good deal of upheaval both for agriculture and industry but there is one point the Taoiseach might have explained to us.  He mentioned that political integration will almost certainly follow, or is likely to follow from certain statements that have been made within the last few months, if we join the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I would like to know, and so would many other people, what exactly will be the implications and what will be our responsibilities in the case of political integration in the Common Market countries?  What would happen if these countries found themselves as belligerents in a war all together? Would we have to take part in the war?  I think that these are considerations that might be looked into before we travel further along the road.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that these dangers might lie out of sight along the road, which should deter us from entering on it.  They may not deter us but they are worthy of consideration <Col N="2620" /> because a step taken now might be very hard to undo in the years to come, and while the Common Market has very definite advantages to offer to us, it has definite disadvantages for us if we do not go in and Britain does.  Nevertheless, I should like to know would nationalism become completely submerged, should a United States of Europe become the final result of political integration?</P>
    <P>I am just taking the two other sets of States in the world that are known to us.  One is the combination of Russian republics.  I do not know what kind of system obtains there but I believe it is not too happy.  The other is one we all look up to and admire&mdash;the United States of America. While I do not know of any one of the 51 States which was formerly a separate country before they joined the United States of America such as this country is, I think there should be a clear statement made on the implications of political integration because we have only recently got our freedom and all these things would have to be examined.</P>
    <P>I should like to know to what extent political integration would interfere with our national ideals; whether Ireland as a separate nation would not have the right to withhold certain action in case the majority of these countries took some line that might not be in agreement with Irish national aspirations.  Let me say that as regards agriculture, there are two things that are vitally important at the present time if we are to save the remnants of the family farms.  If we are to do so we have to give guaranteed minimum prices for most items of agricultural produce on which family farms are depending.  Secondly, there must be de-rating of agricultural land and buildings.  If total de-rating is not feasible, there should be de-rating of the first £50, £40 or even £30.  These are the first two steps that should be taken.</P>
    <P>In view of the flight from the land, it should not be amiss to point out to the Taoiseach that he should take a new look at the work of the Land Commission.  If we are to save the rural population at all, farms of a moderate size should be purchased <Col N="2621" /> with money provided by the Exchequer to place farmers' sons on them.  The Government would be better employed using money for that purpose than allowing foreigners to come in to buy up the land.  It does seem an injustice on the people who fought for the ownership of the land that they are being squeezed out by the carelessness of a native Government while foreigners can come and buy up the land wholesale, that our own flesh and blood are abandoned because our Government does not think they are worth saving.</P>
    <P>With the number of rural Deputies that Fianna Fáil has, they cannot be completely unaware of what is happening in rural Ireland.  It has struck me that Fianna Fáil is convinced that the small farmer is a nuisance and a drag on this country.  He is being squeezed out by the high cost of living and the low income that Fianna Fáil has doled out to him.  Might I suggest that the decent thing to do would be to tell these people, if they are not wanted? It would be better to tell them so and let them know where they stand.  They do not know from where the next blow will descend on them.</P>
    <P>It will be nothing short of disaster for the people if Fianna Fáil are returned for another period of office.  I do not believe they will be.  The thing the people most dread is another five years of Fianna Fáil misrule.  People are waiting in the hope that there will be a change of Government and that the prosperity the inter-Party Government brought on two occasions can be restored.  Many people are just hanging on in the hope that there will be a change of Government that will bring prosperity but if Fianna Fáil are returned there will be an exodus from the country such as was never witnessed before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some rather hard things to say about the Government, but I should like to express my appreciation to the Taoiseach for having given the House some indication of the time of the general election.  We were in a rather awkward position in that we did not know whether we could go away for a holiday <Col N="2622" /> or not.  If there is any meaning in the Taoiseach's statement, we should be safe for another month.</P>
      <P>It struck me this evening that from the moment the Taoiseach rose to make his statement until he sat down, he was on the defensive.  I do not see how he could expect anything but the most severe criticism of himself and his Government over the last four and a half years.  This Dáil is coming to its conclusion now.  It will be looked back on as a Dáil in which the Government had an enormous majority, were free from external worries such as their predecessors had to face; were in office at a time when there were no major disturbances in the world; who were left a corrected balance of payments, which was correcting all the time.  In other words, they had unrivalled opportunities to produce a sound economic policy, if they were fit to do so.  I submit to the House that they have totally failed to do so.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, instead of accepting things as they found them, they wasted a lot of time in trying to change the electoral laws in the only major legislation that they introduced. They failed in that attempt.  When their epitaph comes to be written, it will be that they wasted the best part of twelve months in that attempt.</P>
      <P>This Government have gradually, almost imperceptibly, removed authority from the ordinary Deputy in Dáil Éireann and handed it over to boards.  They created An Bord Gráin, and the Minister for Agriculture has now no responsibility for the price that the farmer gets for beet or barley.  It is a matter for An Bord Gráin.  They established An Foras Tionscal and if you want to get an industry started in your constituency, as I did recently, you have to refer to a board in Dublin which is excluded from Parliamentary control. They decide where the industry is located and the individual Deputy or any other individual in Ireland, although the capital is available, has no say in the matter.  I have given two classical examples of the many boards that have been created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has been the trend throughout <Col N="2623" /> this Administration.  An unpleasant feature of these boards is that any Government that is in power naturally tend to appoint their political henchman on these boards.  One does not like to say that in Parliament, but it is true.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the arguments may not be very pleasing to the House and I will go on to something else but before I do so I want to lodge a protest.  I am speaking on policy.  I am entitled to speak on policy.  My arguments were based on the fact that this Government have removed from Dáil Éireann control over matters and I base that on the fact that if I want to have an industry established in my constituency, as a result of the policy of the Government I am not able to get that industry. Am I talking about legislation in that case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the Deputy should leave the question. He has discussed it amply.  It is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue on policy.  I had an opportunity of getting an industry in my constituency about six to eight months ago. That industry was transferred, as a result of Government policy, to another part of Ireland.  I will leave that question and I will leave the question of boards.  I can refer to lack of policy. The unfortunate situation in which the country finds itself after four and a half years of Government by a Party with an overwhelming majority is that there is mass unemployment, mass emigration, uncertainty and unstable conditions, all due to the fact that the Government have no policy.  I shall not deal any further with policy or lack of policy but will come directly to the greatest failure of this Government, namely, on the question of the Common Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party do not accuse <Col N="2625" /> the Government of having done anything wrong directly with regard to any decision they have taken on the Common Market.  What we do accuse the Government of is that they showed no foresight and made no approach in a situation that was blatantly obvious to them if they have any sources of information at all.  As Deputy Dillon has said, they must have had all the information at their disposal from their Ambassadors in Europe.</P>
    <P>They claim they have a representative, per their Ambassador in Belgium, to the Common Market.  Therefore, they must have known everything that was happening in Europe.  They must have known that this country, together with others in Europe, was faced with the decision whether or not to join the Common Market.  The charge we make is that they did nothing.  That is almost an under-statement.  It is only a fortnight or three weeks since they introduced a White Paper in this House on the question of the Common Market. During the past 12 months, Parliamentary Questions have been put from front and back benches here relative to the Common Market and all the time there was no response from the Government.  They had nothing to say. There was no concern whatsoever from the Government on the question.</P>
    <P>Suddenly, three weeks ago, they discovered that Britain was considering entering the Common Market.  Anyone who had read the newspapers, even without inside information, must have known months ago that negotiations were going on for Britain's move.  The Government must have known, had they read these reports or listened to what their Ambassadors told them, that active negotiations and discussions behind the scenes were going on.  Yet the Taoiseach has given us no information whatever.  In effect, what he has told us is nothing&mdash;just a categorical assertion that if Britain goes in, we go in, too.</P>
    <P>Now he tells us something we all knew already&mdash;that Britain has made application to join the Common Market and that we have made an application to join as well.  Is that the way for the Government to behave with regard <Col N="2626" /> to one of the most vital decisions which has faced this country since we became a State?  Is there any question of the Government having set up a body of technical advisers?  The Taoiseach, the founder of the modern protective system, which is being made nonsense of now, just tells our industrialists that we are likely to join the Common Market.  Why did he not take some action?  Why did he not, as I have already stated set up a body of technical men to tell those industrialists what they had to face?</P>
    <P>Has any preparation whatsoever been made?  Has not every country in Europe, in the world&mdash;even the newly formed nations which have emerged in the past year&mdash;sent people to the six nations for technical advice and to study the conditions in them?  There was no mention that this was done by our Government.  The Taoiseach has come into the House and told us we are going to apply for membership because Britain is doing so.  He tells us nothing about the implications involved.  Does he know?  Have the Government any interest in the Common Market?</P>
    <P>Do not they know that a decision like this is going to affect our whole economy, agricultural and industrial? It should have been obvious to the Government in the past three or four months, even if they had no information, which they had, that the British economy was failing, that something was going seriously wrong with this nation beside us and with which we have such close economic ties.  Was it not quite obvious that they were not able to sell in the markets in which they had sold heretofore?  Was it not obvious then that Britain must take some step to reform its whole economy, industrial and agricultural?</P>
    <P>Still the Government did nothing. There was the imminent advent of the Common Market.  There was the fact that Germany, a defeated nation less than 20 years ago, was bursting at the seams with foreign capital.  Should not the Government then have realised that a dynamic change was taking place in Europe and the world?  After four and a half years of government, the Taoiseach comes in here and mildly <Col N="2627" /> tells us: &ldquo;Britain is going in and we have applied as well&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Even with the difficulties inherent in her Commonwealth ties, Britain long ago appointed a Minister for the special purpose of inquiring into and studying European economic affairs.  He was specially appointed for the purpose of finding out what was the best policy for them to adopt in the economic circumstances facing them.  Still our Government sat calmly by, unaware that Britain was likely to join the Common Market, though all the portents were there, even though they could have got the information.  That British Minister was appointed immediately the British Government took office two years ago.  Still we did nothing.</P>
    <P>The question of what we will do in the future is another matter.  Will we gain by our entry into the Common Market and are we right in going in? My personal view, for what it is worth, is that we are right.  My view is that the Government should have been watching developments and gathering information, that they should long ago have begun preparations.  I understand there are some 100,000 people employed in industry in this country.  Has any survey been made by the Taoiseach or by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the number of industries that will be so severely hit that they will be unable to carry on?  Has a survey been made to discover what industries are competitive, what industries are exporting and are likely to survive?  If that has been done, we have not heard of it.</P>
    <P>There are some industries, some in my own constituency&mdash;which is not particularly overburdened with industries because we never could get them &mdash;that have stood the test of time, producing and exporting on a free market all over the world.  Far from being put out of business as so many people seem to think&mdash;we are surrounded with pessimists&mdash;these industries will expand and increase their exports because they are competitive. They will be exporting into this great economic unit free of tariffs.  That type of industry will survive.</P>
    <P>There are others based on Irish raw materials which are economic and <Col N="2628" /> fundamentally sound and which were not necessarily built up on the Fianna Fáil high protection policy which has been made nonsense of overnight by the decision of the Government to go into the Common Market, a decision into which, of course, they are forced. An immediate survey of such industries is necessary if we are to benfit from the fund which will be at the disposal of individual countries which are members of the Common Market to cushion them against hardships that may arise.</P>
    <P>Many people may think that the British Government have not yet finally decided to go into the Common Market and that may be right.  Some Deputies may feel that because Britain has sent representatives to the Commonwealth countries, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, she has done so in order to reach agreement with them and that she may decide she will not go into the Common Market.  I do not think that is the case.  I had the privilege of seeing the communiques issued by the Minister who went to these countries and my source of information was Council of Europe documentation.  If, as a member of the Council, I can get those documents the Government could have got them if they tried for them in any of our embassies.  Perhaps they have done so.  The gist of all those documents was that discussions had taken place between the Minister concerned&mdash;I think it was Mr. Duncan Sandys&mdash;and the Commonwealth Governments and all that was decided was that entry would create certain difficulties for these countries but they did not offer any direct opposition to the United Kingdom going into the Common Market.  It was agreed that before a final decision was taken, the United Kingdom would have further discussion with the Commonwealth countries.</P>
    <P>It looks as if Britain will enter the Common Market as full member in the reasonably near future and we must get ready to face the competition of the future.  To do so, we must become competitive and I do not see why we should not.  We should be able to keep our production costs down as well as <Col N="2629" /> any other country.  We have great opportunities. Practically every big industry in every country finds itself faced with a need to increase production to provide a higher standard of living and they find themselves faced with enormous extra charges from which we are singularly free.  Our labour costs are not as high and the cost of production provided we have the raw material at our disposal, is not too high.  Even when we have to import the raw material, if it is not too heavy, it is not unduly costly.  But one of the most important things we have here, which many factories in more highly industrialised countries lack, is space to expand.  In other countries, either the space is not available or if it is, the industries must face fabulous expenditure to acquire it.  That is not so here and we can look forward with reasonable certainty and reasonable satisfaction in that we started industries with comparatively modern machinery and if our industries want to expand, they can buy ground at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>Many new industries started here, it was feared, might have been set up only for the purpose of meeting the extra demand they would get in this prosperous community.  This applied to the German industries, Italian, French or other Continental industries set up here.  Some people feel they might have been set up to take all the benefits this country had to offer but now, with the prospect of this new large economic community opening up, these factories will be able to produce economically with modern machinery and export it to any part of the world.  I say this because everywhere one goes one is asked about the Common Market.  One finds the most appalling pessimism&mdash;the <Col N="2630" /> idea that if we go into the Common Market, all our industries will collapse. I think that was fostered by certain elements here who did not want to be disturbed from their comfortable position behind the protective tariff wall and wanted to go on selling the easy way.  All industries must be competitive to survive and I believe our industries can hold their own with any others, provided we accept the fact that they will no longer produce under tariff protection but in a free world market.</P>
    <P>Everywhere one hears speculation about what will become of our agricultural industry if we enter the Common market and lose the British market. The Common Market consists of about 170 million people, in three first class nations, two moderately strong nations and a small nation, Luxembourg. It will have the greatest purchasing power in the world outside the United States.  The pessimism seems to me unreasonable.  If we go into the Common Market, it seems unreasonable to say that, first, we shall lose the British market and secondly, that we shall not gain from the Common Market.</P>
