      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach on what legal authority he stated in the Dáil on 7th March last that for the purposes of determining the constitutionality of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1961, the Census on 9th April, 1961, may be ignored.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in reply to inquiries by Deputy Norton regarding the time available to the Dáil for the consideration of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1961, that I made the statement on the 7th March last to the effect that the 1961 Census might be ignored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach also remember that when he was questioned as to the constitutionality of the 1959 Act he said that it was his opinion that it was still drafted in accordance with the Constitution?  He was proved wrong by the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach on what legal authority he gave that decision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will appreciate the position in which this Parliament will be placed if another court declares the new Bill unconstitutional. To safeguard ourselves, would the Taoiseach say whether it is intended by him or by the President to test the constitutionality of the current Bill before the next general election comes around?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in reply to Deputy Donnellan, I think as reported in Volume 998, said something which related only to one view. Then he went on to give an entirely different view.  On what legal authority did he give that view to the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if in view of the proposal to build new headquarters for the Department of Social Welfare in Dublin he will indicate whether the policy of decentralisation of Government Departments is now abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.  The policy of the Government is to promote, generally, the decentralisation of Departments, according as opportunities present themselves and to such an extent as may be found practicable.  The decisions to transfer the Garda Síochána training depot to Templemore and a section of the Fisheries Division of the Department of Lands to Galway, were made in accordance with this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that in view of the fact that the Taoiseach has placed a contract for £1,100,000 for a Department of Social Welfare building to be erected at Haddington Road, <Col N="623" /> that no decentralisation of that Department will take place?</P>

      <P>District Medical Officers are part-time officers.  Their remuneration has been revised recently and the vast majority now have a salary of £900 a year proceeding to £1,250 a year.</P>
      <P>The duties of District Medical Officers are prescribed in detail in the Health (Duties of District Medical Officers) Order, 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary duty, as laid down by the Order, is to afford adequate medical care and advice at dispensaries, or elsewhere as may be required, to residents in their districts whose names are on the general medical services register, and to their dependants.  They are also required to be responsible <Col N="624" /> for the care in respect of motherhood of any woman in their districts whose name is on the general medical services register, as respects whom no medical practitioner has undertaken to provide such care.</P>
    <P>The Order prescribes that District Medical Officers shall attend punctually at dispensaries on the days, and during the hours, directed by the health authority, and at such other times as may be necessary for the proper discharge of their duties.  These officers are required to record their times of arrival and departure at the dispensary.  I am informed that the dispensary doctors in Limerick City are required to attend at the dispensary for one hour each week-day.</P>

      <P>Customs examination is an unavoidable inconvenience for travellers and, as might be expected, there are occasional complaints on the lines indicated by the Deputy.  Every such complaint is, of course, thoroughly investigated and only very rarely are the officials concerned found to have fallen short of the proper standards of courtesy and consideration.  In these cases suitable disciplinary action is taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the entire Cork staff of the Irish Life Assurance Company have had to resort to strike action since 29th March because of the refusal or failure of the management of the Company to accept or implement <Col N="625" /> a Recommendation (No. 1403) of the Labour Court in the case of a local employee, whose dismissal, following a brief period of illness, was the subject of a recent investigation by the Court at the Company's request; and what steps he has taken to ensure that the management of this State-controlled Company adheres to the normal conduct of good labour relations expected of other employers in accepting the findings of the Labour Court in disputes of this type.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what proportion of the shares of the Irish Life Assurance Company are held by him; and whether in view of his majority shareholding in the Company he will take steps to replace its present directors in view of its failure to conform to normal practice in regard to staff relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>Approximately 90 per cent. of the issued shares of the Irish Life Assurance Company are held by the Minister.</P>
      <P>As regards the other matters raised in the questions, staff relations are connected with the day-to-day administration of the Company in which I do not intervene.  I understand, however, that a further conference is being arranged between the parties involved in the dispute and should take place almost immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could give a simple answer to a simple question&mdash;how can he and the Government expect employers generally to accept the recommendations of the Labour Court when they, at the same time, permit State-controlled companies to disregard the recommendations of the Labour Court?  If that is not the policy of the Government, why do they not sack the directors of this company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the situation at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that the Labour Court made a recommendation in this case in favour <Col N="626" /> of the employees and that the Irish Assurance Company, a State-controlled body, decided that they would not implement the recommendation. My question is aimed at finding out what the Government policy is in such matters.  Are we to stand idly by and see State-controlled bodies adopt this policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the situation. The Labour Court issued a finding and some question arose on the interpretation of that decision.  A further conference has been arranged between the two parties to the dispute and it should take place very shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be no dispute about the interpretation of the findings unless there was ambiguity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I get it definitely from the Minister whether or not the Labour Court's recommendations were quite clear or did somebody in the Irish Assurance Company say that there was some ambiguity about them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <P>The answer to the first <Col N="628" /> part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative.  It has been agreed, following discussions with representatives of the civil service staffs under the machinery of conciliation and arbitration, to introduce legislation to allow payment of compassionate gratuities after seven years' service, instead of 15 years' service, as previously required. Amending legislation will be introduced this year.</P>

Following preliminary consideration of the proposals by the Government, they were examined together with other information submitted by the company by an Inter-Departmental Committee on which representatives of the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Finance, Local Government and my Department were represented.  The Committee met the representatives on a number of occasions and discussed their proposals fully with them.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee the Company were informed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on 9th March 1961, of the Government's decision on their proposals.</P>
      <P>In their reply the Government made it clear that they would require further information in regard to the practicabilities of the proposals before they could take any further steps.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Clohessy</b> asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will give an indication of the trend of jet-aircraft using Shannon Airport with particular reference to the number of flights and passengers; and if in view of the high landing charges at London Airport, and the acute congestion existing there, he will consider the advisability of encouraging air companies to utilise Shannon Airport as the final landing and departure location for trans-Atlantic flights with a ferry service of non-jet aircraft to Britain and Europe generally.</P>

      <P>Scheduled jet passenger services through Shannon Airport <Col N="631" /> were inaugurated in June, 1960, and from that date up to 31st March, 1961, there were 1,026 landings at the airport by jet aircraft and 4,331 landings by piston aircraft.  The total of 5,357 compares with a total of 6,925 by all piston aircraft in the corresponding period of the previous year.  As regards passengers, it is too soon to estimate with any accuracy, but the trend seems to be towards a reduction in transit passengers and an increase in terminal passengers.</P>
      <P>In the summer of 1960, three of the eight airlines providing passenger services through Shannon operated jet aircraft.  In the summer of 1961 all the eight companies will operate jet services through the airport.  The schedules indicate an overall increase of 19 per cent.  in trans-Atlantic landings for the summer of 1961 as compared with 1960.  It is not possible to forecast the number of landings by non-scheduled flights, which amounted to almost 40 per cent. of the airport's traffic in the year 1960.  The Government have provided at Shannon Airport facilities designed to encourage the maximum use of the airport by trans-Atlantic airlines.  These airlines evaluate very carefully the advantages to be gained by the use of the various airports available to them and their choice is also influenced, of course, by competitive factors.  Adequate connections to Britain and the Continent of Europe are already available through Shannon and Dublin.  One trans-Atlantic airline is, from the beginning of May, providing two trans-Atlantic flights a week terminating at Shannon and returning to the United States from there.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to increase general use of the airport and the increasing flow of air cargo now becoming available from the Industrial Estate should attract air companies to schedule further stops there.</P>

      <P>The general powers conferred on county councils by the Labourers Acts to erect houses are wide enough to enable them to consider the claims of small farmers.  Many county councils have provided houses for such persons.  The usual loan terms, including two-thirds State subsidy of loan charges over 50 years are available for the purpose.  Facilities available to persons including small farmers for the provision of their own houses include State grants of up <Col N="637" /> to £310 and supplementary grants payable by local authorities, advances under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts of up to 95% of the market value, and advances of from £100 to £200 from the Land Commission.  New houses erected with these facilities qualify for rates remission in the normal course.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;small farmer&rdquo; is not statutorily defined for the purposes of the Labourers Acts.  Housing schemes under these Acts are not designated exclusively for small farmers but houses provided by county councils for this class would normally be those erected on the specific application procedure. Between September, 1952 and January, 1961 over 40% of all rural houses built by county councils were provided under this procedure.</P>

      <i>Economic Growth in 1960</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In last year's Financial Statement I described 1959 as a year of progress and development.  The Economic Statistics issued last week show that this description can be applied with equal force to 1960.  The rate of growth of 3 per cent. in gross national product in real terms in 1959, itself contrasting favourably with an average annual rate of 1 per cent. over the previous decade, has been followed <Col N="652" /> by a rise estimated provisionally at 4 per cent. in 1960.  The progress achieved in 1960 confirms that the 1959 advance was not exceptional; indeed, the results for these first two years of the Programme for Economic Expansion, together with the indications for 1961, show that a progressive expansion of the economy has now got under way.</P>
      <P>Until recently for various reasons we made a poor showing by comparison with most other European nations.  This position was changed in 1959, when the increase in our real output, though not exceptional by European standards, was, at any rate, above that of the highly industrialised countries of France and Belgium.  The 1960 figures are likely to show that we have maintained this not too unfavourable position; we may, indeed, have moved up the scale a little.  While we have not yet reached the 5 per cent. annual rate of growth which has, on average, prevailed in the more advanced countries since the war, we are now near enough to this figure to strive for it with every hope of achievement.  This will require, amongst other things, greater saving for productive home investment. As pointed out in the report on Ireland recently published by the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, the necessary further growth of investment must not be hampered by an excessive rate of expansion of consumption if overall balance is to be maintained.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Capital Formation and Savings</i>
      </P>
      <P>Gross fixed capital formation increased from £85 million in 1959 to £92 million in 1960, mainly because of increased investment in machinery and equipment.  There had been a big rise in stocks in 1959, estimated at £21 million, of which £11 million was in respect of a growth in livestock numbers.  Stocks rose by £6 million in 1960, the increase being entirely in industry and distribution as there was actually a slight fall in livestock on farms.  Savings last year were roughly the same as in 1959 but, as stocks rose much less, monetary savings were substantially higher.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Balance of Payments</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> Not alone was the increase in real output higher last year but the balance of payments deficit of £8.7 million in 1959 was reduced to less than £1 million, despite a deterioration of about 2 per cent. in the terms of trade.  Thus, taking the period as a whole, there has been equilibrium in our external payments during the past four years, whereas from the end of the war until 1956 there was an unrelieved series of deficits.</P>
    <P>The most significant element in last year's improvement in the balance of payments was the rise of £22 million or 17 per cent. in exports.  This enabled our external accounts to be balanced at a higher level of activity. Imports rose also but not to the same extent as exports.  They increased by £14 million or 6½ per cent., the increase consisting in the main of raw materials and goods for further production. Industrial goods made the main contribution to the rise in exports, increases in exports of metals, textiles, clothing and petroleum products being noteworthy.  A number of the new industries established in recent years helped in this expansion.  The major part, however, was played by older firms, built up initially with the help of protection on the home market and in many cases using domestic raw materials.  Those manufacturers who have shown enterprise and initiative in developing an export trade deserve every commendation.  We look forward to more of our industrialists following their example.</P>
    <P>Agricultural exports contributed to the improvement in the balance of payments in 1960, although not quite to the same extent as industrial goods. The decline in live cattle exports which had been a feature of 1959 was reversed in the second half of 1960, and, despite lower prices, total exports of live cattle for the year amounted to £33.6 million or £3.6 million more than in 1959.  A marked shift in exports took place from store to fat cattle, an increase of £9.4 million in fat cattle being accompanied by a decline of £5.8 million in stores. Exports of carcase and tinned beef increased by £2.8 million to £15.6 million, while butter, bacon, mutton <Col N="654" /> and lamb also showed substantial rises.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Basis for Export Expansion</i>
    </P>
    <P>A broader and stronger export thrust is the chief means of achieving greater national prosperity and diminished emigration.  In a world in which tariff barriers are being lowered and competition is becoming keener&mdash;not less for those who are for the time being outside the new trade groupings than for those within them&mdash;producers and exporters cannot afford to neglect any aids to increased efficiency.  Wider use of the technical assistance and other facilities provided by the Government is essential and the most careful attention should be given to improvements in methods and techniques both of production and marketing.  In some industries structural change, ranging from rationalisation and specialisation to amalgamation, may be called for as, perhaps, a necessary means of ensuring progress in the years ahead.  The OEEC report on Ireland to which I have referred emphasises the importance of maintaining the competitiveness of our industries.  It states that &ldquo;as the most dynamic sectors of Irish industry in recent years have been oriented towards production for export, it is important to maintain their rate of growth.  To achieve this over a long period Irish goods will have to be competitive in price and quality, in particular as tariffs are being progressively reduced in Europe in the framework of the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Community&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>International Trade Relations</i>
    </P>
    <P>In considering the prospects for the continuing expansion of our exports, particularly industrial exports, we must have regard to the effect on our position in the British market of the establishment of the EFTA and of any eventual coming together of the EFTA and the EEC.  Britain's membership of the EFTA entails the gradual elimination of the tariff advantages on industrial products which we enjoy in the British market as against exporters in the EFTA countries.  This process has been accelerated by the recent decision to bring forward from 1st <Col N="655" /> January, 1962, to 1st July, 1961, the second tariff reduction in the EFTA, the effect of which is to bring to 30 per cent. the internal tariff reductions in that group.  While the programme of tariff reductions in the EFTA does not extend to agricultural products, there is provision in the Stockholm Convention for bilateral agreements covering trade in such products between member countries.</P>
    <P>Britain has not yet undertaken any tariff reductions in favour of the EEC countries and we still continue to enjoy in the British market our original preferences over those countries.  This position may not continue unchanged. It is to be expected that there will be an exchange of tariff concessions between Britain and the other EFTA countries, on the one hand, and the EEC countries on the other, in the forthcoming general round of tariff negotiations between the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  Secondly, we must face the possibility that sooner or later some settlement may be reached involving the progressive elimination of the British tariffs on imports from the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>It will be realised, therefore, that our exporters of industrial goods may expect to face much greater competition in the British market in future. They have shown in recent years that they can compete successfully with British manufacturers.  They must now prepare for greater competition in the British market from exports of EFTA and eventually of EEC countries. Developments in relation to trade in agricultural products are more difficult to predict because the common agricultural policy of the EEC has not yet been settled, nor is any definite view possible of the position of agriculture in whatever general arrangement may eventually be made in Europe.  While the Government are watching developments closely with a view to securing favourable terms for the participation of Ireland in any such arrangement, there can be no doubt but that in Europe, as elsewhere, we shall have to adapt ourselves to trading conditions which will be <Col N="656" /> shaped largely by circumstances outside our control.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of foreign trade, I may perhaps refer to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which is being constituted out of the OEEC.  The aims of the new Organisation are to promote economic growth and employment and expand trade.  It is the hope of all member countries that the new Organisation will continue the excellent work done by the OEEC and we shall endeavour to make a worthwhile contribution to its success.</P>
    <P>GATT is an international body which is assuming increasing importance in the field of trade.  The Government informed the Contracting Parties last August that they wished to discuss the terms on which we might accede to the General Agreement.  Preliminary discussions took place last November and arrangements were made for the continuance of these discussions during the forthcoming round of tariff negotiations.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industrial Production, Employment and Earnings</i>
    </P>
    <P>To turn now from external trade to other aspects of the economy, we find the outstanding feature of 1960 was the increase in industrial production. The output of manufacturing industries rose by 7 per cent in that year. This rise in production is attributable to an increase in numbers at work, to a rise in output per person engaged, as well as to the coming into being of such concerns as the oil refinery with high net output per worker.  The number of persons at work in transportable goods industries in the December quarter of 1960 was 162,100 or 4,700 more than a year earlier and was the highest yet recorded.  The increase in employment was not commensurate with the rise in output, part of which seems to have been due to the taking up of slack in industry. The volume of output per worker in manufacturing industries rose by 4½ per cent in 1960 as compared with 3½ per cent in 1959.  This gain has been reflected in the higher real earnings of workers.  Average weekly earnings <Col N="657" /> in the December quarter of 1960 were 7 per cent above the figures for the last quarter of 1959, in contrast to a rise of less than 3 per cent in the consumer price index over the period.  As it is likely that most of the slack has now been taken up, future comparable rises in output are likely to require the employment of proportionately more workers and may not provide so much room for advances in real wages.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Unemployment and Emigration</i>
    </P>
    <P>Along with the increase in employment, there has been a substantial fall in unemployment.  Numbers on the live register of unemployed in recent weeks have been 10,000 to 11,000 below the figures for corresponding dates last year.  Critics have sought to belittle the economic advance that has been made by pointing to the high level of emigration.  It is unfortunately true that far too many of our people are still going abroad, for economic or other reasons.  When the results of the 1961 census are available, we are likely to find that emigration was heavy in the past five years.  This should not, however, cause us to think that the problem is insoluble and that the economic and social policies of successive Governments, directed towards providing an acceptable livelihood in Ireland for more of our people, have been a failure.  Emigration figures cannot be looked at in isolation; they must be associated with the unemployment returns, since both are, to a large extent, aspects of the same problem. If we take the last four years, we find that the number on the live register in February, 1961, was over 30,000 less than in February, 1957.  Many new jobs have been provided and new industries have been established which will give more employment in the near future.  Last year for the first time since 1954 the fall in agricultural employment was fully offset by a rise in employment elsewhere.  This year should see a substantial rise in industrial employment; as I have mentioned, even at the same rate of expansion of output as in 1960, it is likely that the increase in employment will be greater. It is gratifying to know that we have again reached stability in the working <Col N="658" /> population.  Let us hope that the favourable trend may continue without interruption until the population as a whole shows an increase.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agricultural Production and Incomes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The improvement in national output in recent years has been widely shared; wage and salary earners generally have made considerable gains.  While the income of farmers is rising, they have not fared as well as other sectors, and this despite the special emphasis given to agriculture in the Programme for Economic Expansion and the raising of State aid to agriculture over the past few years from £20 million to £25 million a year.  There are two main reasons for the slow rate of growth in the agricultural sphere.  In the first place, special factors have operated to hamper expansion.  For three years in succession, farmers have suffered setbacks caused by unfavourable weather conditions.  Added to this are the temporary difficulties arising out of the elimination of bovine tuberculosis in Britain and the measures necessary to eradicate it here.  Secondly, because of the general conditions affecting agricultural development, results as immediate as those which have been evident in industry cannot reasonably be expected from the Programme for Economic Expansion. There are many good signs, including the increased use of fertilisers, the construction of many new farm buildings and silos, the larger herds of cattle and sheep than in 1957, the rise in pig numbers, the increased use of credit, and the establishment of new industries to process agricultural produce.  With this improvement in potential and with the present volume of State assistance, a substantial expansion of output should be realised.</P>
    <P>In 1960 there was a recovery in live cattle exports, a larger export of beef, greater production of milk and increased output of pigs.  The 6 per cent. increase in net output, taken by itself, raised incomes by £5 million as compared with 1959.  A further £11 million increase in cash incomes was realised because, in contrast with 1959 when some of the output of livestock was retained as an addition to herds, in 1960 the higher total production of <Col N="659" /> livestock was fully disposed of.  Total cash income of farmers, therefore, was actually £16 million greater in 1960 than in 1959.  Cattle stocks are still high&mdash;they were reduced last year by only £½ million&mdash;and, as the export demand for cattle and beef is good, an appreciable rise in agricultural income may be expected in 1961, given normal harvesting conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prospects for</i> 1961</P>
    <P>We may now turn for a few moments to the more general prospects for 1961. The indications of buoyancy in the economy at present suggest a further substantial advance this year provided there is no serious international setback. Commentators appear to be in general agreement that this is now unlikely, since both the United States and British economies are showing signs of recovery and, unless something untoward happens, will move forward in 1961.  All going well, national production should continue to increase at a high rate this year.  On external account there is every likelihood that both agricultural exports, in particular cattle and meat, for which good markets exist at the moment, and industrial exports will continue to expand. However, imports will probably rise noticeably also, partly because of the bad grain harvest last year and partly because of the demand for equipment and raw materials for our expanding factories.  It is possible that a small deficit may emerge but this need not cause concern.  Finally, employment and incomes should rise in line with the increase in production.  On the whole, we may look forward to another year of progress.</P>
    <P Just="Center">II. CURRENT BUDGET, 1960-61</P>
    <P>
      <i>Outturn</i> 1960-61</P>
    <P>There was a deficit last year of £730,000.  Expenditure on the Central Fund Services was exactly in line with the budget estimate.  As revenue was £1¾ million above the forecast, a shortfall of even £¾ million on the Supply Services would have made good the allowance of £2½ million for errors of estimation. Savings on various services were substantial. <Col N="660" /> They were more than sufficient to meet all supplementary requirements but not enough to yield the net saving of £¾ million needed to produce a balanced budget.  The deficit might, indeed, be attributed to a single unexpected item&mdash;the payment of £830,000 to mitigate the effect of the bad wheat harvest.</P>
    <P>Looking back over the last three years, however, there is no cause for disappointment.  The surpluses of 1959 and 1960 outweigh the deficit of 1961. I need not reproach myself for the deficit of 1957-58.  The Government entered office in March, 1957, and had to take the financial and economic situation very much as they found it. The measures taken in 1957 to bring revenue and expenditure into line and to revive economic activity could not be fully effective at once.  The record of the three years which followed is, however, sufficient testimony to the success with which not merely financial balance but economic expansion have been achieved.</P>
    <P>On the financial side, the cause for satisfaction is all the greater because in the past three years the Exchequer has given reliefs in direct taxation&mdash; apart altogether from export tax reliefs&mdash;which now cost about £3 million a year.  Though some indirect taxes have been increased, the reductions have been more significant and the net effect has been a relief of some £1½ million a year in indirect taxation.  In all, therefore, the taxation reliefs of the last three years involve an annual revenue loss of over £4 million.  During these same three years significant improvements have been made in social welfare and other services and remuneration generally has been increased.  The fact that the budget has been balanced has also meant that over the three years a total sum of £26 million has been effectively allocated from revenue to the redemption of public debt.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Expenditure and Taxation Levels</i>
    </P>
    <P>I would like to add a few words on the level of State expenditure and taxation in relation to national production and to the position in other countries. State expenditure chargeable against <Col N="661" /> revenue rose by 8½ per cent. in the last three years whereas the value of national production increased by 12½ per cent.  The rise in State outlay has, therefore, been more than matched by the rise in national production. Exchequer tax receipts, excluding road tax which is applied directly for the benefit of road users, have remained consistently at between 16 and 17 per cent of national production over the last three years.  The proportion of gross national product at market prices taken by taxation of all kinds in Ireland is about 23 per cent.  An article in the current issue of the review published by the British National Institute of Economic and Social Research compares the tax burden in sixteen Western European countries and four others, the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan.  It shows that in only five of these countries was the proportion of gross national product taken by central and local government taxation lower than it is in Ireland.</P>
    <P Just="Center">III.  CAPITAL BUDGET, 1960-61</P>
    <P>Details of capital expenditure last year are given in the Tables that have been circulated to Deputies.  Public capital investment, at a total of £50½ million was short of the budget estimate of £54½ million.  The estimation as a whole can, however, be considered reasonably close in view of the magnitude of the sums involved and the special difficulty of predicting accurately the course of capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The direction of public investment as far as possible into productive channels, combined with the tax incentives given in recent years, is playing a large part in raising national production. This should be borne in mind when the growth in national debt and in debt service charges is being considered. In fact, the net charges in respect of the public debt have remained a fairly constant two to three per cent of gross national product in recent years.  It is not unreasonable to expect that in the years ahead that ratio may decrease because of an accelerated advance in national output. To this advance, public capital expenditure, not only on directly remunerative <Col N="662" /> projects but also on drainage, improvement of farm buildings and water supplies and other less immediately productive services, will, I believe, make a significant contribution. Needless to say, capital expenditure will continue to be most carefully scrutinised so that, particularly at this period of high interest rates, no increase will occur in the national debt which is not fully justifiable as contributing to economic and social progress.</P>
    <P Just="Center">IV.  CAPITAL BUDGET, 1961-62</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure is expected to reach £55.3 million this year.  Table VI of the Financial Tables classifies the proposed expenditure under the headings in the Programme for Economic Expansion.  It will be observed that all the specific headings, except transport, show increases over last year.  These increases total £8.6 million.  The provision for Agriculture (including Agricultural Credit) has reached a new peak.  For the three years 1959-60 to 1961-62 the total comes to almost £36 million, which is more than double the corresponding expenditure in the previous three years. When account is taken of the various other provisions, such as rates relief, fertiliser subsidies, price supports and advisory services, State aid to Agriculture now exceeds £25 million a year.</P>
    <P>For Industry, in the form of grants and credit, there is also an increased allocation as well as an extra £650,000 for share capital for Irish Steel Holdings. This major development is progressing rapidly and the firm plans a total capital expenditure of £1¾ million this year.</P>
    <P>Industrial development has recently made remarkable strides.  In 1960, 45 firms of more than £10,000 capital commenced production or extended their activities.  The aggregate capital involved was some £8 million, and employment potential is estimated at 5,000-7,000.  At the end of 1960, there were 30 new factories being built, involving a total capital investment of about £13 million with an employment potential of some 5,000 people.  The <Col N="663" /> extent of foreign participation proves that the taxation, grant and other incentives offered are producing the desired effect&mdash;an influx of foreign capital and technical competence which will play a helpful part in Ireland's industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure on tourism will be more than doubled this year.  This third main sector of the economy has also benefited from the general improvement in economic conditions.  I am glad to say that here again the incentives granted have resulted in an unprecedented rate of hotel building, modernisation and conversion.</P>
    <P>An additional £900,000 is being devoted to fuel and power development. The Electricity Supply Board has found it necessary to expand its generating plant because of an upsurge in demand due to industrial development and higher domestic consumption.</P>
    <P>The steadily increasing demand for telephones which is reflected in the increased provision under that heading is another pointer to industrial and commercial development and to rising standards of living.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to provide more capital for Radio Éireann for the new television service.  The commencement of this service during the year will, as Deputies are already aware, involve the introduction of a licence fee.</P>
    <P>The provision of £3.24 million for ports, harbours and airports shows an increase of £1 million.  The total provision for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited is £1.33 million, of which almost one-half is for housing of managerial and industrial personnel of new industries at the airport.  This brings the provision for housing generally to £10 million, which is £1 million more than was spent last year.  Other building and construction work, including schools, sanitary service, and hospitals, shows an increase of just over £1 million. While on the subject of building works, I should mention the new Building Agency which has been set up to assist in providing houses for industrial staffs and certain public officials and <Col N="664" /> also the programmes recently approved by the Government for the provision of accommodation for Government staffs at present unsuitably housed and for Garda Stations.  In carrying out these programmes regard will be had to the desirability of maintaining a stable level of activity in the building industry.  It is important to avoid the creation of peaks of intense activity which might be followed by slack periods for many workers.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant features of recent years is the extent to which it has been possible to reshape the public capital programme.  In 1957-58, some 40 per cent. of public capital expenditure was devoted to building and construction&mdash;mainly to housing. For the current year the corresponding figure is 27 per cent.  By contrast, less than 14 per cent. of the public capital programme was devoted to agriculture, forestry and fishing in 1957-58; this year the figure will exceed 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>So far I have been dealing with the principal increases in expenditure. Apart from a negligible reduction of £60,000 under the &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo; heading, only Transport shows a decrease compared with last year.  This is due to the fact that two of the three undertakings which are grouped together under this head require less money.  The air companies need about £4¼ million less while the requirements of C.I.E. have been reduced by £½ million.  The sharp decrease in the needs of the air companies is not unexpected because, as I explained to Deputies last year, the provision in 1960-61 contained two exceptional items: £4¾ million to complete the purchase of transatlantic jet aircraft and £655,000 to acquire shares in Aer Lingus from British European Airways. A large part of the fall in estimated capital expenditure of C.I.E. is due to the fact that last year's expenditure was inflated by a carryover from 1959-60.  The third undertaking for which provision is made under the heading &ldquo;Transport&rdquo; is Irish Shipping Limited, which requires an extra £850,000 to acquire new tonnage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> A substantial volume of public investment is planned for 1961-62 but not, I believe, more than national savings can be relied upon to finance. Intelligent investment, at the highest sustainable level, is a necessary condition of sound and rapid national progress.</P>
    <P Just="Center">V.  FINANCING OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>The resources which were availed of by the Exchequer to meet capital requirements in 1960-61 are set out in Table III of the Financial Tables. Table V shows the resources expected to be available towards the capital requirements of the Exchequer this year.</P>
    <P>Last year's National Loan brought in £14.8 million, which, as in the previous year, was the largest single contribution towards the financing of the capital programme.  The Loan was for £15 million nominal of which £3 million was reserved for certain life assurance offices and for departmental funds under my control.  The balance of £12 million which was available to the public was over-subscribed by more than £3 million.  An exceptionally large number of small investors supported the Loan and this naturally affected the net investment in the savings banks, savings certificates and prize bonds.  The net receipt of £6½ million from these sources was, however, reasonably satisfactory.</P>
    <P>From public issues of Exchequer Bills an additional sum of nearly £4 million was raised.  I feel sure that this attractive form of short-term investment will receive growing support.</P>
    <P>Departmental Funds contributed £10.6 million to the financing of the capital programme as compared with the budget estimate of £8 million. There was a heavy public demand on the Stock Exchange for Irish Government securities and Departmental Funds made large sales from their portfolios.  The financing of our capital requirements was completed by borrowing £3 million on Bills from the commercial banks.</P>
    <P>This year's capital programme is bigger than last year's and, to enable <Col N="666" /> it to be carried out, greater support from the community will be needed. It is essential that we provide from our own resources, if at all possible, the finance required for national development. The level of savings is still rather low here by the standards of progressive countries and an early and sustained expansion is desirable.</P>
    <P>The Savings Committee continues to do very useful work in the promotion of savings.  Its energies are directed principally to the stimulation of small savings through the savings banks and savings certificates and, in particular, to the organisation of savings groups in factories and offices.  The nation's thanks are due to the members of the Committee for the voluntary help so generously given.</P>
    <P>The current issue of savings certificates, which has proved so attractive, is now on sale for five years, and there are many who already hold the maximum permitted number of certificates. As a general incentive to a higher level of investment in savings certificates, I have decided to raise the limit on the maximum holding of any individuals from 1,000 to 1,250 one pound units.</P>
    <P>On 1st December next the 3¼% National Security Loan, 1956-61, is due for redemption.  Some £5 million is outstanding.  To facilitate holders of this stock who may wish to reinvest, I propose to make a conversion offer in conjunction with a National Loan later in the year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">VI.  CURRENT BUDGET, 1961-62 &mdash;INTRODUCTION</P>
    <P>Before I come to the details of the current budget for 1961-62, I have a few general observations to make.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fiscal Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>First, it is clear from the survey of the economic position and prospects that, fortunately, it is not necessary to use the Budget to curb excessive consumer spending or other adverse forces. The aim must rather be, while continuing to avoid inflation, to increase, if possible, the momentum of our economic advance.  It is, of course, also necessary to keep our finances in good order so that, while still paying our <Col N="667" /> way, we may be enabled by revenue buoyancy resulting from increasing prosperity, to reduce rates of taxation. The Programme for Economic Expansion indicated that fiscal policy would be guided primarily by the need to encourage production and saving and, in particular, that the aim of the Government was to create conditions permitting as soon as possible of a reduction in direct taxation.  Such reductions were made in the Budgets of 1959 and 1960.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it is appropriate to refer to the various recommendations of the Commission on Income Taxation.  The first report of the Commission, which recommended the introduction of a Pay As You Earn scheme, has already been the subject of legislation.  I may say that the scheme is working well and I would like to express my appreciation of the co-operation and goodwill which were forthcoming from employers and employees alike.  Three further reports have since been published. The views of the Government on the recommendations they contain require to be set out in greater detail than is possible within the compass of a Financial Statement.  For that reason a White Paper has been prepared which deals not only with the outstanding published recommendations of the Commission but also with death duties and some other aspects of direct taxation.  The White Paper is being issued this evening and copies will be circulated when I conclude.</P>
    <P>Since the White Paper went to press I received two further reports from the Commission, one relating to tax simplification and the other to co-operative societies.  I have not had an opportunity yet of studying these reports.  They are being sent for printing and will be published in due course.</P>
    <P>I propose, at this point, to indicate very briefly the conclusions set out in the White Paper on the second, third and fourth reports of the Commission:</P>
    <P>With regard to the second report&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  The principle of &ldquo;one taxpayer, one charge&rdquo; is accepted. Electronic equipment which the <Col N="668" /> Revenue Commissioners expect to be delivered about September, 1963, will enable the new system to be brought into operation for the income tax year 1964-65.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The recommendation that a separate return should not be required for surtax purposes is accepted.  Effect will be given to this in the Finance Bill and the new system will operate from 1962-63.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The principle that the settlement of a taxpayer's liability to income tax and surtax should be effected in the same office and as a single operation is accepted.  Work on surtax will be decentralised to local income tax offices next year.</P>
    <P>(iv)  It is not proposed to alter the basis of assessment of income from residential and other property let for non-business purposes before control under the Rent Restrictions Acts is substantially relaxed or abolished.</P>
    <P>(v)  The recommendation that Schedule A tax be not charged on owner occupied residences of a valuation not exceeding £30 has not been adopted for reasons explained in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>On the third report, though the principle of taxing spending rather than earning and saving is re-affirmed, it is considered that the introduction of a purchase tax, as recommended by the majority of the Commission, at rates sufficient to make good the revenue loss involved in a reduction of income tax by 2s. in the £, would not be desirable on a general view of the social and economic implications.</P>
    <P>As regards the fourth report, the Government have decided not to change the present method of taxing the ordinary farmer.</P>
    <P>The White Paper mentions my interest in two matters, on which I shall consider the views of the Commission, namely, whether it would be desirable to alter the basis of income taxation by separating the taxation of company profits from the taxation of personal incomes and whether profits taxation should be placed on a current year basis.  It also reports that the Revenue Commissioners have made <Col N="669" /> considerable progress with the work on consolidation of income tax legislation but that this will not stand in the way of further reform or simplification.</P>
    <P>On death duties, the White Paper describes the rates, incidence, yield and cost of collection of the duties, the various arguments for and against their retention and the principal reliefs available. The policy recorded in the White Paper is that the existing system of death duties should, in principle, be maintained subject to such modification as may be necessary from time to time on social, fiscal or economic grounds.</P>
    <P>It is also reported in the White Paper that the Revenue Commissioners are preparing a comprehensive publication containing all the statutory provisions relating to stamp duty.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pay, Organisation and Recruitment</i>
    </P>
    <P>A third general matter to which I wish to refer is the importance of remuneration as a constituent of public expenditure and the consequent necessity for careful control over personnel numbers and costs.  Remuneration of public servants, teachers, Army and Garda Síochána is estimated to exceed £40 million this year, accounting for more than a quarter of total outlay.</P>
    <P>As regards costs, it must, of course, be borne in mind that rates of pay are for the most part fixed by conciliation and arbitration machinery and that a significant influence is exercised by the level of pay in outside employment.  Public service remuneration follows, rather than sets the headline for, pay trends generally.</P>
    <P>Numbers are kept under strict review but I am forced to the view that expectations of large reductions are unrealistic.  When there is a public demand for the speeding up of bovine tuberculosis eradication and the extension of the telephone system and other services, it is inevitable that staff numbers will tend to increase.  However, Deputies may be assured that, even if increases under certain heads are unavoidable, a constant effort is being made to keep costs of administration to the minimum consistent with efficient service to the public.  Special attention <Col N="670" /> is being given to the introduction of mechanisation where it is feasible and economical.  An electronic calculator is already in operation in the Post Office Savings Bank and plans are well advanced for the acquisition by the Revenue Commissioners of the electronic equipment to which I referred in dealing with the reports of the Income Taxation Commission.  Apart from mechanisation, the services of outside industrial consultants are retained for certain specialised investigations, such as the re-organisation of the Central Engineering Workshop in the Office of Public Works.  Organisation and methods studies proceed continuously in all Departments.  Training courses are being conducted to keep officers abreast of developments and to stimulate further advances.</P>
    <P>The re-organisation of certain general service grades, to which I referred in last year's Financial Statement, was put into operation on 1st July, 1960.  The grades are those of staff officer, clerical officer, shorthand-typist, typist and writing assistant and the re-organisation has simplified the staffing structure in this large sector of the service.  The scheme was extended to analogous departmental grades in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners on the 1st January, 1961.  The changes being made, although they are extensive, are gradual and their effect will be assessed at the end of a four-year term.</P>
    <P>The scheme foreshadowed in my speech last year for sending some of the leading candidates at the open executive officer competition to attend nominated University courses at State expense was put into effect at the last competition.  Five out of the first ten candidates at the written competition were selected as a result of interview by the Civil Service Commission and are now attending first-year courses in Dublin, Cork and Galway.</P>
    <P>The changes designed to make the administrative officer grade more attractive were followed by a welcome increase in the number of candidates. While the last examination did not produce enough qualified candidates to meet our full requirements, keener <Col N="671" /> competition was secured.  The attractions of this grade are now considerable and I feel sure that increasing numbers of qualified candidates will be interested in this opening to a career in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P Just="Center">VII. CURRENT BUDGET, 1961-62&mdash; DETAIL</P>
    <P>The White Paper of Receipts and Expenditure shows that current expenditure, as compared with last year, is up by £4.8 million.  Of this increase, Supply Services are responsible for £2.3 million and Central Fund Services, including the Road Fund, for the balance.  The main factors in the increase in Supply Services were explained in the context of the Vote on Account.  Service of debt is, as usual, the principal cause of the increase in Central Fund Services.  The buoyancy of revenue resulting from the growth of national output is, however, expected not merely to cover fully the increase in current expenditure but also to narrow almost to vanishing point the deficit which appeared last year.  Taxes on incomes and profits make the main contribution to the revenue increase.</P>
    <P>While the deficit, on the White Paper figures, is a mere £210,000, this is not the end but only the starting-point of my budgetary scheme.  I consider it necessary and desirable to do four things in particular in this budget: first, to ensure that social welfare beneficiaries share in the improvement in national income; second, to give greater help to farmers to increase production on an economic basis; third, to make an appropriate provision against the contingency of Supplementary Estimates; and, fourth, to lighten the burden of direct personal taxation as an incentive to earning and saving.  So that sound budgeting may continue, all this cannot be done without some increase in indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>The benefits available under social insurance have been improved and extended and a new contributory old <Col N="672" /> age pensions scheme was introduced last January.  As regards social assistance, old age and blind pensions have been increased by a total of 4/6d. a week in the period since 1957 while in the case of unemployment assistance the weekly rate for a person with an adult and two child dependants has been increased by 9/6d.  In the same period a more liberal approach has been adopted in relation to child dependants in social welfare schemes generally by the extension of payments to cover all children and not merely the first two.  It is now proposed to increase as from 1 August, 1961, the rates of non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions by a further 1/6d. a week.  The personal rate of unemployment assistance and the allowance for an adult dependant in both urban and rural areas will also be increased by 1/6d. a week.  In line with these increases the married persons' allowance in the old age pensions contributory scheme will be increased by the same amount.</P>
    <P>The position of social assistance recipients with dependent children deserves some special recognition and, accordingly, it is proposed to increase the child dependant allowance payable under the unemployment assistance and widows' (non-contributory) pensions schemes by 1/- each for the first and second child and by 1/6d. for the third and each subsequent child.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare also proposes to introduce shortly legislation providing for an easing of the means conditions in regard to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The cost of the foregoing proposals will be £600,000 this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmers</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to allocate an additional £825,000 for assistance to agriculture, of which £600,000 will be a charge against this year's revenue.  The original estimate contains a provision of £1 million for the marketing of dairy produce.  As milk production so far this year is at a high level and the export price for butter is depressed, I consider it a necessary precaution to increase the provision in the Estimate by £300,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> Although ground limestone is very cheap there has been a falling off in its use which is difficult to understand and disturbing in its implications.  The use of lime is vital if the full benefit is to be obtained from the application of phosphates.  As the reduction in the subsidy on transport has been stated to be the main factor in the decline in purchases of ground limestone, I am providing an additional £200,000 towards transport charges.</P>
    <P>As a further incentive to the greater use of fertilisers, the subsidy on potash is being increased by £1 a ton.  This will cost an additional £100,000 this year.</P>
    <P>It is intended also to increase by about 50 per cent. &mdash;at an estimated cost of £225,000&mdash;the grants for the erection of cow byres and for the reconstruction and repair of farm buildings generally.  Grants for piggeries were recently increased and are not, therefore, affected by this proposal.  It is hoped that growing advantage will be taken of these aids to increased production, under improved conditions, of livestock and livestock products.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of encouraging greater and more economic production, the Government consider that the most beneficial thing to do for farmers generally with the finance available in this Budget is to allocate extra money for limestone, potash and farm buildings.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Provision for Other Supplementary Estimates</i>
    </P>
    <P>While I do not expect that Supplementary Estimates on current account will arise this year to the same extent as last year, I consider it would be imprudent not to make a sizeable provision against the probability that some supplementaries will be unavoidable. I am, therefore, including £1 million for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The additions to current expenditure which I have proposed under the three heads of Social Welfare, Farmers, and other Supplementary Estimates amount to £2.2 million and increase the deficit to £2.41 million.  This might be eliminated by a deduction of £2½ million for errors of estimation but, <Col N="674" /> while there would then be a balance, the fourth desideratum I mentioned earlier could not be realised and any idea of reliefs and adjustments would have to be abandoned.  Some additional revenue is, therefore, needed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tobacco</i>
    </P>
    <P>The smallest increase in indirect taxation which will give a worthwhile sum without undue hardship is an extra penny on the packet of twenty standard size cigarettes.  I propose, therefore, to increase the main rate of customs duty on leaf tobacco by 1/9d. a pound, with corresponding increases in the other rates of duty.  For pipe tobacco the increase in the duty element will be slightly over 1d. an ounce except in the case of hard-pressed tobacco where an adjustment in the rebate will limit the rise in the duty element to 1d. an ounce.  The increase in tobacco duty is expected to yield £930,000 this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Adjustment for Errors of Estimation</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am encouraged both by the good performance of income tax last year and by the present rate of growth of national income to hope that I would not be taking an undue risk in raising the allowance for errors of estimation this year to £3 million, particularly as I intend to apply this extra £½ million towards stimulating individual enterprise and production.  The total sum available for reliefs is, therefore, £1.52 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Tax, Surtax and Corporation Profits Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>Much has been done already to reduce the incidence of taxation on industrial and commercial profits.  All the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Taxation on Industry have been implemented.  In addition, the standard rate of income tax has been reduced.  Further tax benefits have been granted for exports of manufactured goods, for production of minerals and for export industries set up in the Shannon Airport area.  The encouragement which companies receive to increase their exports could not be greater since it is a 100 per cent tax exemption.  Where taxation does fall on company profits, it is not high by European standards.  The total cost of the reliefs mentioned now runs into <Col N="675" /> several millions and, so far as they are not already being passed on to the investors in our industries, they will ultimately emerge as a benefit to them. These reliefs are also helping to make more capital for expansion available to industry both by reducing the amount of taxation on retained profits and by enabling more attractive prospects to be held out to investors. Capital for industrial expansion is further assured through the operations of An Foras Tionscal, the Industrial Credit Company and other agencies.</P>
    <P>In reviewing direct taxation, therefore, it is reasonable to adopt the line that this year the main advantage from any reliefs I can provide should flow to individuals.  I have stressed in a previous Financial Statement the importance of the human factor in relation to the development of the economy, and the desirability of encouraging not merely those exercising directive and managerial functions but workers generally to give of their best in raising the level of production.  I am also conscious of the fact that one of the principal causes contributing to the buoyancy of the revenue in 1960-61 was the successful launching of Pay As You Earn.  It seems but just that some of the fruit of this scheme should go to the individual taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In 1959 the rate of income tax was reduced from 7/6d. to 7/- in the £. I propose to lower it further this year by 8d. to 6/4d. in the £, a lower rate than has obtained for over twenty years.  This reduction will mean that, where tax deductions under P.A.Y.E. were made at 5/3d. in the £ for 1960-61, a new rate of 4/9d in the £ will apply for 1961-62.  To allow time for reprinting of the ready reckoners for employers, deductions will continue at the old rate until 15 May, 1961.  On the first pay day after that date tax liabilities will be adjusted on the tax deduction cards and the new rate will be given effect as from 6 April, 1961.</P>
    <P>As I propose to provide that corporation profits tax paid will no longer be admitted as a deduction for income tax purposes, relief so far as <Col N="676" /> companies are concerned will not extend beyond those with profits of less than £52,500 a year.  Such companies represent, however, a very high proportion of the total number.  Small companies, i.e., those with profits of less than £2,500 a year and not, therefore, liable to corporation profits tax, will enjoy the full effect of the reduction in the rate of income tax. Companies with profits between £2,500 and £52,500 will get a gradually diminishing relief.  A company with profits of over £52,500 will bear an increase which is virtually insignificant&mdash;only £79 where the profits are £100,000 and £329 where the profits are £250,000.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer this year of the reduction in the income tax rate is £1,200,000.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to extend the relief for earned income but this year I cannot do more than raise the income limit to which this 25 per cent relief applies from £1,800 to £2,000.  This will cost £80,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>I also consider that a reduction in the number of surtax rates is desirable to simplify this tax and facilitate its eventual merger with income tax.  There are at present eight rates, ranging from 1/6d. in the £ on the first £1,000 of chargeable income to 8/6d. in the £ on chargeable income over £18,000.  I propose to reduce the number of rates to three and to make the charge 2/6d. in the £ on the first £2,000 of the chargeable income, 5/- in the £ on the next £3,000 of the chargeable income, and 7/6d. in the £ on the balance.  So that the simplification will not involve an increase in taxation for any individual, it is necessary to lift the starting point for surtax from £2,000 to £2,500.  These proposals will apply to surtax payable on 1 January, 1962, and will cost £100,000.</P>
    <P>I also propose to provide in the Finance Bill for the following further items in the field of income and profits taxation.  They can all be met within a total cost of £20,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare Contributions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Bill will contain provisions for allowing, as a deduction from taxable <Col N="677" /> income, the proportion of the contributions of employees under the Social Welfare Acts which is attributable to widow's pension, orphan's allowance and old age pension.  It will also provide that these benefits will be regarded as earned income for income tax purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dependent Relative Allowance</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under the law as it stands the dependent relative allowance is not granted where the annual income of the dependant exceeds £80.  If the income limit were maintained at this figure, claims for persons drawing the contributory old age pension of £2 per week which came into force on 6 January, 1961, would not be admissible.  I propose to raise the income limit for relief purposes to £110.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Housekeeper Allowance</i>
    </P>
    <P>A man separated from his wife and not maintaining her, who employs a housekeeper to look after his children, does not qualify, under existing law, either for the married allowance or the housekeeper allowance.  I propose to provide that housekeeper allowance will be granted where such a taxpayer qualifies for child allowance and requires the services of a housekeeper to care for the child.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mining Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>I shall also include a provision in the Finance Bill in fulfilment of the promise I made last year to extend to open-cast mining the mine development allowances which may be granted under Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1946.  The extension will cover expenditure incurred on or after 6 April, 1960, and will apply to the mining of all minerals scheduled to the Minerals Development Act, 1940.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice that a mining company might refrain from claiming development allowances under the 1946 Act during a period in which its profits were relieved from tax under legislation enacted in 1956 and, having saved up allowances in this way, claim them after the period of relief had expired.  It was never intended to provide a double benefit of this kind.  I propose to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> A financial resolution will be necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exports Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Finance Act, 1960, was designed to prevent abuse of the extensions under that Act of the tax reliefs on exports.  I propose, and this also requires a financial resolution, to make the section applicable to all claims for tax reliefs on exports.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Death Duties&mdash;Small Estates</i>
    </P>
    <P>When the exemption limit for estate duty was raised last year to £5,000, the former 1 per cent. and 2 per cent. rates of duty on small estates disappeared. The minimum rate became 3 per cent. applicable, as previously, to estates between £5,000 and £7,500, while estates between £7,500 and £10,000 attracted duty at 4 per cent. I propose to re-introduce rates of 1 per cent. and 2 per cent.  The new rate structure will be 1 per cent. on estates from £5,000 to £6,000, 2 per cent. on estates from £6,000 to £7,000, 3 per cent. on estates from £7,000 to £8,000, and 4 per cent., as at present, on estates from £8,000 to £10,000.  The rates for estates in excess of the latter figure will remain unchanged save for a reduction in the rates for large estates, to which I shall now refer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Large Estates</i>
    </P>
    <P>It has been argued that high rates of estate duty exert an adverse effect on the attitude of wealthy persons towards living here.  Indeed, the complete abolition of death duties has been advocated in order to attract wealthy foreigners.  Complete abolition is not a practicable proposition, as the White Paper on Direct Taxation explains, but it is possible to test the validity of the argument by seeing what will be the response to a reduction in the higher rates of duty.  If by this means, wealthy persons were encouraged to settle here in greater numbers, the benefits might well outweigh the loss of revenue.  They would spend their capital and enterprise would doubtless find outlets in this country, with a consequent increase in employment.  A useful additional incentive would also be given to well-to-do persons now <Col N="679" /> domiciled here to repatriate foreign assets.  Since a substantial reduction can be made in our highest rates of duty at comparatively little cost to the Exchequer, I have decided to lower to 40 per cent. the rates of estate duty applicable to estates exceeding £100,000, which at present range from 41 to 53 per cent.</P>
    <P>These reliefs will cost the Exchequer an estimated £45,000 this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Gifts to the State</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under existing law there is no general exemption from estate duty of gifts to the State.  Exemption is confined to gifts of chattels such as pictures, prints, books and manuscripts which appear to be of national, scientific or historic interest.  All property given to the State will be exempted by a section which I propose to include in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Gifts with Reservation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Gifts made within three years of the donor's death are, with certain exceptions, liable to estate duty.  Gifts made outside the three year period are also liable if the donor retains an interest in the property or if he obtains some benefit, continuing for his lifetime, connected with the gift.  For instance, if a father gives his farm to his son, retaining a right of residence and maintenance, the entire farm is liable to estate duty even if the father's death took place many years after the transfer.  The law as it now stands causes hardship where the recipient of the gift has been virtual owner of the entire property for a long period.  I propose to introduce relieving legislation under which, where the donor dies more than three years after making the gift, the charge to duty will be confined to the value of the benefit accruing to the recipient on the donor's death.  This principle will also be applied in relation to trusts ended more than three years before the life tenant's death where some benefit was reserved to the life tenant.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Avoidance&mdash;Gifts</i>
    </P>
    <P>Various tax avoidance schemes in relation to gifts <i>inter vivos,</i> as they are <Col N="680" /> called, have been devised.  For example, if short-dated securities are given as a gift and they are redeemed before the donor's death, the subject matter of the gift, namely the securities, then no longer exists.  The beneficiary has instead the redemption moneys which, not being the subject matter of the gift, are not at present liable to duty. I propose to bring in provisions to counter this and kindred tax avoidance devices.  The legislation will contain complementary provisions covering interests in settled property ended within three years of the life tenant's death.  One of the financial resolutions will relate to this proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Payment by Trustees</i>
    </P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Finance Act, 1941, was enacted to prevent tax avoidance by the termination of trusts prior to the death on which they would normally have ceased.  The section provides that, where the life tenant of settled property disposes of his interest three years or less before his death, the property remains liable to estate duty.  The trustees of settled property are responsible for the payment of estate duty but, in the case of settlements terminated in circumstances giving rise to a claim under Section 30 of the Finance Act, 1941, some doubt exists as to whether the last trustees are liable for payment of duty on foot of such a claim.  The Finance Bill will contain a section to remove this doubt.  A financial resolution will be necessary in this case also.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Wills Act,</i> 1837&mdash;<i>Relief</i></P>
    <P>The general rule under the Wills Act, 1837, is that a legacy fails if the legatee predeceases the testator.  An exception is made in the case of a legacy to a child of the testator who predeceases the testator but who leaves issue living at the testator's death.  It has been held that such a legacy is, to take the simplest example, liable to estate duty as part of the estate of the testator and also as part of the estate of the child who predeceased him.  I propose to bring in amending legislation to provide that duty will be levied only on the testator's estate as if the property were given directly to the living beneficiary.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Amendment of Aggregation Provisions</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> Finally, with regard to death duties, the point was made in the debate on the Finance Bill last year that, because of the increase in the exemption limit for estate duty from £2,000 to £5,000, exemption might apply in certain cases to property totalling as much as £15,000 in value.  This situation arises because certain subdivisions of property, based on the distinction between settled and unsettled property, may under existing law constitute separate estates, each of which would be entitled to exemption if it did not exceed £5,000 in value.  I propose to introduce legislation, which will necessitate a financial resolution, to aggregate the deceased's unsettled property, whatever its value, with any property settled by him.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stamp Duty on Receipts, Cheques and Other Bills of Exchange</i>
    </P>
    <P>The twopenny stamp duty on receipts for £2 and upwards and the <i>ad valorem</i> duties on certain bills of exchange are troublesome and time-consuming for traders and others.  I propose, with effect from 1 August, 1961, to repeal these duties and, by way of compensation to the Exchequer, to apply a flat duty of threepence to all cheques and other bills of exchange drawn in the State. Provision will be made to avoid the inconvenience which would be caused if it were necessary to affix additional stamps to bills of exchange coming from abroad.  On the assumption that advantage will be taken by the banks of the composition arrangements provided in Section 57 of the Finance Act, 1958, these changes will not affect the revenue either way this year.  The gain in future years may be of the order of £40,000.  A financial resolution is required.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stamp Duty on Purchases of Land</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have had under consideration the question of acquisitions of agricultural land by non-nationals, and the desirability of exercising more control over these transactions. It has been decided to include provisions in the Finance Bill to strengthen the existing 25 per cent stamp duty legislation so as to bring <Col N="682" /> within its scope certain procedures which at present enable, or may enable, non-nationals to acquire land without incurring liability to the duty. In particular, I have in mind purchases of land by pre-1947 companies with non-national shareholders.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it is necessary to have regard to the legitimate needs of persons who come from abroad and benefit the economy by setting up industries or otherwise investing here. I do not propose, therefore, that the higher rate of duty should apply henceforward except where it is necessary for social purposes.  It will not apply at all in urban areas or to land which is to be used for industrial purposes and, where it does apply, the Minister for Lands will have power in suitable cases to authorise the granting of exemption.</P>
    <P>The amendments of the law which I propose will be incorporated in the Finance Bill and will affect pre-1947 companies as from today.  Provision will be made for the furnishing of declarations or statements to the Revenue Commissioners, and there will be stringent penalties for failure to disclose information.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Import Levies and Other Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>Turning now to customs and excise matters, I shall deal first with the special import levies.  During the year I received further representations from traders and from foreign Governments for the reduction or abolition of particular levies.  The balance of payments difficulties which led to the imposition of the levies five years ago have, I am glad to say, now disappeared. In the intervening period the levies have been reduced in number to fourteen and the annual yield is down to roughly £1 million.  In present circumstances, however, we cannot afford either the loss of revenue or, in some cases, the loss of protection which abolition of the levies would involve.  I also consider that this form of taxation of less essential goods is not inappropriate at our present stage of economic development.  The Government, therefore, have decided that, in <Col N="683" /> general, the levies should be converted into permanent duties at approximately the equivalent of the combined existing rate of levy and of permanent duty where such applies.  Effect is being given to this decision by an Order under the Imposition of Duties Act which will come into effect tomorrow. The Order provides for some relaxations. I might mention, in particular, that the new consolidated rates of duty on canned fruit will be lower than the present combined rates of duty and levy on these products.</P>
    <P>I have had representations from various quarters for the removal of the revenue duty on musical instruments. It will be recalled that the special import levy has already been abolished.  It would not be feasible to withdraw the duty completely since it affords protection to certain home manufacturers.  The Order I have mentioned contains a licensing provision so that, in future, musical instruments may be imported without payment of duty where a licence is granted.</P>
    <P>The transformation of the levies provides an opportunity to simplify the present complicated structure of the customs duties on motor vehicles.  A separate Order has been made under the Imposition of Duties Act which, from tomorrow, introduces a revised and simplified scheme of customs duties for motor vehicles.  I would like to make it clear that this does not involve any new taxation.  What is being done is simply to spread the existing tax load more evenly over the whole range of motor vehicles and parts so that the overall yield from the revised duties will equal the present combined yield from ordinary duties and levies.</P>
    <P>Copies of these two Orders will be circulated as soon as I conclude.  The net loss of revenue involved by the various changes will be £70,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>Finally, provision will be made in the Finance Bill for the abolition of the duty known as Customs Entry Duty. The requirement that a 6d. stamp should be affixed to every customs <Col N="684" /> entry in respect of each separate description of goods shown on the entry was designed to achieve administrative economy by discouraging importation of goods in very small quantities.  In present circumstances the duty has ceased to serve any useful purpose and the small yield of £7,000 a year does not justify the continuance of this now unnecessary complication in the clearance of goods through the customs.  The cost will be £5,000 this year which, added to the costs I have already given, completely absorbs the £1.52 million available for tax reliefs.</P>
    <P Just="Center">VIII.  CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>As this is my last budget before the general election, it is natural that I should conclude with a brief review of the main developments in the economy in the four years I have been Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In March, 1957, when the Government took office, it was faced, as I said earlier, with a difficult economic and financial situation.  National income and production had fallen in the previous year.  Unemployment was high.  Credit was scarce and there was a serious budgetary deficit.  In general, the balance of payments crisis of 1955-56, though it had been brought under control by corrective measures, had caused a setback to economic development.</P>
    <P>My introductory remarks this afternoon gave some indications of the extent of the progress made since 1957. National production has been increasing in the past two years at a much higher rate than before.  The expansion and diversification of production have led to a sharp upturn in exports. Employment in industry has never been so high or unemployment so low. Savings have increased by over 50 per cent. since 1956.  External accounts have been kept in balance over the years 1957 to 1960 as a whole and, in consequence, the national progress made has been achieved without loss of external reserves.  The contribution of foreign capital to the establishment of many of our new industries is a welcome sign of confidence in the country's potential for development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> All our problems, of course, have not been solved.  On the debit side must be placed the still high level of emigration and the slow and unsteady growth in agriculture.  Signs of improvement are, however, already appearing.  Last year, enough new jobs were created outside agriculture to offset the decline in the numbers engaged in agriculture.  The improvement in agricultural potential provides a firm basis for expansion.  Generally, with the new sense of purpose and direction given by the Programme for Economic Expansion, there is widespread confidence and progressiveness which augur well for the future.</P>
    <P>The public accounts have been in balance over the three financial years 1958-59 to 1960-61 despite additional expenditure and taxation reliefs.  We have been able to meet additional expenditure on necessary public services because revenue has been carried upwards by the rise in national income. Tax concessions to encourage increased exports have been extended and improved and the importance of the human factor in economic development has been recognised by substantial reductions in direct taxation, especially income tax.</P>
    <P>On the capital side of the account, our annual expenditure has been raised to a level higher than ever before and has been reshaped so as to give greater emphasis to productive projects, both <Col N="686" /> in industry and agriculture.  Besides increased aid to private industry and for tourist development, substantial sums have been made available for air transport, industrial credit and shipping. In the agricultural sector, very large amounts have been allotted to eradicate bovine tuberculosis, to improve farm buildings and water supplies, to reduce the cost of fertilisers and generally to promote increased production on all farms, small and large.</P>
    <P>The advances I have mentioned relate to the economy as a whole.  How has the individual fared over the past four years?  The answer is that there has been a general rise in the standard of living based on a real increase in national production.  Despite the removal of the food subsidies, wage and salary earners are now substantially better off than they were in 1956.  The position of the social assistance groups has been improved.</P>
    <P>I think it can be said with ample justification that the record of achievement over the past four years is one of which no Government need be ashamed.  Not alone has there been a satisfactory rate of expansion in the period I have reviewed, but the foundations have been soundly laid for further progress.</P>

    <P>*When considering the Liabilities Statement at 31/3/61 alone it should be borne in mind that there is double reckoning in the totals to the extent of £49,850,000 representing the investment in Ways and Means Advances to the Exchequer and in Exchequer Bills of the proceeds of dollar borrowings the balance in the National Development Fund (Winding-up) Account and of part of the balances of the National Loans Sinking Funds and the Savings Certificates Fund (Principal Reserve Account).  This is offset in the Assets Statement where the balances on the American Loan Counter part Fund, the National Development Fund (Winding-up) Account, the National Loans Sinking Funds and the Savings Certificates Fund (Principal Reserve Account) include the Funds' investments in Ways and Means Advances to the Exchequer and Exchequer Bills.</P>

The Government will find that the people remember the blisters they put upon them&mdash;blisters to which they have added today by another £1,000,000 on tobacco.  The people will remember the manner in which they were misled by the promises that every member of this Government made in the last General Election and this Budget and the speech the Minister for Finance has just made are the end of the apologia, the end of the final admission that all those promises have been completely and absolutely unfulfilled. I propose later on to refer to some of the blisters that Fianna Fáil under Dr. Ryan as Minister for Finance have put upon the people in those five years but, before I do so, I want to refer to certain economic trends, certain trends to which the Minister has made reference in some cases but in respect of which he has signally failed in this Budget to take any corrective action.</P>
      <P>First, let me deal with the balance of payments.  The equilibrium in our balance of payments is due to three things and in respect of not one single one of these three things has the present Minister for Finance any responsibility whatever.  That equilibrium in our balance of payments is due, first, to the measures that we took in 1956.  We took them knowing perfectly well that they would not be popular at the time but because we knew they were necessary and desirable in the public interest.  Indeed, the Minister for Finance himself, contrary to the loud guffaws of some of his backbenchers, acknowledges that in the last page of one section of his Budget speech to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The equilibrium in our balance of payments is due, secondly to the measures that we provided to turn the eyes and to turn the outlook of our manufacturers towards exports, without which we would not have had any upsurge whatever in exports.  The equilibrium in our balance of payments <Col N="716" /> is due, in the third instance, to something in regard to which the present Minister for Finance nor I nor any other person sitting in this House has had the slightest connection.  We have been lucky in Ireland that in the last four years we have had a change in the terms of trade.  We have had a change in the terms of trade which the Taoiseach himself admitted yesterday was such that if it had not occurred, that if international prices had not moved in favour of Ireland in the last four years, instead of more or less equilibrium on current account in our balance of payments, the Minister for Finance would have had to report a deficit last year of £29 million.</P>
    <P>I have said before on many occasions, and I repeat, that the terms of trade is something over which no Minister for Finance here in a small country like Ireland has control.  It has moved favourably for this country. Thank God it has.  Let us hope that it will in future.  Some of the indications in the last couple of months must give everybody anxieties in that respect.  It is a significant fact that, notwithstanding that the Central Statistics Office have made reference to a possible change in the wrong way in our terms of trade, this Budget by the Minister for Finance takes no account of it and offers no assistance towards combating that problem as it moves along.</P>
    <P>It is also a significant thing about this Budget that it makes no provision whatever towards the day that all of us see coming ahead, the day of the emergence of agreement between the Common Market countries and those in E.F.T.A.  There is nothing in this Budget to ease the change-over for us to the situation that is going to arise inevitably in the long-term economic European Community&mdash;nothing whatever in this, because that is a long-term problem, because that is a problem that is going to be there after the next general election and because the Minister knows he will not be there to cope with it after the next general election.</P>
    <P>There is nothing whatever in this Budget to cope with the fact that any advance that there has been in industrial <Col N="717" /> production was slackening off towards the end of last year.  There is no new incentive, no new idea, nothing to meet that slackening situation.  We had been taking up the slack that was there in our production and we have been doing it at a time when there was a world boom all round us.  In spite of the fact that there was a world boom all round us in 1960, if any Deputy cares to go down to the Library and look up the last publication that is filed there from O.E.E.C., he will find that our industrial production in both the second quarter and in the third quarter of 1960&mdash;the last two that are there to compare&mdash;is exactly one half what it has been in the other countries in Europe in O.E.E.C.&mdash;exactly one half compared to theirs.  Yet the Minister complacently gets up, makes no reference to that fact today and does not in any shape or form provide any solution.</P>
    <P>I referred here last week to the most significant problem of all in relation to our agriculture, the fact that this year we are getting a serious trend in the wrong direction in relation to in-calf heifers, the fact that our cattle livestock industry, which accounts for over one-quarter of our whole exports, this year for the first time for years shows a decline in the future mothers of those cattle, a decline of 11 per cent. in in-calf heifers, a slight increase in cows, but much more than offset by the decline in in-calf heifers in the January enumeration.</P>
    <P>I referred to that last week.  For anyone who has the interests of the livestock trade at heart&mdash;and all of us must have that because it represents 25 per cent.  of our total exports&mdash;it must be a shattering thing to realise that instead of looking forward in future to an increase in our livestock, we see a reduction in our numbers of breeding stock.  In fact any increase in livestock numbers is merely using up the older cattle that are there.</P>
    <P>There is no provision whatever in this Budget to cope with that vital matter in regard to agricultural output. I see little provision in this Budget to cope with the situation of employment in agriculture.  If we look at the <Col N="718" /> Economic Tables we find there were 5,700 people fewer at work on the land in 1960 than there were in 1959 and that, in addition, there were 1,300 fewer at work in forestry and fisheries, two activities that we understood and believed were going ahead.  Not merely is there that decrease of 7,000 in agriculture, forestry and fisheries compared with 1959 but if we compare 1960 with 1956, the year about which they talked so much and said they were going to bring about a change, we find there is a decrease of 26,000 people in employment in those three occupations.</P>
    <P>What is the position in respect of employment outside agriculture?  We can remember here&mdash;and let me assure the Minister for Finance the people outside remember&mdash;the Taoiseach's promise of 100,000 jobs, 20,000 a year over five years.  The people can also remember the posters that were displayed: &ldquo;Wives get your husbands back to work.&rdquo;  The result is that there were only 7,000 more last year in non-agricultural employment even though there were 7,000 fewer in agricultural employment.  After all the hullabaloo and after all the talk there are now 27,000 people fewer employed in non-agricultural occupations than there were in 1955.  Is that what Fianna Fáil believe is a good record ?  Is that the record upon which they have reason to congratulate themselves or to be complacent ?  In relation to the increased number of 7,000, I should like to know how many of those are due to the employment in the Avoca copper mines or the petrol refinery at Whitegate started before this Government came into office?</P>
    <P>We had a reference to emigration in the Budget speech.  It was just a passing one, probably because in another Budget speech by Deputy Dr. Ryan he was criticised for not having mentioned it.  What is there in this Budget which is going to stop the tide of emigration?  What is that tide? Do we not all realise that in the past four years some 200,000 people have left our shores to seek work which they believed was going to be given to them here?  The Minister himself, speaking on the Vote on Account last year, <Col N="719" /> admitted approximately that rate, 200,000 of the best of our people, going and the worst significance of it all is that it is the people of a certain age group who are going and those who are left behind are not balanced in relation to age groups.  A declining population cannot be anything but depressing in its relation to economic activity, quite apart from the fact that those who have gone away feel they were deluded, that they have been let down, and there is every justification for that feeling.</P>
    <P>What of this Budget in relation to the actual tax proposals?  This Budget is based upon the measures that were included in the Budget of 1957, the Budget which took £9,000,000 out of the pockets of the people.  By the abolition of the food subsidies, by the increase in the price of flour, by the increase in the price of bread, by the increase in the price of butter at that time, some £9 million a year, as the Minister has admitted before, was taken away.</P>
    <P>This Budget includes, in addition, the extra £1 million per annum put on tobacco in 1957.  It includes the extra £1 million per annum that was put on tobacco in 1960 as well as the £1 million per annum put on tobacco this year.  It includes the extra penny a pint on beer that was imposed by Fianna Fáil in the beginning which is bringing in £750,000 every year, another £750,000 taxation being imposed on the people by Fianna Fáil this year.  It includes the extra 6d. per gallon on petrol that the Minister put on mineral hydrocarbon light oil in 1957.  In fact, with the addition of the extra £1 million he is taking on tobacco this year, it means that in these five years the people will have paid to him during his term of office £60 million additional taxation by reason of the increases I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>That is not all.  This is only one Budget.  Fianna Fáil are adepts at hiving off unpleasant facts in other budgets.  We have had a budget in relation to insurance stamps; the employer and employee are each contributing an extra £2 million this year. <Col N="720" /> We have had a budget in the shape of increased electricity charges.  We have had a budget in the shape of increased postal charges.  We have had a budget in the shape of increased bus fares. When the Minister talks of general elections, these are all the things that the people must and will remember.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this Budget gives 1/6d. a week by way of increased social assistance pensions.  I wonder how much more than that he has taken from the people by the rigorous and stringent means test that is in operation throughout the length and breadth of the land?  Every single Deputy knows perfectly well the Minister has sent out orders to social welfare agents throughout the country to revise the basis of means test to ensure in that way, I suggest, that more than this 1/6d.  will be saved for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I notice from the tables for the Capital Budget, we are going to see in relation to building work next year an expenditure of approximately £3,500,000 less than there was in 1956-57, the year in respect of which Deputies on that side of the House love to shout that there was no expenditure on building.  We were spending £3,500,000 more on building at that time.  I shall not comment on the detailed tax provisions now. Another opportunity will arise for that when we have had a chance of considering in greater detail the White Paper on taxation and the general taxation charges proposed by the Minister in his Budget speech.</P>
    <P>One thing stands out in relation to this Budget.  It is a Budget for the immediate future.  It does not take into account at all the things necessary from the point of view of any long-term change.  All indications are that the progress of the world is throwing up every day new problems.  Governments in every part of the world have to try, in relation to those new problems, to find new solutions or to provide circumstances in which those engaged in private enterprise can meet them.  There is nothing in this Budget to provide in any way for the additional incentive.  There is nothing in this Budget to provide any <Col N="721" /> dynamism for industrial production in the future which will bring employment in its wake.  There is nothing in this Budget to provide any effective cushioning against the future welding of the Common Market and E.F.T.A. There is nothing in it to provide any cushioning effect in case the terms of trade should turn against us.</P>
    <P>In fact, it is a short-sighted Budget designed short-sightedly to achieve a purpose, but I believe it will utterly fail to achieve even that purpose because the people will remember the blisters the Minister for Finance put upon them and not the trivial things given out today by the reliefs he has proposed.  It has been a habit of Fianna Fáil always to try and slap on the blisters in their first year of office and to hope, when they take off some of those at a later stage, the people will remember only the remission and forget the imposition.  If they had not done it so often, it might have worked; on this occasion it is going to fail completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>For the last 12 months we heard boasts from the members of the Government with regard to the increase in the national income and the increase in revenue.  We have been told about the favourable balance of payments, the increase in industrial and agricultural output, and, generally, the people have been given the impression that there has been a vast increase in prosperity here over the last four years of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I do not think anybody listening to the Minister's Budget proposals today could say they demonstrated in any way that this country was prosperous as a result of the Fianna Fáil administration of the past four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I was disappointed at the Budget.  The people were heartened by the fact that the Minister for Finance announced in the Seanad recently that this was going to be a good Budget. The Fianna Fáil members themselves&mdash; while I am sure they did not know the details of the Budget&mdash;freely said in the House during the week that it was going to be a &ldquo;humdinger&rdquo; of a <Col N="722" /> Budget.  If I were to judge whether or not it was a good Budget, even compared with the last three Budgets, I merely had to note the lack of applause from the Fianna Fáil benches.  The only time they were spurred was when the Minister, coming to the end of his speech, made a <i>rallentando</i> which succeeded in stirring them to applaud in a rather weak fashion.</P>
    <P>Could anybody describe this as a Budget with imagination?  In effect, what has the Minister done?  What is the main effect of what he has done? He has put a penny on cigarettes.  He has got £1,000,000, and for about 30 pages of his speech he has juggled with that £1,000,000.  It may be presented as an attractive Budget, because this is an election year.  In some quarters it may be accepted as an attractive Budget, until people read further down the Minister's speech.  I can visualise the box in the columns of the <i>Irish Press</i> tomorrow in which will be listed what were described as reliefs: mining reliefs, export reliefs, death duties, reliefs for small and large estates, gifts to the State, gifts with reservation, tax avoidance gifts, payment by trustees, Wills Act, amendment of aggregation provisions, stamp duty on receipts, cheques and other bills of exchange and on purchase of land&mdash; all giving the people the impression that the Minister for Finance, in his generosity, made a terrific number of concessions to the Irish public.  It boils down to this, however&mdash;that he has given the usual miserable increase to those in receipt of old age and blind pensions and he has made a reduction to some extent in income tax.</P>
    <P>I was frightfully disappointed with this Budget.  I must confess I underestimated the Fianna Fáil politicians, however.  They must be slipping.  If they think the people will accept this as a Budget which represents the boasted prosperity of the country, they are very much mistaken.  Fianna Fáil have made several efforts since they came into office to do things to ensure they will remain on in office.  Since 1957 they seem to be more concerned with hanging on to office than for the welfare of the people.  First, they <Col N="723" /> attempted to abolish Proportional Representation, but failed.  Second, they attempted to arrange the constituencies to suit themselves, but they failed as a result of the action in the High Court.  Now they have the present Electoral Bill designed to do the same thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a Budget designed to give the appearance of benevolence which, it is hoped, will blot out the memory of the infamous Budget of 1957.  If that is the hope, Fianna Fáil are very much mistaken. The people still remember what happened with regard to the food subsidies in 1957&mdash;the food subsidies which still mean people have to pay vastly increased prices for butter, increased from 3/9d. to 4/7d.; bread increased from 9d. to 1/3½d.; and flour, increased from 4/2½d. to 8/2d. a stone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must judge this Budget, as the Minister for Finance tried to, against the last four Budgets introduced by him.  The 1957 Budget, his first Budget, will certainly be long remembered for the tax burden it imposed on the people.  It burdened them to the extent of £8,000,000 without giving any reliefs.  The 1958 Budget still meant additional taxation.  The only reduction in taxation given was £50,000 in respect of cinemas and dance halls. In the 1959 Budget there was no additional taxation.  There was a reduction in taxation to the extent of about £1,500,000, but it also included tax reductions in respect of cinemas and dance halls.  In the 1960 Budget we had additional taxation of nearly £1,000,000, £980,000, because of increased duties on tobacco.  Again there was a reduction in taxation to the extent of about £1,500,000, but it also included a reduction in taxation in respect of cinemas and dance halls and death duties.  The net result of these four Fianna Fáil Budgets is that additional taxes plus the abolition of food subsidies for these four years, amount to £11,000,000.  The reduction in taxation for these four years&mdash;the yearly reduction up to 1960&mdash;came to <Col N="724" /> £3,500,000 leaving a balance of additional taxation on the people of £7,500,000.  During that time also, tax revenue increased to a fairly substantial extent, to the extent of £16,000,000.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Social Welfare and Health is here because he and his Parliamentary Secretary, and other members of the Government, have protested at times that social welfare and social assistance cannot be increased until the situation in the country allows substantial increases to be given in health and social welfare. I have shown that over the last four years there have been net yearly increases in taxes to the extent of £7,500,000.  There has been an increase in revenue to the extent of £16,000,000. That has not reflected itself in any improvement in social welfare or in health.  As a matter of fact there has been a reduction so far as social insurance and social assistance are concerned. In the first year of Fianna Fáil administration, 1957/1958, there was a sum of £25,000,000 spent on social assistance and social insurance.  In the year 1960/1961 it stood at the same figure.</P>

      <P>We will take about the unemployment in a moment.  On the basis of the Estimates this year, apart from the £600,000 which the Minister proposes to give to social welfare, there is a reduction of £500,000.  As a percentage of the tax revenue in 1957/58 social assistance and social insurance came to 24.4 per cent.  On the pre-Budget Estimate in respect of expenditure for social assistance and social insurance it will be down to 21.3 per cent.  As far as expenditure on health is concerned, that also shows no change since this Government assumed office, or should I say since the present Minister for Social Welfare assumed office.  As a percentage of tax revenue expenditure on health has declined from 10.9 per cent. to 7.6 per cent.</P>

      <P>If one couples expenditure on health and social welfare, as compared with 1957/1958, expenditure this year will show a reduction of 2 per cent. of the tax revenue of this country.  I do not know what the Minister for Finance intended to do in this particular Budget.  It was expected that there would be a little more generosity shown towards old age pensioners, blind pensioners, and widows and orphans.  Instead we get a miserable crust of 1/6d. a week thrown to these unfortunate people.  If the country is as prosperous as the Ministers in this Government say it is surely we could afford a little more than 1/6d. to people who are at the moment forced to exist on 28/6d. a week.  Surely it could have been jacked up to 2/6d. a week.</P>

      <P>The Minister this afternoon talked about the improvement in the employment position and the improvement in the unemployment position.  The only information we have at our disposal is the information given to us by the Government.  I wonder how the Minister for Finance can reconcile the figures which he gave here today with the figures in a booklet produced by, I think, the Taoiseach's Department entitled &ldquo;Economic Statistics.&rdquo; I reckon from the statistics in this booklet that in the year 1957 there were 433,000 people employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing.  According to the booklet in 1960 there were 413,000 employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing.  To anybody who can subtract, that suggests that there are 29,000 fewer people employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing.  That is something about which the Government need not be proud.  It is something about which they cannot be proud. Nevertheless we hear glib talk about the increase in industrial employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, we have figures here provided <Col N="726" /> by the Taoiseach himself telling us what the figures for industrial employment are.  In the Booklet entitled &ldquo;Economic Statistics&rdquo; we are informed that in 1957 under the heading of &ldquo;All others in employment, including industrial work, administration, civil service&rdquo; and what-have-you, there were 703,000 people in employment. In 1960 there were 699,000.  Now there were 4,000 fewer people employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing in 1960 as compared with 1957.  The net result of four years of Fianna Fáil administration is that, compared with 1957, there were 24,000 fewer people in employment in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister treated enough of the situation as far as emigration is concerned, notwithstanding the fact that in the last four years approximately 200,000 people have left the country.  I was interested and indeed amused, to see a proposal in the Budget purporting to encourage people to come in here, buy large estates and live on them.  Much more was devoted to encouraging people of that type to come in here than there was towards encouraging Irish people to get employment and remain in their own country.  I do not know whether the Minister wants to encourage emigration.  I am sure he does not.  But he does not seem to be worried too much about it.  Neither does any other Minister in the present Government seem to be too worried about the flow of emigration over the last four years.</P>
    <P>We were told that 1959 was the year of recovery.  We were told 1960 was the year of progress.  In 1960, as compared with 1959, 4,000 more people emigrated.  It does not seem to me as if this Budget will do much for the economy of the country.  It certainly will not please those who are now in receipt of 28/6d. a week.  It certainly will not do much to stem the tide of emigration.  It certainly will not do a lot to put more people into employment in this country despite the many boasts about the increased prosperity in the last four years.  The Budget will be given the appearance of a benevolent Budget.  When the people realise fully what has been done <Col N="727" /> in this Budget&mdash;the small gifts to social welfare recipients, the small reduction in income tax, and all the other trivialities&mdash;I feel confident that, appreciating how shallow this Budget really is and assessing the windowdressing at its proper value, they will welcome the fact that in another two or three months there will be a general election.</P>

It was about the one bright spot in an otherwise very dull speech.  I want to say that as far as emigration, which is our chief evil, is concerned the Minister has made it quite clear that the Government is not going to do anything about it.  He just gives it one sentence when he refers to the problem of the loss of 200,000 people in four years and he said that was something that would have happened in any case. He referred to expansion in exports, but he failed to mention that our chief export under the Fianna Fáil regime was Irish boys and girls.</P>

      <P>The inter-Party Government had brought emigration practically to a standstill.  The inter-Party Government in their period of office for the first time halted the downward trend in the population of this country by bringing about prosperity. At that time we were able to keep the prices of bread, butter and flour down to the tune of £9 million a year.  One of the first things Fianna Fáil did when they came into office was to swipe that £9 million from the people and they have kept on doing that for the last four years.  That is £36 million altogether in the price of food alone that rich and poor alike <Col N="728" /> have been forced to pay.  The only concession to that is the miserable 1/6d. a week which has been given to the old age pensioners.</P>

The Government is going to the country some time soon and their appeal to the electorate will be to keep quiet, to elect them and that everything will be lovely.  Everything will be lovely until they get back and then there will be the shoal of broken promises that we had after the last election.</P>
      <P>They say that they have given some benefits to the farmers.  One of these benefits is a relief of £1 per ton in the price of potash.  For the small farmers of the west of Ireland that is a relief of about 5/- every spring.  How many small farmers have land on which to put a ton of potash?  Perhaps some farmers are able to do it, the ranchers. One pound a ton is a shilling a cwt. and I do not know of any small farmer who would use more than five cwts. of potash in a year so that the Government has given the small farmers the magnificent relief of five shillings a year.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given a reduction of about £1¼ million to those why pay income tax and in the increased tax on tobacco he has taken back about £930,000 of that amount.  Against that also we have had several budgets during the year the most serious being the increase in the E.S.B. charges.</P>

      <P>That is a direct income to the Government because the <Col N="729" /> deficit of £320,000 in the E.S.B. accounts is a result of Fianna Fáil bungling and mismanagement.  Since they caused that, the very least they might have done was to subsidise the E.S.B.  That is what we did before and that is what we would have done. Fianna Fáil believes in letting these State-sponsored bodies plunge into debt and then recover the money from the public by means of increased charges.</P>
      <P>The last thing I want to say on this matter, for the present at least, is that no attempt has been made by the Government to stop emigration or the flight from the land.  It seems that the Fianna Fáil Government have decided that the small farmers are a class to be abolished.  If that is their belief I suggest that they come out in the open and say so.  There is no relief or concession in this Budget to help them by giving them increased incomes or by giving them alternative employment.  It is quite evident that the idea is to squeeze them out.</P>

    <P>(1)  That paragraph (1) of Rule 4 of the Rules applicable to Cases I and <Col N="732" /> II of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act, 1918,&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  so far as it provides that corporation profits tax paid by a company in respect of any accounting period is, in computing for purposes of income tax the profits or gains of the company, to be allowed to be deducted as an expense incurred in that accounting period, shall not apply where the computation is for purposes of income tax for the year 1961-62 or for any subsequent year of assessment, and</P>
    <P>(b)  so far as it provides that, where any amount previously paid by way of corporation profits tax is repaid, the amount repaid is to be treated as profit for the year in which repayment is received, shall not apply save where there has been an allowance of the deduction of an amount as an expense in computing profits or gains for purposes of income tax.</P>
    <P>This is the Resolution that deals with company taxation.  Deputies are aware that at the present time companies pay corporation profits tax on profits over £2,500 and the amount paid is deducted from their profits before they pay income tax.  It is proposed to remove the deductibility so that companies will pay income tax on their full profits.  There are about 8,000 companies liable to income tax but of these about 1,600 are not liable to corporation profits tax and they will get the benefit of the reduction in income tax.  Of that 1,600, only about 135 will lose on this transaction.  The remainder of the 1,600 will gain something.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his Budget statement the Minister said he proposed to impose a tax to the extent of ld. on a packet of 20 standard size cigarettes and that he hopes that will give a yield of £930,000 in a year.  I would ask the Minister if that figure were calculated on the assumption that there would be no drop in consumption or if his assumption is that there will be a drop in consumption and if that is provided for in this figure?  Does this mean the retailer will charge an extra penny for the packet of cigarettes in the future or are the wholesaler and the retailer entitled to put on something <Col N="738" /> extra?  In other words, is this a net penny as far as the wholesaler and retailer are concerned?  Are they entitled to move in and ask for an increase over and above this penny because of the fact that they also will have to pay more for their cigarettes and, therefore, must increase their investment in the purchase of cigarettes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the calculation and the yield in a matter of that kind, I have to take the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, because they have the experience of it.  They estimate this yield from the penny increase in tax on the assumption that there will be some decrease in consumption.  I do not know on what percentage decrease in consumption they calculate but they certainly assume there will be some decrease.  As the Deputy is aware there are other types of cigarettes than the standard size&mdash;the 3/2d. packets&mdash; and it is assumed the price of those cigarettes will increase by one penny also.  The Deputy knows there is very keen competition between the different brands of cigarettes at the moment and I think it is very unlikely that any attempt will be made to put the price up beyond a penny although, of course, this does not fix the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to assume the penny is being put on the assumption by the Government that the purchaser will not have to pay a 1½d.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the exact amount of the tax here a penny or is there a margin left?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not allowing any margin in the trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything included in this resolution for the penny being put on stocks held by the manufacturers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any calculation as to what that would involve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could only make a guess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall accept the Minister's guess knowing, of course, that it will be inspired by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the yield was on previous occasions.  I must go back in history a little.  In 1952 there was 7d. put on and it gave £622,000. In 1956 5d. was put on and it gave £266,000.  In 1957 there was an increase of 2d. and that gave £100,000. On these figures I think this year's sum would not be more than £50,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's table shows the sum he expects to get in revenue as £930,000.  What would be the amount for a full year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is practically for a full year.  It goes on tomorrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister last year put on £980,000 as additional taxation on tobacco.  Was that for the full year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the £930,000 that is going on this year is in addition to the £980,000 that went on last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we were a bit more optimistic about tobacco last year, because there had been a very big increase in consumption and sales of tobacco in 1959.  There was not the same increase at all in 1960.  It went down to a figure very little higher than 1959.  That explains the difference between the figure given now and last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, from <Col N="740" /> the point of view of people who pay taxation on tobacco, they are being asked to pay £930,000 additional this year and they were asked to pay £980,000 additional last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was expected.  They were not asked to pay.  That was the estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing. How much, in fact, did the additional tax yield?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our total estimate on the tobacco item was slightly too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister an assurance from the tobacco manufacturers that they will not invoice the prices of their cigarettes to wholesalers and retailers at more than a penny increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly it could be more than a penny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That could happen even if there were no taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The danger only arises because you are interfering with it.  If you leave it alone the thing will run all right.  You are putting another £1 million on these people, trying to get something back.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(5)  A person who contravenes subsection (4) of this section or a regulation under this section shall be guilty of an offence and, where the contravention is of the said sub-section (4) and such person is not the owner of the vehicle, such owner shall also, in such cases as may be prescribed, be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to ask for an explanation from the Minister as to what this amendment is supposed to <Col N="746" /> do.  There is a distinction mentioned in regard to subsection (4).  There is some attempt to distinguish between a regulation which affects a vehicle and a regulation which affects anything else in subsection (2) or in subsection (1).  I have read through the paragraph here in subsection (2) and it is difficult to see which of them is not covered by subsection (4) when you add to them the general provision in the beginning of subsection (2), that these paragraphs do not affect the generality of subsection (1).  The door seems to be open very wide and I cannot see any safeguard for the owner who was not in fact driving a vehicle which gets into difficulties under the Section.  Quite a number of cases can easily be mentioned where it would be grossly unfair that the owner, who perhaps did not even give permission for the vehicle to be used, should be liable to presecution.  I take it the Minister's intention in substituting amendment 21 for the existing sub-section (5) is that he does not wish to impose any undue hardship upon owners who are not directly involved. I cannot see in the wording of the amendment any safeguard at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, when the Minister introduced this amendment, he presented it to the House on the basis that it was a modification of the section as it stood.  I am quite sure the Minister presented it in that way in a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> manner.  I, when I was speaking, with rather too hasty a consideration of the Minister's amendment, did agree it was a modification of the existing section as drafted; but on considering the position further, I am not at all sure it is.  I think it worsens the position and may worsen it very considerably from the point of view of the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think what Deputy Sheldon has said in relation to this amendment is quite true.  In fact, so far as I can see, subsection (5) of Section 11 can apply to every regulation made under Section 11.  Subsection (4) says that &ldquo;a person shall not use in a public place a vehicle which does not comply with a regulation under this section applying in relation to the vehicles.&rdquo;  Subsection <Col N="747" /> (5) and the proposed amended sub-section (5) then goes on to refer to persons who contravene subsection (4) of the section.  Among the regulations to which subsection (4) applies are regulations dealing with the use and mis-use of vehicles and vehicle equipment.</P>
    <P>As the section originally stood, the position was that the Minister was asking the House to legislate in such a way that, in the case of a breach of these regulations, the owner would be equally guilty with the user of the vehicle unless the owner could show that the use of the vehicle on the occasion was unauthorised.  It was specifically provided in paragraph (b) of subsection (5) that it would be a good defence if the owner satisfied the court that the use of the vehicle on the occasion in question was unauthorised. I felt that did not go far enough.  It appeared to me you could have a situation arising where the use of the vehicle was authorised, where I might give a loan of my car to someone else. In that situation the user of the car was the authorised user, but someone else might subsequently, while he has my car on loan, commit a breach of these regulations.  Even under the wording of the subsection as it stood, I would be equally liable with him, because I could not make the defence that the user of the car was unauthorised.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I put down amendment No. 22, which was to add to sub-paragraph (b) the words &ldquo;or that the breach of the regulation was committed without the knowledge or consent of the owner.&rdquo;  I think that would have dealt with the position fully, because then the owner was in a position of having a defence in court if he could show either that the use of the vehicle was unauthorised or that, if a breach of the regulations was committed, that it was done without his knowledge or consent.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the Minister or his advisers felt there was something in that argument. The Minister, in order to meet the situation, has brought in his amendment <Col N="748" /> No. 31.  I am afraid the effect of that amendment is going to worsen the position rather than improve it. What the Minister is doing now is this.  He is cutting out paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (5).  In particular he is cutting out paragraph (b) which gives the owner in the position I have described at least one solid defence. Instead of that, the Minister is asking us to approve of his amendment which says now in effect&mdash;I am summarising it&mdash;that in certain cases, which are to be prescribed by regulations, the owner and the user of the vehicle will each be regarded as guilty if a breach of the regulations occurs.</P>
    <P>There is no saving provision now for the owner, even if he is in a position to show that the use of the vehicle on the occasion in question was unauthorised. That safeguard, poor and all as it was, is being swept away by the Minister's amendment.  We now have a position where the Minister is asking us to adopt an amendment which enables him to make regulations under which an owner, who may be completely innocent of any offence or of any guilty intent, so to speak, is going to have no defence whatever. The offence is going to be created by the Ministerial regulation and there is going to be no defence open to that whatever.  For that reason, I feel that the amendment, contrary to what the Minister clearly intended and expected to achieve, is going to worsen the position and leave the situation where the owner will be quite defenceless if an offence is committed in respect of a prescribed regulation.</P>
    <P>I might bring it home to the Minister if I put it this way.  The Minister did indicate that what he had in mind was the type of case where a person was the owner of a dangerously defective vehicle and where he gave that vehicle on loan to another person. The Minister said&mdash;I think quite reasonably&mdash;that many people would regard the owner of the vehicle as the more culpable of the two, as between the owner and the user, if to the knowledge of the owner the vehicle was dangerously defective and he gave it to another person on loan.  The Minister <Col N="749" /> intimated that was the kind of case he intended to capture under the regulations he would make&mdash;that that was the type of case he would prescribe under the regulations.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, if that situation did arise, if a person was the owner of a dangerously defective vehicle and if it was a prescribed case, the owner and the user would be equally regarded as guilty in the case of a dangerously defective vehicle.  The Minister is now saying that if the vehicle is dangerously defective, even if it is taken without the authority of the owner, the owner may very well be regarded as guilty because he is not going to have in future, if the Minister's amendment is accepted, the defence open to him that the user was unauthorised.</P>
    <P>I would press very strongly that the Minister should reconsider this matter and should not deal with it as he is suggesting in his amendment.  The position is that we are discussing both amendment 21 and amendment 22 together.  The Minister has not yet&mdash; perhaps he has not had the opportunity&mdash;given us his views with regard to amendment 22.  I suggest that if amendment 22 is accepted to the Bill in its original form, all the fears I foresee will be eliminated and that the position will be covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support amendment No. 21 because it does set out the whole position very clearly.  There is a certain amount of confusion. Amendment No. 21 states that a person who contravenes subsection (4) or a regulation under this section shall be guilty of an offence.  Subsection (4) relates solely to the condition of the vehicle itself but a regulation under the section refers to any regulation under Section 11 so that a person who contravenes either of those two shall be guilty of an offence.  I do not think there is any dispute so far.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;A person shall not use in a public place a vehicle which does not comply with a regulation...&rdquo; The vehicle would comply with the regulation but the loudspeaker might contravene another regulation.  The second part of the amendment states that where the contravention is of the said subsection (4) and such person is not the owner of the vehicle&mdash;that seems to me to bear out what the Minister said when introducing the amendment.  I see the Minister's point. I also see the point raised by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Ryan but I think they are opening the door far too wide because they would leave it open to an owner to say that his car had been taken without his knowledge or consent.</P>

If a breach of the regulation is committed the door would be wide open and it would be almost impossible to catch the owner who had failed to immobilise a vehicle which did not comply with the regulations.  We are not unduly penalising the owner.  If he knows, and he should know, that his vehicle does not comply with the regulations he should immobilise it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure people will be able to get very good legal advice. It is up to the owner to know whether or not he complies with the regulations. Most cars are owned by the head of the family.  He thinks he owns the car but in most cases the car is used more frequently by other members of the family without the knowledge of the owner and without formal permission. If the owner of the car knows that the car does not comply with the regulations the only way he can protect himself is by immobilising it.  First of all, he must collect all the keys.  If members of the family have spare keys he must immobilise it in some other way.  Unless we accept the Minister's amendment we will be leaving the door wide open to a defence which it will be very hard to meet even though the facts clearly show that a breach of the law has been committed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>

      <P>Whether the judge would read the subsection as I read it or as Deputy Booth reads it is something for which a lot of people might have to pay a good deal of money in order to find out.  We must make sure that it does in fact mean what the Minister intends it to mean, if Deputy Booth is reading the Minister's mind correctly.  If subsection (4) referred to a regulation under this section applying to the condition of the vehicle I would be quite happy.  This phrase &ldquo;applying in relation to the vehicle&rdquo; can be read in a much wider way.  That is my difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I still hold that the section as it stands is more drastic than the amendment.  Where a driver is guilty of breaking the regulations and committing an offence no liability will attach to the owner.  If, however, the vehicle breaks the regulation by being defective in some way, then the owner would clearly be liable even though he was not the driver at the time the offence was committed. Whether he knew of the defect is immaterial. The fact that it is another driver who is driving does not alter the fact that the car is defective.  It would be just as defective if the owner drove it.  On the other hand, if the use of the defective car is unauthorised the owner will not be liable.  It was intended that the prescribed regulations would include something comparable to what is contained in (b) of sub-section (5) in relation to its being a good defence to show that the use of the vehicle was unauthorised.  I suggest we retain (b) of subsection (5) in addition to the amendment.  That should meet the various objections raised and would, in a statutory way, state what we in fact intended would be included by way of regulation.  I do not know if we can do that now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is going some way to meet us.  I certainly would prefer that than to leave the position as it is but I suggest that the Minister would be improving the Bill if, in addition to <Col N="753" /> adding paragraph (b), he added the words which have been suggested in amendment No. 22.  The danger I see is that you may have an authorised use of the vehicle, but, subsequent to the authorised use of the vehicle, you may have a breach of regulations committed, possibly deliberately, by the person to whom the vehicle was loaned for which the owner is in no way culpable.</P>
      <P>There may be a question of interpretation. I agree with Deputy Sheldon; I think that this sub-section can apply in cases such as the attachment of loud speakers.  It may be that a regulation will be made prohibiting the use of loud speakers from cars and someone gets a loan of my car and without my consent attaches a loud speaker to it.  Now, I cannot say that the use of the car is not authorised; all I can say is that the use of the loud speaker is unauthorised.  I appreciate the difficulties to which Deputy Booth referred but I think that that can be got over by following the precedent established in Section 56 of the existing Road Traffic Act.  It relates generally to the question of insurance and sub-section 5 of that section provides&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person charged with an offence under this section is the owner of the mechanically propelled vehicle in respect of which such offence is alleged to have been committed, it shall be a good defence to such charge for such person to prove that on the occasion on which such offence is alleged to have been committed such vehicle was being driven without his consent and either that he had taken all reasonable precautions to prevent such vehicle being driven on such occasion or that the person driving such vehicle on such occasion was his servant and in so driving such vehicle was acting in contravention of his orders.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was worrying Deputy Booth was the case of a defective vehicle where the owner knew or should be presumed to know that it was defective. Deputy Booth said in such circumstances the duty of the owner would be to render the vehicle undrivable. A phrase such as is used in the 1933 <Col N="754" /> Act would cover that if, in addition to what I am suggesting, you add the words &ldquo;and that the owner had taken all reasonable precautions to prevent such vehicle being driven.&rdquo;  However, if the Minister will not go further than he has indicated, I think I would be glad to accept the distance he has come but I would urge him to consider the addition of amendment 22.</P>

      <P>I should like to mention the question of unauthorised use. Deputy O'Higgins has mentioned the purpose for which a vehicle will be used.  Possibly Deputy O'Higgins has in mind the case of a person who might obtain the loan of a car to go to a funeral or a wedding and, when he has got the car, he then proceeds to use it in connection with his business as a commercial traveller or for the purpose of carrying goods or making sales. In other words the car would be used for a purpose which was not authorised. I think that is where a question of unauthorised use would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to that, I should say that Deputy Rooney has answered the question himself because, having mentioned the circumstances that could arise, he mentioned the fact that it would not be &ldquo;authorised&rdquo; and I think the whole case rests on that word.  If the authority given did not imply or include its use for some of these purposes which ultimately prove to be in contravention of the regulations, then surely it was unauthorised use.  But I should say in relation to the various arguments, apart from that, that it is only when these regulations are drafted that they can clearly pinpoint the type of case which will come within it or which will not come within it.  When I say that I can see Deputy Sheldon smiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the type of thing Deputy O'Higgins raised&mdash;a car used for the purpose of a loud speaker in such a manner as to contravene a regulation&mdash; again we can and will be considering in the draft regulations all these types of matters, as to whether they will be included or excluded.  I would say, as I said in reply to Deputy Rooney's argument, that if it can be demonstrated that the authority to use the vehicle did not include affixing to it <Col N="755" /> of a loud speaker, then it would be unauthorised use.  If it were given for the purpose of using a loud speaker, I should imagine again that that would be by the action of the operator and it would not be within the control of the actual owner.</P>
    <P>As I have said it is being left to regulation so that matters such as those can be dealt with in a flexible manner because of the difficulties that can arise if you try to spell out each and every detail in the sections themselves. It is for that reason we have to deal with it in this way so that it will embrace the matters it should embrace and at the same time not embrace matters which would be to the detriment of the public in general.  The matters Deputy O'Higgins has intimated his agreement to accept will cover the situation and will give a safeguard to the owners in all cases. I think they are entitled to that coverage.</P>

      <P>The Minister sees the difficulty we are in.  I accept that it is the intention of the Minister, and those concerned with the drafting of the regulations, to do it in the manner the Minister has suggested and to be careful about it but our position is that as Deputies we are being asked to legislate in blinkers.  We do not know in fact what the regulations are going to comprise or how comprehensive they are going to be, and it seems to me that by a simple device we can protect an innocent owner, no matter what the regulations are.  I am not concerned in any way from the point of view of a defence lawyer or anything like that.  I want to see the road traffic code tightened up in such a way that it will be an effective safety measure for all users of the road, whether they be drivers, pedestrians or cyclists and I am not concerned as a lawyer.  I think we can give equal justice to the owner of the car and it seems to me that in refusing to acknowledge that an owner whose car is used for the commission of an offence without his knowledge or his consent cannot be held liable, we are doing him less than justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> I cannot see that the addition of those words to paragraph (b) of sub-section (5) would in any way weaken the Minister's powers to make regulations. I do not see how it is going to weaken the powers of the prosecution or of the Gardaí going into it.  I think it is simple justice.  In framing paragraph (b) as it is, we are departing quite a distance from the ordinary practice where the defendant is proved innocent until found guilty.  We are saying that the defendant is guilty unless he can show the Court that the use of the vehicle was authorised and I think we should go further and give him the advantage of saying that it was without his knowledge or consent.</P>

      <P>I would be satisfied if the Minister would say that he would look again at subsection (4) and make sure that it does without doubt carry only the one possible meaning.  On the machinery of what we are proposing to do I take it that the Minister has agreed that he will leave Section 5 as it is with the insertion at the end of paragraph (a) of the words &ldquo;in such cases as may be prescribed.&rdquo; May I suggest that if it is possible for the Minister he should move that amendment in place of amendment No. 21.

      <P>There is one matter to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention and that is the question of regulations as to vehicle equipment set out in subsection (2), paragraph (b). I hope the Minister will make very strict regulations in the matters of mirrors viewing to the rere.  The use of mirrors is essential for the driving of any vehicle and in many cases it is at least as important to see what is coming behind as what is in front as far as the avoidance of accidents is concerned.  Private cars are usually equipped with mirrors, but some commercial vehicles are not so equipped <Col N="758" /> because the vehicles are so big that the mirrors would stick out to an undesirable distance at one side and so might be damaged.</P>
      <P>The Minister has power at the moment to insist on all vehicles being fitted with mirrors, but I do not know if the regulations are sufficiently explicit about the maintenance of the mirrors in proper condition.  If a mirror is not properly adjusted it is no use.  I hope the regulations will specify that it shall be an offence to drive a vehicle with the mirror not adjusted so as to give the driver a clear view of the road behind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to explain subsection (2).  Sub-section (1) says that the Minister may make regulations.  Subsection (2) says that regulations under the section may be made without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) and then it goes on to deal with a number of points on which regulations may be made, setting out a list from (a) to (h).  The Minister need not make regulations under any of these particular heads or he may make regulations under heads which are not in the Bill at all.  The same thing applies to a number of other sections.  It seems to me that the House is discussing in a theoretical manner regulations which the Minister may make under this section, but he might not make regulations under this head or any of the headings contained in the subsection at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion so far has been about these subheads which have no strict bearing on the legislation now being enacted.  You could carry my argument further and say that he can make regulations about anything concerning local government, but that is a different matter.  In this particular connection it seems to me that the Bill has been cluttered up to a large extent by listing these particular headings.  I do not speak on any particular one of the items because we know that the Minister may decide to make regulations under none of these heads, although I take it as an indication of his point of view that he has mentioned these particular items.  I have seen this happen in legislation over the years and I <Col N="759" /> would like if someone would explain why it is done in this particular way. It seems to me to be largely a waste of time of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question the Deputy has asked, it is true that subsection (1) of Section 11 deals with the general application and sub-section (2) deals with all the various things that one might think up.  On the question as to why subsection (2) might then be necessary, one of the main points is something to which the Deputy himself has objected.  It is to give the Dáil and Seanad an opportunity of discussing in detail the likely matters that will be included and seem obviously suitable for inclusion at this juncture.  In addition to that it will list in subsection (2) some matters on which there might be a doubt as to whether or not they came under the subsection, like the use of loudspeakers on vehicles.  There could be a doubt as to whether the powers included in subsection (1) includes (g) of sub-section (2).  By and large, those are the two main reasons why we seem to have a section that might appear by its enumeration of these various items as being over-elaborate but not necessarily so and I think it is no harm it should be there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, on the Section, if he is prepared to express his views on a matter to which he referred on the Second Reading&mdash;the question of introducing or encouraging the introduction of number plates made of reflectorised material.  I do not know whether the Minister has had an opportunity of considering the matter in the meantime, but the position is that there is nowadays on sale a material which is suitable for making number plates for cars.  It is very much the same type as is used on roadside signs &mdash;Automobile Association signs&mdash; throughout the country which can be picked up for a considerable distance away because they have the property of attracting or gathering up any light cast on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that as part of a <Col N="760" /> policy of road safety, the Government should, under Section 11, certainly consider encouraging, if not making obligatory, some sort of reflectorised material for number plates.  I think I am correct in saying that as the law stands it is necessary to have number plates made of a material which permits the use of a dark background with white lettering.  If the type of material I have referred to is used it might mean an alteration of the present law but it would be of considerable help, it seems to me, in the promotion of road safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed in the Budget to-day that the Minister for Finance has examined the question of the use of safety belts in cars and I would seriously urge the Minister for Local Government to make regulations as to what type of safety belt is, in the Government's opinion, a satisfactory type.  I understand that in Britain some enterprising people put safety belts on the market which were of no practical use at all.  They pulled the seats away from the car.  I would urge the Minister, under subsection (2), to make regulations in connection with safety belts because I believe the introduction of compulsory safety belts in motor cars will contribute more than anything else to a reduction in the number of fatal accidents on our roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to one small point of which Deputy M.J. O'Higgins reminded me.  It is a question concerning the type of number plate.  I do not know what powers the Minister has to deal with the matter, but I would draw his attention to a highly polished type of number plate. Recently I noticed it when following a car and the writing on it was quite illegible because of its overpolished condition.  All I could make out was a bright blur.  That type of number plate is every bit as objectionable as the dirty one.  I hope that the Minister will deal with that by regulation.  I agree that the question of the introduction of a reflectorised number plate is also worthy of examination because the only way an approaching motorist, <Col N="761" /> with the glare of an oncoming car in his eyes, can read the number of that car is by having some kind of reflectorised material in the number plate.</P>

      <P>I rise on one small point in connection with paragraph (f) of subsection (2).  The Minister is empowered to make regulations with regard to the equipment of drivers and I trust the Minister has in mind the tool kit.  Recently I came across an unfortunate lorry driver who had been driving for many hours.  He got a puncture and discovered he had not the equipment necessary to change a wheel.  I would urge upon the Minister to make a regulation compelling the owner of a lorry to have the proper equipment in the vehicle to enable the driver to carry out ordinary running repairs.  The driver to whom I refer would have been stranded all night had I not come across him in the early hours of the morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the remarks of Deputy N. Lemass, if they are to be entertained seriously, are very dangerous in that they really negative democracy.  I admit that in the wealth of detailed discussion provided in the House, the amount of wisdom which may come forth may be very small, but it is only by discussing these things in detail and by Deputies giving their views and reflecting the views of the people they represent that the law which is going to control the movement of thousands of our people may turn out to be a rational, sensible code. It has been said that experts are sometimes the worst people to whom to entrust the making of regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us face what we know to be facts.  Whatever the administration may think about the wisdom or otherwise of suggestions of Deputies during debates which take place in this House, they are read by the Departments concerned and they must make some impression upon the minds of the administration and have some influence on the advice given to Ministers.  The mere fact that we have eight subsections in this section dealing with particular aspects of the matter is a virtue and not a vice.  I think that out <Col N="762" /> of the discussion which took place last night in this House, some very useful suggestions came to light.  Because some of these suggestions reflected the views of the community, we heard here last night the official and the expert point of view and this tends to keep a sense of balance in the debate.</P>
    <P>Coming down to the question of equipment which the Minister may require drivers of vehicles to carry, I think that in relation to larger vehicles we must consider the equipment not only attached to the vehicles but also the equipment to be used in case of emergency such as red lamps and danger signs which would be placed on the roadways some distance away from parked vehicles.  For instance, it is sometimes put up that the electrical equipment in a lorry was faulty or that a lorry was parked during the day time because of mechanical failure, that it was not expected that the vehicle would be on the road during lighting up time. In such case if we made a regulation that an oil or battery operated lamp must be placed on the roadway some distance from a parked lorry, fatal accidents which have become all too frequent in recent years might be prevented.</P>
    <P>I understand that on the Continent there is a system in some countries of placing triangular warnings on the roadway some distance from parked lorries at night time.  These are essential equipment if our roadways are not to continue to be danger traps, which unquestionably they are so long as there are until lorries on the road or lorries which may be lit but which by reason of their bulk and size ought to have advance warning notices as an indication of a serious obstruction. Some of the trucks on the road today are a greater obstruction than a brick wall would be.  A lorry may be eight feet wide and there may be two to three tons weight on it.  That is one of the reasons why there are so many fatal accidents on the road.</P>
    <P>I would hope that in framing regulations the trouble which we know can develop on the road will be anticipated by ensuring that heavier vehicles parked on the roadway at night, in <Col N="763" /> addition to have red parking lights attached to them, would also have advance warning lights placed some distance from them.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I wish to refer is one which I referred to last night, that is, the nuisance of loud speakers.  In relation to this and other sections of the Bill rural and city areas must be considered in completely different lights.  The cities of Dublin, Cork and perhaps Limerick have problems completely different from those affecting rural Ireland.  I do not like quoting British legislation as though it is an example that we must necessarily follow, but it is interesting to note that there is a special traffic regulation for the city of London alone because of the peculiar problems that exist in London by reason of its size. Dublin is to Ireland what London is to England and special regulations will have to be made for the static matters mentioned by the Minister for an area in which there is great density of population and traffic.</P>
    <P>Whatever regulations may be made, they are of no use if we continue the rather haphazard system of enforcement which we have become attuned to over recent years.  It may be that the Government in relation to this Bill, as in the case of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, may intend to enforce the Bill when passed, but certainly this Bill and any regulations made under it must be rigorously, vigorously and impartially enforced.  I understand that at the moment all number plates are supposed to be in black and the lettering on them in white.  Yet one notices going through the city and country several buses which have quite the reverse.  It may be that designers wish to depart from the law as many of us would wish to depart from many laws, but these regulations must be rigorously enforced even at the risk of upsetting the aesthetic beauty of a vehicle.  They must be enforced in relation to lighting, number plates, equipment and every other item.  Even though foreign designers may continue to design vehicles which are not in accordance with this Bill or regulations <Col N="764" /> made under it, our own motor assemblers and users will have to comply with the law.  I hope there will be no relaxation whatever or any indifference about whether the law is enforced or not.</P>
    <P>It is far better to change a regulation than not to enforce an existing regulation.  The only virtue I see in making regulations is that it allows for regulations being changed from time to time.  I hope that that is what will happen rather than non-enforcement of regulations already made.</P>

      <P>On the section generally, it struck me when Deputy Ryan was speaking about emergency equipment, and when Deputy Corish was talking about repair kits, that it might be useful if the Minister were to make a regulation that a first aid kit would be carried in each car.  There are regulations requiring the provision of first aid kits in factories.  Every car is a potential death trap and accidents may take place at a great distance from a place where there is medical aid of any description to be obtained.  Lives might be saved and certainly disfigurement of the human body could often be avoided if first aid equipment were available and used almost immediately. I am not one to advocate the multiplication of regulations but a very useful regulation along these lines might be produced and I make the suggestion to the Minister.</P>

      <P>In regard to the various suggestions which have come from Deputies, I can assure them that all of them will be considered in the approach to the making of regulations. I might add that sufficient power exists to cover any and all of the various matters which have been raised.  In regard to the question of number plates, for instance, that would come under the Roads Act, 1920.  It has been pointed out that it is quite obvious that at the moment the regulations which do exist are being contravened. In regard to the colour and description of number plates as set out in the present regulations, that is true.  It is quite clear to anybody who looks <Col N="765" /> around that this regulation is being contravened.  On the other hand, the advent of this Bill has brought about a situation that many of these things which undoubtedly will be covered adequately in future by regulation are possibly being let be for the moment&mdash; a situation similar to that which developed before the advent of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Gardaí and the Commissioner will ensure and insist that the law will be carried out. In fact, as I pointed out to the House, they have already given me the assurance through the Minister for Justice that the law as enacted here under this Bill will get their wholehearted support and co-operation.  I am quite happy to accept that assurance and I have no doubt whatever that rules and laws finally determined here will be applied fairly and without quibble.  I am satisfied on that.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that the matters they have raised in regard to safety belts, number plates, repair kits, first aid kits, advance mobile danger signs and so on will get our fullest consideration.  Indeed, many of these matters have been getting consideration in various ways and are currently being considered by the officers of my Department and Deputies will find that we will meet many if not all of the matters raised here.</P>

      <P>I am not entirely sure that this procedure is one which will improve the operation of the Bill.  A number of people object to the tests which are going to be imposed under Section 18.  If the tests are to be worth while, the greater and more solemn, if you like, official sanction they get the better.  The more you delegate functions, as is being suggested in the Minister's amendment, the more these tests are likely to come under suspicion in the minds of a number of people whose vehicles are going to be tested.  It might be wise for the Minister to consider that aspect of it.  People are going to have their suspicions aroused, anyhow, and that being so, the more official and formal the testing and the issuing of certificates the better.</P>

      <P>The arrangements as proposed in the Bill, without the suggested amendment, would create quite a volume of correspondence and paper work.  Elsewhere and in the nearest available place where such tests are carried out, which is in the Six-Counties, they operate in the manner which this amendment would now propose. From our information as to the experience that has been gained in the Six-Counties in relation to the handling of these tests, what is proposed in the amendment has been found to be a better proposition than what was first proposed in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned when I was referring to the Minister's amendment, there is a certain amount of opposition to this section and there is some information the Minister might give the House which possibly would remove some of the opposition.  Is the Minister in a position to tell the House, in respect of any period that might be convenient to him, what proportion of accidents have been found to be due to unsound vehicles?</P>
      <P>Secondly&mdash;it is purely a point of information&mdash;in subsection (12) of this section it is stated that &ldquo;a person who contravenes a regulation under this section which is stated to be a penal regulation shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo; I should like the Minister to tell the House where regulations are defined as penal regulations in the section; or is that going to be left to the actual making of the regulations?  If it is, I feel we are going even a step further than when we started this process of legislation by regulation in this Bill. We are now going to legislate so that the Minister may not only make regulations under this section, but may decide whether those regulations are to be what are described as penal regulations or not.</P>
      <P>It is worthwhile also to point out in relation to this section that in subsection (2) we are taking what is, and I think should be regarded as, a very unusual step in putting onus for particular offences under this section on the defendant of showing he is innocent rather than the normal procedure where the onus is on the prosecution to show that the defendant is guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> The reason I am drawing attention to that is because I think the House should regard it as a most unusual state of affairs and because I think this section should not be allowed pass without that comment being made.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile pointing out to the Minister also that in subsection (4) of the section the type of provision I sought to have included in Section 11 is in fact included here in Section 18.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked for some statistics concerning accidents for any date we have.  We have the latest available figures issued by the Central Statistics Office and the Garda Síochána for 1959.  They indicate that in that year a total of 96 accidents&mdash; 13 fatal and 83 non-fatal&mdash;were attributable to the use of defective mechanically propelled vehicles.  The defects include steering, brakes, tyres, lighting, towing systems, gears and so on.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Deputy's question regarding the onus of proof is concerned, it would appear to be a change from the existing pattern.  The problem is this.  In all these cases not only will it be extremely difficult to prove an offence, but it will be extremely costly and troublesome, even in regard to what might be described as minor offences.  If we are to make any significant impact on this type of offence, we must have more adequate control in law than we have had in the past. It is on that basis we have had to approach the matter.  To a large extent, that is the reason why we would appear to change the onus of proof.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that once you introduce &ldquo;penal&rdquo;, whether the offence be by section or regulation, we are running into difficulties.  There is a broad principle of law in all penal offences that one is entitled to trial by judge and jury.  If we could have some definition of what a penal regulation is, it might help us.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason some of <Col N="771" /> these regulations only will be penal regulations is that some of them will throw duties in the issue on authority, such as the keeping of records.  That will be enforced by administrative measures, not by a penalty.  This would involve local authorities, where the obvious method of correction would be through managerial action or executive action through local authorities rather than some penalty being applied to the defaulter or offender.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;or unless the defendant produces in Court the certificate signed and stamped by a member of the Garda Síochána at the Garda Síochána Station so named by the defendant stating the date and place at which such certificate was produced to such member of the Garda Síochána and such certificate so signed by a member of the Garda Síochána shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts stated thereon without proof of the signature of the Garda Síochána or that person purporting to be a member of the Garda Síochána is in fact a member of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As amendment No. 29 appears to be related, perhaps both amendments could be taken together and separate decisions could be given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be in agreement with that, since both amendments turn on the same principle.  This is really <Col N="772" /> a matter of what steps ought to be taken to make proof available to a defendant that he has, in fact, produced a certificate at a Garda station.  As I understand the position at present, a person may not be in a position to produce some documents to a Garda &mdash;documents such as the tax-book, his insurance and driving licence.  He may be required to produce those documents at a Garda station within a number of days.  When such a person produces them at a Garda station, the sole record made of that is for some member of the station staff to record in the day-book or some record book that Mr. X on such-and-such a date produced his driving licence, insurance or other document and that is noted in the book.</P>
      <P>If some member of the Garda fails to carry out his duty the defendant may well be imperilled.  Having done what he was required to do, he may not attend court believing that the summons will be struck out.  Even if he does attend court in order to inform the justice that he has produced the licence and insurance certificates he cannot prove that he has done so unless he produces in court the Garda to whom he produced the certificate. In some cases he may be unable to find the Garda to whom he produced the certificate and licence and he must then go through the laborious procedure of having a witness summons served on the Garda in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be held that the situation I have outlined is unlikely to arise. Cases have occurred in the past.  They may well occur in the future.  A commercial traveller who lives in Donegal may be called upon to produce it within ten days at a Garda He may be unable to produce it there and then but he undertakes to produce it within ten days at a Garda Station in Donegal.  Because of the failure of the Garda in Donegal to make the necessary record, because of a clerical error, because of failure to notify the appropriate Garda station in Cork, the unfortunate man may find himself imperilled.  He may find himself prosecuted in Cork.  It may be too costly for him to go to Cork and the only way he can prove to the <Col N="773" /> court that he produced the certificate in Donegal is by having a witness summons issued and having the Garda from Donegal transported to Cork.</P>
    <P>The section provides:</P>
    <P>In a prosecution for an offence under this subsection, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown by the defendant, that he did not, within ten days after the day on which the production was demanded produce the certificate in person to a member of the Garda Síochána at a Garda Síochána station named by the defendant at the time at which the production was demanded.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister will direct better proofs than occur to my mind at the moment, but it seems to me the only way in which a person can prove this is by producing the Garda.  That might be very inconvenient. It could certainly be a very costly procedure.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the person concerned will have a fair chance of proving the matter.  It is provided in amendment No. 29:</P>
    <P>In subsection (1), before paragraph (b), to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) When a person produces a certificate to a member of the Garda Síochána under the next preceding paragraph of this subsection such member of the Garda Síochána shall endorse on that certificate a note saying that such certificate has been produced to him and the date and place where it was produced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 28 it is provided:</P>
    <P>In subsection (1) to add to the end of paragraph (a):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or unless the defendant produces in Court the certificate signed and stamped by a member of the Garda Síochána at the Garda Síochána Station so named by the defendant stating the date and place at which such certificate was produced to such member of the Garda Síochána and such certificate so signed by a member of the Garda Síochána shall be <Col N="774" /> prima facie evidence of the facts stated thereon without proof of the signature of the Garda Síochána or that the person purporting to be a member of the Garda Síochána is in fact a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>If my amendment is entertained, it may be necessary to go even further and redraft other sections of the Bill. We are here to legislate.  If the Minister thinks my worries are unjustified I am prepared to consider his views. I think the amendment is a reasonable one giving the defendant a reasonable chance at much less cost than if the section is passed as it stands.  If the amendment is accepted it will be desirable to have an endorsement on certificates informing holders that they are entitled to and should demand to have the certificate endorsed, stamped, or signed by the Garda to whom it is produced.  It is a very simple solution to a difficulty and one worthy of consideration if we are sincere in our intention to respect the rights of innocent people.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 are complementary.  They relate to enforcement of vehicle testing. Under Section 18 test certificates may be required for certain types of vehicle.  Under Section 19 these certificates must be produced in the same way as insurance certificates at the moment.  To my knowledge and to the knowledge of my Department, no difficulty has arisen in the past on the lines suggested by the Deputy.  I cannot see where difficulty will arise in the future.  I can see difficulties arising if these amendments are accepted. Checks may be carried out in areas remote from barracks.  It would be asking too much of the Garda to carry all the paraphernalia necessary around with them to enable them to examine vehicle test certificates, endorse them and certify that they had examined them on such and such a date.</P>

      <P>Take a man requested to produce a certificate in Cork&mdash;he is pulled in Cork.  Now, his certificate is in Donegal.  He goes back to Donegal and he produces the certificate to the Gardaí or to a Garda barracks; through an oversight the Gardaí in Donegal neglect to notify the Gardaí in Cork that the certificate was produced there and eventually the defendant is prosecuted in Cork.  To prove his defence he would require to bring the Donegal Guard down to Cork.  But if he produced the certificate to the Donegal Guard, the Donegal Guard endorsed on the certificate something to the effect that it had been produced then.  If there was an oversight, when the prosecution would come up in Cork it would be a good defence to hand in an endorsed certificate.  It is merely to facilitate evidence.  Evidence can only be given <i>viva voce</i> in such a case but if we have the certificate, if the Minister would make this certificate evidence <Col N="776" /> by accepting the amendment, it would save considerable expense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the weight of the Minister's remarks but the Minister has not said what his objection is to accepting the amendment.  Why should not a member of the public produce a certificate of any kind to the Garda Síochána and have an endorsement on it to the effect that &ldquo;this certificate was produced to me this blank day of 1961&rdquo;?  As things stand at the moment the only way it can be proved is by bringing the Guard to court.  That might be an easy thing in a station that is manned by a sergeant and two Guards but it might be a difficult thing in regard to a station in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>But you have to produce that in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Putting it in the day book is not a legal requirement; it is only an internal staff regulation; there is no legal obligation on the Gardaí to do that.  Possibly where the number of certificates is going to increase as it is now&mdash;we are going to have certificates <Col N="778" /> of fitness and one thing and another&mdash; I believe it is a reasonable thing to ask that each station would be given a stamp so that all the man needed would be to have a stamp to say that the certificate was produced and the signature of the Guard.  The Minister has said that in most cases the district justice would accept the sworn evidence.  Let us take the case of the man prosecuted in Cork.  He lives in Donegal.  If he happens to be in Galway, or Dublin or Donegal on the day the court case comes up, it is unreasonable to expect him to travel all the way to Cork to give that testimony, and in many cases members of the public do not attend.  Sometimes they send letters of apology and sometimes they presume the case will be struck out.</P>
      <P>Suppose he does attend to give evidence, the justice will adjourn it to a later date to check up if the prosecuting Guard is not satisfied and the defendant has again to go to the inconvenience of travelling to Cork and subpoena a member of the Garda Síochána to whom the certificate was produced.  I appreciate that there have been few cases in which a conviction was made because of the failure of the Gardai to pass the information but I think it has happened.  I would not expect the Minister's Department to be aware of a thing like this but I would say the Department of Justice would have a record of it in the petitions section.  I am informed, I cannot put it any stronger than that, that there is a case on record of a person who did produce an insurance certificate being prosecuted for failing to do so and being prosecuted as having no insurance. He was convicted on both counts and his driving licence was suspended for three months in respect of not having his insurance.  Subsequently he produced the insurance certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may well say that the onus is on the motorist to produce the certificate.  That is so but we here should not be trying to argue over these legal niceties.  We should make it as simple as possible for the person who is in the right to prove his case in all cases.  He should not have to go to <Col N="779" /> court unnecessarily.  It should be open to him to prove his case simply by the production of the insurance certificate or the driver's licence with a stamp on it saying that it had been produced at such and such a barracks. If a dishonest person gets hold of such a stamp and misuses it it would be open to the Guard to prove that that had happened.  That kind of case would be far more rare than the case the Minister has in mind.  It is a simple matter and I would ask the Minister to consider it between now and the next stage.</P>

      <P>There is one thing in Deputy Ryan's approach to this matter which makes it seem to me that he is missing the essential point of the whole business.  The question which he raises can only come up if there has been, in the first place, a failure to produce a certificate.  An insurance certificate should be ready for immediate production.  It is in case of the person who has committed that failure to produce a certificate that he is allowed to produce it at a Garda barracks within 10 days.  That fault, trivial as it may be, is nevertheless a fault in law and I do not think it is too much to ask that person to take his own precautions about it.  I do not think it is too much to ask that person, when he has been given the facility of producing it at any Garda station, whether it be in Donegal or in Cork, to protect himself the rest of the way and to take the necessary steps, in case there may be any danger that the Garda to whom he produced it did not transmit the information, to inform the Garda in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be possible to go too far along the line suggested by Deputy Ryan.  He suggests that it should be sufficient to have the documents stamped to the effect that is was produced at a barracks at such-and-such a date.  There is always the possibility of forgery and the complication of having a number of stamps on a document which would probably entail a lot of administrative work.  The more practical approach is that which the Minister has indicated.  There has been no great evidence that would make it <Col N="780" /> necessary to fall in with what is suggested by Deputy Ryan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is not. There is an onus to produce it within 10 days if I do not produce it at the time I am asked for it.  There is no onus on a motorist, in this section, to carry a certificate of fitness in a car. The section says that he may produce it within 10 days.  We have no objection to that procedure, but it has been known to happen that when you do produce it at a barracks, whether through an oversight or not, the Garda to whom you do produce it fails to notify the prosecuting Garda and you are then summoned.</P>
      <P>Suppose the Garda to whom you do produce it is stationed in Donegal where you live and you are prosecuted in Cork.  It is necessary for you to transport that Garda from Donegal to Cork to prove your defence.  The amendment suggests that when you produce the certificate in Donegal, the Garda there sticks a date stamp on the back of it and that is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that it was produced within the 10 days. It is not the Minister's Department who would know of these matters.  It is the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a petition at the moment before the Minister for Justice in a case where a defendant was prosecuted for having no insurance.  He produced <Col N="781" /> it within 10 days at a Garda station but the station was closed and he produced it to a Garda outside the station. This happened in my own constituency and in what will be the Minister's constituency in the near future.  The evidence of the production of the certificate was not sent on and the summons was served on his mother. He was away at the time and he was fined £15 for failing to produce it.</P>

The position now is that the Gardaí have a warrant for the collection of £15 or 3 months in jail.  He cannot appeal as the time has expired.  All he can do is to petition the Minister, which I have done.  In the meantime, if the Gardaí want to, they can execute the warrant and land him in Mountjoy prison.

      <P>If the Minister needs an elaboration of that, I can give him a better case.  A Garda prosecuted a motorist for parking where he should <Col N="782" /> not be parked.  He was prosecuted and convicted.  Subsequently, the same Garda issued a prosecution in respect of the same man, in respect of the same car, found in the same street at the same time on the same day and the man, presuming he could not be convicted twice for the same offence, did not do anything about it.  He was convicted again and later a Garda came with a warrant to put him in Mountjoy because he had done nothing about the conviction.</P>
      <P>If that can happen where you have one Garda concerned, what can happen where you have two Gardaí stationed far apart dealing with the matter? The problem can be simply remedied by imposing the obligation proposed in this amendment and by making available a very simple form of proof which is not open to abuse, because I think it is extremely difficult to steal equipment from a Garda station though that may be possible in regard to a Garda's house.  I would ask the Minister to have the matter carefully examined. It provides a simple remedy to prevent what might be a very serious situation.</P>

      <P>On the section in general, there are one or two things that worry me and they come into subsections (1) and (4).  It seems to me that we have gone back to the old days in the drafting of subsection (1) (c) of this section.  The subsection says:</P>
      <P>(c) It shall be a good defence in a prosecution for an offence under this subsection if the defendant shows that on the occasion in question&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  he did not use the vehicle, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  he was the servant of the owner of the vehicle and was using the vehicle in obedience to the express orders of the owner.</P>

      <Col N="784" /> SECTION 20.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) to delete all words after &ldquo;combination&rdquo; in line 24 down to the end of the subsection.</P>
      <P>This is the section which gives a Garda an opportunity, where he suspects a vehicle is defective, to hold it up.  The amendment affects subsection (1) which states:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána observes a mechanically propelled vehicle or combination of vehicles in a public place and he suspects that there is a defect affecting the vehicle or combination which is such that it is, when in use, a danger to the public or, in the case of a public service vehicle, there is a defect affecting it which is such that either it is a danger to the public or it is rendered unfit for the carriage of passengers, he may inspect and examine the vehicle or combination and, for the purpose of carrying out the inspection and examination, may do all such things and make all such requirements in relation to it as are reasonably necessary.</P>
      <P>The reason I put down this amendment is that omnibus phrases of that nature are dangerous to insert in a section of a Bill of this type.  They give too much power to a member of the Garda Síochána. It gives him power in this sub-section to &ldquo;do all such things and make all such requirements in relation to it as are reasonably necessary&rdquo;.  It is quite true that the Garda Síochána are a highly trained and a highly disciplined force, but at the same time it is, in my opinion, wrong to give them such powers because it is hard to know when a member of the Garda will be reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that in certain parishes a Garda may take a dislike to a certain farmer or a certain publican and his criterion of what is reasonable varies with whom he is dealing.  It is particularly objectionable when you have regard to subsection (2) which sets out specifically the things a Garda may do and if the Minister, as a result of his <Col N="785" /> experience of the operation of the Act, thinks later that extra powers are necessary for the Garda, he has the never-failing solution of introducing a regulation to deal with that matter.  I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to delete the words as suggested in the amendment.  I would suggest to the Minister that it would make the section a better one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point which is relevant to the amendment which I would mention to the Minister. It is the danger of abuse.  I think that is what the Deputy has in mind in wishing to strike out the words after &ldquo;combination&rdquo;, but I think that is a bit too drastic because you do want to provide for some testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is provided in the next subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the next subsection is just as objectionable, if I may say so with respect, because in the next subsection there is a provision which if it is left in takes all the point out of the deletion in the first sub-section, the question being simply this, that if you do not give certain powers to the Guards under this Bill then a Guard will not be in a position to nail a defective vehicle or a vehicle which he suspects is defective on the spot.  On the other hand, of course, there is the possibility of abuse.  I had a case of a complaint where a Guard attempted to commandeer a vehicle just for his convenience, to get a lift, and when the driver said he would not agree, the Guard attempted, not successfully, to use his powers as a Guard where, in the first instance, he had held the person up on the question of merely asking for a lift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> There are dangers of that nature in this section.  For instance, the greatest danger I see in it&mdash;and it is a question whether it is a serious enough danger to affect the passage of this section, because it must be an exceptional case &mdash;is as to whether a Guard would abuse the powers of this section, say, for getting a lift or something like that. If you consider the risk of that so small as to be negligible then I am afraid you will have to leave the Guard power to do what is in some way or another reasonable in order to carry out these tests.  Otherwise, a Guard will be unable to nail the vehicle at the time and the subsequent state of the vehicle, if he traces it afterwards, may not be quite the same as on the day he questioned it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) gives the general power to the Gardaí to carry out these examinations and inspections and also to make all reasonable requirements that would seem necessary.  If those requirements as requested by the Gardaí in any particular case are not carried out by the owner or driver of the vehicle for the time being, it will be for the court subsequently to decide whether or not the requirement which he refused to carry out was reasonable or unreasonable. If the court holds that such requirement requested by the Guard was unreasonable, then obviously no offence under this item will have been committed.  On the other hand, if it is held that the requirement which the defendant had refused to carry out was a reasonable requirement&mdash;which, again, would be decided by the court&mdash; he would suffer accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I fear and what in essence is at issue here is that if we agree to the deletion of the words as proposed by Deputy Barrett in this amendment we will leave the Guard relying very much on the two words &ldquo;inspect&rdquo; and &ldquo;examine&rdquo; and that that in itself will not be sufficient for the carrying out of these inspections where he suspects <Col N="787" /> that there is something amiss in a particular instance.  To relate it to subsection (2) is not quite an answer because the matters enumerated in subsection (2) are to a large degree examples of what is intended in sub-section (1).  If we decapitate subsection (1) the examples quoted in subsection (2) are not at all as reliable as they would be if we left subsection (1) as it is and did not weaken it to such a degree that it may not be effective at all and certainly will be ineffective in a great number of cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the general principle of the amendment and to ask the Minister if he thinks he is wise in giving this power to every single member of the Garda Síochána. This, in fact, will mean that every single member of the Force is entitled to stop any vehicle, to get into it and to carry out a test as to road worthiness or efficiency.  It is ridiculous.  The Gardaí have not any special training in motor engineering.  I suppose the majority of them do not even know how to drive a car.  They are going to stop an experienced driver, a lorry driver for example, and say: &ldquo;Drive five miles until I see what condition the lights, the brakes, the carburettor and other parts of the car are in&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary course of events, when the roadworthiness of a vehicle is to be tested I presume there will be a member of the Garda Síochána appointed by the local authority to carry out the tests.  There are members of the Garda Síochána carrying out such tests for the purpose of issuing hackney licences.  These are experienced people.  They know when a brake or steering or wiring is defective.  As a Deputy has remarked, some vindictive person may use these powers, perhaps not in the city but around the country.  You can have vindictive people on the two sides and I visualise that where a Guard wants to take it out on somebody he may get him to stop a car and say that he is going to test the car.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If a Guard wants to go a distance of five miles, he is O.K. as long as he meets a lorry or a car. The Minister should have another look at it to see whether or not he is wise in giving this power to every member of the Garda Síochána.  If he confined it to people deemed to be qualified in motor engineering, or who had some experience of driving, it might not be too bad but if any Guard who has just come out of the Depot is entitled to do this, lorry drivers will resent it and there may be a little more trouble than the actual testing of the motor car.  Some experienced drivers who have driven the same lorry for many miles will certainly resent an ordinary member of the Garda Síochána who is not designated for any particular job in regard to motor cars getting him to stop the lorry, sitting in alongside him and carrying out tests.</P>
      <P>If we are to have driving tests and when we have tests for roadworthiness, I do not think anybody will object because drivers will know that the person who is testing them for driving and for roadworthiness has some qualifications but people certainly will resent every and any of the thousands who are now in the Garda Síochána stopping them at any time on the alleged suspicion that there was something wrong with the vehicle, and getting into the car and saying he wants to test the car.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  I do not want to be repetitious but it does seem to me that the words which we suggest should be deleted from sub-section (1) go much too far in relation to the powers and authority which a member of the Garda Síochána should have.  Sub-section (1) of Section 20 enables the Garda to do various things if he suspects there is a defect in the vehicle.  I think that the phrase in the section &ldquo;if a Garda suspects&rdquo; should be altered to &ldquo;if the Garda has reasonable grounds for suspicion&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on an earlier amendment, I would like the Minister to accept the assurance that in putting down these amendments and expressing these points of view on the Bill we have no intention of weakening the code which <Col N="789" /> the Minister wants to set up.  However, we must have regard to the fact that the owners of cars and users of the roads also have certain rights which we should not lightly take away from them.  While it is certainly to be recommended, and it would have our approval, that there should be a tightening up on the road traffic code, we want to avoid creating what may be a police state of affairs in relation to road traffic and to the management of vehicles.  We do not want a kind of Garda dictatorship to grow up where the individual driver or road user has no rights at all and where we in this House would deliberately deprive them of those rights.  It is in that spirit we move this amendment and some subsequent amendments to this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment.  In regard to the point raised by Deputy Corish on sub-section (1), it would be worse in the city than in the rural areas.  On the north side the city does not extend much beyond 5 miles and that provision would make it possible for the Guards to travel free back and forward by stopping any car, bus, lorry or other private vehicle and saying: &ldquo;I suspect your vehicle is not fit to travel on the road.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy ever hear of anybody in the country refusing a Guard a lift if he put up his hand and the driver had room for him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one thing for the Guard to put up his hand and ask a motorist or lorry driver to give him a lift.  The person concerned is entitled to say: &ldquo;I am sorry.  I do not want to give you a lift.&rdquo;  That is an end to it and it is purely a matter for himself. However, this section will make it possible for the Guard to say: &ldquo;I suspect your car is not in order and will you drive it 5 miles the way you were going?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a second point which has been mentioned by Deputy Corish, namely, the qualifications of a Guard to inspect and examine a vehicle and to determine to some extent whether <Col N="790" /> a car is roadworthy or not.  All of us in this House are with the Minister in his attempt to ensure that vehicles will not be on the road in an unfit condition.  If a case arises where it is obvious to the average onlooker or to the average Guard that a vehicle is in a dangerous condition, surely it would be better for the Guard to require the driver to have the car inspected by some garage designated for that purpose? At least it would be possible to ensure in that way that it was properly inspected.  I do not know what percentage of motorists, even those driving cars for many years, would be competent to get in beside the driver of a car, have him drive it up and down the road and be able to say that the car was unfit in certain respects or that it was fit.  This section presupposes that every member of the Garda Síochána will have a knowledge and a competence to do something that many thousands of expert motorists could not do and that is to determine whether the car is fit or not at a particular time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin seems to be missing the point there.  As I see it, what the Minister is trying to do is to give a Guard authority, if he sees a car behaving in an odd fashion, to take immediate action.  Supposing he sees a car or a lorry, which should be slowing up, swerving madly this way and that way across the road and eventually coming to a halt, it is right that the Guard should immediately intervene to try to establish to his own satisfaction whether the car or lorry has brakes or not.  It is not a very technical thing to establish whether the brakes or steering are working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that is required is that the Guard should, taking his life in his hands possibly, sit beside the driver, ask him to start the vehicle and then put the brakes on and see what happens. If the brake pedal goes right down to the floor and the vehicle goes careering on, it does not need much technical knowledge to decide that the brakes are not working, in which case that car or lorry should be put off the road at once.  If the Guard had to say to the driver: &ldquo;I believe your <Col N="791" /> brakes are not working; in fact, I know they are not working; will you now proceed 15 miles to the nearest checking point and ask them to confirm it?&rdquo; that vehicle could cause any number of fatalities on the road with the defective brakes.  Power must be given to the Guard to take immediate action.</P>
    <P>There is nothing technical in finding out (a) will the car stop when the brakes are applied; (b) will it turn to the left or right when the steering wheel is turned left or right?  That is all that is required.  There is no need for a complete check of the suspension, transmission, the engine, or anything else.  All that is required is to ensure that the vehicle is reasonably safe, and the two things that affect its safety are the steering and the brakes and nothing else.  If the car will not accelerate sufficiently that will not make it dangerous, but if it will not brake satisfactorily, it is a menace to other road users.  Unless this sub-section is there in full the Guard would be precluded from doing anything else apart from looking at the vehicle.</P>

It would be a dangerous thing to assume all Guards would be reasonable men and act as reasonable men.  As a principle, we should object to the insertion of a phrase like this in any section.  Deputy Booth knows as well as I do that if you find something like this slipping into a section of a Bill like this, later on it might slip into another Bill and the answer will be given to you that it was put into the Road Traffic Bill in the Dáil in 1961.  It could slip into much more <Col N="793" /> objectionable Bills and could be used in much more objectionable ways than this.

      <P>I share a certain amount of the fears of the proposers of the amendment, but I am not terribly satisfied that a good way to bring this about is to take out the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; in subsection (1).  I agree with what Deputy Barrett has said.  In relation to this type of thing, it is important that we here should delimit exactly what type of examination a Garda, who may not be a qualified person, may carry out, I do not like the wideness of the implications, not only of subsection (1) but of the part of subsection (2) which says &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred&rdquo; in subsection (1).  I would rather see that cut out and the powers of the Garda limited to what is in subsection (2).  Deputy Booth is prepared to agree that those powers are the type of powers that would reasonably be necessary.  I think some people have slightly misread what a Garda can do. As I read it, a Garda cannot stop a car and go five miles.</P>

It is <Col N="794" /> overstating the case and rather spoiling what I thought was a reasonably good case by going to these extreme lengths. The distance a Garda can request a driver to take a vehicle for the purpose of testing it is not stated at all, but it would have to be a reasonable distance. I do not believe a court would ever accept that a reasonable distance would be anything like five miles.</P>

      <P>I have not the Deputy's specialised knowledge of that. I have not any knowledge of district justices, and I hope it will be a long time before I find out about them.  I think the section is drafted a bit widely, considering the type of powers being given to people, a great many of whom are certainly not qualified to do more than test the brakes, steering and lighting.</P>
      <P>It is quite reasonable that a Garda should get in and tell you that your headlights are not working and discover that the bulb is defective.  That type of more or less casual inspection, not involving specialised knowledge, is fair enough; but we should be careful to see that the section gives no more than that power and not leave it as wide as to allow any Garda to purport to be an expert on a mechanically propelled vehicle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make might preferably be raised on the consideration of the section, but it might help the Minister to consider whether a way out of this might not be to provide in the section itself that the person in charge of the vehicle, or the owner, should have the right, if the Guard requires this inspection, to have somebody representing him there, whether it be an expert mechanic or other person, so as to avoid controversy and danger.  That would be a sound requirement in the section itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think that, even as the section stands, there is a danger from the point of view of the Guards themselves, because what the section requires is that <Col N="795" /> they should do anything they think is reasonably necessary&mdash;not what they think, but anything that is reasonably necessary.  If some unreasonable requirement is made by the Guards and damage ensues as a result of it, that Guard is liable to civil action at the hands of the persons involved.  I think the section is ill-thought out.  If the Minister looks at it, he will see that the first subsection provides that the powers vested in the Guards to examine the vehicle are based on the assertion or belief that the vehicle is a danger to the public.  But one of the powers the Guards have in this section is to make the man drive five miles in a vehicle dangerous to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be interesting to know how new this particular provision is.  I think it is not completely new.  Deputy Costello's point is a good one but in relation to subsection (2) rather than the amendment before us.  This section, as a whole, contemplates two things.  In subsection (2) (a) it contemplates the Guard suspecting a vehicle and bringing it somewhere for testing.  That is clearly a different type of thing to a spot check on the road, such as Deputy Booth had in mind, which seems to be provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) and, to some extent, in paragraph (d) of the same subsection.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first, I think it would be a reasonable requirement to say that if the Guard says he suspects this vehicle, then under paragraph (a) you must bring it to such-and-such a place for a test.  Then I think the two requirements should be met, namely, that the test should be carried out by somebody who, on the face of it, is competent to carry it out&mdash;and that certainly will not be any Guard.  It may be a Guard who is specially trained for it; it may be a Guard in a squad car or any official person properly trained for it.  That is a reasonable requirement. I would go so far with Deputy Costello as to say that the driver in that case should have the opportunity of having his own expert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am basing my remarks on the <Col N="796" /> view that what subsection (2) (a) visualises is the bringing of the vehicle to a particular point where tests can be carried out.  That would be in keeping with other somewhat similar situations.  If a man is suspected of being drunk in charge of a car a doctor must be called in.  The defendant is entitled, as far as I remember, to avail of the services of his own medical adviser.  That seems to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>So far as this question of bringing a vehicle to a test point is concerned, the matter should at least be taken out of the hands of the Garda who queries in the first instance.  Take the case of a drunken driver.  If a Garda suspects a driver is drunk, except in a very clear emergency case, he does not rely on his own evidence.  The driver is brought to a police station and there examined.  As Deputy J. A. Costello pointed out, one has to consider the protection of the Garda too. Now, in the case of the drunken driver, the Garda has the advantage of having a fellow-Garda to support him.  There is corroboration.  There is the condition of the accused when the Garda doctor is called in.  That is quite simple.</P>
    <P>So far as this subsection is concerned, I would strongly advocate a similar approach.  Difficulty arises, however, on the second leg of the sub-section where the question of spot checking on the road arises.  Deputy Booth has given an example.  Supposing there is a car which seems to be obviously mechanically defective and the Garda wishes to find out positively what its condition is with a view to deciding whether he will hold up the vehicle or proceed against the driver.  Supposing a Garda suspects something like that in connection with a car in the middle of Grafton Street. He cannot carry out even the simplest check there.  The car would have to be removed a little distance at least.  At first glance it seems reasonable that the Garda should have the power to bring the driver that distance.  But suppose the car is really defective and suppose the brakes are in such condition as to make its removal to a testing place objectionable because of the danger involved; in such a case the <Col N="797" /> simplest and best thing to do would be to restrict the matter to the first case where the vehicle can be brought to a specific test point&mdash;a Garda station or a Garda squad car where another member of the Garda Síochána will come into the picture&mdash;and the matter could be dealt with on that basis.  I do not think that the individual Garda will gain very much by testing a vehicle himself.  I do not think it is fair to the Garda to leave the onus on him.</P>
    <P>Another speaker this evening referred to the very heavy onus cast on the individual Garda.  Supposing there is a Garda on a fast stretch of a not too frequented main road.  Suppose he sees a vehicle and challenges it.  Under the powers conferred in later paragraphs of this subsection he may get the driver to drive the car.  The Garda may decide that he has known better brakes, but the brakes do not seem to be bad enough to warrant his holding up the driver.  He thinks the brakes are all right.  He might like them to be better and he may say to the driver: &ldquo;You might get those brakes tightened up&rdquo; and feel that he has done his duty.  Later on an accident may happen, irrespective of the condition of the brakes.  The driver may run broadside on into a vehicle coming out wrongly on to the main road.  Those of us who have experience of the courts know that the subsequent action will hinge mainly on whether the man who hit the other broadside on could have pulled up in time.  You have the unfortunate Garda in the position that he queried the car and let it go.</P>

      <P>He would.  But consider his position from the point of view of the onus cast upon him.  He may be a good witness for one side or the other, but the entire onus is cast upon him.  Would it not be better to leave the general phrase about reasonableness?  It is much less dangerous than some of the specific powers given later.  Would it not be better to confine the specific powers to those cases where the Garda can immobilise the vehicle there and then? <Col N="798" /> He must have that power because, if the car is really dangerous, the most important thing will be to immobilise it.  He must have power either to immobilise it or bring it to a recognised point&mdash;a Garda station, for instance&mdash;where another Garda or technical expert can corroborate.  In that way the point made quite correctly by Deputy Costello could be met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but there is this to be said in its favour; the Emergency Powers Order was in existence for some time and there was some experience gained during its operation. That should remove some of the doubts that have been expressed both in regard to the section and the amendment.  I listened to part of what Deputy Corish said at any rate, and I am not quite sure whether he wanted the section at all either as it is or amended.  It seemed to me from what he said that he really did not want the section, or conveyed as I understood him at any rate, that the section was not really necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point is that the courts would look undoubtedly at the things specified in subsection (2) and regard them as tests by which to judge the reasonableness or otherwise under subsection (1).  I think it is only right that in a matter such as this, it is the courts that should adjudge whether or not the matter is dealt with reasonably or unreasonably.  I think that the section <Col N="799" /> as it stands leaves this decision rightly to the courts and that it is better to leave it that way than to remove it from the realm of the courts or, on the other hand, that being in the realm of the courts' judgment, we should all feel quite safe that in its interpretation in the courts that it will be interpreted in a fair and just way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister was not here when I made the points I made because I think that Deputy de Valera agrees with me to a substantial extent.  To some extent it disagreed with the point of view put forward by Deputy Barrett but the reason we are here is to find what is best from the public's point of view. The section gives very wide powers to the Guards.  I said on the Second Reading of the Bill that the one thing we must safeguard is that we will secure the general acceptance of these laws by the motoring public and the public in general.  If you have a series of powers given to the Guards that gets, to use the popular expression, the backs up of motorists and people in general these provisions will become liable to disrespect in the eyes of the public.</P>
      <P>In the section as it stands at the moment, the Guard is entitled, or would be entitled if it became law, to require the motorist or whoever is in charge of the car to do all such things and make all such requirements in relation to it as are reasonably necessary. I prefer that phrase as it stands to any other phrase.  At least there is a possibility of checking a Guard and testing what he has done.  If the section provided that he was entitled to do anything that he considers reasonably necessary, I would put every single bit of power and influence I have against giving any such power to a Guard.  The Minister said the court would probably look at the specific powers rather than the wide powers that are actually there but at the same time when you look at the powers as a whole and consider what a Guard can do, they are very wide powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the defence to that?  What <Col N="800" /> does the section allow the motorist to say in his defence?  Can he say: &ldquo;This was not necessary; there is nothing wrong with the brakes&rdquo;?  It will be a question of whose word will be accepted in court.  We all know that the general tendency of district justices is to accept the word of the Guards.  There is no use in going beyond that.  Very creditable people have been turned down in court because a decision in their favour would involve some sort of aspersion on the word of a Guard and the district justice will not do that.  We have to face that situation and it is a matter that should be taken into account in all this legislation.</P>
    <P>I told the story on Second Reading of a friend of mine who did not think he was breaking the law and the Guard told him that if he gave any more &ldquo;guff&rdquo; he would take him down to the station.  That happened to a very law-abiding citizen who thought he was doing the proper thing.  Guards are very human and, being human, they get impatient.  They meet all sorts of people who have queer notions of their rights and they go up and say: &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; They may put their foot on the running board of the car and start to give a lecture and one word leads to another and suddenly the Guard says: &ldquo;Let us have a look at your brakes&rdquo; when at first he had no intention of looking at the brakes.  One thing leads to another and the Guard exercises the power given under the section.  That should not be necessary.</P>
    <P>I am not at all impressed by the Minister's suggestion that because this section is taken from an Emergency Powers Order of 1945 it is a good precedent. In 1945 cars were only coming back on the roads.  They had been laid up during the war.  It was reasonable to suspect that all sorts of derelict motor vehicles would suddenly emerge on the roads and cause danger.  People were disposed to give wide powers at that time when the war was just over and things were not satisfactory from the point of view of the mechanical repair of the car or even getting proper mechanical service in a garage.  People were disposed to put up with regulations <Col N="801" /> of this kind and I am sure the Guards never bothered their heads much about taking advantage of this regulation.  As long as people thought they were liable to be stopped, it was sufficient.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should be asked in this House in normal circumstances to follow as a precedent something that was accepted in an emergency condition which does not exist today.  I think Deputy de Valera agrees with me that the motorist ought to have an opportunity of checking a Guard.  The Guard will <i>bona fide</i> say: &ldquo;The brakes were bad.&rdquo;  That is a matter of opinion but it is a matter for expert opinion and the ordinary Guard, who would have this power to do this, cannot have knowledge of that if he is not a public service vehicle inspector or if he has not training as a mechanic.  There ought to be some power in this section to enable a man if he is challenged to say: &ldquo;Very well; I will leave the car there and get a mechanic to look after my interests.&rdquo;  As Deputy de Valera said, when a man is charged with being drunk in charge of a car, he has the right to have his own doctor so that the case will not be presented in court by a police surgeon without anyone to contradict him.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to reconsider the whole of this section and examine it carefully to see if powers of this kind are required.  At least they should not be as drastic as they are here.  It is of the utmost importance that there should be respect for the law in connection particularly with motor traffic.  You must get the support and co-operation of all sections of the community; otherwise you may throw your hat at the criminal offences that are being created in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to mis-paraphrase him but I am concerned about the later end of the section.  What Deputy Costello said about the code being acceptable as a whole is very important.  His statement in regard to the courts and the attitude of the district justices I think requires a little amplification in this section.</P>
      <P>There is a tendency to say that a district justice or a judge will take the part of the Guard against anybody else.  That tendency implies that there is some form of tyranny. We are not being fair to the public if we give that impression.  The problem which is posed for a district justice or a judge and also for the Garda Commissioner and the higher officers of the force is that the necessary support must be given to the officers of the law, to the ordinary Guards and their sergeants, in the carrying out of their duty.  Unless the Guards and their sergeants are supported by the courts in the carrying out of their duties there will very quickly come a time when it will be impossible for the Guards to administer the law properly.</P>
      <P>We have all had complaints from time to time that sufficient penalties have not been imposed and the Guards have, on occasion, been perilously near to the point of asking what was the use of prosecuting a fellow if he was to get only a nominal sentence.  We must take that point of public policy into account here.  The courts and the higher police authorities and the State must stand up for and support their loyal servants in the carrying out of their duties.  That is an important public principle.  There is another one which both Deputy Costello and I would argue strongly in favour of and that is for the rights and protection of the individual and the ordinary citizen.  That is an equal or paramount principle but whether they are equal or paramount is beside the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our problem in this House is to reconcile these two conflicting principles. I see very little wrong with the wording of the first sub-section.  I would take the same objection as <Col N="803" /> Deputy Costello has taken if it was the opinion of the court that mattered. To my mind the difficulty lies in the other section and I still see myself coming back to the principle that the car should be taken to a particular point for testing and that there should be corroboration.  Both in the interests of the Guards themselves and in the interests of the citizens it is desirable wherever possible to take such specific powers out of the hands of one Guard without corroboration or support.</P>

      <P>By way of further explanation of the intentions of the people who put down this amendment I would refer the Minister to amendment No. 37 in which it is provided in relation to the testing of a pedal cycle that it should be a good defence to show that no defect existed and that the request of the Guards was not reasonable. The effect of this amendment is to ensure that no person would be convicted where the requirements of a member of the Gardaí are unreasonable. It is on that account that it is so necessary to introduce, either by way of deletion or the introduction of a new section, some simple definition. The members of this House cannot be the final judges as to what is reasonable or unreasonable but it could be a most unreasonable request to require a person to drive a car to a point five miles away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be most unreasonable in Dublin where people are tied to a restricted time schedule, where people have appointments from one end of the day to the other, where they have to clock in and out of work and where they are limited to an hour and a half for lunchtime.  It would be most unreasonable for them to have a demand made on them to go to a Garda station, even if it were only a mile or two away, to have the car inspected.  All these things are of paramount importance when you come to determine them but as things stand at the moment sub-section (2) rather limits what the Guards would consider to be reasonably necessary.  It almost suggests that anything that is in subsection (2) is, <i>ipso facto</i>, reasonable. <Col N="804" /> It goes on to say that a Guard may request a person to drive a car to a point not more than five miles distant for testing.  It seems to me that that is curtailing what might be regarded as reasonable.  It seems to me that it is something which ensures that even though a person might be required to drive a car to a certain place he is prevented from putting up the defence that he was asked to do something that was unreasonable.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to accept the spirit of amendment No. 37, is prepared to accept that as the intention of the movers of amendment No. 30 and is prepared to introduce a new subsection to that effect the objections which we have would be removed.  As it stands at the moment rather unfair demands could be made and are certain to be made, human beings being what they are.  There is hardly a day when one word does not borrow another as between decent members of the Guards and decent members of the public.  You are bound to have cases of Guards just showing how tough they can be and how right they can be.  It is dangerous to overload the limbs of the law with wider powers. It is better to err on the side of the individual so long as you ensure that guilty people do not avoid their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>It may be said that if you allowed a passage of time between the actual request for the testing of a car and the test itself that the person concerned could have the vehicle rectified in the meantime.  That might not be a very bad thing.  All we are seeking to do is to make sure that vehicles are safe and that they are not a danger to the public.  Whether a person does it to ensure that he will not fail a test or to avoid a prosecution or a conviction does not matter as long as he has done it.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment in the spirit in which it has been moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with what the movers of the amendment are trying to do, to protect individuals.  Deputy Ryan has just <Col N="805" /> mentioned this passage of time within which the driver might get the car fixed.  I would be terrified that he would use that passage of time to do nothing to the car but to have an accident in the middle of the period. We have got to be careful that the rights of individuals are not unduly trampled upon but who are the individuals in this case?  Are they the owners or drivers or the individuals they may injure?</P>
      <P>It is not just as if they were driving in a vacuum when they are sitting behind the wheel of a car and that they were the only individuals to be considered. Possible victims of their driving must be borne in mind too. For those reasons I should like to see this Bill as strong as possible.  If a person starts to drive what is a dangerous projectile&mdash;and that can apply even when the car is a good one &mdash;he must be given a sense of being somewhat cramped as to what he may do.</P>
      <P>In relation to what a Garda may do in this case, that should be clearly set out in whatever Act is passed by this House.  For that reason, I again suggest that the right way to secure this is to see that in subsection (2) there is given a list of the things a Garda may do and there should be no question of its being left to the generalities of subsection (1).  Sub-section (2) at the moment does no more than give power to do the things that are in subsection (1).  I would agree with Deputy Ryan that the Minister might consider the inclusion of a similar subsection or paragraph as is proposed in the amendment to subsection (8).  Inevitably, in legislation which is dealing with the use of mechanically propelled vehicles, we are faced with the dilemma of ensuring that the user of a vehicle is not being too harshly treated while at the same time resolving we do not lean too far in that direction and tend to create situations where other members of the public may become injured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that this section is no more than a substitute for the suggestion to include in <Col N="806" /> the Bill a proper arrangement for the regular testing of motor vehicles.  Sub-section (1) deals with the situation where a Gárda sees a vehicle in which he suspects there is a defect on a road. It gives him power to do certain things, but in subsection (3) he is supposed to do only what an ordinary garage tester does&mdash;drive around in the car for a certain distance.</P>
      <P>Reference was made during the debate to defective steering and defective brakes and I should like to point out here how difficult it is for a person sitting beside a driver to diagnose a defect in the braking system. In the modern hydraulic brake system, a good driver can get along in a car with very bad brakes by the system of quickly pumping the brake pedal, whereas an inexpert driver would put his foot on the pedal to discover that the pedal was flat on the floor.  That is quite a common feature in modern cars.</P>
      <P>A good driver may make the car appear to have good brakes whereas they may be very bad indeed.  Paragraph (d) of the subsection empowers the Garda to cause to be carried out such tests as he considers reasonable. I think everyone in this House is particularly anxious to see that the public are protected against the use of defective vehicles on the roads and I would agree entirely with Deputy de Valera when he suggested that a Garda should be authorised, if he sees there is a reasonable cause to do so, one or two things&mdash;immobilise the car or direct the person responsible for it to take the car and have it properly tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger about this section is that every Garda in the country, whether he has any competence or not, can be used as a half qualified tester of motor vehicles.  It is desirable to see that vehicles are safe, that they are not in a dangerous condition, but I would submit this is not the way it can be properly achieved.  Certainly it is giving to the Gardaí a great deal of responsibility. As a layman I would say that the fact that it appeared in the Emergency Powers Act of 1945, brought in to deal with a situation <Col N="807" /> where cars had been put up on bricks or stored in garages for years, is the best argument for a re-examination of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Deputy should not forget that in 1945 spare parts could not be had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>And at that time brake rods and other accessories of that kind had deteriorated because of the interval in which the cars had been laid up.  In this case the same justification does not appear to be there although we all subscribe to the view that every effort should be made to ensure that dangerous cars are not permitted on our roads.  This section will not provide that but it will prove a happy hunting ground for over-zealous Gardaí.  We all know that there are a number of over-zealous Gardaí and it is only with a view to the greater protection of the public that I suggest Gardaí should know what their duties are.  These are very wide powers indeed and I suggest that the Minister might consider knocking out the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a small point.  For this section to be effective it must be assumed that every Guard is competent to decide whether a vehicle is fit for use or not.  If a Guard is not so competent he still has the right to decide whether or not a vehicle should be driven to a place not more than five miles distant for testing.  That places a very serious responsibility on the Guard and it is not any exaggeration to visualise a case where a Guard might decide that a vehicle was not safe from the point of view of the public and instruct the driver to take that car to a garage or some other suitable place notwithstanding the fact that the car might not be in fit condition to be driven.  In such a case, where would the responsibility rest if an accident or any other misadventure happened between the place where the car was originally stopped by the Guard and the testing place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a difficult section to draft to cover all eventualities but I think the Minister would be well advised to take <Col N="808" /> cognisance of the observations made on the section.  It places an unfair responsibility on the members of the Garda Síochána and I certainly would like to see some amendments made to the section to ensure that, if a motorist is asked to take a vehicle five miles, the vehicle, first of all, can be driven five miles and, secondly, that if a test is to be carried out, the test must not be reasonable according to the Guard's point of view but must be reasonable according to the motorist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other class of motorist who may suffer very much under this section.  There are certain motorists who take pride in retaining old models of cars.  Not so very long ago a Deputy had an old model.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, but some of these people take such pride in their old vehicles that they insist on keeping them in a very good state of repair.</P>
      <P>It might obviate the necessity for all this discussion if it were a defence that after inspection by the Guard the defendant or owner of the car produced a certificate of fitness issued not more than, say, three weeks prior to the date of inspection.  I know quite good cars the bodywork of which looks dilapidated but mechanically they are sound.  One can visualise such a car arriving in a village or town and every time a Guard sees it he suspects there is something wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe rightly.  In that case a door could fly open.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean the bodywork being dilapidated in that sense.  I am referring to the paint work. <Col N="809" /> Sometimes cars that are used on country roads look more dilapidated than they are.  A burst silencer or a broken exhaust increases the appearance of dilapidation.  A Guard might reasonably suspect that there was something wrong with such a vehicle and one can imagine several of these inspections being carried out in the one day.  If a certificate of fitness of recent date was produced to a Guard it might obviate the necessity for this continuous examination.</P>
      <P>When a Guard suspects that there is something wrong with a car, it is as a result of observation.  While a car may look bad, it may be mechanically sound but the appearance of dilapidation will continue.  I know gentlemen farmers who use the back of their vehicles for the transportation of calves.</P>

      <P>I have seen calves in the back of a car.  There is no doubt that animals have been seen in the backs of cars.  One can imagine a Guard seeing this for the first time immediately thinking that the car is a broken-down &ldquo;jalopy.&rdquo;  That vehicle could be examined several times by different Gardaí on a fair day or market day.  The vehicle may be quite sound.  Its appearance might lead a Guard to suspect that there is something wrong.  If there was a certificate of fitness for the vehicle of recent issue it might obviate all that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is general belief in the minds of many Deputies here that the Guards, who number 6,000&mdash;there are about 250,000 vehicles&mdash;with all the other duties they have to perform, in <Col N="810" /> respect of matters in which there might be said to be some discretion as to whether or not they should busy themselves, will be rushing around to see where they could find a vehicle which they will test without regard to the overall statement in the law that they really must suspect that it has a dangerous defect.  In the first instance, it is intended that any member of the Force will be expected to have regard to the fact that it is where he suspects that there is a dangerous defect and, possibly flowing from that, that that dangerous defect if allowed to go without correction would constitute a danger to the public, a danger to the owner or to people in the vehicle or other road users.</P>
      <P>This on-the-spot check is not really the testing of vehicles as envisaged in this Bill for the first time.  It is merely a supplement to what will become a regular check at stated intervals in regard to some vehicles at the start and possibly all vehicles ultimately.  It is only to supplement that general overall testing of vehicles at stated intervals which will eventually come and that this part of the Bill is directed towards.  There are 6,000 Guards at the most.  There are 250,000 vehicles and the number is still rising and will continue to rise for quite a long time unless something unforeseen takes place.</P>
      <P>Before we go into the details of the rights and wrongs of all the powers that it is alleged the Guards are to be given under these sections, let us consider the relationship between the number of Guards and the number of vehicles on the roads.  Consider also the overall duties of Guards, the onerous duties in all sorts of matters which they must carry out, and I think it will be seen that the fears which have been expressed here are groundless. While there may be grounds for fear in isolated cases there is no ground for the fear that there would be a general check up by Guards in all sorts of places in respect of all sorts of vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at it from the other point of view.  Supposing a Guard is aware that a vehicle in his locality <Col N="811" /> has no brakes whatsoever and is still being used, is it right that the Guard should allow this car to continue to be a danger to the public?  Is it not reasonable that the Guard, with the knowledge that that car has a serious defect, should be able to pull up that machine?  He does not require any real mechanical knowledge to ascertain that a mechanically propelled vehicle has no brakes.  Surely that is not unreasonable and is something which the safety of the public demands?</P>
    <P>In regard to the objection to a Guard making requirements in relation to a vehicle as are reasonably necessary, that phraseology has, I think, been accepted for what I believe it to be.  It will be for the courts to decide what is unreasonable and that question of what is reasonable and what is unreasonable applies to all these various matters coming under this section. In addition to that, although I do not want to discuss it at the moment, may I say that there is an official amendment, No. 38, which further helps to relieve those who take objection to the powers enumerated in the Bill? There is provision that where it is found that no defect exists this will be a good defence in so far as the defendant is concerned in relation to this section of the Bill.  Regard must be had to the fact that the court will decide as to what is reasonable or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Guards are not going to go runing around seeking out whom they may victimise, as seems to be suggested here.  Bringing it down to individual cases, let us suppose that some Guard or another is unreasonable.  It is true that being human, certain of them may victimise people but there is no doubt that they are the exception rather than the rule.  Everybody also knows that where this type of Guard emerges, if he does not soon get himself out of the Force he will certainly find himself out of whatever station he is attached to.  Guards will not take cases to Court and have them thrown back in their teeth because there is no reason why those cases should have been taken to court.  No Guard who has any sense or &ldquo;savvy&rdquo;&mdash;and most of them have <Col N="812" /> quite a lot of both&mdash;will bring to court a succession of cases that are going to be thrown out and ridiculed because they were groundless and should never have been brought.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, and to what I may have said in regard to the Emergency Powers Act of 1955, in regard to spot inspections, under the 1933 Act, in respect of public service vehicles, in all the years since then there has been in existence a law or regulation which is tantamount to what we are passing in regard to all vehicles in this Bill. If there is a fault to be found in regard to that provision it is that the Guards have not operated it often enough or sufficiently rather than that they have overdone the job.  If they have not done it fully in regard to a small percentage of vehicles, surely that is some evidence that it is unlikely they will do it when they get the power in respect of all vehicles and that they will run wild and start checking all of them without any reason whatsover.</P>
    <P>This spot check is something which I regard as a necessary complement to the overall determination in this Bill that there should be vehicle testing as such, that that vehicle testing will become a feature of our everyday motoring life and that ultimately all vehicles will be tested at stated periods and given a certificate if passed.  However, the fact that any vehicle has a test certificate alive, as it were, after a lapse of some months, even a year, it does not follow that dangerous defects may not in the meantime have developed.  If such a dangerous defect is evident even to the bystander, it is only reasonable that, as is provided in the Bill, the Guards should have power to check that vehicle in the interest of public safety.  The reduction of that power by means of the amendment proposed by Deputies on the Opposition benches would defeat the whole intention and would be tantamount to the wiping out of the provision for the retention of which even those who are for the amendment are agreed there are fairly good grounds.  If we pass this amendment, we might as well wipe out the section <Col N="813" /> altogether and the whole intention of it.  There is little further I can add on the matter.</P>

      <P>I do not want to let it pass that we agreed to what the Minister said in reference to the interpretation of subsection (2), having regard to the final words of subsection (1).  The Minister has suggested that the words at the end of subsection (1) &mdash;&ldquo;and make all such requirements in relation to it as are reasonably necessary&rdquo;&mdash;govern the following sub-section. They do not.  There can be no question as to whether the provisions of subsection (1) and the following subsections are or are not reasonable. Because they are specified, they are deemed to be reasonable.  I think if he will allow me say so, the Minister is quite incorrect in putting that forward as an argument in favour of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for most of his speech was pushing an open door.  He was arguing against something not being put forward.  It is agreed on all sides that some power for what he calls spot checks is necessary.  I do not think that the provisions in this section can really be described as a spot check. It is a very elaborate check.  But, leaving that aside for the moment, the real question is this.  There is a necessity for some power to check to see <Col N="814" /> that vehicles on the road are not unroadworthy. Are the powers in this section too wide, or in some respects do they fall short of requirements in the interests of the public as well as the interests of the motorists?</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal with the matter put forward by Deputy de Valera and myself that there ought to be some authority in this section to enable the person suspected by the Guards to have his own mechanic present during the examination of the vehicle by the Guard so that he would then be in a position to check the evidence or check the findings and give evidence in court subsequently.</P>

    <P>Similar information for the year ended 31st March, 1961, is not yet available.</P>
    <P>As to the second part of the question, I am informed that practically all drugs and medicines prescribed for dispensary patients in the Limerick City area are issued by the Health Authority's own compounders at its dispensaries at Lower Gerald Griffin Street and Ballynantybeg.  In addition, the district medical officers for the area carry small stocks of drugs and medicines for administration or issue to eligible persons when urgently required outside the normal dispensary sessions.  I understand, however, that the quantities of these items used in such circumstances are very small <Col N="644" /> and form an insignificant portion of the total issues from dispensary stocks.</P>
    <P>All drugs and medicines are issued by the compounders in accordance with the following method:</P>
    <P>(a) in the case of items prescribed by a district medical officer, the patient is given the prescription on a printed form by the medical officer, which the patient or his representative presents to the compounder at the dispensary;</P>
    <P>(b) in the case of items prescribed by a medical practitioner, other than a district medical officer, for lower income group patients, for example, those patients attending specialist clinics at hospital outpatient departments, the patient presents the medical practitioner's prescription together with his medical services card to the compounder at the Health Authority's dispensary.</P>
    <P>The Health Authority is satisfied that these arrangements ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that drugs and medicines provided for dispensary patients are genuinely used in the treatment of such patients.</P>

    <P>The area of land in the possession of the Land Commission&mdash;in Co.
