      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  On this Vote for Education, embracing as it does all aspects of our educational life and system, it is necessary that a reasonable amount of time, thought and consideration be given to the various headings by the different members of the House who have contributions to make relating to their particular interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this modern world with conditions unsettled and in some parts almost <Col N="883" /> chaotic, to make plans, particularly educational plans, is not an easy task. In view of the great number of new States that have come into being, in view of the increased opportunities on an international basis and in view of the likelihood of very free and full movement of people throughout the world in a very short time, the whole question of education is far more important than it was when it had to be considered within the narrow confines of nationalism, nationalism based on a particular conflict from without.</P>
    <P>We have had a rather extraordinary, a chequered but still a brilliant, experience in education and in contributions towards educational systems made by our people not alone at home but abroad down the years.  It is in the light of that historical background that we must consider the future plans for education and future system, that may be adopted, having due regard to whether these plans or systems can be fitted in as an integral part in a permanent way or whether there should be transitory plans, so to speak, in regard to education.</P>
    <P>As the Estimate shows in its various sub-divisions, education here is divided into various sections of the Department itself under the headings of primary, secondary, technical and university education.  The other branches under the headings of Science and Art, Reformatory and Industrial Schools and the Institute for Advanced Studies, while very necessary in themselves, cannot be regarded as anything more than subsections of the relevant section of the Department.</P>
    <P>Some people would argue that our educational system is static and that our educational system is wrong but it is my opinion that we have not really got anything like the static framework of a system at all.  There is a great deal of well-intentioned and well-meaning groping and probing into the possibilities of achieving something in the various fields of education.  The people responsible for the planning and development of the particular system or systems which we might have in the various fields are operating in an ever-changing world.  I do not <Col N="884" /> for one moment, speaking generally on this matter, subscribe to the view that other aspects of education, the linguistic and philosophic, the classical side of education generally, should be thrown to the winds in the interests of science and that every boy and, possibly, girl in every school should have his or her mind directed towards becoming an astronaut.  There is still great value to be had from the liberal education which is associated with the humanities.  While science in the world as we see it today must be given its proper place, it must not be given that place to the exclusion of something that makes the mind liberal and susceptible to the various humane activities in a civilised world.  A mind can become too scientific and ruthless and forget entirely the proper relationships that should exist between man and man and between nation and nation.</P>
    <P>In the field of primary education there is very much that could be said and perhaps an equal amount that could, with advantage, be left unsaid. Recently the primary teachers failed to achieve a right which they claimed to be theirs and, in my view, justly claimed, namely, the right of parity with other branches of the teaching profession, that is, those engaged in vocational or technical education and in secondary education.  Speaking as one who has had some experience of the various activities associated with the different grades of teacher, the different kinds of training necessary for those grades and the demands made upon the very nature of the person so engaged, I think it is coercive upon anybody who examines the whole question to come to the conclusion that the primary teacher is and must be regarded as a person in the very first ranks of the educational fight, so to speak.</P>
    <P>There are primary teachers on both sides of this House and they know, as everybody else in the House knows, the difficulties that confront the primary teacher of this or any other country when the young mind is first entrusted to him.  I do not mean any disrespect when I compare the duties of primary teachers with those of persons who <Col N="885" /> become capable of lecturing in the secondary teaching world&mdash;because it is a sort of quasi-lecturing; they are delivering a series of lectures and engaging in discussions on text books&mdash; to a mind already trained or that should be trained; nor do I mean any disrespect when I compare the duties of primary teachers with those of people in vocational schools who have developed, through training, a very high degree of proficiency in their arts and crafts and can mould various kinds of articles and finish them from wood, iron or from any other metals at their disposal.  Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the men and women in the primary teaching world who have to mould the young mind of the child from the age of six onwards must be regarded as pioneers and must be accepted as, at the very least, worth parity with people whose positions have been considerably eased for them by virtue of the excellent work that has been done in the primary school before children reach the vocational or secondary school.</P>
    <P>This whole question of parity should not be abandoned at this stage.  The question of parity involves a great deal more than a mere question of status, salary or allowances of any kind.  It involves not only status but morale and the whole question of the type of people who are going to be drawn into the teaching profession.  I have made this point in this House and outside it certainly on more than one occasion and I have never yet heard anybody challenge its validity.  The point is that teaching&mdash;and this is particularly true of primary teaching&mdash;must be based more than anything else on the vocation for teaching rather than on the attainment of a profession which carries with it a salary and security. Admittedly a salary and the security that follows from it are very desirable things in the establishment and maintenance of the family unit but the best results, particularly in the field of primary teaching, are to be gained from the true exercise of a vocation in that field.</P>
    <P>Many people enter teaching and many leave it when they find it does not suit them or for some other reason. The real reason always is that they find <Col N="886" /> they lack that vocation which is begotten of the pioneering instinct to instruct and to mould the most delicate of God's creations, the human mind. To be entrusted with such a task is something that must be considered also, and the person so entrusted must be held in the highest possible esteem. I am pleased to note that the system with regard to recruitment through Preparatory Colleges was abandoned last year.  I look forward with interest to seeing the results of the new system. It is as yet much too soon to assess the value of it or the beneficial results likely to accrue from it.  It is bound to have this excellent result that a person is not called upon at the age of 13 to 15 to decide on his or her future career and can now wait until the secondary school programme at least has been concluded before finally deciding, by which time he or she can have the benefit of his or her experience up to then to assist in making such a decision.</P>
    <P>I want to make two observations in relation to primary education.  The first concerns the amount of time on the school programme for English and the second concerns corporal punishment in the schools.  I think it will be sufficient to say that not enough time is being given on the daily programme of the ordinary primary school in this country for English.  When I say that I do not want, nor do I want to be interpreted as wanting, to oust from the programme the amount of time already given to the Irish language.  Some time must be made for English in some other way.  I do not want to anticipate the ousting of the language in any way from its present compulsory status as envisaged in the future five year plan of the Fianna Fáil Party printed in the <i>Evening Mail</i> yesterday.  However, be that inspired or otherwise, it is a matter to which we can refer only in passing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>While I would not wish the Minister for Education to be retarded in any way on the road to promotion I think that possibly he occupies the most important and the most dignified post in any Government, the post of Minister for Education, carrying with it heavy responsibilities and always the opportunity for innovation resulting from research.</P>
      <P>So much for the amount of time for English.  I come now to the question of corporal punishment in the schools. Considerable publicity attaches from time to time to some court case or other where, according to the newspaper accounts, damages have been awarded by the court against a teacher who is sued by some infant or other through its parents or next friends for inflicting corporal punishment more than was necessary and where there are allegations of cruelty and allegations generally of a very shocking nature.</P>
      <P>The practice in the courts, where insurance companies are involved, is that the insurance company tries to settle at the lowest possible price irrespective very often of the wishes of the person involved as defendant.  How many times do people feel outraged as defendants, say in running-down actions in the law of negligence, when they find that their insurance company agrees to the payment of considerable sums to an intending plaintiff while the defendant regards himself as blameless and firmly believes, often rightly, that if the case went to court the plaintiff would not succeed?  We must consider settlements against that background. Sometimes these things are rather loosely reported&mdash;&ldquo;Damages were awarded&rdquo;&mdash;when in fact there was no award but merely a ruling that was made a consent of court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in the ordinary process of legal action a document called a statement of claim.  Whether it is in a Civil Bill in the Circuit Court or the High Court, there is a statement of claim. In the statement of claim the case for the plaintiff is made out.  I am sure it would come as a surprise to anybody to learn that the case is always made out to the full.  If you have about nine or ten allegations to make, make them <Col N="888" /> and, if you have one or two of them, fair enough, you are doing all right. What the newspapers then get is a copy of the statement of claim, when these settlements come about, and every allegation contained in the statement of claim is taken by the newspaper as proved, as it were, and written in that such an amount was awarded by Judge so and so to A.B. in his action against C.D., a national teacher, for beating him cruelly about the head.  All of the other gruesome details are included there and it appears as if the teacher in fact did that.</P>
    <P>In a great many respects the whole question of corporal punishment must be considered from the point of view of the case of the teacher.  From 9.30 a.m. to 3 p.m., or whatever the time may be, the teacher is <i>in loco parentis.</i> Speaking on the Estimate I think for the Department of Justice I ventured to point out that in the modern world juvenile delinquency or what we call juvenile delinquency is on the increase not because the children are any worse than they were at any other time or their tendencies towards evil are any greater but because there has been a substantial increase in lack of acceptance of responsibilities of parenthood and because there has been adult delinquency.</P>
    <P>There are people here who went to the national school a longer time ago than I did.  However, even in my time if we got punishment we recognised it was deserved in some way.  Consequently, on reaching home, we never dared to make a point of it because we knew the result would be a fresh application of punishment.  Now, it would appear, in this world of modern darlings who are the equivalents of juvenile delinquents, that as soon as a teacher in the proper exercise of his authority administers punishment the darling has to rush home that evening or probably rushes from the school, absolutely flouting authority, during school hours and, while so doing, hurls abuse at the teacher, shouting: &ldquo;What my father will not do to a so and so like you will be nobody's business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Fair enough.  The child is right because, <Col N="889" /> psychologically, he has assessed his adult delinquent correctly.  The adult delinquent arrives hot foot at the school, waving either an ashplant or his fists, or whatever form of threat he thinks will be most effective. Another battle royal ensues&mdash;a battle of words only of course&mdash;right in front of the whole school.  I believe that a parent who behaves after that fashion should be prosecuted for conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace, and have no more fool acting about it.</P>
    <P>Then the parents try to shift the children to another school.  The thing becomes a vicious circle around the usurpation of the teacher's proper authority and the corruption of discipline. In my own personal experience in the courts I was engaged in only two cases in which I acted on behalf of pupils.  I succeeded, and I thought properly so at the time, but the actions did not lie so much in the excessive corporal punishment that had been inflicted as in the fact that the persons who inflicted the punishment should never have been teachers at all.  That is where the distinction must be drawn between the vocation of teaching and professionalism carrying with it a salary and a certain status.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made it perfectly clear that there is too much mollycoddling of these children who, for some reason or another, choose to challenge the teacher's authority within the school.  The teacher's job is difficult enough without his having to deal with challenges to his authority, for purely truculent purposes, and having that piece of juvenile truculence subsequently backed up by the adult, a worse delinquent, coming to the school to kick up a row.</P>
    <P>The national teachers of this country deserve the best the country can give them.  They deserve the support of parents in the exercise of their proper authority within their schools.  I do not like congratulating Ministers from these benches since, were positions reversed, I should be slightly suspect of congratulations I might receive from this side of the House.  I do, however, want to congratulate the Minister on his <Col N="890" /> handling in this House and with the public of matters relating to corporal punishment.  I do not agree with the infliction of so much corporal punishment as does injury.  Very often, where injury is inflicted, it is not intentional and it is not deliberate.  Where injury does result the probability is that there was some inherent weakness of which the teacher could not reasonably be expected to be aware.</P>
    <P>There must be give and take on both sides.  It is time the parents took less notice of the cranks, administered punishment in their own homes and applauded teachers for doing the same in the reasonable exercise of the discretion afforded to them.  Let us have no more of this nonsense about the great liberal approach, with children running around as freely and as undisciplined as animals.  Let there be an end to these circulars&mdash;issued at whose expense, I do not know&mdash;asking public men for their views on this, that, and the other, when the views of the people who issue the circulars are already well known.  I know I shall bring a hurricane of abuse down on top of me, but I am speaking sincerely here.  This is an election year and perhaps that may deter certain people hurling abuse.</P>
    <P>On former Estimates I have appealed here&mdash;I made the same appeal to Deputy Mulcahy when he was Minister for Education&mdash;for the mechanics of teaching to be taught in the training colleges.  In Dublin&mdash;in Limerick, too, when Deputy O'Malley gets his University there&mdash;teachers in training should be brought to the universities for certain courses so that they might have a more liberal training and the benefit of meeting and exchanging views with more and more people in different spheres in the different Faculties.  The Church of Ireland does that.  They send their student teachers to Trinity College.  I see no reason why the students in Saint Patrick's in Drumcondra and Carysfort should not be afforded the same opportunities. It would, of course, begin in a small way until it could be properly developed.</P>
    <P>A considerable advance has been made in secondary education and there <Col N="891" /> has been a marked increase in the number of people seeking secondary education for their children.  There has also been a concomitant increase in the number of schools.  I have no fault to find with either the curriculum or the end result.  Neither do I wish to quarrel with the curriculum in the vocational schools.  An excellent job is being done all round.  In the reformatory and industrial schools&mdash;I speak subject to correction now &mdash; there should, I think, be a great segregation. There are degrees of crime and there are degrees in the tendency towards crime.  There are people who will never be reformed no matter what one does. There are others who have had one lapse.  It is the first and the last.  I believe there should be segregation as between these two types.</P>
    <P>In the whole field of education we can look forward to new advances. Either last year, or the year before, I said that, with the advent of the Common Market, the position of Irish, the effort to restore it, and preserve what there is of it, would become increasingly difficult.  That situation obtains with equal force today.  I am opposed to the idea of compulsion or anything that is described as essential with regard to any language.  Education always operates at its best when there is a free choice.  On the other hand, where there is compulsion against something, we in this country have always had a tremendous capacity for opposition.  Our capacity to oppose is much greater.  Certainly, it seems to be more of an incentive than our capacity to construct.  That will be a matter that will cause a headache to the present Minister and any future Minister and his officials in the years to come.</P>
    <P>There will be that necessity for modern European languages in use generally in commerce, trade and the ordinary intercourse of international relations.  That is something that has to be watched and looked after.  If the idea of compulsion no longer is attractive, possibly when the Common Market idea develops you might have people, who are now rather indifferent towards the whole idea, developing an <Col N="892" /> interest in promoting the Irish language so as to be able to use it and to show that they can use it to the French, the Germans, the British and all the other peoples of the Common Market countries.  That might be the kernel of real success in keeping, side by side with other languages, our own language.</P>
    <P>One thing is certain.  We will never keep our own language to the exclusion of others.  We cannot.  It would be idle to pretend in this changing world, with the regrouping of nations and peoples, that we can isolate ourselves behind a wall, merely speaking one language and not bothering about anything else that happens.  I used to say I was an unrepentant bi-linguist.  Now I have to alter that and say I am an unrepentant multi-linguist.  There is no point in the world in our isolating ourselves.  We are being unfair if we prevent the people of the Gaeltacht areas, when under the present scheme of things&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;present scheme of things&rdquo; I am not speaking politically at all&mdash;emigration seems to be the main attraction for them from being competitive in the language they speak.  It is unfair to put them at a disadvantage when they go to England, America, New Zealand or any other country to which they have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>That sentiment was expressed in the heart of the Gaeltacht at the end of Irish Week in Tourmakeady recently when a young man said in the presence of the Minister for the Gaeltacht that he thought we did not teach enough English in the Gaeltacht and that the people going away were at a disadvantage. Without going into any detail, it is very easy to understand how they could be at a disadvantage.  Those of our people who suffered from such a disadvantage in the past made up for it by attending night schools, universities, law schools.  That is particularly true in America and in England, too, although we do not hear so much about it.  Some of them achieved remarkable success but it was only by their own endeavours and in spite of the impediment which had been placed in their way in their own country.  The Minister has a tough assignment ahead of him.  All we would ask him to do is to take full cognisance of the ever-changing world, particularly of the <Col N="893" /> situation with which we are likely to be confronted if and when our terms are accepted and we go into the Common Market, and to consider the impact that will have on all aspects of our life, including education.  If we do that and make adequate arrangements, I believe the machinery of State will continue to operate as smoothly as it has done before.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say a word of appreciation of the officials of the Minister's Department.  That does not mean I am leaving the Minister out.  Possibly no other Minister has ever succeeded in getting away with so much by merely smiling at the fellow trying to trap him.  Be that as it may, a pleasant approach has its own merits&mdash;a lot of merit indeed.  I want to say to the people for whom he is responsible&mdash;the civil servants in their various branches with whom I have come in contact over the year&mdash; that I always found their approach was helpful and constructive and that if there was anything that could be done to ease any problem, it was always done and done properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to congratulate the Minister on the achievements during his period of office.  It is generally recognised that in the present Minister we have one of the most outstanding, conscientious, fair minded and successful holders of that office that we have had for some considerable period.  But you cannot please everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain aspects which the Minister might clarify when making his reply.  One point that has created a deal of agitation was the report of the Commission with regard to the question of parity of the national teachers.  There was a suggestion that the Minister, and through the Minister the Government, came to a decision with indecent haste. The suggestion in some of the daily papers is that the report was presented on a Monday and the Government implemented it on a Thursday, to the detriment of the national teachers.  I do not think that was the case.  I discussed the matter with a responsible member of the National Teachers' Organisation.  I understand, and this <Col N="894" /> is a most important point, that this report was not before the Government for only two or three days but that, in fact, it was studied for many months.</P>
    <P>This question also arises.  If a commission is set up, why should the Minister and the Government of the day not take the advice of that commission, even though it is against somebody? In other words, why set up a commission if you are going to pre-judge and come to certain conclusions without considering the opinions of the commission? When refusing parity, it should be brought home that the decision, with the exception of the representatives of the national teachers, was unanimous.  I do not subscribe to the view of the commission that there should not be parity between the national teachers and the secondary and vocational teachers.  It is entirely incorrect and I would go so far as to disagree with them.</P>
    <P>The day must come, if the dignity of the National Teachers' Organisation is to be preserved, when they will be granted parity and I do not think that day is far off.  No member on any side of the House could but agree that everything national down the years has had members of the I.N.T.O. at the forefront, particularly in the days when it was not popular to be associated with such matters of national progress.  I hope that the Minister will in time grant parity and do away with what in my opinion is a grave injustice. I have already pointed out that there has been misrepresentation with regard to the recommendations of the commission.  For the record those should be put right and it should be formally established in the minds of the 13,000 or 14,000 of the members of the I.N.T.O. that the matter did receive consideration.  The extraordinary fact should also be brought home to the public that there were members &mdash;very outstanding and responsible members&mdash;on that commission who were school managers who signed the report recommending that parity should not be granted to the national teachers.</P>
    <P>I am saying this to urge the <Col N="895" /> Minister to go into a little more detail in his reply.  It is not for political purposes that anyone would advocate parity for the teachers; it is common justice.  Is it not a known fact that the majority of national teachers, all things being equal, have a much better education than some of the people in the secondary schools?  It is a peculiar state of affairs that a person can come along qualified to teach in a secondary school with the minimum amount of education at a higher salary scale than a national teacher with better qualifications. This is one of the fundamental weaknesses in our educational system. Of course consideration has been given to the matter but I am not clear about the reasons and the members of the I.N.T.O. are not clear.  Some of them, evidently, are clear, but for political purposes wish to attack the Minister and, through the Minister, the Government.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that quite a large body of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation was a political section, an anti-Fianna Fáil wing for quite a while.  That is a fact.  However, that is no reason why if there is a preponderance of anti-Government members in a national organisation it would entitle the Government of the day to use the argument: &ldquo;We will have a crack at these fellows now.&rdquo;  I would not agree with that logic and I do not believe that was the sentiment when this decision was arrived at.</P>
    <P>I take it that if all the members here were to sit on this commission on this question of parity for national teachers, everybody would support it.  There were people on that commission who, prior to their appointment, spoke at I.N.T.O. dinners and were quoted in the public Press as saying that the day was not too far off when the I.N.T.O. would be granted parity.  Some of these people, recorded in the public Press as having those sentiments, signed the report refusing to recommend parity for the national teachers.  Two who signed the report in favour of parity were the two members of the I.N.T.O.  However, as I said, the Minister may throw further light on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister under the heading of <Col N="896" />&ldquo;Technical Instruction&rdquo; referred to the question of improvements in the Gaeltacht area and said plans were drawn up for the enlargement and reconditioning of housing.  Instruction in the installation of water supplies and sanitation was given, as was also basic instruction in the building trades. In other words, people in the Gaeltacht districts were encouraged to improve their dwellings to accommodate visitors.  I feel that there should be some <i>liaison</i> between the Minister's Department and Bord Fáilte.  At present a guest house, <i>per se,</i> in Ireland, apart from the Gaeltacht, does not qualify for any grant or loan from Bord Fáilte unless it is registered as an hotel.  That is a serious defect particularly when one bears in mind that the highest percentage of people who leave Britain annually on holidays come to Ireland.  It is calculated that 80 per cent. of those visitors coming to our shores would be classified as the working class population of England, Scotland and Wales. These are not the people who are going to stay in the luxury hotels, the Grade A hotels and the new hotels.</P>
    <P>I might say that while Bord Fáilte are carrying out their responsibilities in regard to the provision of extra hotel accommodation they are not conscious of that fact that we are at a loss because the guest houses mentioned by the Minister do not qualify for these grants.  Instead of the Minister's Department having, through the vocational teachers, to educate the people in the locality on how to do the work themselves, if that category qualified for the grants and loans of Bord Fáilte the Minister's difficulty would be solved.  There is too much of an overlap and an exchange of views between the Minister's Department and Bord Fáilte might have satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of teachers in the House this morning, naturally, when we are dealing with this important Estimate.  I should like to put forward a view which could be rather revolutionary in different aspects of our economy.  Most of our schools close from mid-June to the middle of September&mdash;at least those <Col N="897" /> which follow the Irish pattern, and do not ape the British with their Junior Oxford and schools which do not close until the summer is over, close for the summer period.</P>
    <P>At Old Boys' annual dinners&mdash;I do not think nuns have old girls' dinners &mdash;we hear the rector for the time being, or the President of the Old Boys' Association, like my colleague, Deputy Russell, annually regretting the fact that the contribution from the State is not sufficient, and pointing out how hard it is, nowadays, for boarding schools to make ends meet.  I have heard people speak about the lack of hotel accommodation and Mr. Tim O'Driscoll, Director General of Bord Fáilte, has also spoken about the acute lack of accommodation for tourists.  My suggestion is that these schools should be utilised for holiday accommodation as hotels or hostels.  That would be an economic factor in the period between mid-June and mid-September.</P>
    <P>The boarding schools have everything. People need not necessarily go down to Kildare, but there are some beautiful buildings within easy reach of the seaside.  There is a school for sale in Donegal which cost a couple of hundred thousand pounds, and could be bought for about £30,000.  There was a fine school in Threadneedle Road in Galway called St. Enda's.  I think his Lordship the Bishop of Galway got it&mdash;how I do not know. This suggestion might have a very important reaction and effect on the economy of the schools themselves. They have kitchens, dormitory accommodation, and many of them have private rooms for the staff who would be on vacation.  They have everything laid on.  There would be the possibility of booking tours in advance to these places.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Chairman of Bord Fáilte that there is a serious impasse which will take many years to put right.  We are losing thousands and thousands of tourists every years, and here we have ready-made accommodation lying idle in the summer months every year, which could be utilised to the financial betterment of the establishments themselves, solving a crisis in the tourist industry and bringing a <Col N="898" /> much-needed amount of prosperity to certain outlying rural areas.  Is there any Deputy who does not know of outstanding buildings such as training colleges and boarding schools which, in the summer months, would be ideally suited to that purpose?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and a few old ones.  I should like to deal with another matter which has nothing to do with me.  I refer to the dispute in Ballina which has hit the headlines recently. I have not the slightest intention of going into the merits or demerits of the case.  I prophesy that when an impasse has been reached and both parties are making certain allegations, and the man in the street does not know which is true or what is the correct position, all fruit failing, an attempt will be made to make the Minister for Education the scapegoat.  One of the parties will suggest it is the responsibility of the competent Minister to step in&mdash;he will be a foolish man if he does step in.  I prophesy that will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to make another point and perhaps, when he is replying, the Minister will be good enough to refer to it.  I do not know whether the one-day school is unique to Limerick city or whether it operates in other areas. The position is that there is a statutory obligation on employers of children of a certain age to send them to vocational schools for one day in the week. Many of these children contribute to <Col N="899" /> the finances of their families, and also it does not suit certain employers to send them to school.  If a boy has a job he may have to go to the technical school on a busy day and that will not suit the employer.  In any event, he cannot learn very much in one day.  The Minister should have another look at that position.  Possibly he could make it a statutory obligation on the parents to send the child to the technical school for at least one night a week. That would take them off the streets. The position is quite impossible at present, and employers have made many representations on the subject to public representatives.</P>
    <P>There is one last point I want to make.  I was surprised that the Minister in his introductory speech did not make any reference to the University Commission.  I suppose he could not say very much about it because it is established and I understand that they are carrying out that work in a very responsible manner.  He could have told us, however, that they visited certain places in the North, in Britain and on the Continent.  The public would like to know these things.  That University Commission met the Minister in the usual way at the beginning, but, for all the man in the street knows, that Commission might never have met since, which is not a fact.</P>
    <P>I do not want to try to influence this Commission in any way because they are having hearings in the different areas.  I understand that they are coming to Limerick to take evidence. They were very impressed with the case put up by the body who are agitating for a university in Limerick. I understand that they propose coming to Limerick city, to sit there and take evidence from the interested parties and make recommendations to the Government with regard to the question of new universities, which is one of the points in their terms of reference.</P>
    <P>A commission reported previously. I do not know what it was called but it reported with regard to university education a couple of years ago.  In that report, the acute problem of the Agricultural College in Glasnevin was <Col N="900" /> gone into in great detail.  The President of University College, Dublin and the Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture in University College, Dublin, pointed out that the situation not only of that college but of the entire Faculty of Agriculture in this area was in a critical condition.  They could not acquire further land.  They were a type of oasis out in the middle of a housing scheme. The accommodation was totally inadequate and an immediate decision was necessary.  Commission or no commission, this has nothing to do with the setting up of a school of agriculture forthwith.</P>
    <P>Another important point is that we all know that University College, Dublin, have got permission to proceed with plans.  An architectural competition is taking place for the design of the new university.  It is very interesting to note that there is no provision whatsoever in the schedule of that accommodation for one building for the Faculty of Agriculture.  You have all the other Faculties, engineering, medicine, architecture, commerce and these 101 other things, but there is not one provision out there&mdash;and rightly so, in my opinion&mdash;for the Faculty of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach spoke at Mallow.  The tenor of the speech of the managing director of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann was that agriculture was the backbone of our economy.  We cannot turn out top-class key men if the Faculty, as has been said by the President of the University, is collapsing and if the Albert College buildings at Glasnevin are falling into disrepair and the accommodation entirely inadequate.  Cork and Galway are no better off because, as we know, students have to come up from Galway and Cork to Dublin to do their final year for the Bachelor in Agricultural Science degree.  The position is critical and demands immediate action.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to criticise.  I should be very pleased, naturally, to see a school of agriculture established not so much in the Limerick area necessarily but anywhere in the Golden Vale of Munster.  There is one point made by the Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture and the President <Col N="901" /> of University College, Dublin, about Glasnevin.  Even if they had the land up there, which they have not now as there are housing schemes there, they could not have pilot schemes on the land.  The land out there is not typical of Irish farms.  It is quite obvious that you could not have a pilot farm in the Glasnevin area of 50 or 150 acres.  It is not suitable but you have that type of land in the neighbourhood of Limerick, Tipperary or the borders of Kerry.  Apart from the U.C.D. buildings, this will have to be tackled.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister is of the opinion that this Commission are going to deal with recommendations in regard to the Faculty of Agriculture. There is no time limit, and rightly so, as to when this Commission should bring in its report.  Would I be right&mdash; the Minister can only hazard a guess &mdash;in saying that it could take another two years?  Would I be right that it could take another six years before this Commission reports?  I may, perhaps, have a solution to the problem. I am sure that the Deputies with whom I discussed the matter will agree with me.  Would it be in order for the Minister to request this University Commission to issue an interim report expressing an opinion as to the solution of the critical position of the teaching of agriculture in the universities and the provision of accommodation? That could all be done in three months.  It is one of the prime tasks with which the Minister is confronted. If he leaves it until this Commission brings in its report, I respectfully submit that the Minister would be neglecting his duty and the officials advising him will be carrying a very serious responsibility.</P>
    <P>A lot of criticism was levelled, and rightly so, in certain instances, at the junta running University College, Dublin.  Be it to their credit, they have gone on the records of this House as well as on an official Government Commission's report as drawing the attention of the country to the serious plight of the Albert College in Glasnevin which is catering not only for Dublin and the huge contiguous area but to the final year students in the rest of Ireland <Col N="902" />&mdash;the areas served by the constituent colleges of Galway and Cork.  The House and the country will be amazed to know that the agricultural industry in this country is being starved of graduates because there is a staggering of the final year students and in certain instances they have to take their lectures in converted outhouses.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about the Common Market from bodies such as the National Farmers' Association and Macra na Feirme and about the possibility of our joining it.  We hear a lot of talk from those organisations about agriculture being the backbone of our industry in this country.  I say now that we are in a very serious plight unless this problem is tackled forthwith. There is only one way to do it, that is, to erect a new independent agricultural school.  I do not care where it is put up.  Let my area stand on its own merits.  All I am interested in is that such a school is established quickly because if the Commission do report in favour of this new agricultural school, as they must, the existing Charter of the National University of Ireland would have to be changed possibly. Then there is the question of finding the money.  I do not imagine there would be any great difficulty about the financial end of it but the question could run into time.</P>
    <P>That is the sum total of my contribution. As I said at the outset, the Minister for Education has, on the whole, given entire satisfaction, with the exception of the points I have raised in my contribution to this debate.  He has been most amenable to reason.  He has been ready to hear all sides and though on all occasions we have not agreed with his decisions, at least he came to decisions unlike some of his predecessors on both sides of the House, some of whom never reached a decision on anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is one which mainly interests teachers.  It is shop to them as other Bills are shop to lawyers.  I have not had the advantage of a higher education but I suppose I made up for that in some way in the hard field of experience.  It is on that point I want to touch in opening my remarks in this debate.  The Department <Col N="903" /> caters largely for education of an academic nature.  One can be educated in that way but still lack intelligence. I have met many people who had superior education but I could never understand them making a point and they could not understand a point themselves. They lacked discernment, their education being merely superior, without depth.  The children in the higher grades of primary schools should therefore be encouraged to specialise in discussion as part of their curriculum. There should be such things as organised debating and discussion classes so as to sharpen their minds.</P>
      <P>It is amazing the number of people, alleged to be educated, who cannot argue a point or make one clearly to see one.  The Minister, I repeat, should get children to specialise in a type of education that would train their intelligence. I am interested in the type of education imparted in the primary schools because I believe the vast majority of children leave school between 14 and 15 years of age.  Several children go on to secondary schools but a very small proportion of those follow through to the Leaving Certificate. The vast majority of them leave after a year or 18 months.  Accordingly, most of the children who leave school do so with a primary education only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the question of too much Irish in the schools.  I am not opposed to the language, but at the same time I ask of what utility will a knowledge of Irish be to most of the people in this country?  I can look back over the past 12 months and in that period I have heard only two children talking in the Irish language since I spoke on this Estimate last year.  What is the Minister's answer to that?  He will, of course, say that people do speak Irish at all times in certain spheres of life.  My reply to that is that I am referring to the ordinary people throughout the country.  Many children leave the primary schools at school leaving age because of the compulsion to learn through the medium of Irish.  Therefore, they have no education.  I think the Minister should provide that Irish will be taught only as a subject in the primary <Col N="904" /> schools.  That could be improved on later in the case of children going on for higher education.  As it is, the reason many children leave primary schools at the moment practically illiterate is this necessity to learn everything through Irish.</P>
    <P>The whole trend nowadays is towards a common language.  In the past 12 months, control of Radio Éireann has been handed over to a new authority whose main concern will be to make the business pay.  Naturally, therefore, they will not be thinking so much in terms of Gaelic as in matters of finance.  We have been told Common Market membership is near at hand and as travel and intercourse around the world become easier, the whole stress will be on a common language as distinct from separate languages.  It would be a crime, therefore, if, through our educational system here, we lost a good working knowledge of the English language. Whether we like it or not, it is a language of great importance to this country because of our nearness to Britain and the fact that so many of our kin live in the United States.</P>
    <P>I would again ask the Minister to stop turning out so many illiterates from our schools when he knows that the vast majority should be attending school still after 14 or 15 but are discouraged from doing so because of the necessity to do everything through the medium of the Irish language.  As I said earlier, speaking from personal experience, I am amazed at the ignorance of children nowadays.</P>
    <P>Last year, I drew attention to the fact that there was still a great scarcity of schools in the built-up areas, particularly in Dublin.  While I agree great work has been done, nevertheless large numbers of Dublin parents still have to send their children to schools in the centre of the city and while I am aware there are school buses at cheap fares, a large number of children cannot avail of them because they do not go anywhere near the schools.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the question of finances.  The Minister should use his good offices with C.I.E. to see that children are not stopped from attending schools because they lack the few <Col N="905" /> pence.  I know that children fail to attend school sometimes because their parents have not got the couple of pence, particularly during the lean part of the week.  In my opinion, the fact that the parents have not got the few necessary pence should not be allowed to stop children attending school.  Children ought to be able to travel for a penny.  During the year, I asked a supplementary question on the matter of corporal punishment in schools.  The case I mentioned was of a girl of eight years of age, a quiet mannerly girl, who got a box on the jaw because when another girl's name was called in Irish by the teacher, she answered.  There were no grounds whatsoever for boxing that little girl on the jaw.  I can understand Deputy Lindsay's point that many children are bold and deserve to be punished but here and there you get a teacher who has a sadistic touch in his or her make-up and who likes to box people around.  I hope the Minister will watch out for that sort of teacher.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point made by Deputy Lindsay, that some teachers are not in the business because of their love of it but because of the money.  It is not their natural vocation.  I agree that happens.  I know teachers who are engaged in business to such an extent that they are more interested in business than in the vocation of teaching.  Possibly that type of teacher would be irritable and too free with his hands.  If he were naturally inclined towards the vocation of teaching, probably he would have understanding and would not inflict punishment except where it was desirable.  In the particular case I mentioned, there was no justification.</P>
    <P>All of us have bees in our bonnets about some matters affecting various Departments and this is the bee in my bonnet&mdash;the lack of physical training in our schools.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;In any proceedings for an offence under section 49 of this Act the court shall have regard to any evidence which may be given of the proportion or quantity of alcohol which was contained in the blood of the accused in excess of .5% as ascertained by analysis or measurement of a specimen of blood taken from him with his consent; provided that if it is proved that the accused when so requested at any such time refused to assent to the making of such test or measurement his refusal may, unless reasonable cause therefor is shown, be treated as supporting any evidence given on behalf of the prosecution or as rebutting any evidence given on behalf of the defence with respect to his condition at that time&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Dr. Browne).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned, we were dealing with the amendment in the name of Deputy Dr. Browne and I was putting to the House the view that this matter, like many other matters involved in this measure, is one on which, if possible, I think we should avoid a division by way of a vote in any way we can, in order that there should be no divided opinion either inside or outside the House on the entire measure.  We are dealing with the matter of blood tests and also, as suggested in the amendment, with the setting of an arbitrary figure for the percentage of alcohol in the blood, a figure beyond which would imply incapability due to taking intoxicating liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, my view is that the reliability of tests as carried out in other countries at present is not as complete or absolute as one would like it to be if these tests were to be introduced here.  Further, the setting of an arbitrary figure for the allowable alcoholic content of the blood is something which I think would give rise to discussion, division of opinion and controversy, no matter what figure might be decided on.  In view of that and because of consideration given to the Bill <Col N="907" /> before it came to the House and before this amendment was tabled and from the information available to me and to the Government, it is our belief that blood tests and the setting of an arbitrary figure are matters which we would not be wise to include in the Bill at this juncture.</P>
    <P>The view expressed, particularly by Deputy Dr. Browne and supported by many others, is that this amendment should in fact be carried and that the tests and the arbitrary figure should be named in the Bill.  Not wishing to have any division of opinion here, if it is possible, my view and the view of the Government is that this matter can be kept under review and dealt with when we feel that the evidence from the operation of the blood and other tests for alcohol and drunkenness in other countries is sufficiently complete to indicate that these would be useful, conclusive and fair tests.  We would then intend to bring some amendment to the House.</P>
    <P>It is also my opinion that because of the difficulty of arriving at conclusions in regard to this rather highly technical matter of the formula or calculation arising from the blood test or breathaliser or anything of that kind, the matter could possibly be better dealt with by a committee or commission which would go fully into all aspects of the matter and consider all relevant evidence ascertained or ascertainable. Such evidence will be ascertainable to a greater degree in the future as a result of experience elsewhere. That method of arriving at a solution to the problem raised in this amendment would be far better.  Such a committee or commission, I consider, should represent the technical and medical people and the Garda Síochána and should take evidence from the public or anybody interested. In regard to hearings, whether by committee or commission, they would give notice to the public of their intention to do something on these lines and thereby give the public an opportunity of indicating what they feel should be done.</P>
    <P>As I said before, this matter has not been published in the White Paper circulated <Col N="908" /> with a view to sounding public opinion, and the lack of any publication is one of the reasons&mdash;not the only reason&mdash;I should be very reluctant to go ahead and accept an amendment in the form now before us.  I suggest that the House should go with me in the view that this matter could be better dealt with by a committee or commission. I believe that would be the better and the wiser course.  Ultimately, we would have a better all-round Bill than if we were to insert at this Stage this amendment which is very far-reaching in its effects and would be a most controversial insertion in the Bill, particularly as the public have not been given due notice of it as they were given of the other intended proposals in this measure as appeared in the White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong the discussion on this very long Bill.  I agree with the Minister it would be very much more desirable if we had a public debate or consideration of this whole question arising out of the circulation of the White Paper.  I am very much surprised it was not included at that time because it would be a great help to all of us and would be very much more likely to be satisfactory if we had the views of the various voluntary bodies and other interested parties.  All I can and must do, in this very limited way, is go on the experience of other countries who have had the test for varying periods of up to between 30 and 40 years, Norway, I suppose, being one of the earliest.  I am naturally surprised that the Minister and his advisers have not gone on the experience of various other countries such as Norway, Denmark, the United States, Canada, England now, and to a limited extent, Scotland, because a case would appear to have been made by the fact that these tests have been retained so long in these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the precise wording of the amendment or the percentage of alcohol mentioned, I am not at all committed in any way.  What I was really concerned with in putting down this amendment was primarily to get a debate on the matter and to try to have the general principle of tests inserted in the Bill in whatever manner <Col N="909" /> the Minister felt was best.  Like the Minister, I would prefer a step by step approach to this question because it is a very serious one in many ways.  The problem we are dealing with is a very serious one, however, the question of drink, its influence on driving and death on the roads.  Therefore, a positive step should be taken at this stage. The Minister knows as well as I do that one of the oldest devices in the whole history of parliamentary democracy for long-fingering any proposal is the commission.  Therefore, it does not seem to be a very satisfactory solution of the present problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the constitutionality of taking blood tests.  I do not think there is very much validity in that point because we have the precedent of other countries that have the same attitude to the constitutional rights of the individual as we have, and I am sure they considered the rights of the community as a whole against the rights of the individual and are no less conscious of them than we are.  Also I think there is a right under law&mdash;I am <Col N="910" /> not sure about this&mdash;of taking blood tests in maternity cases and if it is accepted for that, I am sure it can be accepted for this.</P>

There may be very limited public opinion in favour of blood tests, as he suggested, and in that case his very cautious and careful approach to the matter may be justified in the event.  On the other hand, I should like to know what is the opinion of the House on this very important subject and in the circumstances I think it worth pressing to a division.</P>

      <P>If a man has taken a considerable amount of either drink or drugs, is it not reasonable to assume that he may not be in a position to swear that he had not driven a vehicle?  The onus is on the defendant but, in fact, he may not be in a position so to swear. It strikes me that this provision puts the defendant in a peculiar position and it might be necessary to look at the section again.  The onus is on the defendant to prove he is not guilty when, in fact, he may not be in a position, as a result of either drink or drugs, to do that.</P>

Supposing he decides he is not in a fit condition to drive. He does not want to leave the car on the street.  He intends to go home in a taxi.  If he calls the police and asks for their assistance, will he be charged with being drunk in charge of a car? Would he have a good defence under subsection (a) in saying that the circumstances were such that there was no likelihood of his driving?</P>

      <P>That would be a defence; at least that is the way we see it.  So far as the point raised by Deputy Russell is concerned, this section is similar to a section in operation in Great Britain.  No difficulty such as that envisaged by Deputy Russell has arisen there under that section.  Apart from that, if a person were under the influence of drink or drugs to the degree that would render it impossible for him to prove that he had not driven at an earlier stage while incapable, it does not follow that he is assumed to be guilty.  The question of the good defence would be absolute if he can provide it.  If he <Col N="913" /> cannot, he will still have to be proved guilty of the offence so that there is no real weakness in the situation.</P>

I suggest that if he were either drunk or drugged, he might not be in a position to swear either that he could or could not drive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 65:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) to add the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and shall not unreasonably fail or neglect to dip or dim headlights after lighting up hours&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to meet what I think the Minister will agree <Col N="914" /> is a definite need with regard to the dipping and dimming of headlights. The position at present as far as I know&mdash;I raised this on Second Reading and I understood the Minister to agree with me&mdash;is that cars are required to have a dipping and dimming device fitted which will enable the driver to dim his lights in the face of oncoming traffic.  I think I am correct in saying that while there is a legal obligation on a car owner to have such a device, there is no legal obligation on the driver to operate it.  Consequently, you have the anomalous position that while the attachment of this device is necessary, it is not obligatory to use it.</P>
    <P>All of us will agree that, whether it is a major cause of road accidents or not, it is certainly a very unpleasant experience for people driving at night to encounter the selfish driver who simply will not dim his headlights.  My own view&mdash;I do not know whether it is borne out by statistics or not&mdash;is that this is probably a major cause of road accidents.  I am basing that on what I read in the newspapers day after day.  When people are charged with driving offences, failure to stop after an accident or hitting someone on the road, we frequently read that the driver puts up in defence the fact he was dazzled by the lights of oncoming traffic which failed to dim.  I suggest in this amendment that not only should it be necessary to fit on cars the dimming device, but that the court should be enabled to regard unreasonable failure to dip or dim headlights as dangerous or careless driving within the meaning of Section 52 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 52 is the section which deals with careless driving.  It sets out in subsection (1):</P>
    <P>A person shall not drive a vehicle in a public place without due care and attention, or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the place.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that that section, in itself, is comprehensive enough to enable a court hearing a complaint of dangerous driving to hold that unreasonable failure to dip or dim headlights <Col N="915" /> does constitute careless driving. I do not think it is sufficiently comprehensive. My recollection is that Section 51, I think, of the 1933 Act is worded somewhat similarly to Section 52 of this Bill.  I think that has been accepted as not imposing a legal liability on an owner to dip or dim his headlights.  My recollection, which is subject to correction, is that the Garda authorities did try to deal with this problem under existing legislation by bringing a prosecution for obstruction against a motorist who failed to dip his headlights, but they did not succeed.  Consequently, we are unable to establish a precedent under existing legislation which would enable them to prosecute drivers who offended in this way.</P>
    <P>The Minister will note the amendment uses the words &ldquo;shall not unreasonably fail...&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;unreasonably&rdquo; has been deliberately introduced into the amendment.  The purpose of that is that everyone will recognise that there are occasions, even in the face of oncoming traffic, when it is neither desirable nor a practical proposition for a driver to dim.  We frequently in this country meet long, straight stretches of road with slight hills and inclines on them.  It would be unreasonable on such stretches of road to require a driver to dim when he is a very good distance away from the oncoming traffic and not involving the driver of the oncoming vehicle in any particular difficulty or danger.  Again, on such a straight stretch of road, if a driver goes down into a dip on the road and is obscured from the view of oncoming traffic, it might even, in such circumstances, be dangerous for him to dim, and he might require the full power of his headlights while going into the dip on the road.  We feel it should be taken into account that there are circumstances in which it might be undesirable and might be unreasonable for a driver to dip his headlights.  For that reason, the word &ldquo;unreasonably&rdquo; is incorporated in the amendment.</P>
    <P>The amendment as drafted, as I see it, will enable a court to decide if the circumstances being dealt with in <Col N="916" /> the court were such as to make the driver's failure to dip unreasonable. If the court holds that the failure to dim or dip headlights on the occasion in question was unreasonable, our suggestion is that it should then be open to the court to convict such a driver of dangerous driving.  I am aware, and no doubt the Minister will also be aware, that this offence, if the Minister accepts the amendment, might not always be very easy to detect or to prove, but I think the Garda authorities certainly have sufficient resource and ingenuity to overcome that problem.  I think all of us will be in a position to suggest a method to them, if they find themselves at a loss.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  Even if the regulations which the Minister is to be authorised to make under this Act are such as to enable him to make regulations to cover this matter, I would nevertheless urge him to accept the amendment.  This offence&mdash;because I think it is an offence&mdash;should be written into Section 52 of the Bill so that in future drivers who because they have more powerful headlights or are not concerned about oncoming traffic, or untroubled by the lights of oncoming traffic, or who for any selfish reasons fail to dip their headlights, will be made answerable to the courts as people guilty of dangerous driving.</P>
    <P>I am sure most deputies have had experience of the unpleasantness of driving against a motorist who simply refuses to dip his headlights.  As I said, I regard it as a particularly dangerous type of driving.  Allied to it is the case of the driver who while he will dip his headlights will turn them on fully when 20 or 30 yards away from you. I do not know whether that problem could be dealt with if this amendment were accepted, but I think anything the Minister or the Government can do to encourage people to use their dipping devices properly, and to discourage the selfish driver who will not do so, should be done.  The Minister would be earning the thanks of motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians generally who use our roads if he does anything in this Bill to put a stop to the driver who will not dip his headlights.</P>
    <Col N="917" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large, I feel I can support this amendment but there are one or two catches attached to it. Deputy O'Higgins has referred to one of them&mdash;the question of the man who does in fact dip his headlights but &ldquo;undips&rdquo; them too soon.  It might be necessary to deal with this problem by a slight change of the wording of the amendment, in the same spirit but having something on the lines of a reference to the unreasonable use of headlights, rather than referring to dipping or dimming.  I am quite sure that the Minister will say, as Deputy O'Higgins has probably already guessed he will, that Section 52, as in the Bill, is sufficient, but this whole question of the use of headlights is of such importance as to warrant a special mention in the Bill.  The fact that it was referred to particularly would, I am sure, strengthen the action both by the Guards and the courts.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the word &ldquo;unreasonably&rdquo; occurs in the amendment because there are quite a number of cases, as Deputy O'Higgins said, where it would be unreasonable to ask anyone to dip.  It could arise, for instance, where a driver is taking a sharp right-hand bend.  The driver who is turning right should not dip especially if the road is wet because the effect of dipping his own lights will cause a person coming towards him to be blinded by the reflection of the lights.  It would be quite right to have some regulation or rule that the person turning left on a bend should always dip whether he sees an oncoming car or not, because on a left-hand bend, one very often meets a cyclist and it is too late to dip with any effectiveness, whereas if you dip automatically on a left-hand bend, you cannot take a cyclist unawares.  One usually sees the lights of an oncoming car approaching the bend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question, the only difficulty I can see is how are regulations, which I believe are to be brought in, to be drafted to cover all the points as to when to dip and when not to dip.  There is also the question of the distance between cars on a straight road.  Some people apparently think that even when a car is a mile <Col N="918" /> away, the driver should dip, but if the distance is too great between them a pedestrian or a cyclist in between may not be seen, if they dip.  How that can be covered by regulation, I do not presume to know.  I can see a great many difficulties cropping up.</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to make in support of this amendment is that this whole question of the use of headlights is so important that it should be referred to specifically.  The way it will work out would be a matter of experience and regulations can be made and changed as circumstances seem to suggest.  This is the type of point which would be met perfectly by the Standing Committee of this House which I suggested on the Second Stage, where Parliament could keep reviewing continually what was happening on the roads and get a layman's view rather than views of a traffic expert.  As I say, my only doubt is in regard to the wording of the amendment and the difficulty I can see in relation to how regulations are to be framed to cover all these points.  On the general issue of referring specifically to headlights, I have no doubt at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all in agreement with the sentiments behind the amendment.  Deputy Sheldon and Deputy O'Higgins have both pointed out a weakness, that is, the question of how regulations are to be framed, in the first place, and, secondly, how to prove that an offence has been committed.  I have even seen public service vehicles which, when they dip, are in fact worse as one light goes down and the other goes up. Therefore, they should be prosecuted under Section 54.  You come to the stage where a man will go into a garage and say: &ldquo;My lights are a bit low; focus them high for fast driving.&rdquo; He might then be driving on the dip and an oncoming motorist will not know that he is on the dip and may flash his lights at the driver and then find himself completely blinded because the lights are focussed high.  I suppose again that that would be an offence under Section 54.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 52 fully covers any offence that might be committed in regard to <Col N="919" /> dipping or not dipping on the road. Section 54 covers any offence with regard to lights not being properly focussed.  Surely if a man fails to dip, or puts on his lights too soon, he is then driving in a public place without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the place.  To incorporate the subsection proposed in the amendment would, in my opinion, be inserting a subsection for which it would be impossible to make enforceable regulations, in the first place, and, secondly, the section itself would be unenforceable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as it stands is that which was contained in the 1933 Act, with the addition of the words &ldquo;without due care and attention&rdquo;, which strengthen the terms of the 1933 measure.  Under Section 52 as it now stands, if a person fails to dip his headlights he can be prosecuted for acting without reasonable consideration, or where the circumstances are very bad he can be prosecuted for dangerous driving under Section 53.</P>
      <P>The addition of the words proposed to be added by the amendment would not in fact add anything to the section, particularly when we realise that under Section 11 the matter of dipping and dimming can be made an offence with a penalty, under the common penalty clause in the Bill.  If we were to isolate this matter, which is only one of many other serious matters, such as, for instance, stop signs, and stopping at signs at road junctions, we might, by focussing attention on it, cast doubt on the effectiveness of the section to deal with those other matters which are individually very important and could cause grave danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this section or any amended section is concerned, we shall have to rely on two considerations in regard to dipping and dimming. The first is the consideration, reasonableness and courtesy of our drivers, and the second is the enforcement of the law by the Garda on those who err in this matter and drive in a dangerous manner.  I believe the <Col N="920" /> assurances we have been given from the Garda and the Department of Justice that such enforcement will be carried out, will be implemented.  If it is carried out, and we get co-operation from and reasonable care exercised by our drivers, driving in a reasonable way with due consideration for other road users, those two things allied together will bring about a very much improved situation in regard to the matter under discussion which is much abused at the moment.</P>
    <P>If we are to have proper enforcement I am afraid we must have, and I hope we do have&mdash;although this will be a matter for the Garda and the Department of Justice ultimately&mdash; much more mobile and active traffic police, &ldquo;traffic cops&rdquo; as it were. Apparently we are heading towards that idea at the moment, if we are to judge from the numbers of Garda on motor cycles now on the roads.  Something on that line will ultimately prove not only effective in regard to this matter, but also in regard to the many other infringements which, looked at in isolation, seem not to be terribly serious, but an accumulation of them makes the roads a really dangerous place to frequent at the moment.</P>
    <P>I feel Deputy O'Higgins amendment does not add to the control which is possible under the measure as it now stands.  As I said, it might have the effect, if dealt with in isolation, of focussing attention on it, and casting some doubt on other matters each of which in itself is also very important and on a par with this matter.  I say that realising that the question of dimming and dipping, or not dimming and not dipping, is one which very literally strikes one in the eye.  Despite that, it is also true that not stopping at stop signs at road junctions is also a very serious matter, and even a more dangerous practice, if anything can be more dangerous, than the violation of the dipping consideration.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I am not inclined to think that adding this amendment would be an improvement on the section.  We can make the matter a special offence, as I said at the start. <Col N="921" /> We have power under Section 11 to make it a special offence.  That, together with other various matters, will be considered with a view to deciding if regulations are to be brought in to make it a special offence.</P>
    <P>Various difficulties were envisaged by Deputy Sheldon as to how this, that and the other, may be defined.  We cannot attempt to define by actual legislation all the odds and ends which will arise, but we can do it much more readily and effectively by regulation. Also by regulation we can meet changing circumstances which we could not write into legislation.  Writing all these changing matters into legislation does not help us to keep our legislation up-to-date, or to make it as effective and as continuously effective as we would all like it to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point that to give emphasis to one particular matter in the section might so to speak, take the emphasis off other offences of an equally grave sort.  That point is valid and requires some consideration.  I should like to feel happy that the Minister's view is correct when he says that under Section 52 as it is worded at present, a person who unreasonably failed to dim his headlights could be prosecuted either because he had driven without due care and attention, or because he had driven without reasonable consideration for other road users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not claim to be an expert but it seems to me that the Minister is not correct in that view.  As I read Section 52, the words &ldquo;without due care and attention&rdquo; would relate, and would be regarded by the courts as relating, to the person's care and attention in the handling of the vehicle.  The words &ldquo;without reasonable consideration&rdquo; also appear in Section 50 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  So far as I am aware, it has not been found possible under that legislation, or under Section 50 of the 1933 Act, to prosecute a person who has unreasonably failed to dim his headlights.  Again, so far as I am aware, the only method which the authorities could find under existing legislation in their endeavour to bring home a prosecution against <Col N="922" /> a person was to charge him with obstruction and they did not suceed in that.</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister is not correct when he says Section 52, as worded at the moment, is sufficiently strong to allow prosecutions against a person who does not dim his headlights.  The Minister may be correct in saying that Section 11, which is the section dealing generally with regulations and with the Minister's authority to make regulations, is sufficiently wide to enable it to be made a special offence.  I do not want it done that way.  I think it is undesirable that this whole Bill should be propped up with Ministerial regulations, or with regulations made, or to be made, by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I think it is much preferable that we should say in the Bill what we mean and what we want done.  The Minister would improve the Bill by accepting the amendment.  If he feels satisfied that it is not necessary, I am not going to press him unduly but I do not think that the difficulties about defining the particular circumstances in which this would be an offence and the particular circumstances in which it would not be an offence need bother the Minister at all if he accepts the amendment because my suggestion is simply that these are matters which should be left to the court to decide.  If the amendment is accepted, it will be open to the court to have regard to all the circumstances in relation to the alleged offence and decide whether or not those circumstances are such that make it unreasonable for the headlights not to have been dimmed and if they hold that they were unreasonable, then to convict for careless driving.</P>

      <P>My advice is that prosecutions have been taken and succeeded under the present section in the 1933 Act, Generally, I have been advised that the section, as it is, is sufficiently strong to cover the various aspects outlined by the members of the House in reference to this amendment. I am satisfied, in so far as it is possible to be satisfied, that the section is adequate as it stands and that we have the power in Section 11 to make this a special offence or any other <Col N="923" /> similar matter if it is so regarded as necessary or if it should arise and become necessary in the future.</P>

In other words, if a person is guilty of dangerous driving and is so found by a july after indictment under this section he must be sent to jail.  There is no discretion in the court.  I personally have always held the view against these automatic sentences and against sentences automatically imposed of imprisonment without a fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to consider the effect of this section and what they are doing if they pass it.  Dangerous driving has not been defined and it has been judicially stated that it cannot be defined.  Dangerous driving is an offence if a judge or a jury in all the circumstances of the case decide that it is dangerous driving.  It is left to a judge or jury to determine on the facts whether the facts constitute dangerous driving.  It was held in a rather recent case in the Court of Criminal Appeal in England in 1957 that mere momentary negligence, momentary inattention of the driver of a motor car, would justify a jury, if they so found, in finding a verdict of dangerous driving. It was the case of a man who turned his head and there were unfortunate consequences as a result.  The jury found he was guilty of dangerous driving.  What this section means is that <Col N="924" /> a person may be found guilty of dangerous driving by mere momentary inattention and must be sent to jail. There is no option.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Minister has an amendment down to provide that instead of a person being found guilty of dangerous driving he may be found guilty of careless driving.  That is not the point.  The point is one of principle.</P>
    <P>I objected in the course of the remarks I made on Second Reading to the phrase &ldquo;securing a conviction&rdquo;. I think the Minister did say that it was found difficult to secure a conviction in cases of manslaughter.  That phrase in my view is, to say the very least of it, a most inappropriate one.  If a jury finds a person guilty of manslaughter or any other offence, that is the clear position. The fact is that the prosecution has not established the case in accordance with the rule of law.  We in this House ought to stand firmly by the rule of law and the finding of strict proof in criminal matters for the prosecution.</P>
    <P>Here it is proposed to create this offence by statute.  A person may be guilty of that offence by inattention or by momentary negligence and he must be sent to jail.  There is no discretion in the court.  In my view that is so wrong in principle that were I alone in this House on this Bill, I would ask the Ceann Comhairle at least to register my strong view about creating such a position here under this statute.  That is the question of principle.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the matter from the point of view of expediency.  Do the State authorities wish to secure convictions in all these cases?  I take it that means there is some suggestion that judges and juries are not doing their duty in finding people guilty of offences. I do not think the House would ever endorse such a view.  But even taking it that the view of the prosecution or the State authorities promoting prosecutions under this particular section is that they should get a conviction in every possible case, this section will defeat itself.</P>
    <P>The provision of automatic sentence of imprisonment will ensure that judges and certainly juries with a strong sense of justice, and their conviction that there is something wrong about the <Col N="925" /> section, will take care that unless they are extremely difficult cases and bad cases, there will be no conviction.  That is what the Minister complained about, not securing convictions in manslaughter cases.  Juries are very anxious to see it is only in very bad cases of manslaughter that a person should be subjected to the indignity and the consequences of a long term of imprisonment or any term.  Therefore, they require that there should be strong proof of the bad cases.</P>
    <P>I can say, after nearly 40 years' experience in this country of juries, that no jury in the world do their duty with such regularity and with such due regard to justice and law as the Dublin juries.  This House may be assured that the Dublin juries or juries anywhere else, where a bad case occurs, will do their duty and convict in a proper case but if they know, as they did know up to the present, that conviction brought with it very serious consequences, then they hesitate to convict. It is only in very bad cases that they will do it.  They will do the same here.  You will get no convictions in cases of this kind.</P>
    <P>On grounds of principle and expediency I urge the Minister not to persist in this measure.  We have had experience in the courts right down through the centuries of the way judges and juries react against penal legislation of a harsh character.  This is penal legislation not merely of a harsh character but of an unjustifiable character which exists nowhere else to my knowledge.  I say that it should not be endorsed by this House on the grounds of expediency alone.  I take my stand on this matter on grounds of principle as well.</P>
    <P>Another consideration I should like to urge upon the House in connection with this measure is that a person alleged to have been guilty of dangerous driving can be prosecuted on indictment if he occasions death or serious bodily harm.  Serious bodily harm may amount, in the view of a jury, to the loss of a finger but would anybody suggest that momentary inattention or momentary carelessness, causing the loss of a finger or, perhaps, <Col N="926" /> the dislocation of a shoulder, both of which can be described as serious bodily harm, justifies automatic imposition of a term of penal servitude? That is what the measure proposes as it stands.  That is what I object to and in the interests of principle and, at its lowest, in the interests of expediency, I urge the Minister and the House to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Costello.  I am not a lawyer but it seems to me quite clear that the basic meaning of this section as it stands is that the result, not the degree of negligence or dangerous driving is taken into consideration in the section.  Under present procedure, as I understand it, if a person is charged with dangerous driving, the papers are sent to the Attorney General who has the right to order an indictment before judge and jury.  Under the proposed procedure, the Attorney General will have no powers beyond the ordering of an indictment which must be automatically sent to a judge and jury.</P>
      <P>This means that the person so charged must stand trial before a judge and jury and must, if the result is serious&mdash;death or serious bodily harm &mdash;if convicted be sent to a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years. Take a person who has been driving faultlessly for a number of years and, through one small error of judgment&mdash; taking his eyes off the road perhaps in passing out a car&mdash;he is involved in an accident in which somebody is killed. He must be charged before a judge and jury and, on conviction, be imprisoned for a period not exceeding five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand we can take the case of a person who has been a consistently bad driver for the same number of years and has got away with it. That person can drive a car under the influence of drink and, through the grace of God and for no other reason, he does not cause death or serious injury.  He is charged and under an earlier section can get off with a short term of imprisonment.  Here we have the case of a person who is known to have driven carelessly, dangerously, and under the influence of drink, but <Col N="927" /> he can get off virtually without penalty whereas a person driving safely and well for many years may be sent to penal servitude for one small error of judgment resulting in injury or death.</P>
    <P>I think that is contrary to all justice. Accordingly I support Deputy J.A. Costello's appeal to the Minister to reconsider this section and the serious implications it holds.  We all want to ensure that the careless and dangerous driver gets the full punishment attaching to his offence but I do not think any of us wants to provide that a normal driver, who has used a car carefully for a long number of years and who makes one error of judgment, should be automatically sent to prison.  That, in fact, is the position that will obtain if this section stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like also to support Deputy J.A. Costello's amendment and to urge the Minister to reconsider this entire section.  I think that in his understandable anxiety to bring home to people the seriousness of road accidents which cause injuries to other people, the Minister has gone rather too far in this section.  I think the entire principle of the differentiation between subsections (2) (a) and (2) (b) in the section is entirely bad and entirely wrong.</P>
      <P>It is all wrong that we should legislate in such a way that the result of bad driving is going to ensure the penalty rather than that the penalty should be measured by the degree of the bad driving.  If the person stands as one guilty of a very slight degree of bad driving but is unfortunate enough to injure somebody as a result, he must go to prison and, in addition, may be fined £500. You may have cases of careless and dangerous driving of a most flagrant kind but simply because they did not result in an accident which caused death or injury the person guilty, as far as the court is concerned, need not be sent to jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister is doing in this section is taking the result of the driving rather than the driving itself as the yardstick by which the penalty is to be measured.  The principle of it <Col N="928" /> is completely wrong.  The section as it stands, as Deputy J.A. Costello and Deputy Russell pointed out, makes it mandatory on the court to impose a jail sentence which may be as much as five years in any case where death or serious injury to another person is the result of dangerous driving.  That is mandatory on the court under the Section.</P>
    <P>Deputy J.A. Costello's amendment merely seeks to leave it to the discretion of the court so that, if the court thought it was a proper case for it, you could have a jail sentence or a fine or both.  Quite apart from the obvious objections there are and which were voiced by a number of Deputies on an earlier section making it mandatory on the court to impose a jail sentence irrespective of the degree of bad driving involved, I think that the amendment tabled by Deputy J.A. Costello is entitled to consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If the Minister insists on the section as it stands at the moment I believe that the result in the minds of both judges and juries may very well be as indicated by Deputy Costello&mdash;that the Minister will not achieve his object by insisting on the section. Secondly, I believe that the section as it is worded leaves a great number of questions outstanding which will cause confusion.  You have the position where a motor cyclist comes into collision with a car.  The motor cyclist is not wearing a helmet, for example, and gets a knock on the head as a result of which he is either seriously injured or dies.  The driver of the car may then be charged under Section 53 with dangerous driving causing death or serious bodily harm. Who is to say that the reason that death resulted from the accident was not due to the fact that the motor cyclist was not wearing a helmet rather than to driving of the car by the defendant?  Those questions will arise and I imagine it would be perfectly natural that judges and juries in the interests of justice would incline to the view that if any such arguments existed in favour of the defendant the defendant should be acquitted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> I believe that in his anxiety to strengthen the position, if the Minister insists upon this section, he will in fact be weakening it.  I should like to join with Deputy Costello and Deputy Russell in urging the Minister to reconsider the entire matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, also, would like to support the amendment.  I need not repeat the arguments so very well put by Deputy Costello but a point that strikes me is the difference between paragraphs (a) and (b) in subsection (2) which have been referred to by Deputy O'Higgins, that is, what happens when the result of an accident is death or bodily harm under subsection (2) (a) or in any other case as under subsection (2) (b).  Somebody who momentarily slipped up could cause grievous bodily harm or death and find himself in this terrible jeopardy whereas the terribly bad driver who may have caused the wreck of six or more cars and is lucky enough not to cause serious injury can get off lightly.  Even though he has driven very badly and caused a great deal of damage, he gets off much more lightly than someone who, through an error of judgment, is unfortunate enough to cause either death or serious bodily harm.  It seems to be very bad law that the seriousness of any incident should be judged solely by the effect rather than by the obvious consideration of the degree of guilt of the person who created the accident in the first case.  The thoroughly bad driver careless about everyone else on the road, driving furiously in traffic, who by his action causes a great deal of damage but luckily does not cause serious bodily harm, will get away, whereas an unlucky person who through a slip causes serious bodily harm is either to be sent to jail or we shall have a miscarriage of justice in that the courts will be so appalled by what they are bound to do if they find him guilty that they will prefer to let him off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we are also discussing the Minister's amendment No. 69.  This is his attempt, I think, to improve on the harshness of the section as it stands. That does not appear to me to be a very good way to deal with it, although <Col N="930" /> better than not having it at all.  It is an improvement of the section.  I do not think it right that juries should be left in the position that while they think a car was dangerously driven, they will not convict because it would appear that the automatic penalty is so heavy.  I do not think it is good that that practice should be set up.  It would be much better to have due regard to what is certain to happen in the courts and I think the amendment would meet the case properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Costello&mdash;and I appreciate that he has very wide experience on matters such as these&mdash;I should be inclined to forget the situation now existing in so far as the ordinary lay person has seen the law in operation in recent years. Is it not a fact that the public mind has been outraged and appalled by the cases that have come to the courts after deaths resulting from cars being driven dangerously?  Is it not a fact that manslaughter charges on several occasions have been preferred and that it is not just a question of the State having failed to get a prosecution but that the law as it now stands is such that the courts are debarred from bringing in a verdict of guilty in many of these cases where undoubtedly guilt exists to a large degree on the part of the driver concerned?  That is how I, as an ordinary member of the public, have seen it and that is how thousands of others have seen it.  We read of cases in the newspapers; we know of the comments made in the courts and we have seen people getting off as if the charge were no more than not having a light on a bicycle whereas in fact these people have driven cars in such a way that there is no doubt in anybody's mind that they were driving dangerously and that it resulted in the death of some innocent member of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to deal with that situation that the new offence is being created in this measure.  It is not, as possibly has been deduced by some members of the House, that the actual result dictates the offence.  If death or grievous bodily harm has not resulted from dangerous driving, the fact that death results from <Col N="931" /> the accident does not make the driving in itself dangerous.  If it is a case of momentary inattention, as Deputy Costello put it, that would not of itself be sufficient to indicate dangerous driving and all that might go with it. In that event the courts would no doubt take the view that this could be regarded, and would ultimately come to be considered, as careless driving which would be an entirely different matter.</P>
    <P>The fears expressed are that these penalties seem to be so harsh, that because jail is apparently mandatory under this section, the courts, juries and judges alike, will shy away from bringing in verdicts of guilty.  What is the penalty we are complaining about? A jail sentence of up to five years. Nobody has mentioned that the sentence could be for a day and that the degree of guilt and the circumstances of each case can be dealt with by penalties ranging from one day to five years as the juries, judges and courts may decide is appropriate in the particular circumstances of the case coming before them.</P>
    <P>I feel&mdash;and it is the expressed view of the voluntary organisations in this country who have vetted these proposals as they appeared in the White Paper and later as drafted in the Bill &mdash;that we required this type of legislation and that we must have it there apparent, even though not necessarily to be used, if we are to succeed in making any impact or impression on those who, by dangerous and negligent driving, cause death or grievous bodily harm.  It is no use saying that if someone creates havoc but is fortunate enough not to cause death or grievous bodily harm his dangerous driving is dealt with in a much more lenient way by six months' jail or £100 fine or both.</P>
    <P>If I were to take a hatchet to one of the Opposition Deputies, for instance, Deputy O'Higgins, and made a bold effort to do him as he sits in the House, if he dies as a result of that attack I would be taken up for murder. If I were convicted I could be hanged.  If through no fault of mine I <Col N="932" /> did not succeed in killing him I would be taken up for attempted murder, the penalty for which is much less.  Where is the difference?  Why cavil at what is suggested here when this situation exists in regard to other offences or attempted offences?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is mere inadvertence there is undoubtedly the opportunity for the court to judge, in all the circumstances as presented to them by the prosecution and the defence, whether or not it is dangerous driving or whether it could be regarded as careless driving.  If it is decided by the courts that it is dangerous driving then, if death or grievous bodily harm has resulted, the Bill lays down that up to five years' jail may be imposed and, goodness knows, in some cases we have seen that would not be too much.  On the other hand, if the circumstances are such that the court, having found that it was dangerous driving that resulted in death or deaths, it is quite conceivable, and within its competence, that the court would decide that one day's jail would be the penalty.  That is an aspect of the matter which has been overlooked and one which should be given due consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appalled at the Minister's answer to the very reasonable case that has been made. It leads me to the conclusion that this Bill will be a failure.  It leads me to the conclusion that what the Minister and his advisers want, and what apparently is the official view, is to stamp all motorists as criminals.  All motorists are not either negligent or criminal.  The majority of people are law-abiding and are doing their best to keep within the law.  Even though a motorist may be doing his best for years to carry out the law, he may be <Col N="933" /> guilty of momentary inattention which will bring him the penalty of a jail sentence.  Do I understand the Minister to argue that because the court can impose a day's punishment on a decent man, that is a complete answer to this question?  I think it was Deputy Russell who spoke about giving a jail sentence to the rising of the court.</P>
      <P>Most motorists are respectable people.  I am dealing not with the case of the man who is clearly guilty of dangerous driving but that of the person who has tried to do his duty as a motorists all his life and who being human, is guilty of momentary inattention and dangerous driving.  I have been watching the Minister during the speeches made by Deputy Russell, Deputy Sheldon and Deputy O'Higgins. He spent his entire time talking to his officials and to my belief has not listened to the arguments at all.</P>

      <P>I would like to continue the remarks I was making on the subject of this so-called reasonable attitude on the part of the Minister in saying a motorist may be sent to jail for a day.  As I say, most motorists are decent people.  It is bad enough for them to find themselves in the dock in Green Street with the position that used to exist.  I do not know whether it is the same now but they used to have to go down to the cells during the lunch time. If that practice does not continue now as it existed in my early days, it is due to the discretion of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These motorists have to go through the ignominy of being prosecuted before a jury.  They must sit in the dock and incur all the expense necessary because of momentary inattention at the wheel.  Perhaps the Minister would look <Col N="934" /> at the 1957 report to which I referred, 41 Court of Criminal Appeal Reports, page 134, in the name of Parker.  I wish to impress upon Deputies the seriousness of this matter.  I was appalled by what the Minister said.  He said that public opinion was outraged because convictions were not secured.  I say that is a deliberate insult to the Dublin juries who are doing their duty.</P>

      <P>That is my interpretation and anybody who wishes to contradict it and form his own views of what the Minister said can do so when he reads the Official Report. &ldquo;Secure convictions&rdquo;&mdash;what other meaning is to be taken from it except that juries and judges do not do their duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the law as it stands, declared not by British courts but by the courts here, certain proof is required in manslaughter cases.  I spoke about expediency. May I make another comment on this section to show how useless it <Col N="935" /> is and how utterly wrong it is for the Minister to take up this intransigent attitude?  Counsel and solicitor are defending people for manslaughter before a jury.  If I may cut the thing short and leave out the technicalities, they always ask the jury to say in their view whether the facts as established justify their finding a man guilty of an offence the consequences of which would entail imprisonment.  Every counsel or advocate defending a person charged under this section would say the same thing to the jury and would he not be right in saying it?</P>
    <P>Here an offence is being created which if established and proved to conviction necessitates imprisonment. There must therefore be sufficient proof for a jury of dangerous driving of such a character as to merit imprisonment. Where will the Minister secure his conviction on that set of facts and on that interpretation of the law?  The law must be respected by the public in order that it may be properly enforced.  Thank God, we still have juries in criminal cases to defend the interests of the public against officialdom and the attitude of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the Minister to the extent that it is proper to create the offence of dangerous driving.  That was the argument he put to the House a few moments ago but he did not say why it was necessary to have an automatic sentence of imprisonment.  The Minister made no argument to justify this section and the imposition of an automatic term of imprisonment, beyond saying, in effect, that the law can be brought into contempt by the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for a day.  He said nobody drew attention to that, except, I think, Deputy Russell who, in passing, suggested throwing it aside because we would not regard that as anything else but bringing the law into contempt.  It was further said that, being a judicial expression, it was not the sort of case contemplated by the section and should never have been the subject matter of an indictment.</P>
    <P>If this House passes this section as it stands at the moment, it will be doing a very bad day's work for the enforcement of road traffic law.  It will be setting <Col N="936" /> up a very dangerous precedent and one contrary to all the principles we have stood for over the years since the establishment of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I see something of what Deputy J.A. Costello is trying to put before us but I am afraid I cannot agree with him.  I feel that possibly he has overlooked the section which we have just disposed of, Section 52. Surely any question of momentary lack of concentration is an offence which must be dealt with under Section 52 and not under Section 53?</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to careless driving but Section 52 makes no reference to careless driving: it refers to driving without due care and attention. To my mind, the addition of the words &ldquo;and attention&rdquo; in that section must obviously have been designed to deal with a situation of momentary distraction when a person has failed for a moment to keep his eye on the road ahead and has become involved in an accident as a result.</P>
      <P>If a case is taken under Section 53 which should more properly have been taken under Section 52, I think that is something which cannot be laid at the door of the Minister.  I would not imagine for a moment that would be the case.  However, if it is an offence which is properly alleged under Section 53 and can be substantiated I would support the Minister in all he says and in his view that a sentence of imprisonment must be mandatory because dangerous driving is something which has to be stamped out as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am possibly speaking against my own interest in this matter as a motorist, but too few people realise that a motor vehicle is essentially a lethal weapon or may become such in the hands of an irresponsible driver.  We could draw a parallel between the driving of a modern motor car or even possibly a very ancient one, which is often more dangerous, and the carrying of firearms.  People are not accustomed to carrying firearms in a public place but out in the country accidents do happen with firearms.  It is regarded as an accident when a person is passing through a hedge and something catches in the trigger, with the result <Col N="937" /> that the gun goes off and someone is injured.</P>
    <P>We have not legislation to deal with the proper handling of firearms in a public place.  I would not regard the driving of a motor vehicle as any less potentially dangerous than the carrying of firearms.  I feel therefore that any conviction under Section 53 could take place only where the jury have satisfied themselves that the accused was actually guilty of drunken driving and that must necessarily mean deliberately dangerous driving, driving with wilful disregard for the safety of others.</P>
    <P>Momentary lack of concentration certainly could not properly come under this section.  However, anyone who wilfully drives too fast, who wilfully drives on the wrong side of the road around a corner, who wilfully approaches a number of children playing on the public roadway, on and off the footpath, and wilfully keeps his speed up and knocks down and kills or gravely injures a child who runs out in front of him is, to my mind, thoroughly deserving of imprisonment. I feel the Minister is perfectly correct in his attitude that it is only by making imprisonment mandatory that it can be brought home to the general public.</P>
    <P>I would support the Minister too in his view that there has been a great public alarm that certain offences which have clearly been committed have not been punished as severely as people thought they should be.  It may be said that possibly I am prejudiced by being on this side of the House but I thought the Minister made clear from the start that what he was criticising was the law as it stands which does not make it possible for the court to deal as seriously with an offence as the court in its wisdom would like to deal.</P>
    <P>I do not say that Deputy J.A. Costello has intentionally misunderstood the Minister but certainly I did not get the same impression from what the Minister said as Deputy J.A. Costello did.  Consequently, I support this section.  I feel Deputy J.A. Costello's amendment is not fully justified.  I agree, too, with the Minister <Col N="938" /> that the court still has an absolute right to award only a sentence of imprisonment which the court feels is justified.  I think we can leave it exclusively to the court to decide what sentence is justified.  Even if the sentence is only for one day, a very considerable shock will be given to the accused person and to all his friends and relations.  They will know that it was only good pleading by the defence counsel that persuaded the court possibly not to impose an even heavier sentence.</P>
    <P>This really means that we are regarding dangerous driving as, in itself, criminal and we must face the conclusion that is to be drawn from that. It is only when dangerous driving is clearly defined as being a criminal offence in itself that people will regard driving as something which must be an exclusive occupation.  There are still far too many people who evidently regard conversation, admiring the scenery and waving to acquaintances as the main thing and the actual driving is merely a subsidiary occupation. When driving, the driver must concentrate exclusively on what he is doing and he must be constantly seeking to ensure that he will be prepared to cope with any emergency that may arise. When a driver deliberately refuses to do that and decides he will get to the end of his journey in the quickest possible time, regardless of the safety of others, then he should be sentenced to imprisonment so that he may learn in prison the lesson he failed to learn when he had his freedom.  I do not want to be unsympathetic with much of what Deputy Costello has said, but the matter is far too serious to deal with it in any other way than the way it is proposed to deal with it in this Bill and I support the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>I should like to make two or three observations. Deputy Booth does not, I think, appreciate the position at all under this section.  Everything he says can be achieved without the necessity for an automatic jail sentence.  If there is a bad case, the jury will bring in a verdict of guilty and the judge will impose <Col N="939" /> a severe sentence.  I understand that is what Deputy Booth wants to achieve.  I am with him on that.  Now, I approve of the creation of this new offence but I disapprove of the imposition of an automatic jail sentence. Deputy Booth said this ought to be done under Section 52, relating to careless driving.  Again, at the risk of being accused of repetition and an overemphasis of technicalities&mdash;Deputy Booth is, or was once, a lawyer&mdash; I refer him to the case I have quoted in the Court of Criminal Appeal in England.  A person was found guilty of dangerous driving and the evidence was that it was the result of merely momentary inattention.  A fine of £60 was imposed.  That verdict was upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
      <P>What have we here?  The offender must be imprisoned.  I want Deputies to realise&mdash;perhaps Deputy Booth will appreciate the point, too&mdash;that if an accident occurs after this Bill becomes law, both parties will be subject to indictment, the innocent as well as the guilty, because the Garda will not be able to choose which is responsible for the damage.  If grievous bodily harm is suffered, both parties will be subjected to the ignominy of being brought before a jury.  I do not think that should be allowed.</P>
      <P>The Minister said, if I heard him correctly, that the voluntary associations had approved of this section.  I want to ask a specific question: did any voluntary association approve of the automatic imposition of penal servitude or imprisonment for this newly-created offence?  I know one that did not.  Did the Automobile Association or the Royal Irish Automobile Club, or any of these authorities, either approve or expressly disapprove? We are entitled to an answer to that question because the Minister said the voluntary associations approved of the section.</P>

He has carried on a conversation with his advisers all through this debate with whom perhaps he will have a better and <Col N="940" /> more appropriate time in which to discuss this very important section. It is a very serious one.  Our duty is to enact reasonable and fair legislation. If we have confidence in our courts we should leave it to them to administer the law and to inflict the appropriate penalty.  The penalty should fit the crime.  The courts are in a better position to decide how far they should go.  I approve of this amendment because I do not think a mandatory jail sentence is the proper sentence.  If a man is convicted of dangerous driving in the course of which a child injures a finger, to use Deputy Costello's illustration, that man will be sent to jail. It should be left to the discretion of the judge and jury to decide what the penalty will be.  If we do our job, then I have no doubt they will do theirs.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to make the roads safer and I think the Minister's provision is the correct provision.  Deputy M.J. O'Higgins and Deputy Ryan have experience of Walkinstown Avenue and Ballyfermot Road.  They will agree that there is really dangerous driving on those roads.  The road is wide and motorists travel at 50 and 60 m.p.h. There are children playing on the footpaths.  I was informed recently by a nurse in the children's hospital in Crumlin Road that casualties come in there and the injuries are consistent with the way in which motorists drive.  If motorists knew there was a compulsory jail sentence, then they would be careful to keep their speed down to 30 m.p.h. in Walkinstown and Ballyfermot.  On the other hand, if a motorist has an accident and serious injury results, if he can say that he was driving in a reasonable manner and suffered some momentary lapse of attention, looked out and did not see the child&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Lemass has been mislead by the discussion that has taken place here.  The amendment which the Minister has put down in regard to this matter does not at all meet the objections which have been made to the section by Deputy Costello and others. I know we are not discussing this matter at the moment but we may refer to it.  It is only where a court decides a person was not guilty of an offence under Section 53 that it could then convict a person under Section 52.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When it finds that he is not guilty of dangerous driving only, then the case which has been made abundantly clear by Deputy Costello is that a person who is guilty of even momentary inattention may under the framing of Section 53, as it stands, be found guilty under Section 53 of dangerous driving because dangerous driving is not, and cannot be, defined under the section.  It is because of that situation existing that the necessity for Deputy Costello's amendment exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not feel that either Deputy Lemass or Deputy Booth, and certainly not the Minister, has given any adequate answer to the case made in relation to this question of a mandatory jail sentence.  Whether we like it or not, the courts must have regard to this Bill as it is worded when it becomes an Act. <Col N="942" /> The courts cannot afford to look at the matter as Deputy Booth did or as the Minister has frequently done in relation to various sections of the Bill saying: &ldquo;Of course, a court knows what we want and a court will do this and that.&rdquo;  A court will be obliged to act in accordance with the words of this section when it is passed.  If a court convicts of dangerous driving under this section the courts will be obliged to impose a jail sentence.  It may be that it will occur to some court to try to avoid an obvious injustice by adopting the device mentioned here of sentencing a person to a day's imprisonment or imprisonment until the court rises or something like that.</P>
    <P>I do not think that meets the situation at all.  If we are legislating in a manner which is bad, it is our job to halt ourselves.  It is not the business of the courts to make it known publicly afterwards that they regard the legislation passed through this House as bad and worthy of treatment by them in a contemptuous manner.  That is what the Minister is inviting the courts to do. He is inviting the courts to say that this legislation is bad; that it does not meet the circumstances as it should and deserves to be treated by them and by juries in a contemptuous manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth, I think, was entirely wrong in his approach to this section when he made the case that dangerous driving under the section applies only in cases where the dangerous driving was deliberate or wilful.  The words &ldquo;deliberate&rdquo; and &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; do not appear in the section.  I would go a long way with Deputy Booth towards withdrawing my objections to the section if he could frame an amendment and get it accepted by the Minister making it clear that the mandatory jail sentence was to be applicable only in cases where the courts came to the conclusion that the dangerous driving was done deliberately and wilfully by the driver.  If Deputy Booth could have that accepted by the Minister, I would withdraw a considerable number of my objections.</P>
    <P>That is not the case.  Those words do not appear in the section.  It is no business of the court to inquire whether the driving was deliberate or wilful.  It is not a matter, as Deputy Booth said it was, of a criminal offence <Col N="943" /> where the court is obliged to go into the question of <i>mens rea</i> and all the rest of it, the intention of the accused, whether he had a criminal intent and so on.  That of course is the answer to the parallel which the Minister tried to draw between his endeavouring to murder me and Deputy Booth endeavouring to run me down with a car. There is a very big distinction.  Deputy Booth will appreciate, possibly the Minister does not, my objections to this section going a lot further even than Deputy Costello's does.  Deputy Costello's amendments are designed to leave it discretionary to the court, as it should be, to impose a penalty appropriate to the offence and leave it discretionary to the court as to whether or not a jail sentence is the appropriate thing.</P>
    <P>I object to the section also on the grounds that I believe this differentiation between subsections (2) (a) and (2) (b) is completely wrong and bad in principle.  I think it is wrong that the Minister should legislate in such a way that the penalty is going to be related only to the result of the dangerous driving rather than to the degree of the dangerous driving.  That is what the Minister is seeking to do in this section.  The offence which is being created is the offence of dangerous driving but people who are guilty of that offence are going to be punished by the results achieved from their dangerous driving and not by the degree of bad or dangerous driving of which they were guilty.  I believe that is wrong in principle and that it will be very bad for this House to enact legislation containing that wrong principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The rather bloodthirsty example given by the Minister himself and the examples given by Deputy Booth and Deputy Lemass were all conclusively in support of the fact that the penalty should be related to the degree and not to the result of the dangerous driving.  That does support the attitude which Deputies on this side of the House have taken in regard to Deputy Costello's amendment. <Col N="944" /> Nobody wants to protect the deliberately dangerous driver from the maximum penalties.  I think that was quite clear but I for one would like to see some discretionary power given to protect an ordinary common or garden decent driver who has been driving for a long period of years and who for one reason or another makes a mistake or some misjudgment or is guilty of a minor degree of dangerous driving on possibly the only occasion in his life.  Under this section he must stand indicted before a judge and jury.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is sufficient answer to say that the court can let him off with one day's imprisonment.  The fact remains that he is headlined virtually as a criminal before the world and certainly before his own community.  Such a charge will stand against him for the rest of his days. At the same time, a man who has been a consistently dangerous driver, who, but for the grace of God, might have killed several people, more by luck than judgment gets away with it. He is the one man we all want to get, but under this section he cannot be got because he was not involved in an accident causing grievous bodily harm.  He is the man we all want to see get the maximum penalty for the offence of dangerous driving.  I do not think the Minister wants automatically to impose sentences of penal servitude on drivers guilty of one error of judgment.  It might be himself, Deputy Booth or Deputy Lemass, who made a momentary error of judgment, by reason of which somebody received serious injury.  I do not think the Minister wants that situation to obtain.  What we want is to have the point of view made by the Deputies who have spoken in support of the amendment clarified by the Minister. Deputy M.J. O'Higgins has suggested that if the Minister could in some way on Report Stage work in some amending clause into this section, it would fit the bill.  I agree with that suggestion.  My anxiety is to see that the ordinary, decent driver who may have suffered a momentary lapse is not hauled before judge and jury to leave a mark on him for the rest of his days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section as it stands punishes a man not because of the degree of his dangerous driving but because of the degree of his bad luck &mdash;no more and no less.  I would point out in reply to Deputy Lemass's point that death does not always follow an accident where a car was moving at a fast speed.  It has been known for a pedestrian to be in collision with another pedestrian and to have suffered death as a result.  It has been known for a cyclist travelling at a reasonable speed to collide with a pedestrian and kill the pedestrian. <Col N="946" /> Sometimes it is not the degree of speed at which the collision occurred that determines the severity of the injury but the feebleness, the ill-health or the age of the victim.</P>
      <P>All of these cases would be cases in which the unfortunate motorist would find himself facing a sentence of penal servitude of up to five years.  The section is well-intentioned but is very ill conceived and the amendment, far from making it unsatisfactory, would have the reverse effect.  While we have in this Bill provided severe punishments for people who deliberately or recklessly drive dangerously, we are providing in the Minister's proposals an escape clause which will lead to many injustices and will induce judges and juries to avail of it rather than send an unlucky motorist to prison.</P>
      <P>I would strongly urge the Minister to consider the points mentioned here; to consider the injustice of imposing a penalty because of ill-luck and not because of dangerous driving.  What is needed is the drafting of a new section providing that where the driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle drives wilfully and deliberately in a manner which he himself must reasonably have known would probably cause serious injury or death, the penalty shall be mandatory.  In that case, we on this side of the House would not have the same strong objection.  I appreciate the object behind this section is to supply a want in our law.  We must prove very conclusively a number of difficult things before a person can be convicted of manslaughter by reason of driving a mechanically-propelled vehicle and I appreciate the Minister wants to get away from that, and to punish severely people who deliberately and recklessly drive in such a manner as to cause serious injury or death to another person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not doing that in this section as it stands.  Certainly if we are, we are doing it only at the risk of punishing people who were not guilty of an extremely dangerous degree of driving, but who were unlucky enough to cause death or serious injury.  We know that a person can drive extremely dangerously and recklessly and only brush against a pedestrian or another car and <Col N="947" /> that that person, though he caused no serious injury, is more culpable than a person who, though driving moderately dangerously, causes serious injury or death.  We must surely punish a person who is guilty of a serious degree of dangerous driving and we can do that by amending the section by saying that a person is driving at a speed that any reasonable person would know was likely to cause serious injury or death.  Deputy Lemass suggested that voluntary organisations did not support this view.</P>

      <P>I apologise to Deputy Lemass.  I am aware of two motoring organisations, the Automobile Association and the Royal Irish Automobile Club, who are both opposed to subsection 2 (a) of this section.  They are sympathetic with the idea that a person guilty of a degree of reckless driving should be punished severely, but they feel it is wrong to punish a man for some misfortune beyond his control.  I can tell the Minister that he will be the most disappointed man in this House if the House accepts the section as it stands because judges and juries will escape to Section 52.  At the present time when a member of the district court bench is faced with a difficult decision about the degree of dangerousness, he escapes to the careless driving section.</P>
      <P>I am quite certain that where mandatory imprisonment is involved, you will have far more occasions of escape to the careless driving section so that the Minister, while his intention is to warn the public of what the result of dangerous driving will be in the future, is missing the point.  I would again urge him to consider the points made by men of experience who appreciate how these sections are interpreted by members of the bench.  The Minister should appreciate that we are sympathetic to those objectives.  I do not think he will attain them in the manner he proposed and certainly if he does, it will only be by imposing unfair penalties on people who are not as culpable as the Minister might think in all cases.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan&mdash;taking the last speaker first&mdash;typifies the general discussion that has taken place on this matter.  On the one hand he holds out&mdash;and I do not disagree; I accept that the view of all Deputies is to try to make this Bill workable with the particular object of improving safety on the roads&mdash;that while he is sympathetic towards this section of the Bill as a whole, people will be found guilty and sentenced under it to penalties which, in the circumstances, will be too severe.  On the other hand, and in the same breath, he points out that as a result of the official amendment there will be an escape clause with the result that very few people will be convicted at all.</P>
      <P>The attitude adopted by Deputy Ryan is typical of the general contradictions that have come from those benches in the last half-hour.  Different Deputies have followed the line that if we could bring in a new section that would outline wilful and deliberate dangerous driving as an offence which will carry these severe penalties, we would all be happy.  Were that &ldquo;wilful and deliberate&rdquo; clause inserted it would almost leave us where we have found ourselves all through the years. It would have almost the same value as a charge of manslaughter against a motorist who has caused a death at present.  I think the House is fully agreed that we should remedy that situation, and yet the same members are now suggesting that we should add or put in a new section that would be tantamount to leaving the situation almost as it is.  Yet, nobody agrees it should be so left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the result of the accident.  It is unfair, it is said, that the result should dictate the penalty.  Possibly in all good faith there is this display of sympathy for the decent honest people who will find themselves in jail.  It is too bad that that should happen we are told, and we are going to be sorry for them because they may even be brought into court. But do any of us stop to think that these decent people&mdash;and I have no doubt that the term in this case would cover 99.9 per cent. of those who come into court&mdash;will be coming in on charges <Col N="949" /> which in themselves surely cannot be regarded as decent inasmuch as these people will have killed or maimed somebody through dangerous driving. Whether it has been wilful or deliberate dangerous driving to their knowledge does not really matter.</P>
    <P>Surely it would be absolutely out of the question that we should ask the courts to find guilty only people who were wilfully and knowingly driving dangerously when they killed somebody? If we are to have cars on the public roads, we owe it to the public to try to ensure that these machines will not be driven dangerously where at all possible.  To impose on the custodians of the law the obligation to prove that dangerous driving was wilfully and deliberately carried out before sentence could be passed would be ludicrous.  It would be merely blinding ourselves to the fact that we must protect the public on our highways. I think that is being completely forgotten in the heat and enthusiasm invoked for the poor unfortunate person who finds himself in the dock charged under this section after an accident that has resulted in death or grave bodily harm.  Let us not forget that the person so charged, even though he is sent down to the cells during the luncheon break and must put up with that, is in a far better position than the person who has been killed.</P>
    <P>We should remember that and we should also remember that we are not just trying to penalise people, not bringing in penal laws for the sake of hurting people but with the avowed intention of trying to protect people. In so doing, it may well be that we shall penalise some people but if they suffer, those penalties have come about through their own actions.  They are imposed in the interests of the future safety of the general public.  It is agreed inside and outside the House that this legislation is necessary and that it is long overdue in all its various aspects, as put to the people in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello asked a specific question following my earlier intervention: did any voluntary organisation approve of the mandatory jail <Col N="950" /> sentences as approved in this section? The Safety First Association have so approved and in so far as objections are concerned I am aware&mdash;and this is subject to correction&mdash;that the Automobile Association does object. So far as other organisations&mdash;and there are quite a few interested in these matters&mdash;are concerned, we are not aware that they have objected.  That does not imply that they may not object.</P>
    <P>All to-day's discussion boils down to one point&mdash;whether or not, when we cut out all the trimmings, we should have mandatory jail sentences in this section.  The same question arose in regard to the charge of drunken driving or driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.  In that case I undertook to have this aspect of the matter further considered before the next Stage and I see no reason for not giving the House the same undertaking in regard to mandatory jail sentences in this section and considering both at the same time.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious misunderstanding in relation to what was said by me and expounded by Deputy Costello who referred to what he believed was a criticism by me of the manner in which juries in Dublin and elsewhere carry out their duties in regard to convictions on charges of manslaughter.  I want to deny categorically that I in any way reflected on the juries.  I want to say again that I was quite specific in pointing out that it was the law as it now stands that prevented the juries and the judges in our Courts from finding persons guilty where death had occurred as a result of a road accident. I want to reiterate that it was in no way and could not be taken as a reflection on judges or juries particularly the juries who give this very excellent service for which they are not compensated in any way.</P>
    <P>The mandatory jail sentence part of this section seems to be the real point at issue.  I am prepared to undertake to the House to have that aspect of the matter further and fully considered between now and the next Stage as I have undertaken earlier to <Col N="951" /> consider the mandatory jail sentence in regard to drunken driving charges.</P>

      <P>In subsection (3), line 38, after &ldquo;not&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of itself&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The subsection to which this amendment is directed inadvertently contradicts the definition of dangerous driving.  Dangerous driving is to be ascertained by reference to a number of matters and all the circumstances of the case.  One of the circumstances is the speed at which the person is driving.  These are matters which the court or the jury would take into account in determining whether dangerous driving has been proved. The subsection to which my amendment is directed provides that it shall not be a defence for a person charged with dangerous driving to say that he was driving at the speed limit.  That is one of the things that determines whether he is guilty or not.  According to the subsection it cannot be a defence for a person to say he was driving within the speed limit.  My amendment provides that it shall not of itself be a defence that a person was driving within the speed limit.  If the Minister looks at it he will see there is at least something to be said for the amendment I have put down.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister cannot grasp what I have not too clearly stated.  The subsection to which I have drawn attention in the amendment says that it shall not be a defence for a person charged with dangerous driving to say that he was driving within the prescribed speed limit.  Surely if that section stands a person would not be able to submit to the court or the jury, as one of the elements to be taken into consideration as to whether or not he was guilty of the offence, that he was in fact observing the speed limit.  If you say it is not to be a defence it can be open to the interpretation that he will not be able to say to the court or the jury: &ldquo;I was under the speed limit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all, because the words &ldquo;of itself&rdquo; would eliminate that.  Surely a person is entitled to say in his defence that he was doing what the law imposed upon him?  What I take the subsection to mean is that it should not be a complete defence to the charge to say he was driving at the speed limit.  That may be what the Minister intends, that the person should be entitled to submit to the jury all the considerations that may be taken into account including the speed limit.  Will the Minister have it examined by the Parliamentary Draftsman or some lawyer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the amendment is withdrawn might I suggest that the subsection could be taken out altogether, which would achieve the point Deputy Costello is making?  I would ask the Minister to consider this illustration.  Under the law as it stands if a man is going through the traffic lights and they are green in his favour he might collide with somebody coming across the intersection.  We know for a fact that at law, although I do not think it is written in, it is not of itself a defence to say: &ldquo;The lights were green in my favour and I went through them.&rdquo;  It does not remove the obligation which still lies on that person to keep a proper look-out.</P>
      <P>I believe the subsection the Minister has inserted is not strictly necessary because the court will say it is not of itself a defence to say: &ldquo;I was under the speed limit.&rdquo;  There are other things which must be taken into consideration. It might be all right to drive at 25 miles an hour if the speed limit were 30 miles an hour, as in some streets but in other streets you might not be allowed to exceed five or 10 miles an hour.  I am quite certain that without that subsection the courts would so interpret the section as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended that it should be a defence.  It was not so in the 1933 Act and bringing it up now, as suggested by the Deputy, which might possibly get the agreement of the House, would seem to imply that we were now for the first time allowing this as a defence.</P>

I ask the jury to take that into account in considering whether it was dangerous driving.&rdquo;  Under this section somebody may say: &ldquo;You are not entitled to say that to the jury.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 69:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (4) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where, when a person is tried on indictment or summarily for an offence, under this section, the jury, or, in the case of a summary trial, the District Court, is of opinion that he was not guilty of an offence under this section but was guilty of an offence under section 52 of this Act, the jury or court may find him guilty of an offence under section 52 of this Act and he may be sentenced accordingly.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> To add to the section the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) Where a member of the Garda Síochána is of opinion that a person has committed an offence under this section and that the contravention has caused death or serious bodily harm to another person, he may arrest the first-mentioned person without warrant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment which, from our information and from our discussions with the Gárda authorities, we find is regarded as very necessary to deal with (1) drivers of self-drive cars, for instance, and (2) Six-County drivers.  It is regarded as necessary in those two specific cases and for that reason I am bringing it before the House and recommending its acceptance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have a lot of sympathy with the amendment, which is very necessary, but it worries me very much as to what is &ldquo;serious bodily harm.&rdquo;  For instance, to a very old person a tip on the elbow might cause serious bodily harm whereas to a younger person it might be a trivial injury.  It is very unfair to place the onus on a Garda to decide what is serious bodily harm.</P>
      <P>I often thought it might be better if there were some certificate as to what serious bodily harm is from a medical man or from somebody in a position to say what it is.  I have a lot of sympathy for the amendment and I can see the necessity for it.  If we could just have that clarified in some way, I should feel happier about it.</P>

At the moment, in addition to penal servitude and fines we also inflict upon the unfortunate person who is charged, perhaps weeks and months of waiting and long hearing in the District Court, the taking of depositions which the Clerk records in longhand and which are then read out laboriously to the witness.  If we provide for trial for killing with a motor car, we at least ought to hurry up once and for all the system of taking depositions in the district court.

      <P>I have seen a report attributing to the Vice-Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany and to a member of his staff the statements mentioned in these questions.</P>
      <P>While I have not seen the text of the statement actually made by Professor Erhard, I presume that what he had in mind is that certain European countries which are members of E.F.T.A. might feel unable to subscribe to the Rome Treaty because of its possible political implications. These implications are, of course, important and would need to be taken fully into account in any examination of acceptance of the Rome Treaty. There is nothing, however, in that Instrument which is directly related to questions of defence, nor is there any reason to think that membership of NATO is a condition of subscribing to the Treaty.</P>

      <P>As has been stated many times in reply to questions in this House the net emigration from various areas can be estimated only for intercensal periods.  This estimation requires data on the population of each area at successive censuses as well as the number of births and deaths among persons normally resident in the areas during the intervening period.  While the population statistics can be obtained it is not possible from the available records to compile the necessary vital statistics either for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas as defined by the Report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta or for the Gaeltacht areas as defined by Ordú na Límistéirí Gaeltachta, 1956.  The information required by the Deputy cannot, therefore, be given.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of both birth and marriage registration the smallest areas for which data are available are Registration Districts, which normally comprise a number of District Electoral Divisions.  It is not possible to compile the relevant statistics either for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas as defined by <Col N="962" /> Coimisiún na Gaeltachta or for the Gaeltacht areas as defined by Ordú na Límistéirí Gaeltachta, 1956.  The former areas are defined in terms of District Electoral Divisions and the latter, in many cases, in terms of individual townlands, so that the data for them cannot be obtained from those for Registration Districts.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might quote, for example, this extract from the report of the WHO Expert Committee on Polio which met in Washington in June last:</P>
      <P>It is the Committee's belief, however, that not all the questions have yet been answered and that the accumulation of further data is desirable before the unlimited use of these live polio virus vaccines can be recommended without qualification. Foremost among the unanswered questions is how a true measure of safety can be devised and the possible clinical risks determined&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Then I would say that the following difficulties would seem to arise:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> No definite dosage schedule is generally acceptable&mdash;&mdash; Its use needs careful planning&mdash;&mdash; With the use of a live vaccine the virus is bound to reach unconsenting contacts; this is a complete departure from present practice in human preventive medicine.</P>

Where, however, a road serves a number of landholders jointly, State assistance for the carrying out of improvements may be given in the form of minor employment schemes or rural improvements schemes grants.  Such assistance is at present being given to the maximum extent permitted by the total amount of funds available and by the special conditions attached to the schemes, which are, principally, that minor employment schemes grants must be <Col N="964" /> related to the number of unemployment assistance recipients in the electoral division, and that local contributions must be paid towards the cost of works done under the rural improvements scheme.

I am informed that progress has been made in the matter but that no final conclusion has yet been reached.  Accordingly, I am not yet in a position to make a statement in the matter.

      <P>The Report of the Irish Land Commissioners for the year and period ended 31st March, 1952 &mdash; which, I understand, is available in the Library &mdash; contains by way of Appendix an illustrated review of the colonisation scheme whereby 122 Gaeltacht families were resettled by the Land Commission in County Meath during the period 1935-40.  As indicated in this review, the scheme proved a success. Since 1940, the establishment of colonies on such a large scale has not been practicable: nowadays, the migration programme is aimed, with like success, at the resettlement in Eastern and Midland counties of smaller groups of families from the same congested neighbourhood in the West.  Gaeltacht tenants are, of course, included in these schemes but precise statistics of such migrations are not readily available.</P>

      <Col N="976" /> Men required by my Department for temporary relief duty as Postmen are recruited through Employment Exchanges. Postmasters, acting in accordance with standing instructions select for the work the most suitable of those listed by the Employment Exchanges. Applicants for work as temporary postmen are required to state the names of two responsible persons to whom application can be made as to their character.</P>

Plans for further special issues have not yet been settled and, as I explained to the Deputy in November last when replying to a similar question, it would be contrary to established practice to anticipate the Government's decision on the matter by indicating the subjects being considered.  An announcement will be made as and when a decision is taken to issue any new stamp or stamps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill arises out of a review which I have had carried out with a view to ascertaining what changes were required in present legislation dealing with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  The original legislation under which the Institute was established was enacted in 1946, and an amending Act was passed in 1954.  As it is now fifteen years since the original Act was passed, it is not perhaps surprising that it has been found necessary to amend the existing legislation. This Bill is designed to overhaul the functions, powers and organisation of the Institute so as to enable it to function more effectively.</P>
      <P>While it is proposed in the Bill to repeal the 1946 and 1954 Acts I should like to make it clear that the changes now proposed are not very radical inasmuch as the Institute as set up in 1946 is being continued in being, although its organisation, financing and functions are being adapted in the light of experience of their working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might help the House if I indicated briefly the main changes which the Bill is designed to bring about in the present arrangements.  Perhaps the most important change proposed is that relating to the organisation of what might be described as the governing body of the Institute.  Deputies will be aware that the Institute's functions under the 1946 and 1954 Acts were discharged by several constituent parts, namely, the Industrial Research Committee, the Standards Committee, the Director and the Council.  The new Bill provides for the concentration of functions in the hands of a single entity in the form of a Board which is to be established.  This simplification <Col N="989" /> in the organisation of the Institute is designed to improve its efficiency.  The Board will be responsible for the general government of the Institute and the administration of its affairs.  It will be appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and will consist of a maximum of nine members.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that it had been hoped to keep industry in close touch with the work of the Institute through the Council, which comprises, in addition to the members of the Industrial Research Committee and of the Standards Committee, not more than fifty ordinary members, each of whom was appointed for his special attainments.  I want to pay tribute here to these gentlemen for the selfless service they have rendered to the Institute in the past.</P>
    <P>It was found that because of its size and the infrequency of its meetings it was not possible for the Council to fill to its own satisfaction the role for which it was established.  It is proposed, accordingly, to have no Council in the reconstituted Institute.  Instead, the Board is being given authority to appoint such <i>ad hoc</i> Committees as it sees fit to assist and advise it in carrying out its functions.  The revised arrangements now proposed should have the effect of introducing greater flexibility into the conduct of the Institute's affairs, of broadening the base of the Institute, and of giving it more latitude in determining the appropriate industrial and scientific contacts which should be enlisted to help towards the solution of specific problems.</P>
    <P>The functions of the reconstituted Institute will be, broadly, similar to those of the present Institute.  It is proposed, in addition, to vest the Institute with authority, where the public interest so requires, to undertake or assist in the development or exploitation of inventions.  It is felt that this would be a desirable extension of the existing powers of the Institute to conduct scientific research.</P>
    <P>Under the present legislation, the maximum annual grant from funds provided by the Oireachtas which may be made to the Institute for expenses <Col N="990" /> of administration is £35,000.  It is proposed to remove this limit, and to arrange that, each year, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, will propose in the Estimates a certain sum for approval by the Oireachtas.  With the expansion of industrial enterprise in this country, with the greater awareness which we may expect from industrialists of the necessity for a scientific approach to production, we may anticipate an increase in the activities of the Institute in the future.  To this end, three new laboratories have recently been completed and handed over to the Institute.  The object of the removal of the present statutory limit on the level of the annual State grant is to ensure that the Institute will not be prevented by lack of funds from using those new facilities to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>This greater flexibility in regard to financial matters should I feel be accompanied by similar flexibility in regard to staffing arrangements.  At present, the numbers, grades, remuneration and conditions of service of the staff are subject to the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The new Bill is designed to remove this control, except for such posts in the Institute's service as are designated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as posts of special responsibility.  The change proposed will, it is hoped, make it easier for the Institute to recruit suitable personnel for the various posts in the organisation.</P>
    <P>The connection between the Institute and Industry which it was created to serve should be as intimate as possible.  Towards this end, provision is made in the Bill whereby industrial firms and other bodies may become associated with the Institute on payment of an annual fee, in return for which they can become entitled to certain facilities from the Institute. The exact terms of the relationship which will thus be created between the Institute and the associated firms will be a matter to be worked out by the Institute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> In regard to standard marks, the Bill provides that certain functions, which are at present exercised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, are transferred to the Institute, and some other minor amendments which appear desirable in the light of experience, are also proposed.  The most important change in this respect is that which empowers the Institute to grant a licence to use a standard mark. This is at present a function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The new Bill also provides for the prescription by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if he is satisfied that it is in the public interest, of compulsory standards for certain commodities intended for sale.  In recent years, public attention has been focussed on the fact that there was no power to prevent the sale to the public of articles which may constitute a hazard to life or health.  The provision to which I have referred seeks to remedy this deficiency, and it is the intention normally to utilise the powers involved only for the protection of life and health.  There is no intention to make compulsory the ordinary standard specifications which will be drawn up by the Institute.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes other provisions in regard to finances, accounts, and audits, annual reports, Board procedure, offices and premises, and other matters, which are generally on the lines of those approved by the Oireachtas for other State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general merits of this Bill, I feel that there should be general agreement to any measure which is designed to improve the working of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  This Bill will, I believe, have this effect.  The days are long gone by when industry could afford to carry on from year to year with the same old processes and practices, and in every country it is increasingly recognised that scientific research is essential to any worthwhile development of resources in the industrial field.  This is more than ever important for this country which has <Col N="992" /> poor natural resources of raw materials, and the additional handicap, so far as human resources are concerned, of a lack of tradition in industrial and managerial skills.</P>
    <P>For this reason, there is a very urgent need for industrial research to improve technical processes and techniques, to develop new processes and new products, to promote the use of substitutes and by-products, and to eliminate waste.  This research is expensive, and the smaller type of industrial firm which we have in this country is often not in a position to provide the skilled staff and the laboratory equipment to investigate its own working so as to find out newer, more efficient and cheaper ways of making a better article.  The Institute exists as a central organisation to provide these facilities for industry.  It has, or will have, the skilled staff and the equipment to do the job.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a greater awareness among industrialists firstly of the need for scientific research and, secondly, of the great advantages which they can achieve from utilising the services which the Institute provides for them.  This Bill represents an effort at improving the organisation of the Institute and giving it more independence with a view to improving its working and making it a better servant of industry.  I recommend the Bill to the Dáil, and I feel sure that the general principles of the Bill which I have outlined will receive approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, the Bill will be generally welcomed. Its purpose is to continue, with modifications, the Institute for Research and Standards established by the 1946 Act.  That Act established an institute which consisted of four parts, the council of the institute, the industrial research committee, the standards committee and the directorate of industrial research and standards.  This Bill continues in being the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards but it appears from the Bill and from what the Minister said that the four components established by the 1946 Act will be merged in a single body to be known as the Institute <Col N="993" /> for Industrial Research and Standards and that this will function through a Board which is established by Section 7 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This Board will function through a chairman and will comprise eight ordinary members chosen by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for appointment to the board by reason of their attainments in scientific research applied to industry or because the person is representative of industry or of persons employed in industry or is capable of giving substantial practical assistance in the work of the Institute.  It seems that that change is desirable because the earlier arrangement under which there was a council of 50, as the Minister said, proved unwieldy in practice and meant that there were infrequent meetings.</P>
      <P>There are, however, certain aspects of this legislation which would seem to me to involve the Minister for Industry and Commerce's entering too largely into the affairs of the Institute. Under certain sections he has power to designate specified offices and the Minister's consent is necessary before an appointment is made.  That involves direct Ministerial intervention in a matter which might clearly be regarded as more proper to the Institute itself and it does seem that some of these sections might require amendment.</P>
      <P>One important aspect of this matter which should be stressed is that up to the present the amount provided by the grant-in-aid was entirely insufficient. The Minister has said it is proposed to raise the ceiling from the present limit of £35,000 to an unspecified sum which will be approved according as the Minister, as a result of discussions with or representations from the Institute, considers necessary. In the last annual report the Institute referred to the difficulties they had in securing staff and under a heading on page 15 of the Fourteenth Annual Report they said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty referred to in previous reports in recruiting suitable technical staff because of the unattractiveness of the salary scales and prospects offered by the Institute <Col N="994" /> still persists.  On this account a number of posts remain unfilled. This matter, however, is under discussion with the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I had a look at the total number of staff and I found that in 1960 the technical staff consisted of 15 people and that, in fact, that was a reduction of four compared with the staff in 1957 which then consisted of 19 people. There is no doubt that if the Institute is to be successful adequate finance must be made available to it.  There is not much point in making legislative changes if adequate financial facilities are not afforded to the Institute.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's speech he referred to the fact that many firms are small and unable, out of their own resources, to provide themselves with adequate scientific and other technical advice and that for that reason they have to look to an institute such as this for assistance.  It does seem, therefore, essential that, if this Institute is to achieve the objective we believe it should achieve, sufficient financial assistance should be provided for the work which of necessity must grow with the substantial development in industry and with the growing competition which is the continuous experience of industry generally.  On the assumption that the Common Market develops and that there will ultimately be competition from Common Market countries with our own industrialists, the competition which industrialists will have to face in the future is likely to be more intense. It seems essential that adequate financial assistance should be provided in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, important that the Institute should have sufficient independence. In Section 20 provision is made that the Institute must comply with the directions of the Minister in the formulation of specifications for commodities and under Section 34 the Minister is empowered to designate an office and approve the appointees to these offices.  These particular powers appear to me to involve to an unnecessary extent the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the work of the Institute.  Bodies of this sort <Col N="995" /> generally function more effectively when they are free from any interference of a non-technical nature.  Subject to the over-all limitation of financial control which is inevitable in this case, the Institute should itself be free to operate its own affairs.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the work of the Institute up to the present which is not sufficiently publicised.  Generally, the ordinary consumer is almost unaware of the existence of the Institute. If there are commodities for which a standard mark or specification has been declared by the Institute and which is, therefore, entitled to bear that standard mark of the Institute, the ordinary consumer knows practically nothing about it.  Some effort should be made to bring the fruits of the work of the Institute to the notice of the public generally.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of this Institute is to prevent inferior articles or commodities being produced and sold to the consumer.  In many cases consumers are unaware of the rights which they have under the legislation already in existence.  It is important that some publicity should be given to the work of the Institute so that, if consumers are aggrieved, dissatisfied or feel that a particular commodity does not measure up to the standard, they are entitled to have the matter remedied.</P>
    <P>Indeed, many of the commodities which measure up to the standards of the Institute are of a far higher quality than imported articles.  Some of the imported articles have not to comply with the same standards or specifications as the Institute lays down.  For that reason it is in the interest of the public generally that the standard specifications which are provided for under the Institute should be widely known and that the public should be familiar with the arrangements under which it is possible to have these standards adhered to.</P>
    <P>The amount provided up to the present was entirely inadequate for the work of this Institute.  Last year, the grant-in-aid was £35,000.  The provision for additional laboratories and <Col N="996" /> equipment amounted to £38,000.  For land and buildings the sum was £3,000 and for special investigations a nominal sum.  It seems to me that the funds which this Institute will require in the future, if it is properly staffed and if it is to achieve the functions which an Institute of this sort is expected to achieve, may involve very considerable expenditure.  In research of this sort it is never possible, in advance of the actual work, to say what may be involved.  Some investigations may turn out to cost more than others but in order to ensure that our industrialists have available the best possible services and that the standards which we believe they should aspire to, not only in their own interests but in the national interests, are maintained at the very highest level, it is obvious that additional funds will be needed.</P>
    <P>Subject to the provision of these funds and to the observations I made that the Minister for Industry and Commerce appears to enter too much to some extent into the work of the Institute, I believe that the proposed changes in the law are desirable and that the arrangement under which a small body rather than a somewhat unwieldy council will have responsibility for directing the affairs of the institution with power to establish <i>ad hoc</i> committees is a more efficient and sensible arrangement.</P>
    <P>I believe that the work which the Institute has already done has proved very useful and that if adequate funds were provided it might be possible for it to do still more useful work in the future.  There are certain other points which I think, will arise more appropriately on individual sections on Committee Stage.  Subject to that, I believe, the measure is desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said in his speech, the size of the Bill is not an indication of the extent to which we are changing from our present pattern of legislation governing industrial research and standards.  In fact, this Bill very largely consists of providing for the repeal of the Acts of 1946 and 1954 and the re-enactment of the provisions of those two Acts.  As the Minister properly says, this new Bill is based on experience of the 1946 and <Col N="997" /> 1954 Acts.  It is quite obvious that has been taken into consideration in framing this legislation.</P>
      <P>The first observation I want to make so far as this legislation is concerned is that I do not believe one per cent. of the population of this country know anything whatever about the Institute of Research and Standards.  Judging from the fact that there are seven or eight Deputies in the House out of 147, a very substantial number of Deputies do not want to know anything about it either.  I think that is a great pity.  I think the Institute of Research and Standards is potentially a very good piece of industrial organisation.  Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how you could have an expanding and progressive industry or industries or a progressive and expanding industrial fabric if you have not, as an adjunct to that, an Institute of Research and Standards which would do all the research work, all the testing, and the examination and all the weighing that is necessary to improve the quality of products and at the same time bring to the benefit of our young and emergent industries here the technical experience and resources which have been developed in other countries as a result of the operations in those countries of Institutes of Research and Standards. I think it is a pity that manufacturing industry generally is not aware as adequately as it ought to be of the existence of this valuable organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a great pity that our young and developing industries do not avail of the Institute of Research and Standards to find solutions for many of the problems thrown up at them from day to day.  If, therefore, there is a discussion in the House or elsewhere on the potential value of research to industries, I hope that every possibility will be availed of to publicise the existence of this Institute and the useful character of its work in encouraging industrialists to avail of it.  Ministerial statements and Press publicity would be of immense value to advertise the work of the Institute and to induce employers in large groups to come and look at its work. Efforts should be made also to issue <Col N="998" /> to some of the employers memoranda which would bring home to them the work the Institute is doing to help employers.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the Institute has at its disposal technical equipment and scientific brains, plus access to sources of technical knowledge, that our industrialists do not have.  I put it to the Minister, therefore, that steps should be taken immediately to bring home to industrialists that the Institute is there, that it wants to help in a friendly way to assist growing industries.  Otherwise the Institute will fall into a backwater and I am afraid will remain unused unless the Department or the Institute itself advertise its worthwhile qualities.</P>
    <P>I observe from the Bill that the Minister has decided to abolish the Council of the Institute and to substitute a Board which will carry out the administrative work of the Institute. The old Council of the Institute consisted of about 60 very busy people and I am quite sure, having looked at the record of attendances of some of them, that many of them found it impossible to give regular attendance at meetings of the Council.  That is understandable because, as I mention, they are very busy people with other demands on their time and I think it is an improvement in our legislation to substitute for a large and perhaps unwieldy body of 60 a Board of not more than nine people who can be much more cohesive than a large Council and who, I hope, will be selected not merely on the basis of their knowledge and experience but also with an eye to their ability to attend meetings regularly.</P>
    <P>I think that in general the substitution of a Board of nine persons for a Council of 60 makes for improvement in this type of legislation.  I am glad to notice that with experience and with development on the part of the Institute it is now possible for the Minister to pass over to the new Board for future administration a number of functions which, by the 1946 Act, were held under the Minister's control but which were to some extent decentralised in the first instance by the 1954 Act.  That procedure is to continue and the Board <Col N="999" /> is to be given wider powers to act on its own initiative on matters which up to now have been exclusively reserved for Ministerial administration.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides that posts on the staff of the Institute are to be reserved for appointment by the Minister.  In other words, the Minister is to designate certain posts as special posts&mdash;that is, posts which can be filled only after consultation with the Minister and the conditions in relation to which will be fixed by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  I should like if the Minister would tell us at this stage what kind of posts he has in mind.  Are they posts which will be designated as offices of special responsibility, do they call for special qualifications, are they posts in the scientific and technical field or peculiarly in the administrative field and does the Minister himself contemplate making these appointments or will any board be established such as the Civil Service Commission or some such body to assist the Minister in selecting the people who will fill these posts?</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Cosgrave I am glad the Minister is adopting a new manner of financing the Institute.  The position up to the moment has been that an annual grant of approximately £35,000 was made towards the expenses of the Institute.  That, of course, was in addition to capital grants from time to time provided for the extension of the Institute premises, but I think the concept of preparing an estimate of what the Institute will require, having regard to the amount of work it does, is preferable to the idea of a grant which is made without any regard to whether it is adequate or otherwise or whether the Institute could do more work of a valuable kind if it got more money for discharging wider responsibilities.</P>
    <P>This idea of the estimate will show us clearly how inadequate the present technical and scientific aid is, as far as industry is concerned.  We are here an outpost of European civilisation, far from the main streams of industrial production and industrial and scientific thought and we have got to <Col N="1000" /> work out as best we can and make it as good as we can.  It is idle to suggest that we are automatic heirs to all the scientific and technical knowledge which the world produces.  We are not.  We can, of course, get the knowledge if we have the resources to pick it up, if we can examine it and see in what way it can be of use to our own industries here and only an Institute of Research and Standards can do that kind of valuable work in an organised way.  No single industry by itself can manage to do that or get access to what the world has to offer in technical and scientific knowledge. The Institute, however, can do that and it is because it can do it that I would travel as far as I could with the Minister in saying that this is a body on which we can spend a good deal of money and that we ought to spend a good deal of money on it because it is an investment in knowledge, in experience, in progress and, in the long run, it will pay very substantial dividends particularly to our young and emerging industries.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that this work of financing the Institute can be interpreted as a wider appreciation of the work the Institute can do.  I think that when approaching the Institute from that standpoint we should not consider we are too poor in industrial, scientific and technical equipment to spend money on an Institute of that kind.  We ought rather take the view that every pound spent on an Institute of this kind is an investment in better production, in better articles of produce from our industries which will give us a greater competitive interest in those markets where the competitive spirit is so keen that quality, and even a small difference in price, could determine whether an industry here would thrive or even survive on the basis of quality, production and prices.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I heartily endorse the sentiments expressed by the Minister in the last paragraph of his speech.  This Institute I think can pay good dividends to industry and I hope we will provide for its existence and treat it reasonably with financial support, encouraging it by every means open to us, in the hope that our <Col N="1001" /> industrialists will equip themselves and their industries with the resources which the Institute of Research and Standards makes available, as only it can make available this knowledge for our new industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputies Cosgrave and Norton in welcoming the Bill.  I might advance a small criticism and that is of the name of the Bill.  It is much too long and I think it is one of the reasons why the Institute is so little known&mdash; it has rather an unfortunate name.  I think it would pay to have an institute comparable with the Agricultural Institute.  If the Minister started by limiting the title of the Bill to &ldquo;Industrial Institute Bill&rdquo; I think it would have been better.  Tying it to research and standards, to my mind, suggests that the scope of the Institute is to be limited while I am quite certain the Minister's intention is that it should not be limited in any such way.</P>
      <P>There is such a vast field for such an institute here, such great opportunities to do work so vitally necessary, that we could have left it with the simple title of Industrial Institute in the belief that it would work hand-in-hand with industrial and other organisations to help the expansion of industry.  That may be a minor point but I think it is rather important.  It bears some relation to the criticism of Deputy Norton that the present Institute is very little known.  I think also it would be of advantage if the Institute followed the very good example of its counterpart in the Agricultural Institute by issuing regular bulletins. The Agricultural Institute issues a very useful monthly bulletin and, while it may not be possible for this Institute to issue a bulletin so frequently, I suggest that a quarterly bulletin distributed to industry, to the universities and to the public would help generally to advertise its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the association between the Institute and industry. I should like to see that association extended to the universities and technical schools and to the new Institute that was recently set up.  If we are to develop our own resources to the maximum <Col N="1002" /> extent we shall need the co-operation of every organisation, scientific and technological.  For that reason I should like to see greater association with universities and technological institutes.</P>
    <P>As other Deputies have pointed out, the grant for the Institute up to now&mdash; some £35,000 &mdash; is hopelessly inadequate. I think I am correct in saying that we spend a fantastically small sum on scientific research compared with any other productive country.  Other small countries spend enormous sums on such research and if we want to take our rightful place in this new emerging European trade group, obviously we cannot afford to stint on scientific research.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill makes provision to enable the Institute to assist inventors. This is a very useful provision and I hope it will be availed of fully. I am not quite clear from the Minister's remarks how capital grants would be provided.  There is reference in the Bill to the cost of administration but no reference to capital costs.  Possibly the Minister will explain that when replying.</P>
    <P>There are two essential qualifications for the success of this Institute.  It must be autonomous.  That is why I feel a little bit uneasy about the Minister retaining certain powers regarding appointments to certain specialised posts.  I do not understand what these posts are.  Perhaps the Minister will elucidate when winding up the debate.  I should far prefer to pick nine competent men and give them complete autonomy and the necessary finance to run this Institute properly.  I should be very slow to retain any links, however tenuous, between the Minister and the work of the Institute.  I am certainly in favour of giving them the freest possible hand to appoint their own staff and get on with their job.</P>
    <P>This Bill in many ways is another indication of the developments that have been taking place in recent years here.  I have mentioned the Agricultural Institute but we also had the Irish Management Institute and the Productivity Council, all of which are working towards very well defined and essential <Col N="1003" /> ends&mdash;the raising of the general level of efficiency and endeavouring to make the country and its people more productive-minded, more efficient and better able to sell their wares against other countries of the world.</P>
    <P>I do not know what views the Minister has on the question of the personnel of this new Board which is to run the Institute.  However, I sincerely hope he will eschew any political appointments when he comes to deciding on the nine persons who are to comprise the Board.  Unfortunately in this country we do tend from time to time to make appointments on a political basis rather than on a basis of qualification or experience.  This Institute is too important to risk favouring any political supporter, however good he may be in other fields, by appointing him to this Board.  I would ask the Minister in appointing the men of his choice to ensure they have the necessary qualifications for their job.</P>
    <P>Although this is an industrial institute I would like to see some representative of agriculture on it.  That may seem a bit incongruous but agriculture in one form or another does supply the most essential and the most valuable raw materials we have.  It would be a natural and logical link with our greatest natural resource if at least one representative of agriculture were appointed on the Board.  I am certain the Minister will ensure that the other branches of industry and commerce will be represented&mdash;accountancy, economics and so on.  I would like to see the industrial worker being brought into the picture as well because on his co-operation, goodwill and skill depends the success of our industrial expansion.  If the Minister is guided purely by getting the nine best men I am sure this Institute will be the success we all hope it will be.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister or his successor, if he is to have a successor in the near future, need worry about getting this Dáil or any future Dáil to vote the necessary funds.  We are all alive to the necessity for giving industry all the tools it requires to make a success of this job and the fact <Col N="1004" /> that European free trade is very near at hand makes it all the more urgent that we be fully equipped to take advantage of the opportunities that offer.  Personally I would rather look to the opportunities that offer than to the threats to our existence about which we have heard so much recently.  The emerging European free trade area will be a challenge to our ability as a people and I feel confident that if we are given the necessary tools to do the job we can do it. I wish the Minister every success with his Bill and I am sure he has the support of every member of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to raise the standard of Irish products and to ensure that, where products meet the specifications laid down by the Board, a trade mark may be used.  It is an offence to use this trade mark if there is any deterioration in the specification or standard laid down.  However, I am interested in something else.  I do not know whether I am entitled to raise the matter under this Bill but I think I am.  No one should have the right to manufacture or produce anything unless he has a licence.  I mentioned to the Minister a few times during the year the junk that is put on the market for home consumption.  Under Section 44 of this Bill the Minister can prohibit the manufacture of anything but the latter part of the provision reads: &ldquo;... which the Minister considers necessary or desirable for the purpose of promoting the safe use of such commodity by the public.&rdquo;  That merely means the Minister can prohibit the manufacture of an article if it is not safe.  An article could be a fraud and still be safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have experience in regard to articles put on the market which will last only while you look at them.  I saw an umbrella which was in use only three days when a strut broke in half. It was sent back to the manufacturer where a new strut was fitted.  Within a week another strut broke.  It was downright robbery to charge a girl 17/6d. for something that would not last a fortnight.  Articles of this sort should not be permitted to be produced unless they can stand up to certain <Col N="1005" /> wear and tear.  There should be some way of protecting the public.  I know of a young lady who bought a handbag for 17/6.  The handle was made of some sort of bone material which broke within a couple of days.  She held it together with a piece of wire but within a week the other side of the handle broke.  There are cheap stockings on the market a pair of which I bought for 2/-.  That evening you could see both of my heels.  There are also supposed to be giant packets of various commodities.  There are large tins of polish with false tops on them; in other words the tin is only half full. Likewise you will find a lot of packing on a commodity giving the impression that it is good value.  That type of fraud should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>Another practice which should be stopped is the selling of stale sweets to children.  These sweets are sold cheap but they are not fit for human consumption.  I know of cases where the doctor had to be summoned after children had eaten such sweets.  There are all sorts of commodities of that sort whose sale the Minister should prohibit.  I remember some years ago Japanese bicycles being imported here which were sold on Bachelor's Walk. They were all right to look at but when you rode out on them you discovered the ball bearings were like a piece of putty.  I am not saying all our goods are as bad as these but a lot of junk is being put on the market for sale.  The Minister should prohibit the sale of such articles unless they can stand up to some test.</P>
    <P>I would also draw the Minister's attention to the practice of certain upholsterers who purchase old mattresses for use for upholstering new furniture.  They should have some sort of fumigating plant, where fibre and such commodity is used, to ensure that people will not be stuck with some verminous matter.  I would ask the Minister to look into the whole question and not to permit any article to be manufactured for sale unless it conforms to certain standards.  It is not enough to ensure that certain articles only will have a mark and must stand up to specification.  I am asking the Minister to protect the community in <Col N="1006" /> respect of certain goods which are put on the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill the Minister has tightened administration considerably.  The provisions are an improvement on the original Bill.  The Institute has perhaps been in some ways a disappointment to people who were keen on its initiation about 15 years ago.  Much of the criticisms of the original Bill at that time were substantiated by experience in years afterwards. However, that is all water under the bridge and there is not much sense in going back on it now.  The present Bill will commend itself to anybody who takes the trouble to think about it as a much more business-like effort and as a Bill which will do its part to achieve the aim for which it is designed.</P>
      <P>Apart from the defects in organisation in the original structure of the Institute there was the general overall defect that it tended to put the Institute in a vacuum, to leave it unassociated with related spheres of activity and, of necessity in that context, to leave it under-financed.  How far can these defects be remedied under the present legislation?  I think the proposed legislation can go a long way to improve the situation.  First of all, in the provision for a single Board you have a provision for unified direction and unified activity which must be the first principle in getting anything done. Therefore, on that basis and its administrative structure, I have very little to say to the Bill other than to share the opinion of others who have welcomed the Bill and feel it is well worth supporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is a lot to be said in regard to standards and specifications except that the work being done under the old Bill can be continued. Broadly speaking, there are two aspects of that matter.  There is the progressive fixing of standards for the convenience of industry which is a useful service.  That, perhaps, has been the most successful aspect of the Institute to date.  That work can continue in the new framework.  There is also the question of fixing standards for the benefit of the public whether in matters of safety or for the better administration <Col N="1007" /> of our industrial policy.  That also can be achieved under the Bill.  It will perhaps require some initiative from the Minister's Department if one wants to follow the road in that direction further but there is not very much more to be said on that.</P>
    <P>When we come to industrial research there is more room for discussion. Everybody welcomes the idea of industrial research.  Opposition speakers have gone so far as to say in so many words that unlimited funds should be provided for industrial research. There have been very many general statements of that nature.  That is all very well but let us come down to earth and see what the problem is in regard to industrial research.</P>
    <P>Industrial research is not a thing that you can carry out by putting yourself so to speak in a corner whether under the name of an institute or anything else, and carrying on, regardless. It presupposes a wide area of contacts and it presupposes a great deal of co-ordination of effort not only directly in any particular programme of research but in related fields.  One of the criticisms of the old Institute was that perhaps it was left too much in a vacuum.  Perhaps the number of people who were enthusiastic about it at the beginning had the idea of an Institute which would carry on under its own steam and provide all its own resources.  I do not think that is practical in the modern world.</P>
    <P>When it comes to industrial research, this Institute must function as a directing and co-ordinating body.  Because of that consideration, the change the Minister is making in the organisation of the Institute is vital and very efficient.</P>
    <P>When it comes to industrial research it is not a question of a board sitting down around a table and saying: &ldquo;We we will do research.&rdquo;  There is too much general research going on in the world and too much research has been done for any profit to come from such a general approach.  The only thing we can hope for in a practical line is that the board will consider specific <Col N="1008" /> problems and any specific problem in industrial research which will be sizable will probably, before it is finished, be beyond the local resources of any Institute such as we intend to set up.  When a sizable problem of industrial research comes up, what the directors and the people who sit down to solve that problem will be faced with is the gathering of information, the organising of work to be done not only in their own institution, their own laboratories, their own plant, but in other institutions or at another site, perhaps.  They will be faced with the problem of securing the co-operation of, perhaps, some industry, university or other institute.  Not only must the research task become specific before it becomes a realistic thing at all, it must also be distributed over the points where it can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I think there should be some careful thinking on that by the people who talk about spending money on an Institute of this nature.  The function of this Board, as I see it, would be to collect information, get the work done at the appropriate points perhaps in an industry or in a plant that has the facility for doing the work, perhaps in a university laboratory and even get experimentation done abroad and, perhaps, erect a pilot plant or something of that kind and have that supplemented by some work in their own laboratory, using their own scientists who will be limited in number and using their own equipment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in this connection I think that the Institute in its reconstituted form should be encouraged to make contact not only with our universities but with all our other technical institutions and with our industries.  After all, research, especially industrial research, is just, shall I say, another name for experiment.  This will have to be supplemented by the collection of information, the utilisation of library services, statistical services and probably in the case of industries commercial information, that is, economic information.  Therefore, the function of this Board must be a very broad one and their success will depend in my view upon how far they can call upon the resources that are available in all <Col N="1009" /> our technical institutions, some of our universities, our technical schools, the laboratories of big firms, in the actual plants of small firms.  Success will depend on their ability to assess what resources are available to them as well as their own and the ability to take a special job, organise it and use those general resources which I have mentioned in the best, speediest and most economic way to get a solution for the particular problem with which they are confronted.</P>
    <P>I see no other way in which industrial research can be done in this country.  It will, therefore, be as much a management business for this Board as a research job in their laboratory. In Glasnevin they have the buildings, the equipment and a laboratory which are all very fine in their own way but let us face the facts.  Very limited resources are available to an Institute of that size having regard to modern developments, the size of modern industry, the complexity of modern life and the complexity of the present state of technical knowledge pure and applied.</P>
    <P>Anybody who thinks that sizable problems will be brought into a laboratory and worked out in Glasnevin and that that is the end of it will be restricting himself to a very confined field altogether.  It is for that reason I feel I should emphasise again the function of the Board as a directing Board, as a co-ordinating Board and as a Board which will seize on a problem, make it specific and then organise the working on that problem having regard to all the resources available. To do that task the Board from the beginning must be in contact with all the resources available and be able to put itself in a position where it can call upon them.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a matter which has cropped up before in other forms. It is the so-called distinction between pure and applied research.  There is not any such distinction really.  Very often the applied research of today is following the pure research of yesterday. Very often the two are indistinguishably interlinked.  Although in modern countries the specific following <Col N="1010" /> of a problem in industry is a specialised thing in itself and has the right to be followed as such, nevertheless the other fields, the so-called pure or academic fields of research, have a bearing there and can contribute in two ways.</P>
    <P>First of all, they can contribute information. Secondly there is the contribution they make in the training of personnel who will ultimately be involved in the technical field.  It is for that reason that I mention on this Stage the words in Section 8, subsection (3) &ldquo;applied to industry&rdquo; which restricts.  No such narrow restriction should be imposed overall, I submit, because frequently it is from the academic-minded, if they are properly harnessed, that the most fruitful ideas come.  It is significant that in other countries in this modern age it is the most academic of the academic-minded who very often are brought in as associates in industrial research or who are consulted in that matter.</P>
    <P>It is also rather significant that, during the pressure of the war years and the post-war years, people like pure mathematicians, theoretical physicists and chemists were inevitably called upon to assist when a problem developed to a certain size.  That is the case in the aircraft industry, the chemical industry and in the development of modern physics and so on. Therefore, we would be wise in this country, quite apart from the fact that we have few resources we can afford to put into watertight compartments, to ensure that that attitude should be maintained in regard to this matter from the beginning.</P>
    <P>There is the question of staffing.  One of the difficulties here is going to be that of getting and attracting staff of adequate calibre.  We have the same problem in our academic institutions. Indeed, the same problem is found abroad in institutions in getting properly qualified staffs.  In a matter of this sort, unless we have a certain percentage of top-grade scientists in an Institute of this nature, we are not going to get top-grade returns.  To get top-rate scientists at the moment means paying adequate rates.  There will be, I anticipate, a question of proper remuneration <Col N="1011" /> of scientists in this regard. The day is passing when the administrator alone will be the person who will draw the highest grades of pay in State services or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, think that people who are willing to spend money in this Institute, or who are willing to advise the Government to spend money on it, will agree this is the best investment that can be made.  We must invest in securing the proper personnel and it is then a question of keeping them sufficiently interested in the needs of the community and how they can be supplied. I think it was Deputy Russell who spoke about autonomy.  I am all for autonomy, particularly on the question of the prosecution of research in scientific and industrial matters.  In the case of industrial research, however, it will come to nothing unless it is specific and I think the Minister should make it a point to see that whatever research is done is specific and is devoted to something that is going to be worth while from the point of view of the community.</P>
    <P>I would point out that there is an essential difference between this type of Institute and, say, the universities, which are there to train scientists, to develop thought.  The same type of autonomy does not apply in both cases and for that reason I think it would be very proper that the Minister should have some say as to what the activities of this Institute of Industrial Research and Standards are to be.  Space research may be a very practical thing for other countries but I do not think that, at the present moment anyway, research into rocket engines should be undertaken here though there is no doubt that it could come into the matter of applied and industrial research.  If any Board of the Institute were foolish enough to go off on some line like that, the Minister would have every right to interfere and say: &ldquo;Look here, we want something more down to earth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I also think the Minister would have a function, on the one hand, in trying to encourage firms and producers to put their problems to the Institute and on the other hand to encourage the Institute Board to tackle these problems <Col N="1012" /> and indicate what they are.  I would not, therefore, go as far as Deputy Russell did on the question of autonomy.  There is, of course, the question of autonomy in the matter of appointments.  I am all for free appointments, the appointment on merit of the best man, but I do draw the line at the suggestion that every Tom, Dick and Harry has the right, with the exception of the Minister, to suggest appointments to a post for which the State is paying.  My remarks are for the sake of balancing the argument.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I do hope the Bill will work more effectively than did its predecessor.  I think the Minister has done a very practical day's work in revising the organisation as he has done.  I think that whatever chance there is for further success will come from a board of this nature.  A board in charge of scientific and industrial research must be composed of people who are experienced in the matter of research.</P>

      <P>In the first place, I should like to take up the suggestion that Section 34, which empowers the Minister to designate certain posts, is taking away a degree of autonomy which should be vested in a board of this sort.  There is no intention on my part or on the part of anybody who will have the obligation of working the Act subsequently to interfere with actual appointments.  The intention is that one or two key posts will be so designated and the Institute itself will have the opportunity of appointing the best person they think it can get for a particular post.  The position is not to interfere with the personnel but to keep an eye on the salary scales the Institute will be inclined to give in order to make sure it does not go unduly out of line with salary scales applicable to other branches of the public service.</P>
      <P>That is the purpose of Section 34 to which some opposition was taken. Otherwise, Section 34 itself removes, on the whole, restrictions that were in the last Act obliging the Institute to come to the Minister on the occasion of every appointment, clerical or otherwise.  It was, in my opinion, far too frustrating for such a body to be obliged to seek authority for making each and every appointment to the Institute Staff, whether clerical or scientific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the personnel of the Board is concerned, I can only say it naturally will be my intention to appoint the very best people I can get to meet the qualification standards as set out in the Section.  Deputy Russell suggested we were prone to make political appointments to boards of one kind or another. I suppose it is not unnatural that the Government in power will know their own supporters better and their qualifications better and will be able to assess the merits of a person known to the members of the Government.  However, I have no intention whatsoever of selecting anybody just because of his political affiliations.  I have made a number of appointments to different boards since I took office in this Department and I think I can say without fear of contradiction that I never <Col N="1014" /> inquired about the appointees' politics either before or after appointments.  In fact, some of the appointments have been acclaimed by the appointees' colleagues on particular boards.</P>
    <P>This is far too important a board to have any persuasion, political or otherwise, other than to procure the very best sort possible.  With regard to the new method of financing the Institute, Deputy Norton asked if that was evidence of a better or more generous approach.  I think that is what it means. In future, the Institute will present, like any other section of the Department, its requirements for the coming year. These will be scrutinised in the Department and will be agreed with the Department of Finance before the estimate is presented to the House so that the Institute will be expected to submit a realistic bill as to what the expenditure is likely to be and, within reasonable limits I shall feel responsible in seeing that there will be no skimping.</P>
    <P>I agree, too, with the remarks of both Deputy Norton and Deputy Russell that the Institute has not been in the past sufficiently widely known Deputy de Valera observed that perhaps we have been disappointed with the results that have come from the Institute.  I think the Institute itself, as the present members of the council readily admit, was unwieldy, that it never got down to work properly.  I am saying that in face of the fact that since it was founded it has produced no less than 102 standard specifications. That is some indication that it was working fairly effectively but, unfortunately, it was not well enough known to industry.  I have been encouraging it for the past couple of years to keep more in touch with industry and I think the Institute has been doing that of its own volition.  They have been inclined to go out and seek industrialists rather than sit in Glasnevin for industrialists to go to them.  That will be the keynote in future years&mdash;to make sure that its advisory services generally will be fully known and fully appreciated by industrialists.  Specifications issued will be brought to the notice of the public so that the general public, too, will be fully aware of the Institute's activities.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say how many of these specifications have been adopted?  The Minister mentioned that over 100 were produced. How many were adopted by industrialists?</P>

      <P>I am advised that only a small number of them were adopted.  As far as the question of capital grants is concerned, it is true that the Institute heretofore was financed within the limits of £35,000 and also by way of special capital grants. There is no provision in the present Bill for capital grants because it is not envisaged that capital grants will be required to the same scale as in the past when the Institute was acquiring equipment and premises but, in so far as capital is required, it will be made available in the annual provision for the Institute.</P>

      <P>Yes, in the past largely to help the Institute equip itself with these new laboratories.  The last point made by Deputy de Valera was that the Minister should keep a watchful eye to ensure that specific research is carried out.  I cannot go into such detail about scientific matters as the Deputy but I know what he means to convey.  It is better that, having appointed a Board in which the House can have confidence, to leave it to the Board to see that the job of research carried out will be specifically designed to help industry.</P>

    <P>Deputy Sherwin made a complaint <Col N="1016" /> about types of commodities which did not live up to what most people would expect.  First of all, it would be impossible to insist on having a licence for the manufacture of every commodity. That would not be tolerated perhaps even in totalitarian States.  However, in so far as there are complaints about such items as ladies' handbags and umbrellas not being fit for the purpose for which they were bought, there is a legal remedy available and it will not be necessary to provide another remedy in the case of these commodities in this Bill.</P>

In addition, certain of the <Col N="986" /> personal allowances were granted as deduc&mdash; tions for Sur-tax purposes with effect as from 1958-59.  It should be noted therefore that the numbers given above for the wears 1958-59 and 1959-60 do not include all persons with incomes in excess of £2,000 as some of these would not be liable to Sur-tax because of the operation of the reliefs mentioned. </P>

      <P>No figures on these lines are compiled and it would not be possible at this stage without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of time and labour to compile them.  I would, however, refer the Deputy to the Return of road accidents compiled annually by the Garda Síochána, copies of which are laid on the Table of the House.  That Return includes a table showing the number of vehicles of different types that have been involved in accidents.</P>
