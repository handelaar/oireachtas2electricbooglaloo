      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That means there is no amendment down to a section to which I drew attention before.  That is Section 13.  Section 13 provides that a judge of any court shall not be prevented or disabled from hearing any case relating to a charity even though he is a member of the board and has, so to speak, formed an opinion on it. I want to put down an amendment to that.</P>

      <P>On every section? What I am proposing was done previously in connection with external investment legislation where there was a big number of amendments.  They were accepted temporarily with an explanation from the Minister in charge of the amendments.  That legislation went forward as new legislation and it was open to amendment on Report Stage.  We have adopted that procedure over and over again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are prepared to facilitate the Government to incorporate in the Bill the wide variety of amendments the Parliamentary Secretary is now submitting, on condition that on next Stage we can submit amendments and discuss them with full freedom.  Personally I believe the simplest thing is to recommit the Bill, as amended, <i>in toto</i>, and then there would be no misunderstanding.  The Bill has not taken long to go through the House; it is not a controversial measure.  The volume of amendments submitted by the Parliamentary Secretary now is such as to change the appearance of the Bill, and I think the Opposition ought to be given a chance of looking at this considerable volume of amendments.  The wise course would be to recommit the whole Bill.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment which proposes to delete the words &ldquo;and acquire, hold and dispose of land&rdquo; in Section 5.

      <P>I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that this will create unnecessary difficulty.  We are all aware that the senior member may be a bad chairman and that the Board may in their wisdom ordinarily choose some other member to preside in the absence of the chairman.  If you say in the Act that the senior member present shall be the Chairman unless the Board chooses somebody else it is manifestly an affront to the senior member to choose somebody else.  The Board will have full discretion if the words &ldquo;the senior member&rdquo; are omitted and the amendment reads: &ldquo;At a meeting of the Board, if the Chairman of the Board is absent, such other member as the Board may select shall be appointed Chairman.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have not very strong views on the matter.  This is a suggestion by the Commissioners.  I think they can be assumed to know how to regulate their meetings to the best advantage.  As they suggested it, I have adopted it.  It is preserving one of the traditions of the Board that the senior member does preside. He may not want to preside at a particular meeting.  We are giving the Board the power, then, to select some other member.</P>

      <P>The House will recall that we had a discussion on this on Second Stage.  Under this section, <Col N="176" /> membership of the Board of itself alone shall not disqualify a Judge from hearing and determining a charity matter.  As I pointed out on the Second Stage the words &ldquo;by reason solely&rdquo; are of vital importance.  The Judge Commissioner might be prevented or disabled from hearing a charity case for a number of reasons.  He might be a trustee of the charity as, for instance, where he was a member of the board of a charitable institution such as a hospital. In such cases and also in the case of a charity matter which had come before the judge as Commissioner, what I referred to on Second Stage as &ldquo;the ordinary etiquette of the judiciary&rdquo; would prevail so as to prevent his acting in as it were a dual capacity.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the history of the matter.  The present Board of Commissioners owe their origin to an Act of 1844.  Prior to that, there was another Board set up in 1800.  Under the 1844 Act, the members were to be the Master of the Rolls, the Chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer and the Judge of the Court of Prerogative &ldquo;together with ten other proper and discreet persons.&rdquo;  The Probate Act of 1861 removed the Judge of the Court of Prerogative from the Board and allowed for the appointment of a Commissioner in his stead.  Subsequently, the offices of Master of the Rolls and Chief Baron ceased to exist.</P>
      <P>Since 1922, three persons became both Judges and Commissioners.  Two were not judges when they were appointed. The third was a Judge when he was appointed.  I found on checking the matter since that I was incorrect in what I said on the Second Stage in this regard.  I was under the impression at the time that what had happened in the post-1922 cases was that certain Commissioners had become judges.  As I say, there was one exception.  However, whether they were judges first and Commissioners afterwards or <i>vice versa</i> does not in any way invalidate my argument that there is nothing inherently improper in having judges as Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1922, it was always the practice to have a judge of the Superior Courts on the Board and a judge appointed <Col N="177" /> in 1918 continued to serve till two years prior to his death in 1949. The first Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests were established by an Act of the old Irish Parliament of 1800.  They consisted of&mdash;and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;the lord high chancellor of Ireland, the chief judges, and the other judges of His Majesty's courts of King's bench, common pleas, and exchequer of Ireland, for the time being, the judge or commissary of His Majesty's court of prerogative in Ireland&rdquo;, the Provost of Trinity College and others.  These Commissioners were set up to sue for the recovery of charitable donations and bequests withheld, concealed or misapplied and to apply them, when recovered, according to the directions and intentions of the donor or donors or to apply them <i>cy-près</i>.  Prior to the Union, a Committee, assisted by two judges, was appointed by the Irish House of Lords in 1764 to sue for the recovery of charitable bequests and donations &ldquo;withheld, embezzled and concealed.&rdquo;  This Committee was discontinued by the Union and the establishment of the first Board of Commissioners. The preamble to the 1844 Act also mentions the concealment and misapplication of donations and bequests, the object of the Act being to see to it &ldquo;that the pious intentions of charitable persons should not be defeated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The powers of the Board are not very extensive.  Moreover, the powers of the Board to sue for the recovery of gifts are practically never used.  The usual practice is for the Board to certify charity cases involving the taking of legal proceedings to the Attorney-General.  The power to certify cases is contained in Section 5 of the 1867 Act&mdash;Section 26 of the Bill &mdash;and is analogous to a case where a judge sends the papers to the Attorney-General for a prosecution for perjury.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would a judge who sent the papers preside at a perjury trial?  No, clearly not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the analogy is not complete.  The Board may authorise or direct a person other than the Attorney-General to institute legal proceedings&mdash;Section 5 of the 1867 Act and Section 25 of the Bill&mdash;but in <Col N="178" /> practice they seldom or ever do so. However, the Board do from time to time themselves seek directions, including the making of a <i>cy-près</i> scheme, of the High Court under Romilly's Act, 1812, but this does not, of course, involve a Judge Commissioner in having to act in two different capacities.  To talk about the Commissioners contesting actions is misleading.  They do not contest actions.  If a case involving the Commissioners goes to the High Court or Supreme Court, the ordinary practice and protocol adopted by Judges would prevail if a Judge Commissioner had already been connected with the case as a Commissioner so as to prevent him from adjudicating on it as a Judge.</P>
      <P>Since this matter was raised on the Second Stage, it has been considered fully by the Government.  We are satisfied that there is no need to amend or alter Section 13.  This is the first time, as far as I can ascertain, in the long history of the present Commissioners and of their predecessors that an issue has been raised about Judges being Commissioners; and there is no record of any difficulty ever arising.  There is nothing new or novel in that the Commissioners include amongst them a member of the Superior Courts Judiciary. Judges have been Commissioners since 1800.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has entirely missed the point. The point is not whether judges should be commissioners but whether a commissioner who is a judge and who sends the case for legal proceedings should preside as a judge when the case comes for hearing.  That is completely wrong.  No question is being raised as to whether a judge should be eligible for appointment as a commissioner. That is agreed.  They have been there.  The original Act insists that three judges should be on the Board.  That is not the case any longer. Judges may be commissioners and nobody objects to that.  What I object to is the provision in the section which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Judge of any Court shall not be prevented or disabled by reason solely of his being a member of the <Col N="179" /> Board from hearing and determining any case relating to a charity or any case arising under this Act, but may hear and determine it as if he were not a member of the Board.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told me that the ordinary run of the law, so to speak, the rules which guide the judges in respect of hearing cases will prevent a commissioner who is a judge from presiding as a judge of the case but why not leave it that he should not be allowed?  In addition to everything else, the fact that he is a member of the Board should prevent him from hearing a charity case.  He should be prevented from hearing cases in which the legal proceedings have been instituted by the Board of which he is a member. Surely that is completely wrong.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that Judge X is a member of the Board.  Let us take Section 25.  Under Section 25, the Board may authorise legal proceedings.  I think it is entirely wrong that Commissioner X, who is a judge, joining with the Board in authorising the legal proceedings, should go down to his court a few weeks later and hear a case upon which he has made up his mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish my argument.  Is justice likely to attract the public attention as being done if a judge sitting as a member of the Board who authorise legal proceedings sits a week after to hear the proceedings which he has authorised?  I think that is completely wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer to the Deputy is that the situation which he envisages would not arise. When a judge comes to try any case, he will consider the matter and if there is any one of a variety of reasons why he should not try that case, he will not try it.  Let us take the case Deputy McGilligan referred to.  In a case where the judge referred the papers to the Attorney General, he would almost certainly not try that case if it ever came before him, but there is no statutory provision preventing him from doing so.  Why does Deputy McGilligan not insist that we should put the provision into the law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has been all right up to now.  Surely all the section does is to say that because a judge happens to be made a charity commissioner, he may hear charity cases.  In other words, he has, because of his particular mental powers, been deemed a sensible person to deal with charities under the Board.  I can see that Deputy McGilligan has some sort of case in saying it is undesirable, but some time ago there was a bit of a <Col N="182" /> furore about the senior members of the Board possibly being affronted if they were overlooked in being made temporary chairmen.  I can visualise senior members of the Bench being affronted if we do not trust them to use their ordinary commonsense.  I think they would have a much better reason to feel affronted than would senior members of the Board on being overlooked as temporary chairmen.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 24, to delete &ldquo;and declared&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to deal with amendments Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>First of all, it is proposed to amend Section 14 so as to bring the law into conformity with the modern accountancy practice of the Local Government auditors.  Secondly, it is proposed to deal with a point in regard to perjury raised by Deputy McGilligan on the Second Stage.  Paragraph (c) of the new subsection (4) will be in substitution of the existing paragraph (d).  Where a statement or representation made on examination on oath before the auditor is false or misleading in any material respect to the knowledge of the maker, an offence will be committed under the proposed new subsection (4).  This will, I think, cover the Deputy's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is withdrawing the term &ldquo;perjury&rdquo;.  It is no longer used.  In amendment No. 7, paragraph (c) is in substitution for paragraph (d) of the Bill.  As it stands here, the phrase was used that any <Col N="183" /> person who on such examination on oath wilfully makes any false statement shall be deemed guilty of perjury.  Now we have it that a person who on such examination makes false or misleading statements in any material respect shall be guilty of an offence.  The offence is not defined so I presume it is something in the nature of perjury.  In addition, it is to be a summary conviction and the penalty is to be either a fine of £25 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both.</P>
      <P>First of all, I am wondering how far this is consistent with what the newspapers show this morning with regard to certain smuggling offences being declared criminal.  This is a criminal matter, too.  The decision was badly reported this morning but there was considerable questioning in court as to the amount of the fine and the terms of imprisonment which would remove the matter from the region of a summary offence.  The Parliamentary Secretary will understand that this is not a summary offence, that a person has the right to look for trial by jury.  However, we shall leave that over to see what all this really amounts to.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to know what is the purpose of the extension of the phrase, &ldquo;any person who makes any statement or representation which is false or misleading in any material respect.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is this some very definite change now from the scheme of the Perjury Act, which is drafted in terms that a person commits perjury if he says something in any judicial proceeding which is material to that proceeding and which he either knows to be false or does not believe to be true? Is &ldquo;misleading&rdquo; supposed to be covered by &ldquo;not believing it to be true&rdquo;?  It is a new term introduced into the law and I want to know what it means.</P>

      <P>There is one point on the section.  If the Parliamentary Secretary gave an explanation of this on Second Reading, I apologise.  I did not hear him.  I take it that the Vote for Charitable Donations and Bequests will not disappear out of the account and in so far as that part of the money is concerned will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, as as it has been.  Why should there be two auditors in respect of this?  Why should the Audit Department not deal with this?  What is the point of bringing in the Minister for Local Government and the Local Government auditors?  I understood, in the Committee of Public Accounts, that our heart is broken and the Comptroller and Auditor General's heart is broken by delays because of there being too much work already on the Local Government auditors.  It does not strike me as being a very efficient way to get this done if on this already over-burdened set of gentlemen we now put another burden.  Some of the Local Government auditors' audits are a year behind.  I can see the Minister for Justice at some future date champing <Col N="187" /> about because he is not getting the report as the Minister for Local Government has not got the report on the accounts.  What is the real reason for bringing another Minister into this? There are two in it already&mdash;the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice.  Now a third one comes in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change, of course.  This is the way things have always been done and the Comptroller and Auditor General, of course, is responsible for auditing the expenditure of moneys out of the Department of Justice Vote and that must continue to be so but, then, the accounts of the Board are an entirely different matter. They have always been audited by Local Government auditors.  By now, the Local Government auditors are completely familiar with them, with the various funds, and so on.  I should not like to be very authoritative about it but I imagine that they would be more suitable people to audit these types of accounts&mdash;the accounts of the Board as distinct from the purely Comptroller and Auditor General type of auditing that the Department of Justice Vote is subjected to.</P>

      <P>I am aroused by another point of view from that expressed by Deputy Sheldon.  I take this to mean that the auditor would be an outside auditor, a commercial auditor.  In any event, whether it is not so intended, it may be.  The auditor is merely defined here as the auditor appointed by the Minister to hold the audit.  That would certainly leave it open.  I would suggest bringing in an outsider.  I am sure that Deputy Sheldon from his services on the Public Accounts Committee must know that the Comptroller and Auditor General has very limited functions &mdash;very limited indeed.  He sees that moneys are properly voted and go into the proper hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  That is one of the reasons why the Comptroller and Auditor General should not be brought in.  Secondly, we are moving in to what we call professional auditors, who have been, so to speak, trained in the Department of Local Government, who have specialised functions and specialised practice.  I am sure Deputy Sheldon is aware of the view that prevails in many instances, that, for instance, with all the very heavy State companies it was found better to have outside auditors brought in.  These auditors belong to a Department and we are handing these men something new.  In any event, whatever may be the intention of the present Government and the present Parliamentary Secretary, it is wide open to bring in a firm of outside auditors.  For that reason I accept this.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10 may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to substitute the following subsection for subsection (1), namely:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Where the trustees of a charity apply to the Board for their opinion or advice respecting the charity or the administration thereof or the property thereof or the application of the property or any question or dispute relating thereto or where the executors of a will containing a charitable devise or bequest apply to the Board for their opinion or advice respecting the devise or bequest or the administration thereof or the application thereof or any question or dispute relating thereto, the Board shall consider the application and may, if they think fit, give such opinion or advice as they think expedient.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to enlarge Section 21 by including executors of a will containing a charitable gift amongst the <Col N="195" /> persons to whom the Board may give an opinion or advice.  The section as at present drafted is confined to the trustees of a charity.  In practice, the Board from time to time give opinions and advice to executors.  I should make it clear that the Board do not give an opinion as to whether a trust is or is not a charitable trust and it is not proposed to empower them to do so.</P>
    <P>Both subsection (1) and subsection (3) of Section 21 have been redrafted to cover executors.  In doing so, the draftsman has availed himself of the opportunity of removing some confusion which could arise by reason of the words &ldquo;subject to any order subsequently made by a Court of competent jurisdiction&rdquo; which conclude the present subsection (1).  These words do not appear in the proposed new subsection (1).  However, the proposed new subsection (3) makes it clear that the immunity of a trustee or executor acting on the advice of the Board will not continue after a Court of competent jurisdiction has pronounced on the matter.  Naturally, if the Court makes an order contrary to the advice of the Board, the trustee or executor is bound to act on the Court order. He cannot rely on the Board's advice any further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The removal of the phrase which now ends subsection (1) of Section 21 is apparently being considered only from the point of view of the immunity given to the members of the Board.  As I read Section 21, I thought it meant that the Board could give such opinion as they thought expedient but that opinion was clearly to be subordinate to any order later made by a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Striking that out seems to me to have the objective of saying that the Board can give any opinion they like and that it does not matter what a court of competent jurisdiction later says about it.  I was rather anxious about that.  I can see the point about immunity in relation to a court of competent jurisdiction which is now in the new amendment No. 9, but what is the position with regard to an advisory <Col N="196" /> opinion?  As subsection (1) of Section 21 stood, it meant that the Board could give an opinion or advice as they thought expedient but that was subject to a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  You made your opinion, subject to an order given later.  Removing that looks as if the opinion would still have effect, even if the court afterwards said something different.  It certainly looks like that to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely why the new subsection (1) is now proposed.  To my mind, anyway, it did not make much sense as it was originally and we decided to tidy it up and make clear exactly what we meant.  No matter what way you read subsection (1) at the moment, you are in difficulty.  How could you give an opinion subject to an order made subsequently?  The order is not in existence when you are giving the opinion and nevertheless your opinion is supposed to be subject to that order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>But at the time you are giving the opinion, there is no order in existence.  How can it be subject to something that does not exist?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, I think we should avail of this opportunity to amend the section, tidy it up and make perfectly clear what it means. In other words, the opinion of the Board will protect trustees or executors until such time as a court intervenes and from then on the protection disappears, if the trustee or executor acts in contradiction of what the court has decided.</P>

      <P>Surely that is a bad principle?  Wherever the Parliamentary Secretary has taken that from&mdash; and I gather it is a provision that was originally in the Act of 1867&mdash;surely, in general, it is a bad principle to provide that where a judge is a member of the body which determines that it is expedient to embark on litigation that judge may be called on to hear the litigation which he himself has taken part in initiating?</P>
      <P>I do not profess to be familiar with the historical background that suggested the provision of such a permission in the statute of 1867, but it seems to me that in 1961 the convention is well established in the minds of all of us that a judge in the course of other duties may be required to initiate litigation and thereby disqualify himself from hearing cause.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that he would, of course, disqualify himself.  Is it not an extraordinary thing for us to legislate here expressly that he need not disqualify himself?  Surely, if we refer to the matter at all, we should emphasise that he ought to disqualify himself?  It seems to be most unfortunate that, by implication, we should suggest by the terms of our legislation that we do not think it necessarily inappropriate that a judge should preside over the control of litigation that he himself has initiated.</P>

      <P>They are entrusted by the Oireachtas with the administration of justice.  They have their own rules of procedure governing their conduct. All we are doing here is saying that, simply because a judge is a member of the Charity Commissioners, he shall not, for that reason alone, be debarred from hearing any charity matter.  There will be cases coming before a judge in the normal way, administration suits, and various cases in which charity matters will be involved. We want to make it perfectly clear that in these cases, where the Charity Commissioners do not enter into the picture at all, nothing will prevent the judge from trying the particular case.  Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan suggest it is dangerous to do that, though I think Deputy McGilligan now agrees that this is the sensible way to approach the matter; if I understand him correctly he said he would be prepared to exclude specifically cases where the Charity Commissioners actually institute proceedings so as to prevent a Judge Commissioner hearing such cases.</P>

If that had occurred, we should have had an argument about it.  Here we are carrying forward a stipulation from 1867 and we are saying a judge shall not be disqualified.  Remember the phrase: &ldquo;from hearing any case relating to a charity or any case arising under this Act.&rdquo;  Surely that is a reference well ahead to those sections under which the Board may institute, or authorise others to institute on their behalf, certain proceedings.

Deputy Dillon, on an amendment, shared the horror of Deputy McGilligan that we might hurt the feelings of a senior member of the Board by stipulating that it might not be possible to have him as chairman.  Now he does not seem to mind the feelings of the judiciary being hurt by suggesting they might act improperly.

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the point is that a judge who acts in the capacity of a member of the Board is already functioning <i>quasi</i> judicially. The whole point in having the Commissioners is to have a body which will institute these proceedings.  Functioning quasi-judicially is probably the best way of describing it.  The judge has certain duties and they impose on him the duty of approaching these matters at the high level of a trustee and somebody exercising the equivalent of a judicial discretion. Therefore, generally speaking, if this body of which he is a member initiate or are a party to judicial proceedings, it will be more in the nature of having a case stated, seeking advice and direction in the same spirit in which that body originally considered the matter at issue.  The circumstances are very different from those in which a body might have an interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances, I cannot see that there is any danger. I cannot see that there is any contradiction in having the same provision as that which exists in the old Act and which is <Col N="203" /> being carried into this piece of legislation. I did hesitate in order to consider the point made by Deputy McGilligan that this is new legislation. The phrase &ldquo;for the Act as a whole&rdquo; is included and, on further consideration, I think the same principle will rule.  Quite apart from Deputy Sheldon's point, with which I sympathise, I think there is no contradiction, that the going from the Commissioners to the Courts is merely a stage in what might be considered as the one judicial process. For that reason, I think Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon are over-anxious in this matter.</P>

The section is not being amended by the Parliamentary Secretary on the grounds that the possibility envisaged by Deputy de Valera is utterly unthinkable. Is that not so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said it was utterly unthinkable and that it was unnecessary for us to provide against it.  It is probably a revelation to the Parliamentary Secretary to realise it is not only possible but that some of his own colleagues think that in certain circumstances it could be desirable.</P>
      <P>All I want to say is that if there was no reference to the matter at all in the Bill, this issue probably would not arise because we could all proceed on the legitimate assumption that where a judge participated in the initiation of litigation as a member of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests he could be assumed to disqualify himself from providing that he himself would preside over any such litigation in the Court.  What I demur to and what Deputy McGilligan demurs to is that under a new law made in 1961 by Dáil Éireann we go out of our way to employ a phrase which Deputy de Valera interprets as meaning that it is not only reasonable to suggest that a judge might preside over such litigation but that in certain circumstances it might be desirable that he would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think in any circumstances would it be desirable that a judge should preside over litigation for the initiation of which he had himself been <Col N="205" /> in part responsible.  That is the simple point.  I do not think we ought to say in a statute of Dáil Éireann, expressly or by implication, that we think the view expressed by Deputy de Valera is acceptable.  I do not want to widen the scope of this discussion, but I think the more the judiciary are asked to undertake extraneous work apart from their judicial functions, the more dangers of this kind we create.  There has been a tendency growing not only here but in Great Britain and elsewhere to invite judges to undertake all sorts of extraneous work as chairmen of commissions and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard it as that but we have not got the custody of the King's conscience in this country now. These archaic forms had their advantages and disadvantages.  I do not think we wish to widen the discussion to that extent now.  I think this is an appropriate occasion on which to suggest that one of the great treasures of our system of judiciary is the detachment of the judiciary from every other branch of government and every activity other than the dispensing of justice.  The more we involve them by the statute law of this House in other matters, whether they be commissions, inquiries or anything else, the more we expose them to legitimate comment on the way in which they have discharged their duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is accepted in our system that the administration of justice is above criticism.  The more we sustain and support that view, the better it is for society.  In so far as we impose on judges the duty to do something other than the dispensation of justice, the more we create occasions on which they may be subjected to legitimate criticism in the discharge of their duties.  The one thing we want to treasure and protect is public confidence in the absolute detachment of a judge when administering justice. I am not speaking as a member of <Col N="206" /> the Bar; I am speaking as a plain and ordinary citizen.  I cannot doubt that it must create misapprehension in the minds of many ordinary people that the proposition should be defended that it could be proper for a judge acting as a Commissioner of Charitable Donations and Bequests to initiate litigation and that, when that litigation came to trial, the judge who participated in its initiation should himself hear the case.  I am sure there is no rational person who would approve of that.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says he defends this provision on the ground that it is unthinkable that such a thing could ever arise.  Deputy de Valera rises behind him and says not only is it not unthinkable but that in certain circumstances it might be desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

Deputy de Valera is a member of the legal profession.  For years he has been a member of this House and has long experience of public life.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary would agree with me that we in Dáil Éireann should not legislate on the lines which appear to be acceptable to Deputy de Valera, that we should preserve the concept of a judge who participated in the initiation of litigation certainly not presiding over it when it comes to trial.  Because there appears to be an express assertion in this Bill that we think it is proper that he should in certain circumstances do that, I demur at the terms of the Bill. I think a form of words should be found which would preserve the right of a judge who happens to be a member of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests to hear cases involving general charitable questions, which would expressly state that that did not include litigation initiated or participated in by the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, of which, for the time being, a particular judge happened to be a member.</P>

I thoroughly agree that the preservation of the integrity of the judiciary is of paramount importance wherever it is involved.  There is no difference between us on that principle. In this case, the argument I was making&mdash;and I was making it merely as a supplementary argument without derogating from what the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Sheldon said; I agree with both of them&mdash;was that even if Deputy McGilligan's fears were founded, and even if this thing could happen, it could be justifiable in a particular case.  Let me be absolutely blunt.  There could be no question of agreeing in the ordinary way to a judge being a party to litigation, or initiating legislation, and then hearing it.

      <P>It is not a question of anyone here having a vested right.  Supposing the Commissioners <Col N="208" /> of Charitable Donations and Bequests found an unclear point of law which it was desirable should be cleared up. It may be that the point of law was not unclear, but that it was arguable, and that it would be for the benefit of all to have it judicially decided, thus saving a great deal of expenditure or a great deal of energy.  Surely in that case, if the Commissioners were in some way to bring it forward for judicial decision, there would be no objection to the judge deciding it. There would always be appeal from him on the matter.  I am talking now about a point of law.</P>
      <P>It was considerations of that nature I had in mind, when I said, in answering Deputy McGilligan, that even if the matter were pressed to the extreme point to which he was pressing it, it could be still justified.  I am not saying that I would be any more in favour of it than Deputy Dillon.  As Deputy Sheldon said, it would inevitably happen that any judge interested in a matter would not hear it.  That is a fundamental safeguard. The safeguard is in the sense of the fitness of things of the judges themselves, and that is where the safeguard has been heretofore.  Therefore, I think it is unnecessary to press the matter as far as the Opposition are pressing it.</P>

      <P>How far are we pressing it?  What we are pressing is that there should not be incorporated in this statute words which suggest&mdash;and I mean no disrespect to the Deputy&mdash; that his view would in any circumstances be accepted.  We are using words in the Bill which the Deputy, I think correctly, interpreted as meaning that if in their deliberations a point of law arises which the Commissioners think would be advantageous to get settled, it would not be inappropriate for the judge who directed their attention to the obscurity to frame proceedings, then leave the offices of the Commissioners and go down, sit in court, have these proceedings brought before him and, in his judicial role, give a judicial decision on the very matter which, on the previous day, he had determined was one of obscurity requiring <Col N="209" /> definition.

      <P>If we must use positive words to provide against that danger, all I would ask is that words be added which would indicate that in respect of litigation to which the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests are themselves a party, where a judge is a member, he shall not be eligible to try the matter, notwithstanding the general power in the earlier subsection.  That is all.  It <Col N="210" /> would be well to clarify that because it is to be borne in mind, and it is often forgotten, that it is not our expressed intentions that are considered by the courts in interpreting the statutes of the Oireachtas.  It is what the Statutes are deemed to say by their contents.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the majority of us consider it would be proper for a judge to preside over the proceedings initiated by the Commissioners or to which the Commissioners would be a party.  I see the difficulty that you do not want any doubt as to his competence to try in relation to charities in general.  If you feel it necessary to allay those doubts by express statutory provision, you ought to circumscribe that express statutory provision so as to prevent a matter coming before the courts at the instance of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests being put in the list of a judge who is himself a member of that body.</P>

      <P>We are on Section 26 but we appear to be discussing Section 13.  I think the kernel is that Deputy McGilligan's and Deputy Dillon's difficulty is whether or not the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; makes any difference to the section.  It probably would be better and more appropriate if on the next stage Deputy McGilligan had an amendment to tidy up the words in whatever way he thinks would be preferable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say that the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; is the governing factor.  If the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; were left out then the matter would be left wide open.  A judge who was a commissioner would apparently be given the right to try a case in which he was an interested party as a commissioner.  The introduction of the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; prevents that happening.  The purpose of the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; is to make it clear that his membership, <i>per se</i>, is no bar.  But, membership plus interest would be a bar, even under Section 13. I am not a lawyer.  I do not know always the precise meaning a court would apply to sections of Bills passed in this House.  I feel Deputy McGilligan should introduce the form of <Col N="211" /> words which he thinks would clarify the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with Deputy Sheldon as to the importance of the word &ldquo;solely.&rdquo;  I intended to say to Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan that it is the keyword in Section 13.  It is obviously inserted with the intention of indicating that there could be other circumstances. The circumstances are obviously the sort envisaged by Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon.  However, there could be other circumstances which would prevent a judge who is a member of the Board from trying a charity case.</P>
      <P>The reality of the situation is that if we did not have this section it could be suggested that a Judge Commissioner could not hear any charity case.  We want to make it clear that in any case with charity implications the judge will not have to step down from his bench and refuse to adjudicate simply because he is a member of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  We all agree, I think, that where the Commissioners have taken some specific action in relation to a case, then the Judge Commissioner would refuse to try the case when it came before him in his judicial capacity.  It is not necessary to make any provision in that regard.  If we were to make that sort of provision we should have to make it for all sorts of cases and not merely for the charity case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of person we want on the Board of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests is rare.  It is important that we get the very best people as Commissioners. These are people who because of their training, experience and, in the case of judges, their actual judicial capacity, are very valuable and very rare.  It is important that we should have such people for this purpose.  Similarly, it is important that just because a judge is a member of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests he should not be debarred from hearing the great number of ordinary charity cases.  The way out of the dilemma <Col N="212" /> is to make the provision as we have made it, emphasising the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; which clearly indicates that there are other considerations which a judge would take into account in relation to the trying of a charity case.</P>
    <P>Possibly the best answer on this point is that if the stage has arrived when we do not trust a judge or when we fear a situation would arise where a judge would be unscrupulous enough to sit in the boardroom of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests and take a certain action and then, with a prejudiced mind, try that case in court, all is lost, anyway; and there is not much point in trying to make any statutory provision in the matter.  I say the situation does not arise; and there is never any danger of its arising in this country.  We have an excellent, independent judiciary who know their job and have their traditions, protocol and etiquette.  I am quite convinced that the tradition and constitution of our judiciary is sufficient guarantee.</P>

      <P>On the argument that you need not set out to prevent something that is not being done, if any Minister came here with an amendment to the Courts of Justice Bill that had in it a phrase to the effect that no judge shall be prevented, solely because he has an interest in the subject matter of a case, from hearing and trying that case&mdash;herein determined as if he had no such interest&mdash; I should object to it fiercely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I would oppose Deputy McGilligan on that.  There is no question of the Charity Commissioners having a vested interest.  The Charity Commissioners are acting purely in the capacity of trustees or in a quasi-judicial capacity.  There is no question of a member of the Board of the <Col N="213" /> Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests having a vested personal interest in any proceedings coming before the court.  He could not benefit.  Therefore, this analogy of Deputy McGilligan is entirely off the point.</P>
      <P>The point surely is that what the Board can do is to initiate litigation. Deputy McGilligan now wants us to take an unprecedented step and to give directions to the judiciary as to what cases they may properly try and what cases they may not.  I am open to correction but I understand there is no statutory rule as to what case a judge may or may not try.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any statutory provision whereby a judge can be prevented from trying a murder case in which his own son is involved.  The idea is unthinkable because it would be a breach of the oath he took when taking office.  I agree very much with the Parliamentary Secretary that if we are to take seriously the whole tradition of the judiciary and the oath which they have taken to try cases which may come before them without fear, favour or affection, or whatever the exact phrase may be, we are adequately protected.  We must never give any impression either to ourselves or to the public that the Board of Charity Commissioners can possibly have a vested interest in any proceedings whatever because they cannot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>That argument goes to the conclusion that if the Charity Commissioners have no vested interest they should try every case because no interest arises.  Deputy Booth agrees with Deputy de Valera.  If there is no question of a vested interest there is nothing, therefore, to prevent a judge who is a member of the Commission hearing the case as a judge.</P>

      <P>A judge while he has no personal vested interest in the proceedings would not come to a case with an unprejudiced mind.  That is the main objection to a judge.  In fact, it is the only objection to a judge who is a member of the Board subsequently trying a case simply because he might be influenced by certain arguments <Col N="214" /> which were put before him as a Charity Commissioner and which were not put before him in court.  It is not a question that he might be prejudiced in his own interest but be prejudiced by arguments which were put before him other than in court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The main amendment is 26 and the other amendments are consequential thereon.</P>
      <P>Amendment 26 proposes to insert a new section to deal with the <i>cy-près</i> doctrine in charity law.  The section will not alone consolidate in statutory form the existing law but will also amend that law.  As I explained on the Second Stage, the expression <i>cy-près</i> is of French origin and it has now by professional usage come to mean &ldquo;as near (as possible)&rdquo;.  The doctrine has been called the &ldquo;doctrine of approximation&rdquo; and it has a number of other applications as well as its peculiar application in charity cases.  It arises, for instance, in connection with the rule against perpetuities; and, where a gift would be void by reason of that rule, it is in certain circumstances construed as nearly as possible to the intentions of the testator.</P>
      <P>In the law of charities, in order that the <i>cy-près</i> doctrine may be applied there must be a general charitable intent and it must be found unlawful, impracticable or impossible to carry out the direction of the donor.  I gave in my Second Stage speech a simple example.  A person leaves by his will money for the building of a church in a particular district.  On his death it is found that a church has already been built in that district.  As there is a general charitable intention, the money may be applied <i>cy-près</i> for the repair and maintenance of the church.</P>
      <P>There are certain defects in the existing law as to <i>cy-près</i> application of charitable funds. The position has been examined both by the Nathan Committee in Britain and by the Newark Committee in the North.  Both these Committees made certain recommendations.  We have examined these recommendations in consultation, of course, with the Charity Commissioners and the section in this amendment is the result.  Similar provisions to those proposed were enacted in Section 13 of the British Charities Act, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> Subsection (1) sets out the circumstances in which the original purposes of a charitable gift may be altered to allow for <i>cy-près</i> application.  Paragraphs (a) and (b) make no change in the existing law.  Paragraph (c) relaxes the old rule requiring impossibility or impracticability and will allow conjunction of funds not only where that is the only possible or practical method of proceeding but also where it is a more effective method of proceeding, though continuation in isolation be possible.  At present the court has no jurisdiction to direct a <i>cy-près</i> scheme though it thinks that the mode of application specified by the testator is inexpedient or even harmful.  In a leading case decided in 1910, the then English Master of the Rolls put the matter as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the charity can be administered according to the directions of the founder, the law requires that it should be so administered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) will allow <i>cy-près</i> application where the charitable purposes of the gift apply in respect of an area which has ceased to be a unit for some other purposes.</P>

      <P>For instance, the gift might be for the poor of a particular local government area which has been abolished and replaced by another area.  The paragraph will also allow for <i>cy-près</i> application where the gift is for an area or class of persons which has ceased to be suitable or practicable.  Thus &ldquo;unsuitability&rdquo; is being substituted for &ldquo;impossibility,&rdquo; regard being had to the spirit of the gift.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Unsuitability&rdquo; is being substituted for &ldquo;impossibility.&rdquo; Paragraph (e) deals with three types of <Col N="217" /> cases.  First of all, <i>cy-près</i> application will be possible where there is adequate alternative provision.  At present, a gift for, say, the maintenance of a road cannot be applied <i>cy-près</i>, even though the local authority is bound to maintain the road.  Secondly, a gift for what has become an illegal or useless charity may be applied <i>cy-près</i>.  This is the present law.  Thirdly, a gift may be applied <i>cy-près</i> where the original purposes have ceased in any other way to be a suitable or effective method of using the property, regard being had to the spirit of the gift.  At present, it would appear that there is no power to provide for a different mode of application of charity funds that would be more expedient and beneficial to the community than the original mode specified by the donor or testator.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) proposes that subsection (1) shall not affect the conditions which must be fulfilled in order that property given for charitable purposes may be applied <i>cy-près</i>, except in so far as those conditions require a failure of the original purposes.  In other words, before <i>cy-près</i> application can be made, the requisite condition (apart from failure of purposes) must be satisfied.  This condition is a general charitable intent or what is known as an &lsquo;out-and-out&rsquo; gift, that is to say, a gift made with the object of parting with the whole interest in the property given and with no expectation of ever getting the property back.  There are certain technical differences between the general charitable intent case and the out-and-out gift case.  In either case, there may be <i>cy-près</i> application. &lsquo;General charitable intent&rsquo; arises where there is an initial impossibility and the &lsquo;out-and-out&rsquo; case arises where there is a supervening impossibility. The law will remain the same as it is at the moment, and general charitable intent or out-and-out gift will continue to be required wherever either is required at the moment.  This is the object of subsection (2).</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) reproduces the existing law by providing that original purposes shall include alterations by scheme.  All <i>cy-près</i> schemes are inherently subject to future schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (4) proposes to impose a <Col N="218" /> duty on charity trustees to keep their trusts effective by having the property applied <i>cy-près</i>, where the case permits or requires that this be done. Trustees are, of course, legally bound to carry out the trust and it is no more than reasonable that this obligation should extend to the duty of making a <i>cy-près</i> application where such is necessary to give effect to the charitable intention of the settlor.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) makes it clear that the proposed section will apply to property given for charitable purposes, notwithstanding that it was so given before the commencement of the Act.  Therefore, if the present law prevents a <i>cy-près</i> scheme being made, in a particular case, the trustees may apply for a scheme under the law as amended by the section.  For Deputy McGilligan's information, the case I referred to was <i>Re Weir Hospital</i> [1910], 2 Chancery Reports, page 124.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) (a) (ii), page 13, line 10, after &ldquo;or&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;where the fund exceeds £500.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might suggest that this amendment and amendment No. 20 could be taken together because I do not think one makes sense without the other.  I mentioned this point on Second Reading and I then put in these amendments.  I was considerably fortified in my opinion by discovering that the House of Lords had just passed very similar legislation.  They did it in a very complex way and it <Col N="222" /> must give great joy to the legal profession. Hardly two lines make sense when read together.  The general intention is the same.  It all arises out of this very sensible step that power should be given to widen investment.</P>
    <P>Now, in giving such power certain safeguards should be employed.  One of them, which is in amendment No. 19, is that there should be a restriction put in of £500.  That is an <i>ad hoc</i> figure which I would not mind moving up or down.  I just thought of one figure and that seemed a reasonable one.  The idea was that where a fund was as small as £500, it should not be open to the risks of investments in equities in whole or in part. Admittedly, the proposals which the Parliamentary Secretary has now brought forward for common investment funds will probably alter the situation completely, but as there is no compulsion to have common investment funds in one case, there is still the desirability of some such provision as I suggest.</P>
    <P>If I may go on to discuss Amendment No. 20 with Amendment No. 19, what I want to do there is that where the sum exceeds £500, then not more than 50 per cent. shall be invested in equities and not more than 20 per cent.  in any one company.  That is just to secure diversification and to prevent the collapse of one company from adversely affecting a trust or a charity.  I think it is a sensible provision and there I am very much fortified by discovering that very much the same provision has been made by recent legislation in England. Admittedly, there they were more complex about it.  They just seek for diversification without specifying any particular percentage and they make provision for all sorts of advice to be taken and very often it is not clear whether anyone needs to have any qualifications to give the advice.</P>
    <P>Rather than leave it in that open way, that some person could be called upon in respect of any particular charity to say that this amount or that amount of its funds may be invested in equities, it would be better to make a provision in law whereby some percentage <Col N="223" /> will be inserted and some percentage both in relation to type of investment and in regard to any particular company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself unable to accept these amendments.  At the outset I should like to make a point to Deputy Sheldon.  The proposal at present in Britain is to enable trustees to invest in the manner set out, without going to the court.  It is an extension of the powers of trustees generally.  It will not be necessary for a trustee in England to go to the court.  There is that essential difference between our proposal and the proposal at present before the British Parliament.  Subsection (3) of Section 32 provides for the authority of either the court or the Board, so that in that regard there is no similarity between what we are doing and what is proposed in Britain.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, I think it is not necessary for us to fetter the court or the Board in the manner proposed by Deputy Sheldon.  In the first case, with regard to the £500 limitation which he proposes to insert, I think, as he himself has indicated, the provisions which we propose about amalgamating small charitable funds will go a long way to meet his point. Even apart from that, the whole value of this proposal is that charities will be able to avail of the high returns and the capital appreciation which they can get from equity stocks.  That being so and assuming, as we must assume, that the court and the Commissioners will act, not alone judicially but judiciously, I think we need not put in any limitation such as suggested by Deputy Sheldon.  I think we can leave it to the court or the Commissioners, acting on proper advice, to ensure that there is no danger of the funds being recklessly invested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble is that, if you make a limitation of this sort and write it into the Statute, you do not know what difficulties it will subsequently cause for trustees.  There might be some particularly desirable investments which trustees of a particular charity <Col N="224" /> might like to make and this limitation which Deputy Sheldon would have us put into the Bill would prevent that desirable form of investment.</P>
    <P>As I say, I think the fact that we are making it all subject to the authority and permission of the court or the Board is sufficient protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Parliamentary Secretary say the permission &ldquo;of the court or the Board&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Or the Board,&rdquo; yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That type of argument goes too far.  It is going too far for anybody introducing a Bill to say: &ldquo;We are putting this into the hands of people.  We must accept that they are responsible and reasonable people. Therefore, we need not fetter them.&rdquo; Why fetter them as you have done in two subparagraphs of subsection (3) of this section?  You do not say &ldquo;any stock, any shares of any company.&rdquo; You impose certain limitations.  You say it must be a company incorporated in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is national policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we not trust a body of Commissioners who are reasonable people to carry out national policy?  Secondly, we allow them to invest in the ordinary shares of a company &ldquo;maintaining in the State...a register of its shareholders.&rdquo;  Is that national policy, which is carried forward in certain things that we are trying to get away from?  Finally, it says: &ldquo;Provided the ordinary stock or shares of any such company are quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange or the Cork Stock Exchange.&rdquo;  If they are reasonable people, you need not put that in.  This sort of argument: &ldquo;We either trust the Commissioners or we do not,&rdquo; goes much too far.  If you are going to trust the Commissioners, then do not accept Deputy Sheldon's point, which is a very reasonable one. I do not agree with his proposal in regard to the £500 but the other one, that not more than 50 per cent. of any fund may be invested in ordinary stock <Col N="225" /> or shares and not more than 20 per cent. in any one company, is not unreasonable. I do not know whether it is a sound direction to give but it is not an unreasonable direction to ask the Commissioners to see to it that they shall not put all their eggs in one basket.  That is all the amendment asks.</P>
      <P>I have some anxiety about this question of investing in ordinary stock of a company, even though it be a company incorporated here or maintaining a register of its shareholders resident in the State and quoted on either stock exchange.  It is a very wide clause, and a very complete innovation in regard to trust funds. We may be in the mood to do all these things, but this may go too wide altogether.  It is one of the points which may have to be thought over on the next Stage.  If there is ordinary stock open for investment, if you are to put any limitation on them, just to say: &ldquo;Do not put more than 50 per cent. in ordinary stock and do not have more than 20 per cent. in any one company&rdquo; is not an unreasonable limitation.</P>

If they are reasonable people, they will have a look to see if the shares are being quoted.  If you put in that limitation, I say it is not unreasonable to say the other thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two different points here.  Deputy Sheldon is concerned primarily with the security of the funds, but the limitations generally are to make sure that <Col N="226" /> charity funds will be invested in accordance with national policy in relation to trustee investment.  An Act was passed in 1958 covering the investment of trustee funds generally and directing that broadly they be invested at home.  These provisions here are in the main to secure that the similar provisions apply to charity funds.  That is why these limitations are put in.  They are not concerned with the security of the funds.</P>
      <P>I can only repeat in reply to Deputy McGilligan what I said to Deputy Sheldon, that is, that we think it better to give the power generally and then to make sure that trustees will have to apply either to the court or the Board. That is enough protection.  As I said in answer to Deputy McGilligan, surely if a stock or share investment is good enough to merit your investing 50 per cent. of your funds in it, it is generally good enough for all of your funds.  If it is not good you do not invest them at all and, if you regard it as good for any of your funds, you might as well put them all in.  Special considerations may apply in different cases, however.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard everything now.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary really expect me to take that as an argument?  Is that the way he invests his money, picks one company and shoves the lot in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is attributing to me an affluence which I do not possess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing he became affluent, I wonder would he get the opinion of the Charitable Commissioners or the courts as to how he would invest his own if that is what he is prepared to do with charity money. We are handing over to the courts and to the Board the direction of the investment of charitable moneys.  Having done that, there is a moral obligation on us to do one of two things.  One is to say: &ldquo;In seeking higher returns from the funds we think there should be a prudent limit put as a safeguard.&rdquo;  If we are not going to say that then we should say: &ldquo;If it turns out you were wrong in investing all the funds in one <Col N="227" /> company, that, having so invested them, that company disappears, we will undertake on behalf of the State to give you power to reimburse the charity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the courts are to be given this power to do what they like with all the funds, if we are giving them <i>carte blanche,</i> I think we are going much too far and we are leaving charities open to a very grave risk. It is not just a question of taking your funds out of gilt-edged securities and putting them into some company which will give a bigger return. Security comes into it just as much; in fact, I would say security is of more importance in regard to charitable funds than it would be to a man in regard to his own money.  Very few people, certainly not people who were seeking to provide for their old age, would rashly put all their money into one company even if they thought there were prospects of a good return. We are the guardians of these charities and it is incumbent on us to see that some safeguard is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not handing over to the courts anything new.  The High Court has always had jurisdiction in charity matters and, indeed, can authorise a charitable trust to invest in anything it wishes.  Let us be clear on this: we are limiting the power of the court in this section. The position in Great Britain is that if a trustee goes to the court and gets its authority, he can invest all his funds in anything he likes.  There is no limitation in Great Britain on what the courts may authorise a trustee to do.  In that regard, rather than, as Deputy Sheldon says giving it <i>carte blanche,</i> we are in fact limiting the court's power, though admittedly the limitation is directed more to a policy of national investment than to security of the funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me point out <i>en passant</i> that there is also the stipulation that the securities must be securities quoted on the Stock Exchange.  The Stock Exchange have very rigid rules about the companies that will be granted quotations.  I do not disagree at all <Col N="228" /> with Deputy Sheldon as to what the canons of good investment require, either in our personal capacity or as trustees.  A prudent man would certainly take advice and take precautions with regard to the spread of his investments, and so on.  I think a prudent trustee must do likewise, and I am quite certain that the court and the Commissioners will be mindful of those requirements and will be properly advised in regard to them.</P>
    <P>The only difference between Deputy Sheldon's view and mine is that I do not want to write down in black and white in this Bill the limitation he suggests. While I agree with the motive behind his suggestion, I do not want to put it into the Bill and find subsequently that some unfortunate trustee of a charity is debarred from making some particularly desirable or lucrative investment simply because of the straitjacket we have put him into under this Bill.  While agreeing with everything Deputy Sheldon says about the necessity for prudence and the spreading of risk, I prefer to proceed by giving the powers, with the general limitation we have, and then leaving it to the court or the Board to look after the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 17, before Section 44, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>(1) Where for any reason the appointment of a new trustee or new trustees of any charity appears to the Board to be necessary, the Board&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) on the application of the trustee or trustees of the charity, or</P>
      <P>(b)  if there are no trustees of the charity, or they cannot be found, on the application of any person appearing to the Board to have an interest, or</P>
      <P>(c) in any case, of their own motion,</P>
      <P>may make&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) an order under the seal of <Col N="233" /> the Board appointing a new trustee or new trustees of the charity either in substitution for or in addition to any existing trustee or trustees, or although there is no existing trustee, and</P>
    <P>(ii) an order under the seal of the Board vesting the property of the charity for such estate as the Board may direct in the persons who on the appointment are the trustees, and the order shall have the same effect as if the persons who before the appointment were the trustees (if any) had duly executed all proper conveyances of the land for such estate as the Board direct, or if there is no such person, or no such person of full capacity, then as if such person had existed and been of full capacity and had duly executed all proper conveyances of the land for such estate as the Board direct.</P>
    <P>(2) Every trustee of a charity appointed under this section shall, as well before as after the property of the charity becomes by law vested in him, have the same powers, authorities and discretions, and may in all respects act as if he had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument (if any) creating the trust.</P>
    <P>(3) The Board may order the costs and expenses of and incidental to any application or order under this section to be paid or raised out of the property of the charity or the income thereof or to be borne and paid in such manner and by such persons as the Board may consider just.</P>
    <P>(4) The Board shall, not less than one month before the date on which they propose to make an order under this section, give public notice of the proposed order in such manner as the Board consider most effectual for ensuring publicity thereof and for bringing the proposal to the attention of persons interested.</P>
    <P>(5) (a)  Any person appearing <Col N="234" /> to the High Court to have an interest may, within twenty-one days after the date of the making of an order under this section, appeal to the High Court against the making of the order and on such appeal the High Court may make such order confirming, annulling or varying the order under this section and such order as to costs as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(b) The Board and the trustees (if any) of the charity shall be entitled to be represented and heard on any appeal under this subsection.</P>
    <P>(c) An order under this section shall, if no appeal is brought against it, become operative on the expiration of the period of twenty-one days mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection, and an order against which an appeal is brought shall become operative&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) if and so far as it is confirmed by the Court, from the date of the final determination of the appeal, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  if the appeal is withdrawn, from the date of the withdrawal.</P>
    <P>(6) An order under this section shall not operate further or otherwise as a discharge to any former or continuing trustee than an appointment of new trustees under any power for that purpose contained in any instrument would have operated.</P>
    <P>(7)  Nothing in this section shall give power to appoint an executor or administrator.</P>
    <P>(8) Where a body corporate is appointed by order under this section to be, or a body corporate appointed under this section becomes, sole trustee of a charitable trust the terms of which provide for or require the appointment of more than one trustee, then during such time as the body corporate holds the office of trustee of the trust&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the terms of the trust shall be deemed to provide for or <Col N="235" /> require the appointment of one trustee only, and</P>
    <P>(b) one trustee only shall be deemed to have been originally appointed under the terms of the trust.</P>
    <P>The section proposed in the amendment will authorise the Board to appoint new trustees of a charitable trust wherever this is necessary.  The Board will be able to appoint such trustees either to fill up the original number or to replace an existing trustee or trustees or to deal with the situation where there are no trustees or they cannot be found.  Specific provision is being made for the giving of public notice of a proposed order under the new section and also for an appeal to the High Court.  The section will allow for the replacement of two or more trustees by a body corporate so as to discharge all the original trustees. This is not possible under existing law because of Section 10 (2) <i>(c)</i> of the Trustee Act, 1893.</P>
    <P>The position is different in England and in the North, as the Trustee Acts have been amended in both jurisdictions to cover the matter.  Where charitable funds are vested in two or more trustees, it is often desirable to allow the trustees to be discharged in order that a body corporate may act, if such will make for the better administration of the charity.  There are a number of cases at the moment where charity trustees want to be relieved so that they can hand over to bodies corporate.  The Charity Commissioners and others have drawn this matter to our attention.  It is proposed in a later amendment to validate certain appointments of bodies corporate as sole trustees of charitable funds although these appointments have not legally discharged the original trustees. In other words we will validate what has been done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one small point in this.  There is a right of appeal to the High Court given. That is under subsection (5) of the amendment.  It states that they &ldquo;may, within 21 days after the making of <Col N="236" /> an order under this section ...&rdquo; but the only way in which the person can get to know it is not with respect to the date on which the order is made&mdash; and it is from that date that the 21 days run&mdash;but from the day on which the Board propose to make an order and of that time notice has to be given.  I am looking now at subsection (4): &ldquo;The Board shall not less than one month before the date on which they propose to make an order under this Section, give public notice of the proposed order in such manner as the Board consider most effectual.&rdquo; One swings over from that to the application to the High Court within 21 days after the date of the making of the order which may not be the date included in subsection (4).  If it is possible to give notice of the proposed order why would it not be possible to give notice of the order, the date on which it was made, and let the 21 days run from that?  Twenty-one days after the making of an order&mdash;that date may not be known to a person who may be an interested party in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this proposal.  This provision will be a very great help in many cases.  It was brought to my notice the other day where, because of the lack of some such provision, 14 death certificates had to be sought over a period of 50 years in order to clear up a trust.  This provision will in future obviate that type of search and delay.</P>
      <P>There are just one or two minor points which arise mainly because of my own ignorance of legal phraseology. In subsection (2) the phrase &ldquo;as well before as after the property of the charity becomes by law vested in him&rdquo; appears.  What is the meaning of &ldquo;as well before as after&rdquo;?  Is this related to what the Parliamentary Secretary said with regard to invalidating something which may have taken place in an interim period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of publicity, this is left entirely to the Board.  It is usual where publicity is provided for to <Col N="237" /> stipulate at least one type of publicity which must be used; for instance, notice must appear in one national newspaper.  How will the Board be aware that interested parties may or may not turn up?  Could they be held at fault later if someone did turn up who claimed that the publicity given had not been sufficient because he was not aware of it at the time?  That in itself would surely be proof that the publicity was not sufficient.  I am thinking of it not so much as a safeguard for persons who might turn up later but rather as a safeguard for the Board so that they could say a minimum provision had been laid down and they had complied with it.  From the point of view of the Board some such provision might be safer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, subject to correction, I think the phrase &ldquo;as well before as after&rdquo; means that the trustee might have to deal with something that happened the property before he became a trustee.  I understand the phrase is designed to cover that eventuality. With regard to the suggestion about advertisement, I shall examine that to see whether it might not be desirable to make some such provision. The suggestion is a useful one.</P>

      <P>Section 44 is designed to apply to both contentious and non-contentious business.

These latter are confined to contentious business.

      <P>In page 17, before section 45, but in Part III, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>(1) For the avoidance of the difficulties which arise both in giving effect to the intentions of donors of gifts for the celebration of Masses in perpetuity or over long periods and in administering such gifts and in order not to frustrate the intentions of such donors, it is hereby enacted, notwithstanding that a gift for the celebration of Masses, whether in public or in private, is a valid charitable gift, that a gift taking effect after the commencement of this Act for the celebration of Masses for a period of more than fifty years shall be construed and have effect as if the gift provided&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) for the celebration of Masses in accordance with any terms and conditions of the gift for a period of fifty years, and</P>
      <P>(b) for the application, after the expiration of the period of fifty years, of so much of the subject of the gift as should then remain for the celebration of Masses during such period and on such terms and conditions as should be determined after such expiration by the person to whom the gift is given or his successor in title and, if the gift is administered by the Board, for the vesting in the appropriate person, on such expiration, of so much of the subject of the gift as should then remain.</P>
      <P>(2) In the application of this section to a gift for the celebration of Masses for a purpose or purposes specified in the terms of the gift, references in subsection (1) to the celebration of Masses shall be construed as references to the celebration of Masses for that purpose or those purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> (3) In the application of this section to a gift which is administered by the Board, the reference in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) to the person to whom the gift is given or his successor in title shall be construed as a reference to the appropriate person.</P>
    <P>(4) In this section &ldquo;the appropriate person&rdquo; means in relation to a gift for the celebration of Masses&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) if and to the extent that the Masses are celebrated by a priest who is a member of a religious order, institute or society, the major superior for the time being of the order, institute or society in the State, and</P>
    <P>(b) if and to the extent that the Masses are celebrated by any other priest, the archbishop or bishop for the time being of the diocese in which the Masses are celebrated.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to deal with what are known as Foundation Masses&mdash;that is to say Masses in perpetuity or over long periods.  The Canon Law on this subject has recently been altered.  To avoid risk and uncertainty in the fulfilling of perpetual obligations, it has been decreed that future Foundations of Masses are to be so understood that the Masses will be celebrated for fifty years from the date of the Foundation unless a shorter period has been determined by the founder.  At the end of fifty years the capital and income still remaining is to be applied for the celebration of Manual Masses for the founder's intentions.</P>
    <P>Since the decision of the old Irish Court of Appeal in <i>O'Hanlon v. Logue</i> (1906), gifts for Masses, whether celebrated in public or private, are charitable and accordingly the rule against perpetuities does not apply.  The proposed new section will put a time limitation on Foundation Masses.  Gifts for Masses in perpetuity or for a period of more than fifty years will be construed and have effect as if the gift provided for the celebration of the Masses for a period of fifty years and thereafter for the celebration of <Col N="240" /> Masses during such period and on such conditions as shall be determined by the person to whom the gift is given or his successor in title.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Where the gift is administered by the Board, the remaining capital and income at the end of the 50 years will become vested in the Archbishop or Bishop of the diocese or in the major superior of the religious order, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed section will avoid difficulties which can and do arise in regard to gifts for Foundation Masses. Furthermore, the section will prevent the frustration of donors' and testators' intentions, as gifts for such Masses are not acceptable except in accordance with Canon Law.  What we propose is in effect the application of the <i>cy-près</i> principle to gifts for Foundation <Col N="241" /> Masses.  If there is a gift or bequest for Masses in perpetuity or for more than fifty years, the direction of the donor or testator will be given effect to in the way that is practicable and possible.</P>
    <P>I should add that for the section to apply the gift must take effect after the commencement of the Act.  There is no retrospection.</P>

    <P>(a) for remunerating persons appointed trustees to hold or manage the fund or any part of it, with or without provision authorising a person to receive the remuneration notwithstanding that he is also a charity trustee of or trustee for a participating charity;</P>
    <P>(b) for restricting the size of the fund, and for regulating as to time, amount or otherwise the right to transfer property to or withdraw it from the fund, and for enabling sums to be advanced out of the fund by way of loan to a participating charity pending the withdrawal of property from the fund by the charity;</P>
    <P>(c) for enabling income to be withheld from distribution with a view to avoiding fluctuations in the amounts distributed, and generally for regulating distributions of income;</P>
    <P>(d) for enabling moneys to be borrowed temporarily for the purpose of meeting payments to be made out of the fund;</P>
    <P>(e) for enabling questions arising under the scheme as to the right of a charity to participate, or as to the rights of participating charities, or as to any other matter, to be conclusively determined by the decision of the trustees managing the fund or in any other manner;</P>
    <P>(f) for regulating the accounts and information to be supplied to participating charities.</P>
    <P>(5) A scheme, in addition to the provision for property to be transferred to the fund on the basis that the charity shall be entitled to a <Col N="243" /> share in the capital and income of the fund, may include provision for enabling sums to be deposited by or on behalf of a charity on the basis that (subject to the provisions of the scheme) the charity shall be entitled to repayment of the sums deposited and to interest thereon at a rate determined by or under the scheme; and where a scheme makes any such provision it shall also provide for excluding from the amount of capital and income to be shared between charities participating otherwise than by way of deposit such amounts (not exceeding the amounts properly attributable to the making of deposits) as are from time to time reasonably required in respect of the liabilities of the fund for the repayment of deposits and for the interest on deposits, including amounts required by way of reserve.</P>
    <P>(6) Except in so far as a scheme provides to the contrary, the rights under it of a participating charity shall not be capable of being assigned or charged, nor shall any trustee or other person concerned in the management of the common investment fund established by the scheme be required or entitled to take account of any trust or other equity affecting a participating charity or its property or rights.</P>
    <P>(7) Property held upon any charitable trust may be transferred to common investment funds established under this section unless the power to do so is excluded by a provision specifically referring to schemes in the terms of the trust.</P>
    <P>(8) A common investment fund shall be deemed for all purposes to be a charity.</P>
    <P>(9) The High Court may by order amend or vary the terms of, or wind up, a scheme and the Board may by order amend or vary the terms of, or wind up, a scheme made by order of the Board.</P>
    <P>The proposed new section will allow for the making by the High Court or the Board of schemes to establish common investment funds. <Col N="244" /> These schemes may be made on the application of any two or more charities. The section makes detailed provision as to what the scheme may contain in regard to the constitution and management of the common investment fund.</P>
    <P>A strong case has been made to us for the necessity of allowing for the pooling of investments on behalf of different charities, and the present proposal is as recommended by the Board.  Where a trust fund is small, it is not a practical matter to obtain a wide spread of investments.  Both the amount of work and the expense involved are too substantial to make up for any increase in income.  By permitting trustees to pool a number of trust funds, a better range of investment is available.  Each fund will receive its appropriate share of the total income of the pool.  This is obviously better business management for a body which is a trustee for a number of small charitable trusts.  By joining the trusts together for the purpose of investment each individual trust does better than it would if the investment of its funds were dealt with as a completely separate matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very welcome provision and it influenced very much my willingness to withdraw my previous amendments because it will provide more safety for the small fund.  The only comment I want to make is that the drafting, for once, appears to me to leave something to be desired.  In general, the drafting in the Department of Justice is extremely good and the various aids that are given by way of marginal notes are very useful.  In this case, in relation to subsection (1), I would not go so far as to say it is ambiguous, but it is not terribly clear.  I take it from subsection (2) it is not envisaged that there shall be a common investment fund for Ireland.  It assumes that there will be a number of common investment funds.  In paragraph (a) of subsection (1) there is a reference to &ldquo;the fund.&rdquo;  It is only when you read all through it that you realise it is one particular fund out of many.  I think the expression &ldquo;a fund&rdquo; might be better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> I suggest a new start be made by beginning the section with a definition subsection in which both &ldquo;schemes&rdquo; and &ldquo;fund&rdquo; would be defined.  That would then enable the whole section to be tidied up and made a good deal more clear.  The present way of defining &ldquo;schemes&rdquo; by putting in a phrase in parenthesis absolutely prevents one defining &ldquo;fund&rdquo; without getting into a terrible tangle.  It might be better to redraft the beginning and define both &ldquo;fund&rdquo; and &ldquo;schemes&rdquo; in relation to this section.  To say &ldquo;for property transferred to the fund&rdquo; is bound to be slightly confusing.  You do not mean a common investment fund for the whole country but a particular one about which you are talking at the time.  In the same way, right on down, you get slightly confused.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would take a note of that and see if more clarity could be got.</P>

      <P>(1) Subject to subsection (2), the circumstances in which the original purposes of a charitable gift may be altered to allow the property given or part of it to be applied <i>cy-près</i> shall be as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  where the original purposes, in whole or in part&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) have been as far as may be fulfilled; or</P>
      <P>(ii) cannot be carried out, or cannot be carried out according to the directions given and to the spirit of the gift; or</P>
      <P>(b) where the original purposes provide a use for part only of the property available by virtue of the gift; or</P>
      <P>(c) where the property available by virtue of the gift and other property applicable for similar purposes can be more effectively used in conjunction, and to that end can suitably, regard being had to the spirit of the gift, be made applicable to common purposes; or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d) where the original purposes were laid down by reference to an area which then was but has since ceased to be a unit for some other purpose, or by reference to a class of persons or to an area which has for any reason since <Col N="247" /> ceased, either to be suitable, regard being had to the spirit of the gift, or to be practical in administering the gift; or</P>
    <P>(e) where the original purposes, in whole or in part, have, since they were laid down&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) been adequately provided for by other means; or</P>
    <P>(ii) ceased, as being useless or harmful to the community or for other reasons, to be in law charitable; or</P>
    <P>(iii) ceased in any other way to provide a suitable and effective method of using the property available by virtue of the gift, regard being had to the spirit of the gift.</P>
    <P>(2) Subsection (1) shall not affect the conditions which must be satisfied in order that property given for charitable purposes may be applied <i>cy-près</i>, except in so far as those conditions require a failure of the original purposes.</P>
    <P>(3)  References in the foregoing subsections to the original purposes of a gift shall be construed, where the application of the property given has been altered or regulated by a scheme or otherwise, as referring to the purposes for which the property is for the time being applicable.</P>
    <P>(4) It is hereby declared that a trust for charitable purposes places a trustee under a duty, where the case permits and requires the property or some part of it to be applied <i>cy-près</i>, to secure its effective use for charity by taking steps to enable it to be so applied.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 17, before section 45, but in Part III, to insert the following section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> (1)  Property given for specific charitable or non-charitable purposes which fail shall be applicable <i>cy-près</i> by a Court of competent jurisdiction as if given for charitable purposes generally, where it belongs&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to a donor who, after such advertisements and inquiries as are reasonable, cannot be identified or cannot be found; or</P>
    <P>(b) to a donor who has executed a written disclaimer of his right to have the property returned,</P>
    <P>but in applying <i>cy-près</i> property given for specific non-charitable purposes regard shall be had to the wishes of the trustees or other persons in charge of the property.</P>
    <P>(2) For the purposes of this section property shall be conclusively presumed (without any advertisement or inquiry) to belong to donors who cannot be identified, in so far as it consists&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) of the proceeds of cash collections made by means of collecting boxes or by other means not adapted for distinguishing one gift from another; or</P>
    <P>(b) of the proceeds of any lottery, competition, entertainment, sale or similar money-raising activity, after allowing for property given to provide prizes or articles for sale or otherwise to enable the activity to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>(3)  A Court of competent jurisdiction may by order direct that property not falling within subsection (2) shall for the purposes of this section be treated (without any advertisement or inquiry) as belonging to donors who cannot be identified, where it appears to the Court either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) that it would be unreasonable, having regard to the amounts likely to be returned to the donors, to incur expense with a view to returning the property; or</P>
    <P>(b) that it would be unreasonable, having regard to the nature, circumstances and amount of the gifts, and to the lapse of time since <Col N="249" /> the gifts were made, for the donors to expect the property to be returned.</P>
    <P>(4) Where property is applied <i>cyprès</i> by virtue of this section, the donor shall be deemed to have parted with all his interest at the time when the gift was made; but where property is so applied as belonging to donors who cannot be identified or cannot be found, and is not so applied by virtue of subsection (2) or (3)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the scheme shall specify the total amount of that property; and</P>
    <P>(b) the donor of any part of that amount shall be entitled, if he makes a claim not later than twelve months after the date on which the scheme is made, to recover from the charity for which the property is applied a sum equal to that part, less any expenses properly incurred by the charity trustees after that date in connection with claims relating to his gift; and</P>
    <P>(c) the scheme may include directions as to the provision to be made for meeting any such claim.</P>
    <P>(5) For the purposes of this section, purposes shall be deemed to fail where any difficulty in applying property to those purposes makes that property, or, in the case of property to be applied for charitable purposes, the part not applicable <i>cy-près</i> under section*, available to be returned to the donors.</P>
    <P>* This is the section proposed to be inserted by amendment 26.</P>
    <P>(6) In this section, except in so far as the context otherwise requires, references to a donor include references to persons claiming through or under the original donor, and references to property given include references to the property for the time being representing the property originally given or property derived from it.</P>
    <P>(7) This section shall apply to property given for charitable or non-charitable purposes, notwithstanding that it was so given before the commencement of this Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> This section proposes to make property which would not be applicable <i>cy-près</i> in the ordinary way so applicable where the property would be the subject of a resulting trust in favour of the donors.  The section will apply both to property given for specific charitable purposes and also to property given for specific non-charitable purposes.  In either case, the Court will apply the property <i>cy-près</i> as if it were given for charitable purposes generally; but in the case of property given for non-charitable purposes regard must be had to the wishes of the trustees or other persons in charge of the property.</P>
    <P>The proposed section will apply in the following cases:</P>
    <P>(1)  where the donor cannot be identified;</P>
    <P>(2) where the donor has disclaimed in writing;</P>
    <P>(3) where the donation was by an essentially anonymous method, e.g. by placing money in a collecting box;</P>
    <P>(4) where the amounts due under a resulting trust would be too small to justify expense in repaying them; and</P>
    <P>(5) where it would be unreasonable, having regard to the nature, circumstances and amounts of the gifts, and to the lapse of time since the gifts were made, for those entitled under a resulting trust to expect the property to be returned.</P>
    <P>Where the donor cannot be identified or found after advertisement and enquiry, he will still be entitled to recover his donation from the charity if he comes forward within a year of the making of the <i>cy-près</i> scheme.</P>
    <P>The section will apply to property whether given before or after the commencement of the Act and will, it is hoped, do away with difficulties which have arisen and can arise under existing law where anonymous and untraceable donations are given for a charitable or non-charitable purpose which fails.  I should like to make it clear that the section is designed to provide <Col N="251" /> for <i>cy-près</i> schemes where the section in the previous amendment will not apply.  The latter section applies only where there is a general charitable intent and it is, of course, confined to charitable gifts, whereas in this case we are dealing with non-charitable purposes as well.</P>

There have been a number of cases where these funds are in existence and cannot be applied for any purpose and the original donors cannot be ascertained.

      <P>I should like to elaborate a little on what I said on Second Stage.  I do this in order to clear up any misapprehension as to what the section is designed to do. The section has two objects.  First of all, it will apply to an imperfect trust provision that causes the gift to fail completely.  This is the Diplock type of case, where the gift is for charitable or benevolent purposes.  In such a case, the trust will in future be construed to be a trust for charitable purposes.  Secondly, the section will apply to an imperfect trust provision that causes the gift to fail as a charitable trust but not as an ordinary trust.</P>
      <P>Two examples from decided cases will, I hope, illustrate this second type of trust.  A bequest to the College of Surgeons was held by the former Irish Court of Appeal in 1918 not to be one for charitable uses as the College of Surgeons had two main objects, one of which was charitable and the other non-charitable.  In a case reported in 1945 the late Judge Overend held that a gift for the purposes of the Carmelite Order was invalid as a charitable gift but was a valid non-charitable gift.  According to the decision, which followed a Supreme Court case in 1935 in regard to the Jesuit Order, the Carmelite Order has purposes some of which are not charitable.</P>

    <P>Section 45 will validate, as charitable gifts, gifts similar to those with which the 1918 case and the 1945 case were concerned.  The non-charitable purposes will be excluded in construing and giving effect to the gift and the gift will be a gift for the <Col N="255" /> charitable purposes of the body concerned. I think this is quite clear from subsection (1) of the section and this, I should stress, was the intention. Subsection (1) covers both (a) a gift for mixed purposes, charitable and non-charitable, that fails completely because of uncertainty or the rule against perpetuities, and (b) a gift for charitable and definite non-charitable purposes that fails as a charitable gift but not as an ordinary gift.  The subsection is, therefore, not confined to the cure of what are in reality drafting errors.</P>
    <P>Where a donor or testator wishes to have his gift applied to both the charitable and non-charitable objects of a particular body there will be nothing to prevent his framing his gift accordingly.  Subsection (2) specifically excludes from the ambit of subsection (1) those gifts in which an apportionment is made or provided for between the charitable and the non-charitable objects.  I dealt with apportionment cases when I was speaking on Second Stage.  The law as to apportionment has not given rise to any real difficulty of interpretation and the leading decisions are fairly clear and easy to follow.</P>
    <P>A charitable gift is not liable to legacy or succession duty and where it involves a perpetual endowment it is not void.  The rule against perpetuities and remote vesting does not apply to charities.  Furthermore, uncertainty cannot arise.  If there is a charitable intention, it is immaterial whether or not the objects of the donor's or testator's bounty are particularly defined.  The intention will be carried out by means of a scheme. In the case of a non-charitable gift, where the objects are vague or indefinite, the gift will fail for uncertainty.</P>
    <P>Charitable gifts are at present subject to Section 16 of the 1844 Act.  This section renders invalid any such gift in so far as it consists of land or in so far as it is payable out of land.  The section is now being repealed in the Schedule to the Bill.  Paradoxically, the gift to the College of Surgeons in the 1918 case and portion of the gift to the Jesuit Order in the 1935 case would <Col N="256" /> have been ineffective if they had been charitable gifts.  The reason for this is that they were payable out of realty and thus came within the 1844 Act section.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to mention that, from specific inquiries I made, I was quite satisfied that mixed charities would prefer to receive their gifts free of legacy and succession duty so that they would have to apply them to their charitable objects exclusively, rather than to receive them less legacy and succession duty, and be free to apply them to both the charitable and the non-charitable objects.  Moreover, gifts which, without Section 45, would fail completely because of uncertainty or perpetual endowment will in future be valid charitable gifts.</P>

    <P>In every case of a breach or supposed breach of any trust for charitable purposes or whenever the direction or order of the High Court is considered necessary for the administration of any trust for charitable purposes, the Board or, with the consent of the Attorney General, any person may apply to the Court for such relief as the <Col N="258" /> nature of the case may require and the Court may make such order thereon as the Court thinks fit.</P>
    <P>This is the re-enactment, apparently, of sections from Acts dating as far back as 1812.  On the face of it, when we positively legislate to declare that a judge who is a member of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests may consider any case in his court relating to charitable matters, surely we ought not to express as an addendum &ldquo;exclusive of such matters as may arise under Section 47 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the same old argument&mdash;rules for the judiciary as would properly be appropriate to a Courts of Justice Bill.  Certainly, it is not something one would insert casually at the end of a section in a Bill dealing with charities.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that it would be a fundamental question of principle and would have to be brought into the House and discussed as such&mdash;not something that would be casually inserted here as an addendum to a section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary missed the whole point. If Section 13 did not appear in the Bill I should agree with him.  Then the matter need not be raised at all.  However, we are legislating in this Bill for the judiciary.  It is because we are positively legislating thus that I think it necessary to introduce this reservation. Section 13 provides:</P>
      <P>A Judge of any Court shall not be prevented or disabled by reason solely of his being a member of the Board from hearing and determining any case relating to a charity or any case arising under this Act, but may hear and determine it as if he were not a member of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is legislation controlling the conduct of the judiciary.  It is considered necessary to insert that section.  To listen to the Parliamentary Secretary one would imagine it was not either necessary or desirable.  He says it is not desirable to legislate with regard to the conduct of the judiciary in a Bill of this kind.  Yet he does it in Section 13. <Col N="259" /> Surely what I have just read out proves it?</P>

      <P>It is a declaration by the Oireachtas that they are quite at liberty, although members of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, to consider, to hear and to determine any case arising under this Bill when enacted&mdash;&ldquo;but may hear and determine it as if he were not a member of the Board&rdquo;. If we consider it expedient to enact that section we should add to it &ldquo;exclusive of matters arising under Section 47&rdquo; or, if you want to put it this way: &ldquo;exclusive of litigation to which the Commissioners are themselves a part&rdquo;.  That is all.</P>

      <P>My objection to that is that it would be a bad precedent to establish.  It would be fair if there were a necessity for it.  My case is that there is no necessity so long&mdash;as I indicated previously when Deputy Dillon was, I think, absent&mdash;as present conditions continue.  If we have not got an independent judiciary in this country on whom we can rely to administer justice without fear or favour, in accordance with the oath they took when assuming office, then all is lost and the type of addendum Deputy Dillon wants will not solve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all nonsense. Nobody is suggesting that the judiciary is anything but what we know it to be.  All we are pointing out is that it is considered expedient to insert Section 13 from the Act of 1867.  I do not know the history of Section 23 of the Act of 1867 which affirmatively declares that a judge of any court shall not be prevented or disabled by reason solely of his being a member of the Board from hearing and determining any case &ldquo;relating to a charity or any case arising under this Act...&rdquo; Those are the relevant words&mdash;&ldquo;or any case arising under this Act, but may hear and determine it as if he were not a member of the Board.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> It is extraordinary that from that general advice we should exclude the matters which we provide in this Bill may be brought to the High Court at the instance of the Commissioners themselves and that we should also exclude from the general provision under Section 13 matters which come before the High Court to which the Commissioners are themselves a party. I think that far from making any reflection on the judiciary, such provision simplifies things very materially and makes it manifest to everybody, not only to those in the profession but to ordinary people, that the Oireachtas had due regard to what it was doing.  While wishing to preserve the power of a judge to hear charity matters in general, even though he was a member of the Board of Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, they recognised and provided against the possibility of his being asked to hear a case which the Board of which he is a member had initiated.  That seems to me to be a thoroughly sound principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I direct the attention of the House to the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo;.  The people who framed Section 13 had this whole situation carefully and clearly in their minds. The use of the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; is convincing proof of that.  I feel that everything that could be said on either side of the House has been said.  The original argument the Opposition put forward was that a judge should not be a member of the Charity Commissioners at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>That being so, my argument is all the more convincing. My argument is simply that a judge would not hear such a case.  Therefore, all the fuss and excitement which the Opposition have started concerns something which does not arise.  It is <i>non est</i>.  It will not happen.  If we are down to the one moot point of a judge coming into a court with a mind already prejudiced by the fact that he sat in the boardroom of the Charity Commissioners, there cannot really be any further argument.  Our judiciary conduct themselves and behave in such a way that that problem simply will not arise.  I think that anything that can be said on either side about this has been said and the only solution for the Opposition is to put down an amendment and let the House decide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a provision that is now being put in in 1961 no matter what happened before.  It is an old provision.  It could only have applied to things under the 1867 Act. On the point of a case arising under this Bill, Deputy de Valera was quite clear.  The judge is there as a Commissioner and also, not forgetting the judicial point of view, he hears things. Deputy de Valera talks about a case stated and thought it was proper that it should go to the man who was already conversant with the matter. I know he has been sent out but one cannot dismiss him from the debate. That is the position we are up against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not merely should justice be done but it should seem manifestly to be done.  That will not be the case if a judge goes to hear something and it gets to be known that he really heard the case as a commissioner.  That can happen.  If a new Courts of Justice Bill were brought in tomorrow which included a phrase that a judge <Col N="262" /> of any court should not be prevented or disabled by reason solely of his being a member of the Board, he having heard some previous matter, from sitting and hearing and determining that matter, there would be murder in this House if any such proposal was brought in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of justice being done or appearing to be done, I would be completely reluctant to do anything of the nature suggested by the Opposition to indicate to the people of Ireland that it was necessary for us in this House to instruct our judiciary as to how to do their business or give any impression that we had not an independent judiciary who are fully capable themselves of taking care of this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fantastic suggestion.  What is being called to question is the form and substance of the legislation with which we are now concerned.  Our case is that if it is expedient to re-enact in Section 13 the provisions of the 1867 Act that a judge of any court shall not be prevented or disabled by reason solely of his being a member of the Board from hearing and determining any case relating to a charity or any case arising under this Act, but may hear and <Col N="263" /> determine it as if he were not a member of the Board, we should have regard to the material not alone that is in existence in the legislation of 1867 but to the fact that there are new provisions in this Bill.  A new situation arises out of that fact.  We merely wish to reiterate the principle which the Parliamentary Secretary says he thinks should be so obvious that it does not require stating but with which Deputy de Valera says he does not agree.</P>
      <P>Our contention simply is that if Section 13 is necessary, then, in the light of subsequent additions to this <i>corpus</i> of legislation relating to charitable donations and bequests, it should be made clear that while Section 13 is put in in order to prevent any ambiguity about the capacity of the judge to hear matters relating to charities generally, it is not to be interpreted as going so far as to say that it would be proper for him to hear matters in which the Commissioners themselves&mdash;of which he is a member &mdash;were directly involved.  That is a desirable principle.</P>
      <P>I have said repeatedly, and I said to-day, that I very much doubt the desirability of expanding the extralegal duties of members of the judiciary because the more we draw them away from their ordinary business of dispensing justice and impose on them other duties, the more we expose them to the possibility of criticism and comment which would never arise if they confined themselves exclusively to the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>I think that is true and it is a bad tendency which has been growing both here and in Great Britain of asking judges to undertake a wide variety of extra-judicial duties which bring them into the arena of comment and criticism which is not appropriate for judicial persons.  However, that is a very much wider issue and I want to maintain a very narrow point, which is that if Section 13 is necessary, some conditions of limitation are also necessary, in view of the provisions of the Bill which we are now passing into law.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that I did not infer that the Opposition <Col N="264" /> were casting doubts on the independence of the judiciary.  They have indicated on a number of occasions that they had no desire to do so, but what I would say is that if we were to put in a provision of the type which the Opposition is seeking to put in, either here or somewhere else, it would reflect in the public mind on the independence of the judiciary.</P>
      <P>When I said a moment ago that the Opposition had originally argued that a judge should not be one of the Commissioners at all, Deputy McGilligan said that that had never been suggested. I want to quote from the Dáil Debates, Volume 184, No. 4, Column 607, where Deputy Dillon said:</P>
      <P>Why not?  I have got the uncomfortable feeling that the judge ought not to be a member of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  It is reasonable to suggest that in the circumstances it would be much better for a judge not to be himself a Commissioner of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  Any rational Deputy will agree with me. I do not think it is an unreasonable stipulation to say that if a man is a member of the Board and attains to judicial office, he should relinquish his position as a Commissioner of Charitable Donations and Bequests.</P>

Limit Section 13 to this, that a judge may sit on cases other than those which he has heard as a Commissioner.  The alternative is not to have a judge among the Commissioners at all.  With regard to this hint about the independence of the judiciary, of course the meaning does not arise in this connection at all. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary means the integrity of the judges who may be members of this body.  Deputy de Valera thought it was not really consistent with integrity but that it was proof of their integrity that they should be members, hear the evidence and hear the matter as judges.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16 of the 1871 Act is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where any person shall be bound to publish any devise or bequest under and by virtue of the nineteenth section of the Charitable Donations and Bequests Act (Ireland), 1867, such person shall (save in case of exemption as hereinafter provided, and so far as the same shall extend), within four months next after obtaining probate of the will containing such devise or bequest or administration with such will annexed, deliver at the office of the Commissioners, or forward to them by post, three papers (not being the Dublin Gazette) containing successive <Col N="267" /> publications of the said devise or bequest, pursuant to the provisions of the said section; and every such person who shall neglect to deliver or forward such copies of such papers as aforesaid shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding five pounds, to be recovered by the Commissioners, who may sue for the same by civil bill in the court of proper jurisdiction: Provided always, that it shall be lawful for the Commissioners, at their discretion, having regard to the small amount of any devise or bequest, or other special circumstances, to exempt such persons from such publication under the nineteenth section of the said Act, either wholly or to such extent and upon such terms as they shall think fit.</P>
    <P>The original Section 16 had this proviso that the Charity Commissioners could exempt from publication. Now we have taken what was formerly a proviso of Section 16 and made Section 20 out of it in our Bill so that the section with which we are now dealing, Section 48, is the same as the original Section 16, without the proviso because the proviso is now given effect to by means of Section 20 in our Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 19, before Section 52, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>Where, before the commencement of this Act, a body corporate has been appointed sole trustee of a charitable trust, then, during such time before and after such commencement as the body corporate has held and continues to hold the office of trustee of the trust&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the terms of the trust shall be deemed to have provided for and required and to provide for and require the appointment of one trustee only, and</P>
      <P>(b) one trustee only of the trust shall be deemed to have been originally appointed under the terms of the trust.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to validate certain appointments which have been made of a body corporate in place of two or more trustees.  Section 10 (2) (c) of the Trustee Act, 1893, provides that &ldquo;except where only one trustee was originally appointed, a trustee shall not be discharged under this section from his trust unless there will be at least two trustees to perform the trust&rdquo;.  I have already mentioned this matter in connection with the new section contained in amendment No. 22.  In future, the Board may, under that section, appoint a body corporate in substitution for two or more trustees; and the appointment will discharge the existing trustees. There are a number of cases, however, where two or more trustees of a charity have renounced their trusteeship in favour of a body corporate and we propose that they shall be legally and properly discharged from the trust.</P>

      <P>This sets out the functions of the Council which, briefly, are to advise the Minister for Health in relation to any regulations under Section 14 of the proposed Act and the Minister for Agriculture in relation to any regulations under Section 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we could wait to discuss this at a later stage but I want to raise at once a matter to which I attach very great importance.  I recognise that with the developments that have taken place there may be poisonous substances used in connection with agriculture generally which it may be necessary now to control by regulations of the kind envisaged in this Bill.  I refer particularly to certain types of poisonous spray that may constitute a hazard to those charged with the responsibility of spreading them.  Other types of poisonous spray may create problems in regard to bird life, bees and insects, but under Section 15 it is also proposed that this body shall have the power to advise the Minister for Agriculture in relation to certain regulations relative to the use of what are <Col N="273" /> technically defined as poisonous preparations for veterinary purposes.  I think that is going too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we not debate that on Section 15?  I doubt if this is the appropriate section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it suits the Minister better, but I want to enter at once a caveat that I recognise the appropriateness of the Council undertaking to advise the Minister in relation to poisons either for human use or even in agriculture because I recognise the hazard that that may create inadvertently by being used for the protection of crops.  However, I want to demur at once at the inclusion of veterinary preparations.  You must always in legislation of this kind try to weigh the advantages against the disadvantages.  There is always a tendency on the part of the professions and indeed of our esteemed public servants to go too far in protecting us against ourselves and that very often carries us to the point of putting burdens upon the community which it is not reasonable to ask the community to bear.  I can see that there must be control of the promiscuous use of poisons where there is the danger of their being used improperly by human beings but I cannot for the life of me think why if a farmer desires to give a pig an injection or even a cow an injection he should be prohibited by law from doing so because the substance which he proposes to inject into his beast has been declared on the advice of a committee of this kind to be a dangerous substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net result of such procedures will be that there will gradually grow up around the livestock farmers of the country a hedge of restrictions on the veterinary remedies which can only be penetrated by the habitual employment of a veterinary surgeon.  In my experience, the result of that will be that many farmers will not be able to afford to continue calling on the veterinary surgeons and, if these substances are no longer available to the farmer without restrictions of the kind envisaged in this Bill, the livestock will have to be allowed to die or deteriorate.  It is for that reason <Col N="274" /> that at this stage I want to direct the attention of the House to the power taken here to advise the Minister for the purpose of prescribing restrictions on the use of veterinary medicines and that is a power with which I do not think this body ought to be endowed. They should be confined to the other purposes referred to in the Bill which deal with agricultural preparations and poisons in the common interpretation of that word.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition, who has a well-informed and well-ordered mind, will see that the question that we should discuss on this section is the composition of the Council which will have the function to advise either the Minister for Health in relation to Section 14 or the Minister for Agriculture in relation to Section 15 and that the scope of the advice or the category of matters on which they may advise could be much better debated on Sections 14 and 15.  On the precise point to which Deputy Dillon addressed himself, may I point out that his colleague, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, has an amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete subsection (1) and to insert the following subsections, namely:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Council shall consist of&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  two persons each of whom <Col N="275" /> is a registered medical practitioner, has, for a period of not less than ten years before the date of his appointment as a member of the Council, been registered, or been entitled to be registered, in the Register of Medical Practitioners for Ireland and possesses an academic qualification which is higher than the minimum qualification required for such registration and is, in the opinion of the Minister, a desirable qualification as respects membership of the Council,</P>
    <P>(b)  five persons each of whom is a registered pharmaceutical chemist and has, for a period of not less than ten years before the date of his appointment as a member of the Council, been registered, or been entitled to be registered, in the Register of Pharmaceutical Chemists for Ireland,</P>
    <P>(c)  one person who is a registered dentist and has, for a period of not less than ten years before the date of his appointment as a member of the Council, been registered, or been entitled to be registered, in the Register of Dentists for Ireland,</P>
    <P>(d)  two persons nominated by the Minister for Agriculture each of whom is a registered veterinary surgeon,</P>
    <P>(e)  one person with special knowledge and experience of the use of poisonous substances in agriculture nominated by the Minister for Agriculture,</P>
    <P>(f)  one person whose main occupation is farming nominated by the Minister for Agriculture, and</P>
    <P>(g)  three other persons (whether or not having any qualification referred to in the foregoing paragraphs).</P>
    <P>(2)  At least one of the persons referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section shall be <Col N="276" /> a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>
    <P>(3)  (a) Each of three, but not more than three, of the persons referred to in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section shall be a person whose main occupation is either the carrying on of the business of pharmaceutical chemist or in employment as a pharmacist and at least two of those three persons shall be persons who, on the date of their appointment as members of the Council, are members of the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.</P>
    <P>(b)  At least one of the persons referred to in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section shall be a person whose main occupation is the teaching of pharmacy or a similar subject.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment has been drafted to meet, so far as possible, the various points put forward both in Dáil Éireann and by certain interested organisations in relation to the constitution of the Council.</P>
    <P>The function of the Council will be to advise the appropriate Minister in relation to regulations affecting certain particular types of substances.  The purpose of the amendment now put down is to broaden the field from which advice may be obtainable so as to make that advice reflect what may be described as the general interest of the community, while at the same time trying to ensure that the size of the Council will not be so great as to make discussion difficult.</P>
    <P>As I now envisage, the Council will consist of 15 members instead of 10 as originally intended.  It will include, in addition to what was proposed in the first instance, representation for dental and farming interests and the section as amended will provide that doctors, pharmaceutical chemists and dentists on the Council will possess such experience as will ensure a high level of expert advice in relation to matters referred to the Council.</P>
    <P>The specific points of difference between the section as originally drafted and the section after this amendment <Col N="277" /> has been adopted is that two doctors will have had to be registered, or entitled to be registered, for not less than 10 years and possess such a higher academic qualification as, in the opinion of the Minister, makes them suitable for membership of the Council.  At least one of these two must also be a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  When I specify that qualification, I am not to be taken as suggesting that other post-graduate qualifications may not rank as highly as that specified in the Bill but the fact is that some of the functions which this Council are now to discharge formerly reposed in the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  If I may so put it, the stipulation is a recognition of the fact that by usage, tradition and law, that body have established, so to speak, a prescriptive right to participate in advising the Minister in matters of this sort.</P>
    <P>As originally drafted, it was proposed that there should be not less than two members of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland on the Council. Instead of that minimum of two, the amendment provides that the Council will have five and that each of these must be at least ten years registered. It provides that not more than three must be in business as pharmaceutical chemists or employed as such and that, of these three, at least two shall be members of the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland. There is one other reservation in relation to pharmaceutical chemists.  It is that one of them shall be a teacher of pharmacy or a similar subject.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the Council will include among its members a member of the dental profession who must be at least ten years qualified. It is not readily practicable to specify that such a person shall possess a higher qualification in dentistry because these are not commonly looked for and it would unduly restrict the field of choice if such higher qualification were to be prescribed.</P>
    <P>Again, we shall have on the Council a person whose main occupation is farming.  In addition, there will be <Col N="278" /> two persons instead of one person with special knowledge and experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not.  They are provided for in the parent Section.  I am enumerating the changes provided for in the amendment.  There will be two persons, with special knowledge and experience of the use of poisonous substances in agriculture, to be nominated by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>In addition there will be three persons chosen at large by the Minister who might be taken as representing the general community which will have a very definite interest in the matters which come before the Council.  They may, for instance, be business people or ordinary citizens.</P>
      <P>I want to make this clear in regard to the proposed Council: the proposals have been framed to ensure that this body will not be representative merely of narrow, vested interests.</P>
      <P>It is not intended that the Council should be used as a battleground of conflicting interests.  The function of the Council is to advise the appropriate Minister, the Minister for Health in regard to regulations to be made under Section 14 or the Minister for Agriculture in regard to regulations to be made under Section 15.  My purpose is to try to constitute a council which will be a pool of knowledge and experience available to advise the Minister in the interests of the community as a whole as to the controls necessary in the manufacture, sale, distribution and use of poisonous substances.  I think I have managed to constitute the Council in such manner that every regulation that comes before it will be considered in the light of the special knowledge which one or other of the members of the Council will possess.  They will be able to make recommendations which will reflect generally the consensus of informed opinion and good sense of the Council in regard to any proposed regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the amendment will meet with the general acceptance of the House and give to those who are somewhat <Col N="279" /> apprehensive as to how the Council will function the assurance that it will not deprive any person of any legitimate right he possesses or that it will operate otherwise than merely to advise the Minister as to the best way to safeguard the health of the community, individually and as a whole, by protecting people against the unwarranted distribution and supply of poisons and by ensuring that where poisonous substances are used, there will be adequate safeguards for the user and also for those who, in one way or another, may be affected by the fact that such substances are being utilised for specific purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitution of the Council in the original Bill was, in my view, scandalous.  This amendment represents no improvement.  I shall give my reasons for saying that. The Council will have the function of advising both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Agriculture.  On the Council as at first constituted there was not a single farmer.  We have approximately 380,000 farmers and I think they are worthy of a bigger voice on this Council than just one in 15.  The Minister said a few moments ago he was anxious the regulations should be just and correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. I did not use either of those words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="280" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not have used those exact words, but he said he was anxious that any regulation made would not be harsh or extreme. How can the regulations not be harsh on the largest section of our community when there is only one representative of that section on a Council constituted of 15 members?  He has now put in three persons without laying down any qualifications at all other than the pious aspirations he uttered here today.  I fully approve of a Bill which gives the Minister power to make regulations in regard to the sale of poisons generally.  Over the years science has made many advances.  It has become the practice now for farmers to become their own vets. to a large extent. If the Council now proposed is established practices and usages may be interfered with.  Remember, there has not been one single complaint of accident or death even though farmers all over the country have been using certain poisonous substances by way of vaccine and dosage.  Can the Minister advance one single reason why the agricultural voice on this Council should be limited to one?</P>
      <P>I daresay it is necessary to tighten up on the sale of poisons generally but there are many anti-biotics and pretty harmless substances which will come within the scope of this Council.  Take the case of sheep farmers.  There are many diseases associated with lambing. It has become common practice to inject both lambs and ewes with various preparations immediately after lambing and that has resulted in a reduction of mortality in sheep.  I refer to diseases such as pulp kidney and fluke.  They were very widespread.  I have not the slightest doubt that this Council will recommend that the treatments given should be given by veterinary surgeons. There is a sheep farm in the West which extends from Ballinrobe to the gates of Galway City.  There would not be sufficient vets in the province of Connaught to deal with that area during the lambing season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the creamery areas large numbers of cows suffer from various complaints.  Remedies for these complaints and preventives are pretty well known.  Under this Council I can <Col N="281" /> see a situation in which recommendations will be made to the Minister for Agriculture that nobody should use these remedies or preventives except a veterinary surgeon.  It would be as well for the farmers to hand over their livestock altogether to the veterinary surgeons.  There would not, of course, be enough veterinary surgeons to cope with the situation if the regulations I envisage are made.  Instead of just one farmer I propose there should be three.</P>

      <P>Carters of milk can engage in the haulage of milk to creameries only by virtue of the special concession in that regard provided in Section 2 of the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1955.</P>
      <P>To extend that concession so as to enable such carters to bring back from creameries goods purchased by or on behalf of farmers, would have the effect of enabling them to act as general hauliers to the farming community in competition with C.I.E. and licensed hauliers, countrary to established transport policy.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister must have regard to the realities of rural life?  Does he not appreciate <Col N="292" /> that it is, I believe, the earnest desire of the Minister for Agriculture that farmers should combine to send their milk by one carrier rather than having 15 farmers bringing 15 separate cans of milk to the creamery?  In such arrangements, normally the carriers will call at each of the 15 houses to return the skimmed milk.  It is a fantastic extension of the spirit of the Road Transport Act to say that they cannot bring back a half lb. of tea or a loaf of bread.</P>

      <P>Life could be made impossible for people if the law is not administered in its spirit as well as in its letter.  If the Minister for Transport and Power indicates clearly that where a man is bringing back skimmed milk to a neighbour, having brought in whole milk to the creamery, no question will be raised if he brings back ordinary household goods manifestly purchased for the neighbour's convenience, then there is no serious difficulty, but what is happening is that people are being prosecuted for bringing back a loaf of bread or a half lb. of tea. Does the Minister endorse what the Taoiseach said, that unless they are carrying for reward, there is no prosecution?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normal practice for Córas Iompair Éireann and the Ulster Transport Authority to co-operate in the use of specialised equipment for cross-Border transport. As the U.T.A. equipment was regarded as more suitable for the transport of the boiler in question it was carried <Col N="294" /> by the U.T.A., though C.I.E. could have undertaken the job.</P>
      <P>C.I.E. have recently had the question of transport equipment for extra heavy loads under examination and I am advised that they are acquiring a new low loader which will be suitable for the vast bulk of the heavy loads offering.  The E.S.B. also have specialised vehicles suitable for the transport of heavy equipment which they are prepared to place at the disposal of C.I.E. should this be necessary at any time.</P>

      <P>The answer to both parts of the Question is in the negative. I have seen the report of the Cork acting county engineer.  It appears to suggest that the greater portion of the roads in the area on which the substitute services will be operated are already substandard for existing traffic.  I am satisfied that the need for improving them cannot be related wholly or mainly to the marginal increase in traffic which will follow on the closing of the railway line.</P>
      <P>The question of any improvement in the roads which the county council may consider desirable would be a matter which would appropriately be dealt with by the Minister for Local Government to whom I understand a copy of the report in question has already been sent.</P>

      <P>As stated in reply to a previous Question in Dáil Éireann, the information furnished to me by representatives of the trade tended to show that, with the exception of a <Col N="304" /> limited number of preparations, prices here are approximately the same as those operating in the Six Counties and in Britain.  The further investigation in this matter is now being directed towards finding the reasons for the price differential in the case of these exceptional items, which, I may add, are not manufactured here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I mentioned in the House already that in regard to drugs and chemicals&mdash;these are basic drugs and chemicals&mdash;there is no real difference between the prices here and those in Britain.  Any differences there are are very minimum.  In some cases, they favour the Irish consumer. In regard to proprietary preparations, it has been discovered that there is no difference either except minimum ones in respect of 90 per cent. of them.  The remaining 10 per cent. is now being investigated.  If I find that a public inquiry is warranted, the review having been made, I would give the matter favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will <Col N="305" /> take steps to enable him to refer the proposal to increase premiums for motor insurance to a Prices Advisory Committee for public investigation and report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to Section 5 (h) of the Prices Act, 1958, which excludes charges for insurance from the scope of that Act. There is power, which has not up to now been utilised, to control premium rates for motor vehicles under the Insurance Act, 1936.</P>
      <P>In reference to the impending increase in premium rates for private cars, I may say that the insurance companies informed me, in advance, of their intention to increase these rates.  At my request, they provided factual data in support of their proposals, and the companies were able to demonstrate conclusively that motor business is being run at a loss.  While I am naturally anxious that the insurances charges should not weigh too heavily on the motor users, it must be recognised that insurance companies cannot be expected to continue to provide the service if the charges are unremunerative.  I will, however, keep the situation under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <P>The general policy in relation to the determination of wage rates is that they should, so far as possible, be negotiated freely between employers' and workers' organisations.

The Convention expressly provides that its principles may be applied by means of collective agreements between employers and workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Tenders have been invited by Wexford Corporation for this scheme and the last date for reception of tenders is the 25th of this month.  The question of my giving sanction to the commencement of building cannot arise until a specific proposal on the matter is received from the Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not concerned about the long delay since the first application was made by the Wexford Corporation to have these houses built?  Is he not aware of the fact that because building has been delayed so much in Wexford many building workers are now idle in the town and many have been forced to emigrate?  Will he also say at what date he will require the Wexford Corporation to invite tenders for these 30 houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite a formidable list of Supplementary Questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>Only three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give the information to the Deputy.  With regard to my concern in this matter, I am most concerned that these houses should be built but I am equally concerned that the cost should not be exorbitant and that concerns the interests of the tenants, the ratepayers and the taxpayers.  In the case of the scheme which is under question, the cost of the superstructure alone is £250 to £300 more than the labour cost of a similar superstructure by direct labour in the City of Cork.  It <Col N="316" /> is quite evident from that that the cost is out of all proportion to what it should be.  The device now being adopted of the direct labour unit tendering in competition with other contractors on the specifications laid down will have the effect, as it has had in another instance, of giving us a much more suitably priced job than that proposed.  It is certainly no pleasure for me to keep revising these things or putting them back.  I want the houses built just as much as the Deputy or anybody in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister could have got all that information six months ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question of delays, I do not accept that the delay is in any way due to the action of my Department, or that any unnecessary delay has been caused by it.  In fact, since September of last year, and up to January of this year, any delays caused in these revisions, possibly necessary delays, have been in Wexford and not in the Department. Further to that, I might say that to expedite things and cut out any undue delay, we have had our people visit Wexford twice to try to make it possible for the Wexford authorities and ourselves to reach a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must agree that there has been a painful delay?  The House will remember that on three or four occasions I tried to establish the need for so many houses which the Minister denied and which some of the officials of Wexford Corporation denied?  The Minister will surely remember that he said that there were only 30 houses required in Wexford and that subsequently the county manager, months afterwards, said 260 were needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That took three or four months and now there has been three or four months' delay on the cost.  In the meantime men are idle and have been forced to emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I said, from the information furnished to me from Wexford, <Col N="317" /> that 30 houses appeared to be the need.  Subsequent to that, the Deputy questioned that figure in this House and only subsequent to that was it elicited from the manager and the local authority that more than 30 were necessary.  Who is at fault there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

Part of what was usefully done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act was to be considered by the Board of Works. No legislation, so far as I know, is necessary in order that certain of these works should be carried out.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions No. 70 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>I already have certain powers under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, and the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, to deal with electrical interference of the kind mentioned by Deputy Rooney.  I do not consider that further legislation is required for the purpose he has in mind&mdash;at least at this stage.  I propose to set up a committee shortly, as provided for in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, to advise me on the making of statutory orders requiring suppressors to be fitted or other appropriate action to be taken in relation to particular kinds of electrical apparatus.  Some preliminary progress has been made in collecting documentation on measures taken elsewhere in this regard.  Unfortunately, there is no short-cut to interference-free radio and television reception.  It will take a considerable time to get out Orders covering such a wide and varied technical field but I hope it will be possible to make Orders this year in regard to some of the most common causes of interference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime I have appealed to manufacturers, assemblers and importers of those kinds of electrical goods which are known to cause undue interference to take all practicable measures to prevent such interference before the goods reach the public.  Members of the public can also help, not only by having suppressors fitted to items of electrical equipment already in use which cause interference but by making a point of enquiring, before making a purchase of any new item, whether it has been <Col N="335" /> fitted with a suppressor or has otherwise been designed and constructed in such a way as to avoid causing interference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister in considering this at least to provide for the use of suppressors after 6 p.m. and on holidays and on Sundays. Otherwise there is not much trouble as television only starts at that time.  The principle interference is with television and there is no serious interference with radio.  In the case of television when any electric mechanical device is operating television viewing becomes impossible.  There is nothing but interference.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> (1)  The property has been acquired by the Committee;</P>
    <P>(2)  I gave sanction to the Committee's proposal to undertake the work of reconstruction, at an estimated cost of £72,500, on 8th April, 1960;</P>
    <P>(3)  Sketch plans for the work in question were approved on 3rd September, 1960;</P>
    <P>(4)  Lay-out drawings for the various classrooms were approved on 20th December, 1960, and authority was given for the preparation of working drawings and specification, which must be submitted to my Department for approval;</P>
    <P>(5)  The working drawings and specification have not yet been received in my Department, but I understand that they are in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>There has been no undue or avoidable delay on the part of my Department in dealing with this proposal at any of its stages or in issuing the various approvals.  I am aware that unfounded and irresponsible charges of delay have been made publicly against my Department, and I have had to refute those charges elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Sanction for the invitation of building tenders can be given only when the working drawings have been examined and found suitable.  I cannot, of course, foretell whether these drawings and specification, when received, will be such that they can be approved without amendment, but they will be examined with all reasonable expedition.</P>

The compilation of separate figures for the 14-15 and 15-16 age groups would involve an inordinate amount of official time and would not, I feel, be warranted.  This is particularly so since it is well known that the great majority of pupils of the 14-15 age group who are in whole-time attendance at school continue to attend when they pass into the 15-16 age group.</P>

      <P>While not committing myself to acceptance of the Deputy's statement that Irish manufacturers are meeting with increasing difficulties in the sale of their goods, I am fully aware of the importance of design in industry.  During the past year there has been set up under my Department a committee representative of the various interests involved, including the manufacturers, to consider what appropriate steps might be taken to improve the facilities heretofore available in the National College of Art for training in industrial design.</P>
      <P>I may mention here that some institutions not directly connected with my Department, but represented on the Committee to which I have referred, have been very actively concerned with this question of design in industry.  Last year, for example, An Chomhairle Ealaíon awarded a scholarship of £800 to a young Irish designer to study industrial design abroad.  This scholarship holder is at present pursuing his studies on the Continent.  Córas Tráchtála are also examining means of providing an advisory service in industrial design for Irish manufacturers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore the decision of the Government to oppose this Bill, first on the grounds of common courtesy.  The Front Bench of this Party rarely resorts to the device of proposing a Private Bill.  I think when they do the ordinary courtesy of the House should be extended for the purpose of having the Bill printed so that it can be debated on its merits on the Second Stage.  In my opinion, it is an improper use of the Government's power to prevent a Bill of this kind being printed by opposing it at this Stage.</P>
      <P>The reason for this Bill is perfectly simple.  Before we left office in 1957, the Road Traffic Bill was in draft.  It is now four years or more since that time and, throughout that whole period, repeated promises have been given in this House to provide a Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill.  None was forthcoming.  Several fatal accidents have resulted from people colliding with the backs of large lorries standing unlighted on the side of public roads.  That, in our opinion, constituted something amounting to an emergency, with the result that we put down this Bill to provide shortly that, pending the presentation to the House of a comprehensive road traffic code, it would be made illegal to leave lorries parked on roads in those circumstances without making adequate provision for their adequate illumination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> One of the first results of our putting this Bill on the Order Paper was that the Government presented a comprehensive Bill to deal with road traffic which the House will have to consider. I put it to the House that it is a very extensive Bill which will take a considerable time to consider in the various Stages through which it will have to pass.  In the meantime, existing abuses can continue, whereas the Bill we have submitted is a one-section Bill which could have been passed expeditiously through the House thus abating the existing abuses.</P>
    <P>Therefore, on two grounds I deplore the Government's decision and I propose, if possible, to bring the matter to the issue of a Division.  First, I think it would have been common courtesy on the part of the Leader of the House to signify the Government's readiness to have the Bill printed and considered on its merits, whatever those merits might be, at a suitable date to be arranged between us.  Secondly, I consider it wrong to refuse us the facility of the procedure of the House to put through a Bill quickly which would abate what is, in our judgement, a very present and acute abuse which requires urgent abatement.  I would even now suggest to the Taoiseach that he might reconsider the Government's decision and signify their willingness to allow this matter to proceed to Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Dillon that no discourtesy is intended to him or to the other Deputies whose names are attached to this Bill by reason of our opposition to the First Reading.  I do not think, however, that the respect due to the Deputies who signed the Bill should lead us into doing something which, on the face of it, is very foolish.  Indeed, I must say I expected that the Bill would not have been proceeded with in the circumstances, where a comprehensive Bill dealing with road traffic matters has been circulated and is available for discussion by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure every sensible Deputy will agree it is desirable to have the whole of the road traffic code incorporated in one measure.  The Bill which the <Col N="349" /> Government has circulated contains proposals for dealing with the particular matter to which the Private Members' Bill was directed.  Indeed, it is our assumption that every Deputy recognises the necessity for reviewing our road traffic legislation and, as far as we are concerned, the Bill which is submitted is not a contentious measure in any way.  We hope that all members of the House will co-operate with the Government in trying to make it a satisfactory measure in every respect. <Col N="350" /> Any amendments which Deputies opposite may propose, which appear likely to improve the Bill, will be fully considered and accepted.  We and the House would look foolish, and the business of the House would be upset, by having two Road Traffic Bills before us at the same time.  That is why we are opposing the First Reading.</P>
