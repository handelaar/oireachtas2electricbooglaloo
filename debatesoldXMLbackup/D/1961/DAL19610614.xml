      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring last evening to the number of schools which were built in a specific period compared with the number built since the foundation of the State.  The number of new school buildings which the Minister for Education envisaged in his statement to the House recently was, I think, 67.  The Parliamentary Secretary has started well this year, and in the first couple of months, the money expended was a goodly sum.  I take it that refers to the buildings completed within the recent past.  We should do everything possible to accelerate the school building programme, bearing in mind the children who are affected by present conditions which we do not wish to see perpetuated.  I admit that every endeavour is being made to get on with that programme. For that reason, I am glad there is an increase in the technical staffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish there were some way by which this work could be expedited.  From the time it is decided to build a school, there is a long time lag before building starts.  That is inevitable.  When it is decided that a school should be built in a particular area, immediately, without waiting for the various preliminaries which must be concluded, the planning of the actual building itself should be commenced.  I understand <Col N="91" /> that one of the factors which delays the programme in that respect is that when the actual building has been planned, the assembling of the various bills of quantities and so on takes time.  The Parliamentary Secretary will admit, therefore, that it is not uncommon sometimes to find that three years or more elapse before building operations commence.</P>
    <P>I mentioned previously that we should not be so conservative in regard to the numbers we build for. We build schools to accommodate the averages which pertain in the locality at the time.  It is a well-known fact that generally the school-going population trend is as much affected by the proposed location of the school as by anything else.  Anything like an industry contiguous to the area will increase the school-going population, or even the possibility of an industry coming to the area.  We ought to err rather on the side of allowing extra space in the schools than on building them exactly to the agreed number of square feet per pupil for the existing population so that we will not later on be compelled to alter the buildings to provide extra rooms.</P>
    <P>There are a few minor points in regard to schools to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention. The two-teacher school is pretty widespread throughout the country.  In a school like that there are bound to be days on which the second teacher may not be there.  At the moment no provision is made in planning for a communicating door between the two classrooms and it is extremely difficult for the remaining teacher to supervise properly and adequately the pupils in the second classroom.  He is under obligation to supervise and ensure their safety at all times.  I suggest that, in all future planning, provision should be made for a communicating door.  That would make for convenience and safety.</P>
    <P>The outsides of most schools at the moment are finished with heavy casting. From the point of view of the safety of the children this is not the best finish.  There is danger of injury <Col N="92" /> if children, through natural exuberance, fall against the wall.  Children's faces could be injured.  Even if it is necessary to use rough casting, surely the lower portion of the walls could be finished in smooth plaster.  At the moment the new schools look beautiful but, as time goes on, they will lose their freshness and, if a smooth finish is used, I think it would be much easier then to give them a face lift. Probably the Parliamentary Secretary has a good answer to justify the type of finish that is being used at the moment.</P>
    <P>Recently I noticed link fencing around part of the boundary of some new schools and, on the inside, white thorn is planted.  I do not think that is wise from the point of view of the safety of the children.  The interiors are excellent and the scheme of decoration is very effective.  The blackboard arrangement, however, leaves something to be desired.  At the moment the blackboard is placed on both sides of the fireplace and it is also continued across the top of the fireplace.  Perhaps the idea is that that portion should be used as a notice board.  I think that, as well as having a blackboard, there should also be maps provided.  These are a most essential part of the equipment of any school.  In conjunction with the Department of Education, I suggest steps should be taken by the Board of Works to have a map case fixed permanently for display purposes.</P>
    <P>In the infant schools there is need of a timber rail, or some kind of rail, on which to display pictures.  Pictures form a very important part of the teaching equipment in infant schools. I suggest the Board of Works should in future provide such a rail.  I know it is easy to mention these matters. Action is something else.  I suggest that there should be a supervisory staff so that, as building progresses, essential details can be added.  The supervisory staff should be out through the country wherever building is going on. In the long run that suggestion, if implemented, could save money.  It would also save time and the necessity later for remedying defects long after the building has been completed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> There is provision for a great deal of building in relation to other Departments.  There has been for some years now a pretty extensive building programme for the Department of Agriculture.  Remembering the important part agriculture plays in the economy of the country it is both essential and desirable that such building should be undertaken to improve conditions generally.  The building of research and experimental stations is very much to be desired.</P>
    <P>I was taken aback to discover that it is contemplated moving the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health to a new site.  At the moment the Department of Social Welfare is housed in Aras Mhic Dhiarmada.  That is one of the most modern buildings we have.  Córas Iompair Éireann must have a good deal of accommodation all over the city.  I admit that the Department of Health may find itself cramped in the Custom House.  References have been made here from time to time to the fact that Aras Mhic Dhiarmada is rented.  Is that building now fully completed?  In the recent past I know it was not.  I cannot understand why the Department of Social Welfare should enter the picture just at the moment.  There are other projects which are more essential in my opinion.</P>
    <P>As far as the Department of Justice is concerned, quite a number of Garda stations throughout the country are not in a desirable state of either repair or maintenance.  It would be more desirable to deal with some of these and to accelerate some of the other works for which the Office of Public Works is responsible rather than indulge in the completely new step of housing the staffs of the Department of Health and Social Welfare. I quite agree that Staffs must be properly housed and it is not so very long ago since we had a Bill in this House dealing with office conditions. Nobody can say that the offices in Aras Mhic Dhiarmada are anything but ultra modern.</P>
    <P>In regard to arterial drainage, I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary refers in his statement to its continued expansion.  He says it continues <Col N="94" /> to expand and progress is satisfactory. I think everybody is in agreement with that fact.  Arterial drainage has been expanding as the Office of Public Works has been expanding the necessary machinery and equipment to deal with these problems.  We ought to try to accelerate the programme.  The Parliamentary Secretary refers to a programme that might be completed in 15 years or so.  It is the &ldquo;or so&rdquo; rather than the 15 years that I am afraid of.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we very eagerly await the programme, first, in regard to the operation on the Deale.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary, when concluding, would give us the up-to-date information as to the progress of that scheme. I know from local contacts that it has reached the advanced stage and for that the people of West Limerick are very grateful indeed. Last year the people in the valley of the Deale had the unfortunate experience of flooding during the summer period when their crops were completely destroyed.  It is not so long ago since the Land Commission had for offer in one of those areas a holding which they were letting by auction for some time.  The farmers of that area sought gardens on that holding to enable them to grow root crops&mdash;a thing which they have not been able to do satisfactorily for years.</P>
    <P>Anybody can testify to the fact that about five times during the past seven or eight years their crops have been swept away by disastrous flooding in that area.  Besides, there are in County Limerick large areas of land which cannot even be adequately drained. They cannot obtain the benefit of drainage schemes.  That is a very serious drawback to the agricultural economy of those areas.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can do anything to expedite this programme or even bring it forward by three months, it would be very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the Maigue.  I know that the survey of the Maigue has commenced.  It is a vast area and it extends into the heart of the Golden Vale, touching even the County Tipperary.  Again, I certainly would not be in any way critical of any expansion of staff which would <Col N="95" /> give us an acceleration of the drainage scheme programme.  We would add considerably to the economy of the country if we were able to bring this land into productive capacity sooner than it can by our present rate of progress.</P>
    <P>In that respect, indeed, the agricultural community who live along the banks of the rivers for which it is intended that the Board of Works will be responsible are anxiously looking forward to the operations of that section of the Office of Public Works. Early this year the Parliamentary Secretary received a deputation from the Limerick and Tipperary area in regard to a flooding problem.  Unfortunately, the Parliamentary Secretary could not do anything for them because the programme of arterial drainage made it incumbent upon him to leave that problem aside inasmuch as it could not be classed even as an intermediate drainage.  The Shannon is a tidal river.  We are certainly not very far from the sea.  Rivers like the Maigue and the Deale are tributaries of the river Shannon.  To think that the areas I have mentioned will have to wait a very long period would be a great source of uneasiness to the people who live in these regions.</P>
    <P>I know that the Office of Public Works has a very large responsibility in regard to the building programmes under the various Departments of State.  They are passed from the various Departments for execution to this Department.  Any of the Departments may at that stage say: &ldquo;Well, we have passed the particular project.  We have done all we can about it.  It is now a matter for the Office of Public Works.&rdquo;  The problem is then left with the Office of Public Works and that Office is responsible for projects emanating from the Department of Justice, the Department of Education, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of External Affairs, the Department of Industry and Commerce and so on.</P>
    <P>At the same time it has a rather stinted allocation of moneys for the purposes with which it is to deal.  I <Col N="96" /> do not know whether this would be an example in reverse of centralisation towards getting the desired effect. Each of these Departments, I suggest, might have their own planning section to deal with their problems.  Having planned them, they could hand them for execution to the Office of Public Works.  That might contribute something to the expedition which everybody desires.</P>
    <P>This Estimate is a most important one.  The work that is being done under the auspices of this Office is a permanent record of our interest and our efficiency in regard to the various State projects where we are trying to replace deficits which exist over so many years in the past.  Everybody wishes the Parliamentary Secretary and his staff well in that respect.  The only fault which anybody might have with the programme is that it is too slow.  It is very much to be desired that the Parliamentary Secretary would bring to that office a sense of greater urgency in regard to the programme which has to be completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few general remarks arising out of the Estimate before the House.  On Votes 8 and 9 it will be appropriate to refer to items such as coastal erosion and other matters.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his statement indicated that a substantial part of the increase of £39,150 in the Estimate was due to the provision for the recruitment of extra architectural and engineering staff required to undertake some large building and harbour construction projects which will be commenced during the year.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary has been able to get additional technical staff to cope with the work that will arise as a result of these major operations.  The progress over the past few years in speeding up planning of projects under the control of the Board of Works has been deplorably slow. Appeals have been made from all sides of the House during debates on Estimates to have these planning operations expedited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works is the <Col N="97" /> most extensive organisation under the control of the State.  The type of work it undertakes necessitates slowness in planning and great care and attention to detail.  A private person who engages an architect to plan a business or private premises knows that it takes several months to get even a very minor plan brought to finality. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that the major operations carried out by the Office of Public Works take a great deal of time.  However, the time taken in regard to many projects is far too long and if it is due to lack of staff or office accommodation, that matter should be put right once and for all.  This cause of complaint has existed for many years and the improvement is not very noticeable.  It is exasperating that when local clearance is obtained in regard to new schools or other projects, it takes months and even years, apart from the question of title, to get plans and specifications brought to the stage at which the contract may be advertised and the work put in hands.</P>
    <P>I inquired into this matter some years ago.  I have a good deal of sympathy with the Parliamentary Secretary and with the staff of the Office of Public Works, particularly the technical staff who are responsible for these matters.  The fact that they have not an entirely free hand in major or minor planning causes a certain amount of slowing down.  A private architect is responsible only to the person who engages him and can speed up plans to a much greater extent.  The staff of the Office of Public Works are responsible through the Parliamentary Secretary to the House and are open to criticism for any false steps or imperfect work that may be brought to light.  In those circumstances, naturally, they take very great care that all details are examined and that any work they carry out is as nearly perfect as it can be.  I understand that position very well but I do think that their work could be speeded up a little more. There has been some improvement, as I have been told by persons who have had experience in this matter, but there is room for a great deal more. If the Parliamentary Secretary did <Col N="98" /> nothing else but to show an appreciable speeding up of the work during his period of office, he would have done a good deal.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity, through the Parliamentary Secretary, to thank the staff, particularly the technical staff associated with planning, and the architectural staff, for the very large volume of work they have successfully carried out during the past 12 years.  The year under review is a record year and the present position augurs very well for the future.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made a casual reference to minor drainage, or it appeared to me that he had something of that nature in mind, when he said that under the arrangements introduced about a year ago for intermediate river drainage, work will be started on four of the smaller catchment areas this year.  There is a great and very pressing need in many areas for attention to these minor drainage works.  Part of the problem was dealt with some years ago through the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I am one of those who feel that the money spent under that Act was badly spent and I am entirely happy that the grants were withdrawn.  I do think, however, that there should be some organisation in the Office of Public Works to deal with the more important part of the minor drainage problem arising from work in connection with the Land project and from major arterial drainage operations.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is no satisfactory provision whereby such work can be undertaken on a communal basis, for the benefit of the community.  I know that it takes some time to evolve a practicable plan to deal with a problem of this kind but in the interim, provisional measures should be available to the community for undertaking urgent minor drainage, where problems arise.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to direct his attention to that aspect in the very near future and indicate to the people in what way he may be able to help them.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which is probably more urgent, namely, coast <Col N="99" /> erosion.  In my constituency and in a number of coastal areas, erosion is becoming an acute problem.  The damage caused in certain areas is very serious and the indications are that it will become more serious.  Representations have been made to the Office of the Parliamentary Secretary on a number of occasions over the past couple of years and the matter has also been raised by way of Parliamentary Question.  The present position is that local authorities have no funds available to them to relieve the problem. The situation is becoming worse and in some years time will have reached the stage at which it will not be possible to do anything if the problem is not tackled immediately.</P>
    <P>I understand that the work necessary to correct damage due to coast erosion is more or less in the experimental stages in certain parts of the country up to this.  Obviously, the value of such experimental work must be tested before it can be generally applied but, even so, I think that if an attempt is made and fails it is probably better than making no attempt at all.  No doubt the coast erosion problem is one for State attention, initially at any rate; no local authority could possibly cope with the expenditure that would be involved and until some settled basis is reached the State should come into the picture.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the most urgent problems should be attacked without delay. Board of Works staff have reported on most of the areas from which complaints emanate and it should be possible to devise some scheme of work to provide the necessary defence against further erosion in these areas. I appeal very specially to the Parliamentary Secretary to give this matter his urgent attention and indeed, if he has not already done so, bring it to the notice of the Government at the earliest opportunity.  The summer period is usually a suitable time to carry out such work and I should like full advantage to be taken of that period, so that if we are to have something done, the work would be in hands and completed as far as possible before winter sets in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> There are two or three districts in my constituency about which I have already made representations to the Parliamentary Secretary as regards the necessity for urgent action to protect amenities and different types of property adjoining points where the sea is causing damage.  I hope he will be able to do something for those areas of the coast in the North Kerry district.  I appeal again to the Parliamentary Secretary to tackle these problems and relieve a good deal of mental anxiety, apart from physical damage, existing in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Estimate because the Board of Works is responsible for the erection of new buildings and the reconstruction or improvement of old buildings for all Departments of State.  It is a sort of clearing house for all Departments.  It does other valuable work also and, as Deputy Moloney spoke principally of coast erosion in his constituency, I might as well remind the Minister of the problem in that regard facing us in South Kerry.  I understand that coast erosion comes under the Department of Transport and Power but I presume that when any work has to be done in connection with it the job is handed over to the Board of Works.  I do not know if that is correct.</P>
      <P>Dealing with coast erosion is a very difficult problem and prevention of damage would cost immense sums of money.  It is believed that while there is coast erosion in one place, in other areas new land is being created so that I may assume that the area of the country is the same as it was hundreds of years ago.  In South Kerry we have very serious erosion at Waterville and along the coast between Waterville and Ballinskelligs. In fact, unless something is done to protect the village of Waterville, it will disappear in 20 or 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arterial drainage, which is also of great importance, is carried out by the Board of Works.  At present the River Maine is being drained and good progress has been made but there are some complaints in connection with the completion of the work.  As the <Col N="101" /> Parliamentary Secretary knows&mdash; because there have been deputations to him on two occasions&mdash; the complaints have arisen in connection with the drainage of one of the main tributaries, the Brown Flesk.  I should like to know if any progress has been made towards easing the serious flooding that takes place and not only damages land but also houses which are in danger of being wrecked and having their foundations undermined.</P>
    <P>At one place on the bank of that river there is a cemetery and river erosion is taking place at that point. It is very important that something should be done in regard to the drainage of that tributary.  It is appreciated that it is a very difficult problem because of the winding of the river.  The danger is, now that the work is near completion, that unless something is done about this tributary, it will also flood the main road from Killarney to Tralee.  That has already happened once.  We also have the serious flooding that takes place in the valley of Glenflesk and deputations have also been to see the Parliamentary Secretary from that area because of the serious flooding there three or four times a year.  We are told that it is part of the Laune catchment area but there is no flooding anywhere along that river except in the one portion. The excuse has been given that the flooding cannot be relieved until a new bridge is built at Flesk between Muckross and Killarney but that work will be carried out in the near future and so there should be no excuse for not relieving the serious flooding in the Glenflesk area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did something for some portion of Galway.  I may refer to the maintenance of rivers drained under arterial drainage schemes.  Kerry County Council, for instance, has been presented during the past few years, since the work was completed, with the task of providing £17,000 per annum for the maintenance of the River Feale.  That must be raised by rates.  Now we shall have the River Maine which perhaps will require a further £17,000 or maybe more, for maintenance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly fair to ask the ratepayers of the county to pay for the maintenance of these drainage works, because there are hundreds of thousands of people in Kerry who did not benefit at all from the drainage of the Feale or the Maine.  The Department of Finance should be responsible for the main portion of the maintenance and farmers and people who benefit by the drainage should also pay something, and perhaps there could be something then in a general way from the rates.  It is not fair that people who derive no benefit from the drainage should be asked to pay for the maintenance of these works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a large sum here for the development of certain harbours. There are five, one of them being Cahirciveen.  I am sure the people in that area are pleased that that is so. Prior to the report of the body which dealt with the development of these <Col N="103" /> harbours, the Deputies from South Kerry had asked that Cahirciveen be included in the development and we are glad that it has been.  In regard to Dingle, I understand it will now be in the constituency of South Kerry so we shall have to look after it as well as the portion we had already.  It would have been much easier if they had left it in North Kerry, even though some Deputies might regret its severance from that portion of Kerry. But Dingle harbour does not come under this development.  I think it is one of the principal fishing harbours in the country and it should be regarded as more important than a place called Greencastle which is one of the five for development.</P>

      <P>I shall pass on from the matter.  There is not very much <Col N="104" /> more I have to say because even though it is an important Estimate, other Deputies have referred to the many points that could be raised.  With regard to schools, there are many new schools yet to be built and many old schools which could be reconstructed even in a temporary way until new schools are built.  I do not know if the Board of Works have anything to do with the selection of sites for schools.  I take it one of their engineers carries out a survey of the sites offered but in this age it is a pity that the sites are so small.  Sites should be selected which are large enough to provide room for the children to play games, such as football and hurling or other games, while the girls could play tennis or hockey and other games.  In all cases, the sites are miserably small and uneven and they are left that way. That was the case in the old schools and one wonders how they were built among rocks.  Very often the teacher had the obligation of levelling the ground in order to save the children from injury.  I notice that schools which were built 10 or 12 years ago are now in a very bad state of repair.  I suppose the Board of Works are not responsible for that but the contractors who do the work do not always do it in a satisfactory manner.  Perhaps that is because of lack of proper supervision.</P>
      <P>In regard to the erection of Garda stations or their improvement or reconstruction, I notice a sum of money voted for a station down at Lauragh near Kenmare.  It would be no harm if the Board of Works consulted the Department of Justice in regard to that because I understand that station is either closed or to be closed and the Guards moved elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I can say that the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary is notable for the absence of any reference to work that requires to be done rather than work that is being done.  It is a statement the Parliamentary Secretary could make at a chapel gate in connection with an election. It looks good and there are many promises in it and I only hope they will be carried out as expeditiously as possible, if not by the <Col N="105" /> present Parliamentary Secretary, at least by his successor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder did anyone ever say a good word for the Office of Public Works?  It seldom, if ever, happens.  One chairman of the Board of Works said to me on one occasion: &ldquo;We are the `skivvies' for every Department and Government&rdquo;. To listen to the previous speaker, one would imagine that they were responsible for moving part of Kerry into another part.  I have very little to say on this Estimate but it is necessary that I should say a few things.</P>
      <P>In regard to arterial drainage, you never find trouble in a scheme until it is being wound up.  Then, engineers, knowing the things they do, find that for a small expense they could cut out or add in a small portion which would do a lot of good.  So far as the officials of the Office of Public Works are concerned in regard to arterial drainage, I think the work they are doing is a credit to them.  It is work which the people in the rural areas never expected to see done.  The only fault is that it is rather slow.  At the moment only the Brosna, the Glyde and Dee and one scheme in Kerry have been completed and one might say the Corrib is nearly completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are only two large schemes, the Moy and the Kerry No. 2 scheme. Those works that are finished are excellent but much needs to be done in my area.  There were many small portions in the scheme which were taken out.  Of course, the Board of Works is legally entitled to do that, but with a small effort and very little expense, additional work of great benefit could be done.  In the Dunmore area the extension of operations would not cost much money.  I have made several appeals to the Office about it but apparently the engineers think otherwise.  It would give back roughly 50 or 60 acres of land to very small tenants in the area and the expenditure would not run into more than £400 or £500.  That was in the original scheme.  I am not saying it was cut out deliberately for political reasons or anything like that because <Col N="106" /> I know the Board of Works never consider things of that description.  Anyway, over the past two years, the people there and I have been appealing to have something done for this area.</P>
    <P>Again, right beside this area, there is a huge lake, the Glenamaddy lake, which was originally in the scheme. I put down a few questions in that regard and Deputies of the then North Galway constituency, Deputy Killilea and I, met the people&mdash;Deputy Kitt did not turn up at the meetings&mdash;and discussed this problem.  About two years ago, the Office of Public Works put machinery in there where there was a huge swallow-hole which was taking the water.  The result was that this huge lake that used to dry up every summer has not dried up at all for the past two summers.  In fact, it is more flooded, even in the height of summer than ever it was in the winter.  I asked a few questions about it, although I am not one who likes putting down questions because I know one does not get any information from the Department concerned. However, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to be good enough to get his officials to look after it and at least let us have a decision as to whether the work will or will not be carried out.</P>
    <P>There are also in the Glenamaddy area a number of lakes about which investigations are going on for the past four or five years and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into these matters.  It is when you are finishing up in an area that you come across those difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago, the people around Moylough and Belclare approached me about a huge lake at Moylough.  The Corrib catchment area went within 400 or 500 yards of where <Col N="107" /> 200 acres of land could be dried.  They were asked just to go the other 400 or 500 yards that would completely relieve this lake.  The answer was that the Moylough lake was in the Suck catchment area.  The same applied to certain lakes down in Williamstown and that part of the country.  I made representations but to no effect.  I cannot understand why a small area like that cannot be brought in when it would be of such advantage to all concerned.  I fully realise that if that were to be pursued too far, the whole country would be in one catchment but when a scheme comes within 400 or 500 yards of an area where huge tracts of land could be relieved, the Parliamentary Secretary should ask the Office to overlook the Order under which they are operating.</P>
      <P>I was on a deputation with other Deputies from Galway in relation to the Corrib-Mask drainage scheme.  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows well, that was previously a part of the Corrib drainage scheme.  For some reason or other which I will not go into now&mdash;I went into it well enough in the area&mdash;it was not kept in that scheme, which included such places as Belclare, Shrule and Headford.  There are no people in Ireland who suffer as much as they do from flooding.  When we went to the Parliamentary Secretary some nine months ago, he told us he would have a survey carried out in 1961.  I am sure he is as good as his word but it is no harm for me to remind him of the fact and to ask him to ensure that that survey will be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Rydell report, the Suck scheme cannot be carried out until the Shannon is done because it would flood the Shannon.  I put down a question to the Parliamentary Secretary some time ago in relation to the Brosna scheme, as well as the Glyde and Dee and the Feale in Kerry.  I inquired what extra flooding the Brosna had caused on the Shannon. The answer was that it did not cause any extra flooding.  What is the use therefore in waiting for this Rydell report to be examined?  If the Brosna did not cause any extra flooding on the <Col N="108" /> Shannon, the Suck will not cause any, either.</P>
    <P>Does the drainage of the Clare-Corrib cause any further flooding of the River Corrib?  Not at all; in fact, there is no flooding there at all now. The Suck catchment area takes in a large part of my constituency.  The previous Parliamentary Secretary had an interest in that and so had his predecessor.  I would ask the present Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;a man as good as any of us&mdash;to look into that matter and to realise, regardless of reports or anything else, that extra flooding will not be caused.  He told me himself, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, that the drainage of the Brosna caused no extra flooding on the Shannon.  Then why should the drainage of the Suck do so?</P>
    <P>I heard some Deputies complaining that the cost of maintaining drainage schemes was too great a burden on the rates and that some other method should be found.  If these people had been approached at the time it was decided to carry out these schemes, would they have said: &ldquo;Do not carry them out because of the cost to the rates of maintenance&rdquo;?  They certainly would not.  The Office of Public Works are spending £3 million or £4 million on schemes which will do a lot of good for this county.  The people of the county should realise they are in a privileged position in having that work done for them.  The least gratitude they should show is to pay for the maintenance of the schemes.  Of course, you meet some people who want their bread buttered on both sides.</P>
    <P>I have one serious complaint.  It concerns a bog at Derryglassaun, Meanlough, Ballinasloe.  I approached the engineer in charge about it and he sent one of his engineers to inspect it on two or three occasions.  Some time last year, in connection with the drainage of the Corrib catchment, the Office of Public Works had to cut a huge drain, in length about 600 yards, right through the end of that bog. People cut turf in that area.  The result this year is that they could not get in a turf cutting machine because the Office of Public Works destroyed <Col N="109" /> the right of way and have refused to have it replaced.</P>
    <P>I have here a letter in connection with the matter signed by about 20 people: Tim Devaney, Meanlough; Tom Madden, Grallagh; John Kilgannon, Derryglassaun; Paddy Laheen, Meanlough Road; James Kelly, Meanlough; Peter Kelly, Meanlough; Pat Ruane, Meanlough; Joseph Kelly, Meanlough; Martin Potter, Meanloughbeg; Tommy Laheen, Grallagh; and Delia Kane, Derryglassaun.  I am sorry Deputy Kitt is not here.  He lives in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know. They never voted for him, apparently. It is a scandal that the Board of Works should cut this drain and prevent the people from getting in to cut their turf. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that matter as well.</P>
      <P>In regard to school buildings, I see Deputy Kitt made a statement about all the additional schools being built. I know that, as far as the building of schools is concerned, the Office of Public Works have not got an easy task.  We hear Deputy Kitt bleating about all the extra schools being built in Galway.  Yet when the Archbishop of Tuam came to my parish, Dunmore, he was worried about a school the Office had closed up.  I would prefer to take the word of the Archbishop on that than the word of Deputy Kitt.  But I am not blaming the Board of Works for that, either.</P>
      <P>I have referred to arterial drainage in Galway.  There are other areas in south and east Galway which had a high priority at one time, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look after them as soon as he possibly can. He is a man of rural Ireland who knows rural Ireland and in his Office he has a good staff who work loyally and honestly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first came into the Dáil over four years ago, I pleaded very strongly with the Board of Works and the Parliamentary Secretary to start arterial drainage work in County Cork.  It is a very <Col N="110" /> large county.  We have some good land there which is flooded every year. In my memory, these rivers which cause the flooding have never been cleaned.  A deputation was appointed from the county council to travel to Dublin to make representations on the matter but while some surveys have been carried out in the county, so far, I cannot see that any machinery has been put working to clean these rivers which are so badly in need of cleaning.  I can see thousands of acres of valuable land going to waste in my own constituency in particular but also in other areas.  In South Cork also, these rivers overflow their banks and swamp thousands of acres of what could otherwise be first-class arable land.</P>
      <P>Whatever work is undertaken in this country, be it the setting up of industries or the buildings of schools, the land is the foundation of our whole economy.  The more money we put into the development and protection of our land, the better for our economy. I should like to impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary the importance and the urgent necessity of putting this machinery to work on the rivers of Cork county without any further delay.</P>
      <P>That is work which would be of tremendous value for generations to come.  It would be putting money to a very useful purpose which would benefit the country in many ways, give employment, put the land into production and help to increase our exports of agricultural produce.  I sincerely hope there will be no further delay in getting that work undertaken in the county, and, in particular, in my own constituency of West Cork.  Two rivers have been surveyed there but that is as far as the Board of Works have gone.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to say that the machinery will be put in there forthwith, that the rivers will be cleaned, so that there will be no further flooding in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very important and necessary work in my constituency is the improvement of the small piers around the coast, and in particular in the islands off the coast.  I was on Bere Island some weeks ago.  The inhabitants <Col N="111" /> of that island must derive their living mainly from the fishing industry, and the landing facilities on that pier are certainly very poor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary. It would arise relevantly on the Estimate for Fisheries.  A decision to improve the pier on the island in question does not lie with the Parliamentary Secretary, but with the Minister in charge of Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; we will have another opportunity of dealing with it and I shall leave it.  Castletownbere Harbour is to be reconstructed, possibly in the near future&mdash; how near I do not know.  Again, I sincerely hope that work will not be too long delayed.  The people in that area also derive their living largely from the sea and the reconstruction of the pier there is an absolute necessity. There is a notice board on the pier prohibiting the people from, and warning them of the danger of, going on to that pier, but the people must go on to it, so that the reconstruction of the pier in Castletownbere is again a matter of urgent necessity.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to have that work expedited as much as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building of schools is a very important matter which is proceeding reasonably well at the moment.  All the new schools being built should have the modern facility of running water. We are advocating the installation of running water in the homes, but it is also an essential which should be provided in the schools.  I know that schools were built in recent years in which running water was not provided. Certainly that is wrong and it is a bad example.  I impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary the importance of <Col N="112" /> running water in any school.  In future, no school should be built without running water and flush lavatories.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will pay heed to the three major points I have put forward: drainage, Castletownbere pier and the provision of running water in schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking generally, I think nearly everyone will welcome the proposal to provide what cannot be described as further amenities, but proper and adequate amenities, for this House.  Of all the various Parliament buildings I have visited, I think I can say without any great fear of contradiction that this must be the worst.  I am glad the decision has been taken to extend it and to keep Parliament in this traditional centre.</P>
      <P>I notice under Subhead B of this Vote that a figure of something over £1,000,000 is provided for the erection of new premises for the Social Welfare Department at Haddington Road.  I do not know what motive was at work when Haddington Road was selected. Why Dublin city at all?  I can quite appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary, or indeed the Minister for Finance, might not be responsible for the decision in regard to location, but I do think that an example might have been taken from our counterpart across the sea.  The principal offices of the Department of Social Welfare in Great Britain are situated in Newcastle-on-Tyne. On the very vexed question of decentralisation, this is certainly one point on which decentralisation could be considered with advantage and without any inconvenience to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the building and selection of sites for national schools, I have, at various times both on this Estimate and on the Estimate for the Department of Education, complained about the size of the sites selected as being inadequate to include, if not playing fields, certainly playing grounds of a size that would make them attractive to the pupils during play-hour and a centre for the village or the school area during leisure hours.  I am often appalled by the selection of sites for national schools in close proximity <Col N="113" /> to main roads and busy thoroughfares. Only recently at a point somewhere between Dunshaughlin and Navan &mdash;an extremely busy and dangerous road&mdash;I saw a new national school being erected.  It is quite a small school, but I was horrified to notice that it is right beside the main road, a road with heavy traffic and very dangerous for children, because being children, they always do the unpredictable, and thereby incur danger.  Children should not be placed in a position in which they can incur danger by reason of the selection of school sites on main thoroughfares.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that in the new Garda stations, as well as in the national schools to which I have referred, there will be running water and sanitation of the most modern kind.  Deputy Wycherley has dealt with that matter very adequately, adequately enough, I think, to bring it to the notice of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>It is pleasant to see that a number of new post offices will be built and presumably they will be adequate to deal with the business that offers.  The only major work in my constituency relates to social welfare.  A new employment exchange is being built at Achill.  It is interesting to note that the only method of relieving unemployment in an area which used to carry such a very high population up to the past four or five years is the building of a new employment exchange.</P>
    <P>On the question of drainage, all too frequently&mdash;I am sure this is the experience of every Deputy&mdash;we receive from the Office of Public Works a letter of regret with regard to representations made about certain streams, which do not fall within a catchment area but which are of such magnitude as to be outside ordinary drainage schemes contemplated in the small Vote provided.  I do not think this Vote should be so small.  In view of the turn things are taking in constituencies like mine and that of the Parliamentary Secretary, it is extremely important that this Vote should be greatly increased to <Col N="114" /> help small farmers to drain streams that adversely affect their lands.  All too often, in the course of these regrets, the last sentence invariably reads: &ldquo;This work is not of the kind that is within the scope of the works contemplated by this Office.&rdquo;  That is not the fault of the Office, of course; it is the fault of the people who plan the expenditure of the money.  I think it is high time the drainage of these streams and rivers was given greater consideration.  That kind of relief would help to stay the rush away from these small holdings which, while it is largely dictated by economic reasons, is also largely due to the absence of amenities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point to which I should like to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention is to the drainage of the Black River from Shrule to the Corrib.  That belt of country is very highly rated.  The people have very small holdings and every perch of land counts.  It appears that the Office of Public Works drained portion of the river from the Corrib to within about 40 perches of Ower Bridge.  From that point up to Flynn's Bridge has not been done at all.  Further up, from Flynn's Bridge to Shrule, drainage work is being carried out by the respective boards of the Galway and Mayo County Councils.  It seems a rather extraordinary anomaly to have the Board of Works draining portion of the river to a certain point, then a stretch of river left untouched, and beyond that the drainage boards of the Mayo and Galway County Councils carrying out work further up.  The undrained stretch is actually a dam between the two points.  The distance is not very great but the people of three or four villages are vitally concerned.  In the villages of Rosstaff and Ower, and another village further downstream, the people are very highly rated.  In winter, they lose the benefit of many acres of land because of flooding by this stretch of river.  Drainage work on this stretch would be of inestimable value to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the matter to see if anything can be done to relieve flooding <Col N="115" /> in this area in winter time and, if it can, I would ask him to carry out the work as quickly as possible.  I have a letter from the Parliamentary Secretary stating that the river between these two points is not part of any drainage district.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make it part of some drainage district.  The necessary machinery is there at both sides, some owned by the Mayo and Galway County Councils and some by the Office of Public Works.  It is a pity that this machinery is not used to complete the drainage of the entire river and relieve flooding in this locality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general trend of the debate does not, I think, call for a great deal of comment or further elucidation from me.  Deputies are very often inclined to refer to parochial problems on this Estimate rather than to the general policy of the Office of Public Works.  The expanding activities of the Office of Public Works may not always be fully appreciated. Deputies suggest quite glibly that we should expedite this, that and the other work, and it is perfectly obvious that they have not got a proper insight into the working of the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The expansion in arterial drainage alone has reached such a stage that it could keep the whole of the Office of Public Works, as constituted 15 or 20 years ago, fully occupied.  Major harbour works have created an extra problem requiring extra staff.  The anxiety of the Department of Justice to proceed more rapidly with the construction, repair and improvement of barracks has created a problem which has necessitated increasing activity, increasing staff, and greater attention from the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most inaccurate and contradictory statement made during the debate was that made by Deputy Dillon&mdash;he may not have made it seriously&mdash;that the Office of Public Works was an office to which the other Departments gave money and then instructed the office not to spend it.  The very opposite is true.  We have been persistently pressed by every Department of State <Col N="116" /> to produce results in this, that or the other project.  We are moving as fast as the facilities and personnel at our disposal permit.  The Minister for Lands wants harbours built hurriedly; the Minister for Justice wants barracks built without delay; the Minister for Education wants school building expedited generally; the Minister for Agriculture has schools and institutions which, in the light of the expanding activity in that Department, require immediate attention.  The pressure comes from every angle.  I do not think the Opposition are serious when they suggest that the Office of Public Works is given money by a Department and asked not to spend it.  I wish we could spend it and carry on the work as rapidly as the various Departments would like us to do.</P>
    <P>School building is one of the major sections in the Office of Public Works. It is one sphere of activity which comes in for most comment by Deputies&mdash; second only to arterial drainage.  I should like to say something with regard to school building in general before I deal with any points raised by Deputies in connection with that matter.  I do not think the position in the school building section is always appreciated.  When one visualises that action is demanded on anything up to 300, 400 and 500 schools at a time, one can appreciate how difficult it is to give priority to all the people who make demands. &ldquo;Under active consideration&rdquo; is a very well-known phrase which is often repeated, sometimes in derision. In the school building section, there are at least 200 jobs under consideration, whether they are new schools in various courses of planning, major repairs or minor repairs.  Against that background, practically every day I meet some school manager or Deputy asking that his school be given priority.</P>
    <P>Everyone can make a good case to show that it is an urgent matter. Recently the Office decided that if we were to keep putting the priority for a particular job aside and take out another one and give it priority the next day, the result would be a complete upsetting of the entire programme. There could be nothing but <Col N="117" /> chaos.  I was surprised that such good results were coming in recent years from the Office, in view of the fact that they were trying to meet the demands of everybody who could make a good case for priority.  It was eventually decided to have reorganisation.  The matter was examined by experts and it was decided that there would have to be a queue and that the Office could not possibly work with any expedition, unless there was a priority list and that all applications should take their place in a queue with as little upset as possible.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies outlined cases where one might have to give priority.  You cannot stick rigidly to the applications just as they come in.  You could even have the case of a school roof collapsing. Somebody pointed out that there was a factory built in an area which urgently required extension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are matters in respect of which one would be justified in changing the priority but in so far as it is possible and in the interests of more orderly progress in the school building section, I am hoping&mdash; without committing myself to figures&mdash; to see marked progress this year.  In the interests of that orderly progress, we refuse to take schools indiscriminately out of the priority list and put them at the top.  I think that, when the matter is explained, all concerned will agree that if we are to avoid complete chaos, that is the best direction in which to move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am dealing with the question of schools, I should like to deal with some of the points made.  Deputy Dillon made a suggestion that has been made occasionally.  In fact, I think, I made it myself on one occasion when speaking on the Estimate.  The suggestion was that we should rather build a parish school and bring the children in from all around by transport and leave them back again in the evening. Naturally, that decision would be one for the Minister for Education.  It is a decision that has been considered more than once so far as I know but I do <Col N="118" /> not think it was anything other than the necessary amalgamation of schools where the average had dropped.  It has never really been tried.</P>
    <P>There are many points to be considered and the managers of the various schools concerned are usually the best judges.  Deputy Dillon suggested that a manager be appointed who would be prepared to give the scheme a trial.  By and large, at the moment, the type of school being built is satisfactory.  It is reasonably convenient for all the pupils who attend and the small school sometimes can be a very homely institution where the children feel comfortable and where they get a good deal of personal attention.</P>
    <P>No one really raised any serious point with regard to the standard of these schools.  In the past, the allegation was sometimes made that these two-room or three-room schools were too elaborate but on the other hand, some people said that they were not sufficiently elaborate.  We always felt that we had struck an optimum to meet the reasonable demands of everybody concerned.  The notable thing today is that everybody is clamouring for better sanitary conditions, the installation of water and better sanitary arrangements in schools generally.</P>
    <P>I think that is a tremendous thing because it is an indication of the great upsurge in the standard of living which has occurred in this country in recent years.  Not many years ago, people were quite prepared to accept what would now be considered primitive sanitary arrangements in schools. We have suddenly come to agree and clamour for an immediate change in these facilities.  I should like to point out that the Office of Public Works have been pressing for the installation of water in schools for years past. Certainly every new school built today is provided with the most modern sanitary facilities.  Like the Minister for Education when speaking on his Estimate, I, too, hope that we will very shortly have reached the stage of which we can say that the most modern sanitary facilities have been <Col N="119" /> installed in every school in the country.</P>
    <P>Arterial drainage did not meet with much adverse criticism except from the first speaker who, admittedly, told us that he was expressing a personal opinion and who has a very poor opinion of arterial drainage because, he said, he was not quite sure whether it was a matter of development or merely of employment for vote-catching purposes.</P>
    <P>Any man interested in the development of the land of this country must by now have realised that drainage of any sort is an indispensable factor in land improvement generally and that arterial drainage is the most efficient type known.  Arterial drainage in this country was not brought about as a result of any hurried, careless or loose thinking or arrangement.  It was the result of years of study and research, having regard to the best opinions available and after examination of alternative work in other countries.  The legislation which set up the machinery to carry on this work was debated at great length in this House in 1945.  It was then decided that maintenance would be a county at large charge on the local rate.  In the debate on the Estimate each year Deputies complain that it is not fair that the cost of drainage should be a charge on the rates.  In the debates on the Bill in 1945 one finds alternative suggestions, some that the Exchequer should bear the maintenance cost after completion of a scheme, others that the immediate beneficiaries, the people whose lands were immediately affected, should be charged accordingly.  Both these proposals were turned down and I would say rightly so.</P>
    <P>In the first place, it is not easy by any means to assess the improvement in the value of the land affected by a particular scheme and it would be difficult fairly to assess the proportion the owner would have to pay for that relief or improvement.  Secondly, if the charge were made a Central Fund charge, there would be a tendency to apply indiscriminately for drainage work without consideration of the outcome or the ultimate cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> When maintenance is a charge on the local rate it tends to ensure that only works of the greatest importance are undertaken.  The local authority and the people concerned, realising that they will bear the maintenance charge on the local rate, will ensure that the job is worthwhile and that proposals for arterial drainage will not be submitted and pressed by people who would be reckless in regard to future costs.  It is an essential brake on irresponsible applications for drainage. The county at large charge is as fair as any other charge.  People may argue that a person is paying for something from which he is deriving no benefit. That could be said of every tax paid in any respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's reference to arterial drainage in this debate differed somewhat from his last year's contribution. He suggested that main arteries should be dealt with without dealing with the catchment as a whole.  We frequently give the answer when somebody asks us to drain a river, tributary or part of a catchment, that we do not undertake drainage of any part of the catchment until the catchment as a whole is treated.  When Deputy Dillon suggested doing the main artery from the outfall upstream, that is quite impossible and I do not see that there would be any point in doing it.  It would only mean that the catchment was not dealt with at all, only the outfall relieved, and the machinery would have to be brought back at some future stage and the whole question of compensation and exhibition of the scheme would have to be dealt with all over again.  It would be pretty well impossible except that it would do a certain amount of work which, at least, would cause no further harm.</P>
    <P>The type of job which I meet most frequently and for which Deputies come to the office with appeals is to have part of the catchment done without treating the outfall at all.  In most cases the outfall of a catchment is not the worst part of it.  The important thing is the relief which can be given to the tributaries and the tributaries of tributaries throughout a hugh area, sometimes involving, as in <Col N="121" /> the case of the Boyne catchment, the Six Counties.  It is the fact that it enables drainage to be carried out on the smaller tributaries, which are causing the most damage, that the main outfall has to be tackled at all.  To do the main outfall and the other work, for which in my experience there is the greatest demand, would not be to deal with the problem in a methodical manner.  The provisions of the 1945 Act do not permit that type of thing, anyhow.</P>
    <P>I should refer to one of Deputy Lynch's annual complaints here, that is, that the South East coast is, for some reason known only to himself, being neglected by the Office of Public Works.  That is not true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  If one takes the expenditure of the Office over the year in routine matters, repair, Government buildings, general repair and up-keep, the money is necessarily spread as evenly over the country as is required without reference to area. That is the only thing which dictates distribution of money.  In the matter of schools, barracks and other matters to which the Office attends in the ordinary course of routine work, that part of the country to which Deputy Lynch refers gets its just and equitable share and in matters of expenditure in other directions it is not forgotten either.  Deputy Lynch does not live too far from Rosslare Strand where a considerable amount of money has been spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No allocation is made to any one harbour as such.  If Deputies examine the Estimates they will see that a bulk sum is to be spent in connection with major harbour development. I think the figure is about £100,000 in the coming year.  I mentioned it in my opening speech.  I have given the Deputy pretty definite and accurate replies and I am trying to explain that his annual complaint that nothing is being done for South-East Ireland is completely inaccurate and untrue.  I think what the Deputy has in mind is that arterial drainage has not been applied to County Waterford as yet.  He might consider it fortunate that nature has so ordained that Waterford is not suffering as seriously as other counties such as Kerry and Galway, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal, as a result of flooding.</P>
      <P>I was particularly interested in the Deputy's statement that good land should be drained first.  There is much to be said for that but sometimes a job in one small area would cater for three times or even 10 times the number of residents in a large area.  When one is trying to ensure the greatest good for the largest number of human beings, that is also a big consideration.</P>

      <P>If there were any other points raised by Deputies to which I should refer, I shall try to deal with them now, but I think I have dealt with most of them in my general summing up.  Galway Deputies referred to purely local problems and Deputy Lynch suggests that Galway is not the worst-off county in regard to attention <Col N="124" /> from the Office of Public Works particularly on arterial drainage.  Arterial drainage had to begin somewhere and it is a tribute to the work that where the office does carry out a job it is from that area that the greatest demand comes for further work, indicating that the people see the great benefit brought about as a result.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde complained that there was no drainage in Wexford. That means that either he is not looking around his constituency or else that he is oblivious of the good work being done there.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies referred to the building at Haddington Road.  I am sure they know that the Department of Social Welfare could not go on indefinitely occupying a building originally provided for C.I.E. and which C.I.E. require so badly.  In fact there was need for building in any event as C.I.E. was being so severely handicapped for space.  The necessity to centralise its activities was perfectly obvious to everybody.  The Government took the decision that the Department of Social Welfare should have a new office building and the Department of Health also, as well as the Stationery Office, at Haddington Road.  There is a site available to the Government at Beggar's Bush and I think it is an excellent site in so far as it is in an area not congested by traffic and well provided for in respect of parking space and of easy access from all parts of the city.  It is an excellent position for the building and I hope it will be a building that will do credit both to the country and to the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>I believe we have passed the stage where propaganda used be made about erecting what were described as elaborate and unnecessarily palatial buildings. If we had not places like the Customs House, the G.P.O. and other such buildings to show to our visitors we would have nothing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we came to consider erecting decent buildings ourselves, there was a tendency to make propaganda about squandermania. I think that has completely gone now and, judging from the trend of the debates here recently, it is obvious that everybody is agreed that when we build we should provide decent buildings which will be a credit to ourselves, to the Government, to the country and to the Office of Public Works.  These buildings need not be unnecessarily expensive.  The actual instructions that the Office of Public Works gets are to provide the requirements in a suitable manner.  No frills are sought but architecture demands a certain dignity and it is certainly the showpiece of any country's progress and development.  I believe we can count on getting that.  Deputy Dillon was rather subtle in the way he tried to represent the Government as having eased off a building programme to go in for what he described as development which is productive development. He set out by saying he read something recently somewhere, and did not say where he read it, which said the Government were right to have gone off house building and building construction to invest money in productive development.  There was of course no such decision to go off building.  Somebody may have written an article somewhere but I have not seen it.  We regard building as an essential part of the Government programme. In fact at one time, we were accused of building too much.  Deputy Dillon's insinuation was that houses for the poor and hospitals must come before all other buildings.  We have done pretty well in that regard but we must bring up the whole economy at the same time.  You cannot be lopsided in any particular type of building. Institutions and agricultural schools such as those at Clonakilty and Athenry, and the repairs to such places, are just as essential to the poor people, and more so, because it permits their economy to expand and thereby gives a better living to those who reside in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have at the moment an excellent building programme which is directly associated with productive <Col N="126" /> development.  In fact, the entire activities of the Office of Public Works reflect in the greatest degree the expansion of activities in all other Departments.  That accelerated programme and expansion of activities is more obvious in the Estimates before us than at any other time.  Deputy Palmer said that my introductory statement was like a statement at a chapel gate.  I do not quite see the point because we do not set out to talk about what we have done, and we could talk a lot about that, but we are dealing with the Estimate for the coming year which sets out what we are going to do.</P>
    <P>If you look back over previous Estimates, you will see that the tangible results are pretty noteworthy. If we can succeed in getting the necessary technical personnel which is indispensable to the huge programme before us, I believe the Estimate next year will be even more interesting.  I have no doubt the Office is capable of rising to the great heights to which it must rise in order to cope with the continuing expansion of activity in all other directions.  It is quite wrong to say&mdash;in fact, the opposite is true&mdash;that any brake is being applied by any Department.  I want to emphasise that again.  The one thing which nettled me in the debate was when I heard Deputies say that various Departments give the Office of Public Works money and then tell them not to spend it.  The direct opposite is true.</P>
    <P>If I feel guilty of anything when I meet the Government, it is that I am not in a position to show sufficient progress and if we are not moving as fast as we would like to, it is because we have not got the necessary technical personnel at the moment.  We are trying to recruit them and we have only the nucleus of a section to deal with major harbours and the same applies to barrack reconstruction. Each competition held shows better results and in that regard I should like to point out that it has frequently happened that when we have competitions for architects and engineers, we get them coming back from abroad, sometimes from as far away as <Col N="127" /> Canada.  We hope we will shortly have the necessary staff, particularly to deal with those three sections which definitely require additional staff, arterial drainage, with the added intermediate drainage, major harbour development and the work to which I have made no reference yet and to which, in conclusion, I want to refer, coast erosion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wycherley said that the Office of Public Works should deal with this and that and get on quickly, just as if a wand had only to be waved.  The one thing which has prevented us is that we cannot possibly see any means of having another completely new section to deal with this huge national problem of coast erosion.  Some definite measure of agreement has now been reached and proposals for legislation are being considered. I hope they will not be too long delayed but it will involve a very big undertaking.  Since I went to the Office of Public Works, the Government have discussed this with me several times.  It was only because we had not got the necessary personnel to deal with it that the introduction of suitable legislation was delayed.  I hope it will emerge shortly and that the problem of erosion will be tackled in the same enthusiastic manner as arterial drainage has been tackled.</P>
    <P>I do not think I should say much more, as the debate does not call for further elucidation.  There are many points I did not touch on.  There were some points about which I thought Deputies might have made a lot but they did not.  Recently there was a controversy about a plaque that was erected on the G.P.O.  It caused a good deal of controversy among people who like to write letters to newspapers.  I want to say that the Board of Works placed the work in the hands of competent artists and a competent sculptor. Nothing was done without the due consideration which is given to such work by the Office.  The actual wording on the plaque was arranged by the Office of the Taoiseach and examined by some very eminent Irish scholars. It was known before it was executed <Col N="128" /> that there might be controversy about it.</P>
    <P>At the time, I asked the sculptor, through the principal architect in the Office, when complaints were made regarding the format of the plaque and the subdivided words and when criticism was levelled at the general execution of the plaque, if due consideration had really been given to it in every respect.  He produced such things as I have before me now.  One of these is a photograph of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington which is held to be one of the most famous pieces there are in that type of sculpture. It will be seen from that that there are at least six subdivided words.</P>
    <P>Some of the famous plaques in Rome which I also saw photographed are the same.  In fact the lettering on our plaque was even nicer.  Sometimes people criticise these things without having any criterion in mind, without making comparisons with what are readily accepted as top-rate work. When it comes to the question of criticising the literary side of it, I suppose it gives an outlet to people who like that kind of controversy.  It sometimes gives them an opportunity, either to be helpful or merely to show that they detected something that someone else might not detect.  To paraphrase the closing lines of the &ldquo;Deserted Village&rdquo;: &ldquo;They still had hopes for pride attends them still; among the swains to show their book-learned skill.&rdquo;  People who may have motives of that kind got an opportunity in this case but, by and large, this work has been accepted by fair-minded people as being what it is supposed to be, a dignified and artistically executed work.</P>
    <P>I merely wish to point out now that we are always grateful for co-operation. Sometimes we must write letters that are not the type we should like to get.  A huge number of jobs require to be done, all needing to be carried out at the same time.  If Deputies would only advise their constituents that it is not possible for all these works to be done at the same time, a great deal of disappointment would be avoided. The heads of our Offices meet Deputies courteously and deal with <Col N="129" /> them very efficiently.  Their pleadings are never ignored when they have a good case.  The Office does not always get due praise for the efficiency of their staff or for the careful manner in which they look after property.  They are very often the butt of a great deal of unnecessary and possibly ill-meant derision.  The officers' responsibility is to give tangible expression to the efforts of the other Departments.  With a comparatively small staff, they carry out that work in a very effective and efficient manner.</P>

      <P>The Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes makes provision for the annual programme of employment schemes to give work to men in receipt of unemployment assistance in both urban and rural areas, including towns with a population of 200 and over, and for other services not directly concerned with U.A. recipients, such as bog development schemes, rural improvements schemes and miscellaneous schemes, including minor marine works and archaeological excavations.  Provision is also made in the Vote for the salaries, travelling and other incidental expenses of the staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office, who are responsible for the administration of the Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last year in my introductory statement, it has been the practice for a number of years in dealing with this Vote to give a résumé of the work done in the preceding financial year.  The Estimate figures for 1961/62 are, as Deputies will see from page 48 of the Estimates Volume, for all practical purposes the same as 1960/61, so I propose to do the same this year, which in fact, should give a very clear idea of what it is proposed to do with this year's money.  The gross estimate last year was £861,080.  In addition, there was, however, a sum of £16,728&mdash;being the unexpended balances of previous years' allocations from the National Development Fund &mdash;available for expenditure, bringing the gross total to £877,808.  The expenditure in the year just closed is estimated <Col N="131" /> at £853,865, which is 97% of the gross provision.  Last year, I estimated the 1959/60 expenditure at £859,120&mdash;98% of the available money. The actual audited figure amounted that year to £852,104, which was 97% of available money.  I hope my expenditure estimate for 1960/61 will be equally accurate.</P>
    <P>To give a comparative picture of the operations of the Special Employment Schemes Office in recent years, I have made available to Deputies a tabular statement giving particulars of the expenditure under the various subheads of the Vote for the four years 1956/57, 1957/58, 1958/59 and 1959/60, the estimated expenditure for 1960/61, as well as the provision proposed for these services for 1961/62.  These figures include payments from the National Development Fund in addition to the Vote up to 1960/61.  Deputies will recall that in my introductory statement last year I said that I had a balance of about £16,000 then left in the National Development Fund to meet charges against the Urban Employment Schemes Subhead.  The provision in the Vote last year was £227,000 but I am anticipating an expenditure of almost £246,250 on these schemes, which will wipe out all the balances of the National Development Fund in so far as the Special Employment Schemes Office is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see that in common with other Government Departments the format of the Estimate at page 48 has been somewhat simplified as compared with preceding years.  In previous years, travelling expenses, incidental expenses, and telegrams, telephones and postage, were shown in three separate subheads, making a total of ten subheads of expenditure.  This year, the three items are bulked together under one subhead, described as &ldquo;travelling and incidental expenses&rdquo; reducing the expenditure subheads from ten to eight.  The details of the incidental expenses will be found at page 49 of the Estimates Volume.  The Appropriations-in-Aid (or receipts) subhead is, of course, still continued.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with salaries, travelling <Col N="132" /> and incidental expenses, I propose to make some general comments on the unemployment figures.  Grants for Urban, Rural and Minor Employment Schemes are related to the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each area.  A census is taken annually by the Special Employment Schemes Office in the third week of January of the number of these men, as well as the number of men in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit, in each of the 60 urban areas, the 477 non-urbanised towns with a population of 200 and over, and the 2,874 rural electoral divisions in the country.  This particular week is selected as it approximates the peak period of unemployment, by which date, it is anticipated, persons who have received only seasonal work around the Christmas period have returned to the Unemployment Register.  This census includes, in addition to the men drawing unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance benefit, any men who formerly drew these payments but who were working on schemes financed by the Special Employment Schemes Office during that particular week.</P>
    <P>The January, 1961, census gives a total of 24,704 men in receipt of unemployment assistance compared with 30,521 in 1960&mdash;a reduction of 19 per cent.  The reduction was greatest in town areas, the figures for urban areas being 6,712 in 1961 compared with 9,357 in 1960&mdash;a reduction of 28¼ per cent.  For towns with a population of 200 and over, the figures were 1,000 in 1961, and 1,418 in 1960, a reduction of 29.5 per cent.  The rural areas figures were 16,992 in 1961 and 19,746 in 1960, a reduction of 14 per cent., which should be compared with the over-all reduction figure of 19 per cent. Comparing 1961 with 1957, the over-all U.A. figures were 35,116 in 1957 compared with 24,704 in 1961, a reduction of 29½ per cent.  The percentage reductions were 38 per cent for urban areas, 14.3 per cent. for towns with a population of 200 and over and 26.5 per cent. for rural areas.</P>
    <P>The figures I have just given relate only to men in receipt of unemployment <Col N="133" /> assistance.  Including men in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit in addition to U.A. men, the combined figures were 55,439 in 1961, 66,363 in 1960, 74,929 in 1959, 76,962 in 1958 and 84,098 in 1957. Comparing 1961 with 1960, the reduction in U.A. and U.I.B. combined was 16.5 per cent., compared with the 19 per cent. reduction for U.A. alone. The reduction was greatest in the town areas also, the figures being 22 per cent. in urban areas, 19.4 per cent. for towns with a population of 200 and over and 13.1 per cent for rural areas, against the over-all figure of 16.5 per cent.  Comparing 1961 with 1957, the reduction in U.A. and U.I.B. combined was 34.1 per cent. against 29½ per cent for U.A. alone, and the reduction again was greatest in urban areas, the figures being 44 per cent. for urban areas, 26½ per cent. for towns with a population of 200 and over and 28.6 per cent. for rural areas, against the over-all reduction of 34.1 per cent.  It will be seen, therefore, that although there is no reduction in the provision for this Vote, the U.A. figures are down by 19 per cent. compared with last year and 29½ per cent. compared with 1957, and the combined U.A. and U.I.B. figures are down by 16.5 per cent. compared with last year and 34.1 per cent. compared with 1957.</P>
    <P>The number of registered men employed on works financed by the Vote in the census week ended the 21st January, 1961 was 2,563, of whom 1,947 were formerly in receipt of unemployment assistance and 616 were persons formerly in receipt of unemployment benefit.  The corresponding figures for the census week in January, 1960 was 2,498&mdash;1,942 U.A. and 556 U.I.B.  As Deputies are aware, the bulk of the employment given under this Vote is in the winter period and the number employed varies considerably during the different seasons of the year.  The peak period in the last financial year was week ended the 17th December, 1960, when 5,306 men were employed&mdash;873 in urban areas, 542 in towns with a population of 200 and over and 3,891 in rural areas. The lowest number was during the week ended 24th September, 1960, <Col N="134" /> when only 640 men were employed, of whom 132 were in urban areas and 508 in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Subheads A and B provide for salaries, travelling and office expenses of the Special Employment Schemes Office.  There is, as will be seen from the Estimates Volume, a small decrease in the number of the staff.  The expenditure last year was something more than £76,440.  The figure of £78,600 in the Estimate will provide for the normal increments as the staff become a year older.  The small increase in Subhead B is due to a revision in the scale of subsistence allowances as well as payments to certain outdoor officers for the use of part of their private residences for office work.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Subhead C: Urban Employment Schemes</i> provide for works in the four County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and the 55 other urban districts.  The grants are administered through the Department of Local Government and are conditional on the local authorities submitting suitable work schemes for approval by the Special Employment Schemes Office and making contributions towards their cost.  The local contributions vary in the different urban areas. It is 20 per cent in the case of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, i.e., one-fifth; it is one-sixth (16.7 per cent) in Cork and Limerick; one-seventh (14.3 per cent) in Waterford and it averaged 12 per cent in the 55 other urban areas, varying from as low as 5 per cent. to as high as 16.7 per cent in other towns.  A sum of £227,000 was provided in the Vote last year for those urban schemes and was allocated for new works as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Including local contributions, the State grant of £227,000 represented works costing in all £274,115.  The State grant expenditure last year is estimated at £246,245, being £19,245 <Col N="135" /> more than the Vote provision, of which £118,840 was for Dublin, £21,270 for Cork, £15,035 for Limerick, £10,225 for Waterford, £7,700 for Dún Laoghaire and £73,175 for the 55 other urban districts. These figures, in effect, mean that we are undertaking the arrears of payments in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Dún Laoghaire and the smaller urban areas.</P>
    <P>Employment schemes in urban areas are ordinarily concentrated in the winter period but the Dublin schemes are proceeded with the whole year round &mdash;each U.A. man getting a 12-weeks' spell of employment.  The unemployment assistance recipients census figure for Dublin was 3,258 in January, 1961, compared with 4,712 in January, 1960, 6,480 in January, 1959 and 5,889 in January, 1957.  Almost half the U.A. recipients in urban areas (48.5 per cent) are still concentrated in the Dublin Borough area.  The Dublin Corporation were notified on 16th August, 1960 that a State grant of £115,000 was available for new works costing £143,750, subject to a contribution of £28,750.</P>
    <P>Schemes to absorb the full amount were duly approved during the year, of which £64,775 was for road works, including re-surfacing and improvements at Cabra, Crumlin, North Wall, Kimmage and Rathdown Park, Bow Street, Poplar Row, Donnycarney, Malahide, Fairview, etc.; £4,850 was for the improvement of sundry lanes in all parts of the city, and the balance, £45,375, was for amenity schemes, including a play centre at Gloucester Place (£5,890); the improvement of parks at Stella Gardens, Irishtown (£3,580) and Donnycarney (£7,500); the culverting of the Naniken River which runs through St. Anne's Park, Clontarf (£21,680) and of the Claremont stream, Finglas (£3,420), as well as the cleaning and embanking of the lake in St. Anne's Park, Clontarf, at an estimated cost of £4,140, of which £3,312 is State grant.</P>
    <P>Included in the road works totalling £64,775 is a grant of £17,955 towards the cost of the reconstruction <Col N="136" /> of the carriageway at Fairview between Annesley Bridge and Merville Avenue, near Fairview School.  This work will cost £22,445 and is being done by contract instead of by direct labour.  The work is in the nature of an experiment to ascertain whether it is possible to employ U.A. labour on these employment schemes in Dublin under the contract system.  Apart from these new works, which absorbed the allocation of £115,000 for Dublin, employment was given during the year on the completion of schemes sanctioned in previous years, including the Bushy Park development scheme costing £36,400 approximately, which was completed last June, further development work at St. Anne's Park, Clontarf costing £24,000, and the improvement of the junction of Fortfield Road and Templeogue Road, costing £10,700.</P>
    <P>The average number of men employed weekly on the schemes last year in Dublin was 131, of whom 90 were U.A. recipients.  The number varied during the financial year from 229 to 80, of whom 177 and 48 respectively were U.A. recipients.  As the U.A. personnel of the gangs are changed at the end of a twelve-week period of employment, some 360 Dublin fathers of families each get a twelve-week spell of employment in the year, in addition to more than 40 who have employment the whole year round.  The amount which will be allocated to the Dublin County Borough area in 1961-62 has, of course, not yet been determined at this early date but, notwithstanding the substantial reduction in the number of U.A. recipients, it should be possible to allow something more than £100,000 for new works in Dublin in 1961-62.</P>
    <P>The Cork Corporation were notified on 16th August, 1960, of a State grant of £17,500 for new schemes, subject to a contribution of £3,500&mdash;one-sixth of the total £21,000.  Schemes to absorb the full allocation were duly approved, of which £15,132 was for road work at Ballymacthomas, Blackpool Bridge, Fairhill and Pouladuff and for footpaths in various parts of the city; and the balance, £2,368, was for amenity schemes, including the demolition of <Col N="137" /> Glenryan House and the clearance of the site, and the levelling and grading of an open space at Valley Drive Road.  Substantial progress has been made in the year in clearing outstanding payments in respect of schemes sanctioned prior to the 31st March, 1960.</P>
    <P>The payments made by the Department of Local Government to the Cork Corporation during the year amounted to £21,270 (allocation £17,500).  The full allocation of £16,500 for the Limerick County Borough area was also taken up, which, with the local contribution of £3,300, made £19,800 available for new works.  Of the £16,500, £8,960 was authorised for road work at Rosbrien, Meelick, Cathedral Place, etc., and the balance, £7,540, was for amenity schemes in various parts of the city, including the widening of the Shannon Embankment path, the draining of the playing pitch at Shelbourne Park, the improvement of the bus stop at Russell Park, and the levelling of an area in Garryowen, etc.</P>
    <P>Schemes to absorb the full allocation for Waterford were also approved. Adding the local contribution of £1,335 to the State grant of £8,000 made a sum of £9,335 available for expenditure. The works included the improvement of the roadways at Bridge Street junction, High Street, Passage Road, The Glen, the Cork Road, and footpaths at Ozanam Street, Barrack Street, etc.  The year before, Waterford Corporation was slow in submitting suitable schemes and the first proposals were not approved until January, 1960. There was, therefore, a time lag in the payments of the grants authorised in that year and the cost of some of the 1959/60 schemes had to be met in 1961. It is in these circumstances that while new works equivalent to a State grant of £8,000 were approved last year, the payments made to the Corporation by the Department of Local Government amounted to £10,225.  The Dún Laoghaire allocation last year was £5,000 State grant but the expenditure has amounted to £7,700.  This occurred owing to the late date, near the end of March, 1960, on which the Sandycove Harbour improvements scheme was approved out of the 1959/60 allocation. <Col N="138" /> The 1960/61 allocation was allotted to the laying out of Dunedin Park for playing fields, including the demolition of Dunedin House.  Some further development work was also undertaken during the year on the Neighbourhood Park at Williamstown.</P>
    <P>The allocations for the remaining 55 other urban districts for 1960/61, amounted to £65,000 and, including the local contributions, permitted of a gross expenditure of £73,980, or £74,000 in round figures.  The grants varied between £250 in towns with not more than 6 U.A. recipients in each, such as Bundoran, Castlebar, Carrick-macross and Templemore (which with the local contribution of £20 to £40 would provide for only a few weeks' work for U.A. men) to as high as £4,900 in Drogheda, £4,500 in Dundalk, £4,300 in Tralee, £3,750 in Wexford, £3,350 in Galway, £3,250 in Kilkenny and Sligo, £2,400 in Clonmel and £2,000 in Bray, in the larger urban areas.  In urban areas other than Dublin, the maximum number of weeks' employment which may be given to an individual U.A. recipient is eight weeks.  In Dublin, as already stated, 12 weeks are allowed.</P>
    <P>The full allocation of £65,000 in the 55 other urban districts was duly absorbed and the work schemes approved included £36,500 for road works, £18,200 for footpaths.  The remaining £10,300 was utilised for various amenity schemes, such as the clearance of derelict sites, the development of parks and town walks, the laying of tennis courts, the levelling of parking places, as well as, in one case, the continuation of a sea wall at Dungarvan.</P>
    <P>The distribution of the available money for the new financial year in the county boroughs and other urban areas has not yet been determined.  As I said earlier, the number of U.A. recipients has fallen from 9,357 in January, 1960 to 6,712 in January, 1961, a reduction of 28¼ per cent.  The &ldquo;nest egg&rdquo; of £16,000 balances from the National Development Fund is no longer available so that in allocating money for new works in 1961/62 an eye must be kept on the debts due on the uncompleted works as at the 1st April, 1961 <Col N="139" /> and the total sum of £227,000 available for expenditure on these urban schemes in the year 1961/62.</P>
    <P>The provision in the next subhead, Rural Employment Schemes, is £35,000, the same as in each of the last four years.  The works are confined to non-urbanised towns with a population of 200 and over and the grants are made available to the County Councils concerned, who are required to contribute one-quarter of the cost, so that a total of £46,665 is available for expenditure on the schemes.  One hundred and fifty-two of the 477 towns qualified for grants last year under this scheme, in which 4,000 (1,163 U.A. plus 2,837 U.I.B.) of the 4,919 unemployed, according to the January, 1960 census, were resident.  No grants were given for the other 325 towns, containing 919 unemployed&mdash;255 U.A. plus 664 U.I.B.  The schemes were almost exclusively carried out in the weeks before Christmas and the allocation for the great bulk of the towns was between £200 and £300 in each case.</P>
    <P>The towns which got more than £300 were: Kilkee, £450; Cork south city suburbs, £550; Passage West, £350; Balbriggan, £500; Dublin south city suburbs and Dún Laoghaire suburbs, £400 each; Tuam, £500; Newcastle West, £400; Edenderry, £400; and Mullingar, £400.  The various county councils were notified on 12th August of the amounts of the grants and the town areas to which they were applicable.  The approved works consisted mainly of footpaths in the towns or environs, and minor road works in the vicinity of towns, including the removal of hedges and the easing of bends.  The clearance of derelict sites and parking spaces was also undertaken.  The number of unemployed in these non-urbanised towns, according to the January, 1961, census is down to 3,965&mdash;1,000 U.A. and 2,965 U.I.B., compared with 4,919 in 1960&mdash;a reduction of 19½ per cent.  The distribution of the £35,000 available for the new year has not yet been determined but it will, as in previous years, be related to the unemployment position in each town area.</P>
    <P>Minor Employment Schemes are <Col N="140" /> carried out in the period November to March, and are intended to give employment to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance in rural areas.  £130,000 has been provided for these schemes in each of the last four years and the same provision is proposed for 1961/62.  The works consist of the repair and reconstruction of accommodation roads to farmers' houses, lands and bogs, and they are done only in areas in which there are substantial numbers of unemployment assistance recipients.  The unit of distribution is the electoral division, of which there are 2,874 in the whole country.  This unit, which is well known locally, was selected, as it is an area of approximately 9 square miles on average, and work in any part of it is, therefore, usually within walking distance from the homes of the U.A. men for whom it is intended to cater. Deputies have sometimes complained that a particular townland has got no sanctioned work.  When I mention that there are no less than 60,462 townlands in the country, it will be appreciated that it would be quite impracticable to divide an allocation of £130,000 on a townland basis.</P>
    <P>The Minor Employment Schemes full-cost grants are given only in parts of 12 of the Twenty-Six Counties, where there are sufficient U.A. men resident to ensure a gang of suitable workers.  Last year, grants were given in 11 of the 90 electoral divisions of Cavan, on the borders of Leitrim and Longford; 11 of the 149 electoral divisions in Clare, all on the sea coast; 7 of the 92 electoral divisions in West Cork, mostly in the Castletown area, bordering Kerry; 91 of the 145 electoral divisions in Donegal, most of which are in the western half of the county; 34 of the 213 electoral divisions in County Galway, all west of a line going north and south through Galway city; 43 of the 162 electoral divisions in County Kerry, mostly on the sea coast and a few bordering County Limerick; 34 of the 78 electoral divisions in County Leitrim, some in each of the 5 rural districts; 6 of the 134 electoral divisions in Limerick, 5 of which are on the Kerry border; 10 of the 52 electoral divisions in Longford, in the salient between <Col N="141" /> Counties Leitrim and Cavan; 87 of the 150 electoral divisions in County Mayo, on the sea coast and bordering the rural district of Castlerea and the Sligo border; 11 of the 110 electoral divisions in County Roscommon, in the Castlerea rural district and bordering Counties Mayo and Sligo; and 29 of the 79 electoral divisions in County Sligo, either on the sea coast or on the borders of County Mayo and the rural district of Castlerea in Roscommon.</P>
    <P>This makes a total of 374 areas of the 1,454 electoral divisions in these 12 counties or about one-eighth of all the 2,874 electoral divisions in the country.  It may be of interest to Deputies to know that, of the 19,746 U.A. in rural areas in January, 1960, 15,797 were concentrated in these 374 electoral divisions, leaving the other 3,949 U.A. scattered among 2,500 electoral divisions.</P>
    <P>As the schemes are carried out only in the winter period, road works only are done as Minor Employment Schemes.  Drainage works are unsuitable and there are, therefore, no funds at my disposal out of which full-cost grants can be given for land drains.  I want to emphasise again that only U.A. men can be employed on these schemes. The farmers whose houses or lands are served by the road work are not eligible for employment on the schemes unless they are themselves in receipt of the highest scales of U.A. payments in the immediate, adjacent area.  859 schemes were approved last year to absorb the £130,000 available for expenditure and some 16,984 families were served by these works to their houses, land and bogs.  The number of U.A. men in rural areas has fallen from 19,746 in January, 1960, to 16,992 in January, 1961, and, while the 1961/62 winter programme will not be drawn up until next October, it is unlikely that there will be very much change in the areas in which the allocations for this year's £130,000 will fall.</P>
    <P>£160,000 is available in the Bog Development Schemes subhead&mdash;the same provision as in each of the past four years.  This subhead makes provision for drainage works in bogs in <Col N="142" /> all parts of the country, which are carried out in the summer period; and for road works in those parts of the country in which Minor Employment Schemes grants are not authorised and which are sanctioned for execution in the winter period.  Some 1,265 schemes were approved last year, of which 555, representing an expenditure of £61,170, were drainage works and 710, representing an expenditure of £98,830, were road works.  Some 37,551 families in all were facilitated, 13,814 by drainage works and 23,737 by road works. Although these Bog Development Schemes are not primarily to give employment in rural areas, priority in recruiting gangs of workers is given to U.A. recipients or to persons in receipt of unemployment benefit in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>With the exception of a few roads and drains in privately owned bogs in which the rent income from annual lettings is substantial and where, in consequence, it would not be unreasonable to expect these bog owners to make a contribution, all grants under this bog development subhead are full-cost grants.  The amounts of the grants in these bog development cases are not related in any way to the unemployment position.  The funds are distributed having regard to the number of families served, the amount of turf produced and the cost of the relevant development works.  In cases where expensive development works are required for a small number of families and for which a full cost grant could not be justified the contributory Rural Improvements Scheme is available as an alternative.</P>
    <P>The Rural Improvements Scheme makes provision for grants towards the cost of carrying out works to benefit the lands of two or more farmers, such as small drainage schemes, bridges and the repair or reconstruction of accommodation roads to farmers' houses, lands and bogs.  It is not an employment scheme, and it applies to all parts of the country.  It is the only scheme available for the improvement of farmers' roads outside the congested districts and for the smaller types of land drains all over the country, other than field drains on individual farms, which, of course, are a matter for the Department <Col N="143" /> of Agriculture and not for the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>
    <P>Road schemes can be, and are, also done in the congested districts under the Rural Improvements Scheme in any cases where the benefiting farmers are prepared to make the necessary contribution towards the cost.  Unlike the Minor Employment and Bog Development Schemes, where the function of the Special Employment Schemes Office is to pick the best job undone in the electoral division area, i.e., of the greatest utility in relation to its cost, each Rural Improvements Scheme is considered specially on its own merits.</P>
    <P>There may be four, five or six other roads in the same electoral division area needing attention, each of which serves a greater number of families and which would, therefore, have priority as a Minor Employment or Bog Development Scheme, but if the farmers on the road which is No. 7 on the list are prepared to contribute under the Rural Improvements Scheme, that seventh road is the one which is done under the contributory scheme.  Works of a better and more durable standard are done under this scheme than are possible under the Minor Employment Schemes, where, in many instances, the small number of U.A. recipients limits the amount of money that can be made available.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that this scheme was largely suspended in 1956-57.  The issue of new offers of grants was stopped in August, 1956.  The receipt of new applications was suspended in September, 1956; and it was not until the 20th July, 1957, after the increased provision for this scheme and the introduction of the new terms, that the scheme was again really under way. Some 798 schemes costing £215,000 were approved in 1957-58.  771 schemes costing £199,988 were approved in 1958-59; 719 schemes costing £196,800 in 1959-60&mdash;a short fall of £200&mdash;and the contributions received in the year just closed permitted only of 650 schemes costing £169,302 being sanctioned in 1960-61.  Of these, 195 schemes costing £37,289 were drainage <Col N="144" /> works, and 455 costing £132,013 were road works.  The expenditure under the Scheme, as will be seen from the table that I have made available to Deputies, was £238,639 in 1956-57, £194,654 in 1957-78, £169,088 in 1958-59, £194,649 in 1959-60 and it is expected will approximate £177,000 in 1960-61. Contributions, as will be seen, have been falling off in the last eighteen months.  Some 1,165 offers of grant were issued during the year, but lodgments were made only in 655 cases, 553 for new schemes and 102 for supplementary or part grants.  Only about half the offers made were, in fact, accepted.</P>
    <P>This Rural Improvements Scheme has actually been in operation since 1943, and for the first seven years the contribution was on a flat rate of 75 per cent.  State grant, 25 per cent. farmers' contribution, with more favourable terms for link and other roads used by persons other than those whose houses and lands were directly served thereby.  The schemes sanctioned in that seven year period amounted to £723,596, of which £565,790 or 78 per cent. was State grant, and £157,806 or 22 per cent. was farmers' contributions.  A sliding scale was introduced in June, 1950, varying the contributions from as low as 5 per cent. in the case of farmers whose average land valuation was less than £6, to 25 per cent. contribution in the case of farmers with an average land valuation of £18 and over, and this scale was in operation until 1957.  During that seven year period, the sanctions amounted to £1,476,420, of which £1,295,192 or 87.7 per cent. was State grant, and £181,228 or 12.3 per cent. was farmers' contributions.  Finance was not provided for this scale; and, as already explained, the scheme was suspended in August/September, 1956. Some two years arrears of applications were on hands, in fact, in 1957.</P>
    <P>A new scale was introduced on 20th July, 1957, with a minimum of 10 per cent. contribution in the case of farmers with an average land valuation below £6, and ranging upwards to as high as 50 per cent. in the case of farmers with a land valuation of £100 and over. The amended scale has now been in <Col N="145" /> operation for four years, and in that period the work sanctioned amounted to £781,092, of which £646,619 or 82.8 per cent. was State grant, and £134,473 or 17.2 per cent was farmers' contributions. The terms of this scale have been recently under review, and it has been decided to make the terms somewhat more generous.  The minimum contribution will in future be 10 per cent. of the cost for farmers with an average valuation below £7; 12½ per cent. for valuations between £7 and £10; 15 per cent. between £10 and £15; 20 per cent. between £15 and £25; 25 per cent or one-quarter between £25 and £50; 33? per cent or one-third between £50 and £100; and 50 per cent. or half the cost in the case of farmers with a valuation of £100 and over.</P>
    <P>I propose also to introduce a special scale of 90 per cent. grant with 10 per cent. contribution in the case of bog schemes which cannot be done on a full cost grant basis under the Bog Development subhead.  For the convenience of Deputies I am circulating a statement giving particulars of the scale in operation from June, 1950 to July, 1957, the existing rates from the 20th July, 1957, which have now been in operation for almost four years, as well as the new scale proposed.  I consider the amended scale as generous as can be justified and I have little doubt that the full provision of £200,000 in the Vote for the current year will be fully taken up.</P>
    <P>The provision for Miscellaneous Schemes was £15,000 in the last four years, and the same provision has been repeated in 1961/62.  The expenditure in 1959/60 was £14,514, and the estimated expenditure in 1960/61 is around the £14,000 figure.  This subhead is intended to meet expenditure on minor marine works, towards the cost of which County Councils are required to contribute one quarter and which they are required to maintain on completion. It also finances archaeological excavations and other miscellaneous schemes.  About £2,450 of a provisional allocation of £2,500 was spent last year on archaeological excavations, of which £620 was expended in Templekieran, Loughaun in County Offaly; £545 in Ballyneety, Limerick; £455 in <Col N="146" /> Creewood, Slane, Meath; £410 in Reenascreena South, Carberry, Cork; £270 in Glendalough, Wicklow, and £150 in Townley Hall, Louth.</P>
    <P>Schemes approved under this subhead during 1960/61 totalled £18,600, of which, apart from archaeological excavations, the principal items were £4,950 for additional works at the Wicklow foreshore; £4,360 for road access to a coal mine in County Leitrim; £365 for additional work on the Ulster Canal, and £6,400 for minor marine works, including £2,100 at Seafield, Quilty, County Clare, £1,950 at Lahanebeg, Castletownbere, Cork and £900 at Crookhaven, Cork; £975 at Rosbeg, Donegal, £315 in Kilcummin, Mayo, as well as small grants of less than £100 each for Scattery Island, Clare and Ervallagh Pier, Roundstone, Galway.  There is, therefore, little prospect of any new miscellaneous schemes being sanctioned in 1961/61 and, if it is possible to meet expenditure against the commitments already made from the £15,000 in this year's subhead, it is as much as we can hope to do.</P>
    <P>The Appropriations-in-Aid subhead is made up almost entirely of the contributions in respect of the Rural Improvements Scheme, which amounted only to £29,320 in 1960/61. I have already referred to the drop in the contributions.  It also includes receipts in respect of development works in privately owned bogs, the county councils' contributions towards the cost of minor marine works, and the sale of surplus stores.  The figure in the Estimate for 1961/62 is £35,000, the same as in recent years.</P>
    <P>In addition to the works financed from Vote 10, the Special Employment Schemes Office also acts as the agent of the Minister for Transport and Power in respect of the carrying out of development works to facilitate the output of turf for the four hand-won turf generating stations at Caherciveen, Kerry, Miltown Malbay, Clare, Screeb, Galway and Gweedore, Donegal.  These schemes are financed from a National Development Fund allocation of £80,000 at the disposal of the Minister for Transport and Power.  New works <Col N="147" /> costing £20,205 were approved last year, of which £7,225 approximately was authorised in Donegal, £650 in Galway, £5,580 in Clare and £6,750 in Kerry.  The commitments entered into to date out of the £80,000 available amount to £55,080, leaving a balance of £24,820 still available for new schemes.  The expenditure on these schemes last year amounted to £17,000 and the total expenditure was £39,000 up to the 31st March, 1961.</P>
    <P>The Special Employment Schemes Office also acts as agent for the Minister for the Gaeltacht in respect of the carrying out of accommodation road works in Gaeltacht areas financed from the Vote of that Department.  New works costing £32,710 were authorised in 1960/61, of which £12,220 was in Galway, £7,800 in Donegal, £6,135 in Mayo, £4,375 in Kerry and £2,180 in Cork.  The expenditure on these Gaeltacht schemes is estimated at £28,780 approximately, of which £10,400 was in Galway, £7,720 in Donegal, £5,700 in Mayo, £3,060 in Kerry and £1,900 in Cork.  The expenditure on the Gaeltacht schemes and on the works for the benefit of the turf-fired generating stations will be accounted for by the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Transport and Power respectively, and not by the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>
    <P>With this detailed statement of the various works of public utility which have been undertaken last year under this Vote, in Dublin, in other urban areas, in some of the non-urbanised towns and in rural areas, I propose to conclude by making some general comments on the Vote as a whole. These schemes are not, nor were they ever intended to be, the answer to the unemployment problem.  As I said last year, they do, however, provide very real benefits as an adjunct to the system of direct social welfare payments, by giving spells of manual work at normal rates of wages to men with the highest number of dependants who, in most cases, have been unemployed for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>All Deputies would, no doubt, like <Col N="148" /> to see more money provided for the different schemes being operated by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Apart from the labour value, the schemes are now recognised, particularly in rural Ireland, for their contribution to agricultural and fuel production; and, indeed, it can be justifiably argued that they are indispensable in so far as they keep open the ancillary arteries of communication. But in clamouring for more funds for these works, we must keep in mind the various calls that are made upon the general pool by other important incentives and subsidies to production.  The eradication of bovine T.B., subsidisation of fertilisers, farm buildings, water schemes, erection and repair of dwellings, etc., as well as the full-cost grants to arterial drainage are among the things which have what we may regard as priority in the demand for allocations from the Exchequer; and, in this perspective, Deputies will agree that the funds we are spending on minor roads and drains and other amenity schemes is providing a very useful adjunct to the general pattern of better standards for our people, and it is only reasonable to expect that as time goes on the demand for funds for this work will be increasingly progressive.</P>
    <P>That is a fairly detailed statement of the working of the Special Employment Schemes Office and Deputies should not require much further information. At the same time, I am prepared to facilitate them as far as I can if they want more information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his kind offer to give more information.  I was wondering if he was going to say that Deputies should not have some criticism to offer of his office in the last 12 months. However, we shall leave that until another time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has often occurred to me that the Parliamentary Secretary's office, including Public Works and Buildings and the various employment and emergency schemes which he administers, has reached the stature of a Ministry.  I would not oppose but, on the contrary, would welcome the raising <Col N="149" /> of the Office of Public Works to a separate Ministry.  The office handles a very considerable amount of money. That office and the Forestry Branch of the Department of Agriculture are doing some of the best and most remunerative work for the expenditure incurred in the whole range of Government.  The Office of Public Works make a first class job of any work they tackle and it is only once in a blue moon that complaints are heard about the quality of the work done.</P>
    <P>It must be realised from the table that the Parliamentary Secretary has been kind enough to circulate to us that the paralysing hand of Fianna Fáil has fallen on this Office as it seems to fall on everything pertaining to rural life.  The comparative figures given in the table surprised me greatly.  For instance, in regard to urban employment schemes the expenditure in 1956-57&mdash;the last year that we were in office&mdash;was £284,840, while the Vote provision this year is down to £227,000, a decrease of £60,000.  In regard to rural employment schemes, the expenditure in 1956-57 was £28,587; and the Vote provision this year is £35,000.  In regard to minor employment schemes the expenditure in 1956-57 was £136,074, against a Vote provision this year of £130,000.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that in the last five years wages have increased, the cost of material has risen and yet there is a reduction of £6,074 in the Vote provision this year as against actual expenditure in 1956-57.  In regard to bog development schemes, the Vote provision is £160,000 as against estimated expenditure last year of £162,000, a decrease of £2,000.  In regard to rural improvement schemes, in the last year that we were in office we spent £238,639 and the Vote provision this year is £200,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the figures contained in the table that the Parliamentary Secretary has circulated. I did not know that these were the figures until he revealed them.  In 1956-57 we spent £238,639 on the rural improvements scheme as against an estimated expenditure last year of £177,000.  In every county wages have gone up and the number of persons employed must be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has also provided a table showing a proposed change of rates of local contributions. The first year that the rural improvements scheme was introduced was the first year that I came into the Dáil, 1943.  There was an all-round contribution demanded then, regardless of valuation or circumstances, of 25 per cent.  That was the Fianna Fáil method from 1943 until 1950.  The first inter-Party Government changed it and introduced a sliding scale, a method which was very beneficial to those who wanted work done and had not the money to pay the 25 per cent.  We brought it down to £6 or less, the rate of contribution being five per cent. of the total cost of the scheme.</P>
      <P>On the 20th July, 1957, a few months after the present Government took office, they altered the scheme. They raised the contribution straight away, in the case of small farmers below £6, to ten per cent.  That meant that for a job costing £300 the farmers would have to find £30.  That might not seem much in the Parliamentary Secretary's eyes but to the small farmers who have to watch every penny and who have to work minor miracles in order to live at all, £30 is untold wealth in some cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but in many cases the contribution might be spread over only two or three.  Divide it as you will, it is a heavy burden for them to meet.  It would be very interesting if the Parliamentary Secretary would give us the number of schemes that have fallen through because somebody said he could not meet the contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is heartbreaking&mdash; and I am sure Deputies particularly in the western counties have experienced this as I have&mdash;to go to a lot of trouble getting schemes formulated, getting signatures, copying signatures from demand notes as accurately as possible and getting matters up to the point where the Special Employment Schemes Office states the contribution required and then to find that the whole thing drops because of complete failure to get the necessary contribution.</P>
      <P>I should like, if the Parliamentary Secretary would not mind my being wearisome, to ask the number of failures to get contributions if such a record is kept, the number of schemes that fell through because tenants could not pay the contribution when the sliding scale from June 1950 to the 20th July 1957 was changed as compared with the last four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could give the Deputy the number of schemes that were not accepted but I could not say why they were not accepted.  There are various reasons contributions are not lodged.  Sometimes the people concerned do not agree.  Sometimes the contribution comes in after a matter of two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with that.  There are two types of person who may explode a scheme that has reached the contribution stage.  One is the person who has not got the money and the other is the crank&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have them even in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a man who <Col N="152" /> happens to have a house so near the main road that the improvement is of little value to him.  Sometimes you come up against a man who cannot bear to see his neighbours better themselves and who would rather live up to his knees in filth every day of the year provided his neighbours were going through the same hardship.  That may happen every now and then, that you get people of that mentality, but in most cases benefiting tenants make up the crank's contribution, or the poor person's contribution, and the scheme goes ahead.</P>
      <P>Under the new scheme, the Parliamentary Secretary has raised the contribution where the valuation is between £10 and £15.  He has fixed the contribution at 15 per cent., which is a very high rate.  Most people in western counties who would be availing of the rural improvements scheme would come within that range.  In fact, 15 per cent, is completely beyond their capacity to pay in most cases. I advise the Parliamentary Secretary to go back to the old sliding scale which existed from 1950 to 1957.  That was very fair and it gave the smallholder whose income was low a chance to meet the contribution.  The new scheme which the Parliamentary Secretary proposes now has no advantage over the scheme in existence for the past four years.  In my opinion, it appears to show that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government have little or no conception of the times the small farmers are passing through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a small farmer has some money the first thing he does is to put it into some improvement about his own place, into making a better access road for example.  At present, these farmers have gone through two or three very bad years.  There was no sale for either sheep or cattle.  Last year sheep were absolutely disastrous.  While that has improved somewhat cattle were unsaleable all through the year up to the month of March.  Since May, and in the present month, prices have dropped and as a result farmers have gone to fair after fair and have had to bring home their stock again unsold. That has very serious repercussions for <Col N="153" /> them because they had to rear and feed the stock up to that stage and now, when it is ready for sale, there is no market.  The small farmers have not got the money that the Parliamentary Secretary thinks they have.</P>
    <P>About half our population live along by-roads.  That is a rough and ready guess of mine, but I think it is not far wrong.  They find that the more fortunate half have either a county road or a steamrolled road passing by their doors.  A good deal of the reluctance of young people to stay on the land at present is due to the fact that they have to trudge in and out a boreen every time they want to go to the shop, to market, to Mass or to school or any other place.  Bad access roads to villages are one of the principal causes of disgust among the rising generation.  When no roads were steamrolled or tarred, and boreens and county roads were all much the same, it did not make much difference.  Now, that has been changed and the contrast between the farmer living beside the tarred road and the man who has to trudge the boreen is too great.  The result is that most of the farmers who have raised families cannot get a son to stay on the land.  Personally, I cannot blame them.  I think in proposing this new scheme&mdash;this applies also to the scheme proposed before he took office&mdash;to increase the contributions under the rural improvement scheme the Parliamentary Secretary is merely stepping backwards.  Apart from that, it shows no conception of the condition of the people in the country at present.</P>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give greater latitude in the case of bog drainage.  Sometimes we hear excuses that the Land Commission drained a bog and that these drains have now gone into disuse.  Of course they have. In most cases the Land Commission opened drains in virgin bog and when people got plots in the bog and came in to cut turf, over the years the level of the bog was lowered to a point lower than the drains made by the Land Commission.  The bog level is constantly being lowered and it is the duty of some Government Department to continue deepening the drains so that the adjoining roads can be used.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> In the subhead covering urban improvement schemes I think the Parliamentary Secretary should be a little more liberal to towns that are already overburdened with rates.  In some cases streets and roads through these towns are in a deplorable condition.  County rates, as far as I understand, make little or no contribution towards them. To put the streets in proper repair would be beyond the capacity of the townspeople.  I know of several towns where the streets are in a desperate condition.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should deal with that by making better provision for them.  The rates in most towns, as I have said, have reached a level now where it is only a fool who will own a house, or at least a big business premises.  The rates are so high that in many cases the owners already have all they can do to meet them.</P>
    <P>There are a few local matters in which I am deeply interested.  There is one matter about which recently I received a letter from the Parliamentary Secretary's Department, regarding an application for the cleaning of the upper portions of the River Lung which flows through Roscommon. I am interested in the upper regions where damage is being caused to the land of about 500 farmers.  The communication stated that this was a job beyond the capacity of the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Might I submit that I do not think so.  The portion I am speaking of can scarcely be described as a river; it might be described as a very large drain.  It has three forks which branch close to the town of Ballyhaunis.  Between land, bogs and houses 500 farmers are vitally affected and I think the Parliamentary Secretary should have another look at it to see if it is at all possible to do it.</P>
    <P>The Lung River does not come under arterial drainage as the Special Employment Schemes Office say that the job is too big.  What that means is that the position must remain as it is and the farmers will find their land being flooded increasingly according as the drains become choked more and more each year.  It is a shame and a scandal that that position should be <Col N="155" /> allowed to continue.  If there were only a few farmers involved, I would not be so perturbed, but there are 500 involved in Mayo and across the border of Roscommon.  Some of the best land they have is flooded and potatoes have been ruined and hay crops have been under water.  I submit that the job is not beyond the capacity of the Special Employment Schemes Office.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see if outside machinery could be employed for this work.  I am not asking him to take machinery off arterial drainage work but to experiment if necessary with the employment of a privately owned machine.  There are many such machines for hire and their owners would be glad to get the employment.</P>
    <P>Another matter in which I am interested is the drainage of the huge area of 150 acres of the best arable land outside the village of Irishtown. I am sure the officials in the Board of Works are familiar with my representations in that regard.  These are two areas where damage is being caused by flooding.  In the case of the Lung River, if the job is not done by some Government Department, and I respectfully submit that the Parliamentary Secretary's Office is the correct one, it will mean the banishment of a couple of hundred farmers from their holdings because nobody can make a living there and meanwhile the rents and rates have to be kept going.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the rural improvement scheme, the Parliamentary Secretary said that it was suspended the last year we were in office, in 1956/57.  I should like to know how over £238,000 was spent that year if it was suspended and how, when Fianna Fáil came into office, they spent some £194,000 the first year and £169,000 the second year, £194,000 the third year and £177,000 the last year.</P>

      <P>Let us agree for the time being that these schemes were suspended in August, 1956, that was roughly seven months before we went out of office.  How then could over £238,000 be spent in that year?  I presume that when the scheme was suspended there was a big backlog of work to be undertaken.  I am not making politics of this but it does seem to be something of a Chinese puzzle as to how, if it was suspended, over £238,000 could be spent in one year and, when Fianna Fáil came into office, they spent £194,000 the first year and £169,000 the second year.  That was after slicing £9,000,000 off food subsidies, a sum which we never had. I should like the explanation for that, whatever it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and his office are to be congratulated on the very fine statement issued this morning.  At the same time I feel, and perhaps I shall be the only one who has this feeling, that it is high time that both minor employment schemes and rural improvement schemes should be inquired into to see if we are reaching the target we hope to reach some day.  In general the schemes operated by that office, especially for the poorer areas, have an allocation of £50, £60 and upwards, approximately to £100.  That generally is what is allocated for each little job.  To my mind if that goes on from year to year we can never reach a target where our roads will be up to a proper standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> I feel the Office of Public Works should co-operate with the local authorities in the different counties where the money is being spent and increase that allocation for a road, say double or treble that amount, and ask the local authorities if they would consent to taking over the particular road and the Board of Works would finish with it there and then.  It would be a better way of doing business and in future years you would have the majority of those roads at such a standard that you could bring a car or a lorry into the different villages.  Until that is done the situation will not improve. It may be all right to spend a few pounds on a number of roads which will be effective for a few months but if you take the ordinary farmer living in these places driving a tractor-load or a lorry-load of goods over these roads the inadequacy of the works carried out will be obvious.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said in his opening statement that the third week in January is usually the week taken in which to say whether a particular electoral division is to qualify for grants under the relevant subhead. To my mind&mdash;and I daresay other Deputies in my constituency are of the same opinion; I see Deputy Lindsay sitting here&mdash;January is not a very suitable time because there is a great deal of temporary migration in the beet season.  Therefore there would be several villages that would qualify for minor employment schemes but which cannot avail of it for that reason.</P>
    <P>One thing I would like to see abolished as quickly as possible is the consent form in connection with roads. It is the greatest possible waste of time having a ganger or a supervisor asking people if they are willing to allow road construction or repairs to go ahead. That may be all right in connection with a new road but where a road has been done time and time again it is not desirable.  If one fellow in the village has a quarrel with his neighbour and wants to be awkward he will not sign and for that reason the officers of the Parliamentary Secretary will not carry out the work.  That is hard on that man's neighbours.  That provision should go as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> The Parliamentary Secretary stated that a certain number of rural improvement schemes have been turned down for different reasons.  I should like, when he is replying, that he should give those reasons.  I know of a number of schemes, details of which I will give to the Parliamentary Secretary when the debate is over, which have been turned down for reasons which are not right.  The information which has been given to the officers is wrong.</P>
    <P>In regard to bog development, I believe the western part of County Galway is not getting its share.  In a list supplied by the Parliamentary Secretary only a few days ago to Deputies in general, something like five schemes are envisaged for the whole west.  That is very low.  There is a huge area of bog west of Galway City.  A lot of it will have to be drained and opened up.  There is a power station in the area and there should be more bog drainage schemes there in order to facilitate the people who make a livelihood by cutting turf and supplying it to the station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at once that with the budgetary proposals within which they have to work and allocate the various moneys, this office of minor employment and rural improvement schemes does the best it can.  However, I do think they make use, possibly as a matter of policy, of the stereotyped kind of reply to which reference has been made here by several people, namely, that the work proposed or contemplated by the proposers is outside the scope of work initiated or undertaken by the Office itself.  On the other hand, in the words of the last speaker, they take too much notice of this consent form. Nothing will convince me but that, on receipt of news from the local inspector that he has failed to get the requisite number of signatures, there is more jubilation in the Office at not having to spend the money in that year than there would be in conferring the benefit which the spending of it would be bound to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole system of minor employment and rural improvement is outmoded. It is high time that stock <Col N="159" /> were taken and that the whole system were changed in some way.  The bye-roads have been mentioned and some speaker or other has said that any target that might be in view would never be reached under the present system.  I do not think there is any target or that it was ever contemplated that there would be a target. This whole system, outmoded as it is, is designed to keep people quiet in one place this year or in another place next year by throwing a few shovelfuls of gravel and stones into potholes so that no one will walk or cycle into them saying: &ldquo;There you are.  The Government are doing a great job for you.&rdquo;  There is a great deal in what Deputy Blowick says and in the view I have already expressed on the earlier Vote today, that the failure to provide amenities such as good roads and drainage that does not come within the scope of arterial drainage in respect of the more backward areas of rural Ireland is, apart altogether from economic pressure, a vital factor in the flight from the land which we all deplore.</P>
    <P>People are not content any more to put up with the couple of shovelfuls of gravel and sand or the few bits of stones thrown into the potholes in order to make their lives reasonably livable in such areas.  We are not satisfied with that now and, until something is done to change the whole outlook, the people simply will not remain there.  Maybe that is the idea behind all this policy of having a static Vote of this kind year after year, to break the morale of the people in these areas so that it will not become necessary as the years go by to vote any moneys at all for these areas.</P>
    <P>I deplore it now, as I did before when the increase was made some years ago, and I do not think this change in the rate of contribution for rural improvement schemes will make the situation any better.  While there is a great deal to be said for the principle that dear money is better than no money, if it is so dear that it is put beyond the capacity of the people to pay, then it is worthless and will not achieve the objective for which it has been made available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> It is quite obvious from looking at the lists from year to year that that is the policy: do it here this year and maybe in five years' time you can come back and you see the sort of telling addendum &ldquo;supplemental to the Vote of 1954-55&rdquo; appearing in 1961-62.  That is extremely bad and will not impress the people.</P>
    <P>I was not here to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say what Deputy Blowick tells us he said; that all these things were suspended in August, 1956.  If that is so, it is extremely interesting that in the financial year 1956-57 we, as a Government, spent over the four succeeding years about £60,000 more than this Government spent and about £38,500 more than this Government intend to spend in this financial year.  The money was spent whenever it was spent.  I do not think it would be any argument for the Parliamentary Secretary to say &mdash;certainly it would not be a successful one&mdash;that the figure of £238,639 was brought to that level in the 11 days they had the Government from, say, 20th March, 1957, until the end of the financial year.  These moneys were spent and that is all about it. It was said by the Parliamentary Secretary that these moneys were never intended as a relief of unemployment. Quite obviously not, because, if they were, they would be grossly inadequate. If they were intended to confer any real benefits, they are still grossly inadequate.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, this is the kind of Vote to keep people quiet for the time being&mdash;nothing more and nothing less. The Parliamentary Secretary makes some point of the great reduction there is in the numbers of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance recipients, particularly in the urban areas and the non-urbanised towns. He knows where they have gone, and he knows the reason for that.  Surely that should not be a sufficient reason for reducing the amount by anything in order to deprive the people who have been brave enough to remain in these areas?</P>
    <P>When we subtract the £93,090 devoted to salaries, travelling and other incidental expenses, we get a figure of £767,000 in all for this Vote to cover <Col N="161" /> portions of 12 counties.  That, in itself, shows a lack of any attempt either to relieve unemployment or confer any real benefit.  There is slightly less than £750,000 to assist by way of partial employment or by way of conferring of benefits on the people living in the backward areas of 12 of our counties, when at the same time we can pay £2 million for a jet airplane.  The whole thing is topsy-turvy and cannot be regarded as likely to ensure the confidence of the people or to show that the Government are earnest in their regard.</P>
    <P>I get a list every year through the courtesty of the Parliamentary Secretary. I asked for it when I came here originally and I must say it is sent to me with great promptitude.  I received it this year and I still have it.  I would venture to say there are numbers of Deputies who have cut it up into little bits and posted them to the various parts of their constituencies to try and give the impression that it was they who secured the particular £50, £70 or £100 to be spent.  That, in itself, coupled with the inadequacy of the sum, is not helpful to the morale of our people.</P>
    <P>I have the strongest objection to officers of this Office in rural Ireland taking with them public men, selected public men, to inspect proposed bog road, bog development or rural employment schemes, thereby giving the impression that this whole interest is centred in one person.  The people in this Office are doing a wonderful job in distributing the little bit of money here and there.  By and large&mdash;there is no case known to me to be the exception&mdash;these men try to put the money where it should be and to get the best they can out of it.  But their best efforts are set at nought by reason of the inadequacy of the sum and the great area to be covered.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary had a long brief covering almost ten very closely typed pages.  This is an election manifesto and is intended to be such. When you think that it takes ten closely typed pages to introduce a Vote of less than £750,000 for the people of the backward areas of rural Ireland, you then think of the Minister for Transport <Col N="162" /> and Power coming in here with four pages of double spaced typescript &mdash;in which, incidentally, for the first time the word &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; did not occur&mdash;looking for £3½ million for Aer Lingus, Aerlínte and the building of hotels.  Are the Government serious about preserving rural Ireland and giving to the small farmer the amenities to make his life reasonably livable&mdash;I shall not say either happy or comfortable&mdash;in these violently backward areas?</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the whole amount is inadequate and no amount of typescript is going to put a gloss on it. The money for rural improvements is too dear and the money for minor employment is too little.  I do not think that, despite all the efforts of the Parliamentary Secretary, he is going to get many votes out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly we had so little debate because of the fullness of the brief.  The last speaker said it was a fairly full brief, but it was full of facts. It did not propose, assume or prophesy. It merely set down the facts and gave the detailed working of the Office.  I think that was a very useful thing to put on record.  I said at the end of my brief that I supposed if the money in this Vote were trebled, some Deputies would say they would like to see more. This is something that has a parochial effect and is very beneficial for some areas.  The activities of Deputies in submitting proposals and pressing them on this Office have a certain effect, and no doubt certain kudos is expected. For that reason, money for this purpose is always welcome.  However, we must always ensure that it is being spent to good purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at the end of my speech that a certain amount of money was being spent out of the general pool towards the improvement of roads in the areas which Deputy Lindsay has just referred to as being violently backward.  You have grants and incentives for many other things.  I suppose it is a question of what direction we should take.  My ambition each year is to get as much as I can for my own Office, always bearing in mind the responsibility of <Col N="163" /> ensuring the money is being put to really good use.</P>
    <P>I do not quarrel with those who say that the pattern in regard to the Special Employment Schemes Office has been entirely changed.  Originally, the Office was set up for the purpose of relieving unemployment.  It dealt with the matter of accommodation roads.  Previously no provision had been made for these except in the case of the Land Commission constructing bog roads.  When I was young it was simply a case of the people turning out on a few days in the week with carts and spades and doing the necessary improvements to the roads. That is being done now by way of grant.  It is being done mainly through the rural improvement schemes.  As I say, the work of the Office has gone on for a number of years and we have now reached the stage at which everybody agrees that the work would be done even though there was not a single unemployed man in the country tomorrow.  Someone would have to do these roads.  The people who came together and did the work voluntarily in the past are no longer prepared to do that.  They expect to get these grants and I am afraid they will have to get them.  That is what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>The rural improvement scheme was an excellent scheme because there was a local contribution involved and that ensured that only essential works were put forward.  If the people really wanted something done, they were prepared to pay a contribution towards its cost.  That is why the scheme was so successful in the first instance.  I gave the history of the scheme in my introductory statement and the history describing how the scheme was brought down to as low as five per cent.  I pointed out that sufficient funds were not available to operate that generous scale.  That is something we have to watch.  Deputy Blowick suggested the proposed amended scale will not be of much use.  I believe it will give very considerable relief.  It confers considerable benefits in respect of levels of valuation averages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> The new scale is calculated to consume the amount of money in the Vote.  I have been watching the situation over the past few years and, while activity under the rural improvements scheme was very creditable, we did not expend the full amount voted in the last two years.  The amended scale is calculated to ensure that the full amount will be spent.  We always keep an eye on the operation of the scheme in order to see whether adjustments may not be necessary in any particular direction.  I would not care for a return to a very low scale because such a scale encourages people to apply for a scheme merely for the sake of the employment it provides rather than the benefit it confers. While the number of acceptances are reasonably good, the amended scale&mdash; it is a considerable easement of the existing scale&mdash;is calculated to consume the full £200,000 in the Vote.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick pretended he could not see why the schemes were suspended in 1956 when the generous scale then in existence would have required twice the amount of money to operate.  The amount provided in that year was considerably less than the amount provided this year.  Deputy Blowick pretended to know nothing about the National Development Fund, a Fund which was used in that particular year to the extent of £41,000 for rural improvement schemes.  The amount of money provided this year for these schemes is much more than was provided in 1956/57.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had not a halfpenny to give anybody from August, 1956.  That is on the records. I explained the position in my introductory statement.  I do not think we should go back to the old scale unless we are prepared to support it with money.  I suggest we should carefully watch the operation of the scale we have introduced and, if it proves inadequate to consume the money available or if we desire at some stage to concentrate on rural improvement schemes as against M.I.S. or bog development schemes, we could put a little more money into it and expand a little more.  Let us avoid extremes, the extreme of having a rather high contribution and a lot of money, which will inevitably mean surrendering a balance each year, and the extreme which existed in 1956/57 of a generous scale of contributions and not enough money to support that scale.  We must keep a balance between the two.</P>
      <P>Any Parliamentary Secretary who keeps an eye on the number of acceptances in proportion to the number of proposals will easily see what adjustment is required from time to time. The fact that people are prepared to put up the money and do the job has the advantage that the work is essential. Their willingness to put up the money is the acid test.  Great numbers are still operating the scheme and that proves that it is a scheme in the right direction.  I have often thought we should concentrate on that particular type of scheme rather than on some of the full-scale grant schemes that we are operating.  But that is a different matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay pointed out our grants were small and the amount of money was hardly sufficient.  That is true.  We could spend more if we raised our standards.  We are, at least, keeping these lines of communication open. They do not bear a great deal of traffic. They are merely connecting links between major roads and towns.  We keep them open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bog development scheme has <Col N="166" /> contributed towards the increased production of fuel.  I do not know if the productive capacity of these schemes is always appreciated.  Deputy Donnellan spoke about the needs of Galway.  Galway as a whole does exceptionally well in these bog development schemes.  The allocations are based on production.  There is no allocation so thoroughly examined as are the moneys distributed by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go into detail again in relation to matters falling within the scope of the Special Employment Schemes Office.  I again emphasise that we are sufficiently aware of the fact that the Office is not really related any longer to unemployment. If there were not one unemployed man in the country tomorrow, the work being carried out by the Office would have to be done, either by that Office or by somebody else. The number of registered unemployed is still the basis on which many of the grants are allocated.  As compared with what was done in 1956/57, in relation to the register of unemployed, which is our basis of allocation, the amount of money we are giving now is considerably better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire Tionscail agus Trachtála (Seán Ó Loingsigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go ndeonófar suim nach mó ná £1,841,000 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar crioch an 31ú lá de Mhárta, 1962, le haghaidh Tuarastail agus Costais Oifig an Aire Tionscail agus Tráchtála, lena n-áirítear Seirbhisí áirithe atá faoi riaradh na hOifige sin, agus chun Ildeontais-i-gCabhair a íoc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> Sara ndéanfad tagairt cruinn do sna seirbhísí éagsúla ar a bhfuil an t-airgead so le caitheamh, ba mhaith liom, ós rud é go bhfuilim ag teacht ós comhair na Dála chun cúntas a thabhairt ar imeachtaí mo Roinn-se, tagairt ginearálta a dhéanamh do staid na tíre chomh fada is a bhaineann sé liomsa mar Aire.</P>
    <P>Is féidir liom a rá láithreach gurab ábhar sásaimh an stáid sin maidir le n-a bhfuil déanta cheana agus gurab ábhar dóchais é maidir le n-a bhfuil rómhainn.  Tá cúrsaí tionscail agus tráchtála na tíre go bríomhar beoga agus tá gach cosúlacht air go ndéanfaidh siad tuille dul chun chinn sa bhliain atá rómhainn.</P>
    <P>Admhaím nach bhfuil deire curtha fós leis an difhostaoícht agus an imirce ach tá tionscail nua dá mbunú níos tapúla ná ariamh agus táid ag cur obair fónta ar fáil dár mhuintir annso i nÉirinn.  De bhárr saothair mo Roinne agus an Udaráis Forbartha Tionscail, tá toradh mhaith ar na h-iarrachtaí atá dá ndéanamh chun lucht tionscail a thabhairt isteach ó thíortha eile, agus tá roinnt maith d'ár gcuid tionscal féin ag coiméad céim ar chéim leis an ngluaiseacht domhanda i leith breis éifeachtachta agus breis táirgiúlachta.  Tugadh cúnamh, maidir leis na neithe seo, dár gcuid tionscal ón Scéim Deontas Cúnaimh Teicniúil atá dá riaradh ag mo Roinn-se agus fuaireadar cúnamh, leis, ón gCoiste Náisiúnta um Tháirgiúlacht.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú mór tagaithe ar an gnó easportála de bhárr an laghdú cánach atá le fáil ag easportálaithe agus toisc go dtuigtear go bhfuil an t-am ag teacht go mbeidh sé deacair do thionscal maireachtaint maran féidir leis dul san iomaíocht ar mhargaí an domhain.  Annso sa bhaile do bhaineas trial as a bhfeachtas san &ldquo;Ceannuigh Earraí Gaeleach Anois&rdquo; chun a chur 'na luí ar ár muintir gur féidir le gach aon duine acu rud a dhéanamh chun obair a chur ar fáil ach earraí a deintear in Éirinn a cheannach.  Ní deirim gur smaoineamh nua é seo ach bféidir go bhfuil glún ag fás suas anois nach foláir é a mheabhrú dóibh.</P>
    <P>De lean an Foras Tionscal de bheith <Col N="169" /> ag gríosú daoine chun tionscail nua a bhunú tré deontasaí a thabhairt mar chúiteamh ar chuid de sna costasaí móra a ghabhann le gach iarracht nua. D'éirigh go maith leo maidir leis an gcúnamh a thugadar chun monarcháin a chur ar bun i n-áiteanna iargúlta, áiteanna ná maolófar ar an imirce uatha, do réir dealraimh, ach tré tionscail a bhunú.</P>
    <P>Le cúnamh óm' Roinn-se tá cuartú agus forbairt mianraí sa riocht anois gur féidir a rá, le muinín éigin, go bhfuil acmhuinn mianra na tíre, pé mhéid de atá ann, ag déanamh ar bheith forbairthe go h-iomlán don chéad uair riamh.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh an tionscal fíor-tháchtach san, an cuairtíocht, chomh maith le tionscail eile, a chuid custaiméirí a aimsiú ar mhargadh go bhfuil an iomaíocht ag dul i méid ann i n-aghaidh an lae.  Na teoranna a bhain le taistil i gcéin de dheascaibh an chogaidh, agus na constaicí eile a bhí ag cur isteach ar taistil go dtí an Mór-Roinn agus go dtí áiteanna eile, teoranna agus constaicí a thug buntáiste dúinn thar tíortha eile, táid sin imithe ar fad anois, geall leis, agus caithimíd dul san iomaíocht leis an gcuid eile den domhan gan an buntáiste sin.  Tá áthas orm a rá go bhfuil cruthú láidir againn gur caitheadh go fónta an t-airgead a cuireadh ar fáil cheana tré Bhórd Fáilte Éireann. D'éirigh go maith leis an tionscal cuairtíochta sa bhliain 1960 agus ba chóir go mbéadh 1961 'na bhliain mhaith eile.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cúrsaí tráchtála dhe, tá mórán obair fónta dá dhéanamh as mo Roinn i leith rudaí mar, cuir i gcás, athchóiriú na dlithe a bhaineann le cuideachtaí, paitinni, cóipcheart, agus arachas.  Ní foláir na dlithe so go léir a thabhairt suas chun dáta agus tá an obair seo ag dul chun chinn go maith.</P>
    <P>The Estimate of £2,761,000 for 1961/62 shows a net decrease of £909,550 as compared with a total sum of £3,670,550 granted in 1960/61.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from the explanatory statement at the end of Part II of the Estimate at Page 224 in the Book <Col N="170" /> of Estimates, the original net total for 1960/61 was £2,471,000.  To this is added £1,200,000 granted by way of Supplementary Estimate for the purchase of shares in Irish Steel Holdings Ltd.  This brings the total grant to £3,671,000 from which a sum of £450 is deducted in respect of the annual subscription to the International Wheat Council.  This service has been taken over by the Department of Agriculture and is no longer a charge against this Vote.  For comparison purposes therefore a total of £3,670,550 must be taken as representing the 1960/61 Estimate.</P>
    <P>A second Supplementary Estimate for a token sum of £10 in relation to Dundalk Engineering Works was taken too late for inclusion in the printed Estimate, but does not affect the final figures in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The principal increases in 1961/62 are in the provisions for Tourism, £70,000 (Subheads H.1, H.2 and H.3); Córas Tráchtála, £39,000 (subhead I.1); Industrial Development Authority, £35,625 (Subhead J); An Foras Tionscal, £175,000 (Subheads K.1 and K.2); and Repayment of Trade Loan Advances, £28,599 (Subhead R). Increases in other subheads amount to £31,840, bringing the total of increases to £380,064.</P>
    <P>The principal decreases in 1961/62 are in the provisions for Irish Steel Holdings Ltd., £1,200,000&mdash;there is no provision for this service in 1961/62&mdash;and for Córas Tráchtála, £40,000 (Subhead I.2).  Decreases in other subheads amount to £38,252.  To these must be added an increase of £11,362 in the appropriations-in-aid subhead which is equivalent to a decrease in the net grant.  This brings the total of decreases to £1,289,614. The net decrease in the Estimate for 1961/62 compared with 1960/61 is therefore £909,550, as I have already stated.</P>
    <P>The rapid increase in industrial production which became evident in 1959 continued in 1960.  For the year 1960, the provisional index of volume of production, to base 1953 = 100, of manufacturing industry was 120.0 compared with 112.1 in 1959 and 105.7 in 1958.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> The average number of persons engaged in manufacturing industries is provisionally estimated at 149,600 in 1960 compared with 146,100 in 1959. There has been a further reduction in the total unemployment figures as compared with recent years.  On 27th May, 1961, the number on the live register was 49,000 compared with 53,000 on the comparable date in 1960.</P>
    <P>Excluding projects in which the capital involved was less than £10,000 in each case, 45 new industrial undertakings or extensions of existing firms came to notice as having commenced production in the year ended 31st December, 1960.  The aggregate capital investment in these 45 undertakings is estimated at £8 million and the employment potential is estimated to range between 5,000 and 7,000.  Included in the 45 are 30 with external participation.  The total capital involved in these 30 undertakings is estimated at £6,700,000 and the employment potential at 4,500 to 6,000.</P>
    <P>Apart from projects which had already reached the production stage, there were, at the end of the year 1960, 30 factories in course of construction. These additional projects will involve a total capital investment in the region of £13 million and are expected to give employment ultimately to 5,000 workers.</P>
    <P>Industrial proposals before my Department and the Industrial Development Authority, which had reached a stage at which it was considered likely they would come to fruition, numbered 95 on 31st March, 1961.</P>
    <P>The special campaign to attract industries from abroad is being continued and the efforts of the Industrial Development Authority, who are carrying out this work, are continuing to show satisfactory results.  The Authority are pursuing their campaign by visits to Continental countries and the U.S.A., by the appointment of representatives in Europe and the U.S.A., by the publication and distribution of attractive brochures and through advertising.</P>
    <P>A delegation from the Authority visited France during the year and had <Col N="172" /> discussions with important industrialists and banking concerns and made a number of promising contacts.  These contacts are being pursued by the Authority's representative in France with the object of maintaining and stimulating the initial interest awakened there.  During the present year, the Authority are planning to send a delegation to other countries which will include Italy.</P>
    <P>The results so far achieved in attracting foreign investment have been satisfactory.  It would seem that the sustained and widespread publicity abroad is bearing fruit in increasing measure.  Deputies may be interested to know that investment in Irish factories has come from a wide variety of countries, including Great Britain, Germany, the U.S.A., Canada, The Netherlands, France, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, Italy and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme of technical assistance grants administered by my Department, grants may be given of up to one-third of the cost of the engagement of consultants to advise on matters directed to the improvement of productive efficiency.</P>
    <P>Even in the most efficient industrial units, there is a continuing need to keep abreast of technical developments and to take advantage of the latest and best techniques in organisation and management.  The need is, of course, all the greater in the case of factories which for one reason or another may not yet have reached the point of optimum efficiency.</P>
    <P>Technical assistance grants have been made available to encourage industrialists to engage competent, independent consultants to survey their industries, to point out any shortcomings in the organisation of the productive unit, and to advise on the means of remedying such defects and increasing general efficiency and productivity.</P>
    <P>I am greatly impressed by reports received in my Department from a number of firms which had taken advantage of the technical assistance grants scheme.  These reports have been very favourable and have pointed to results such as substantial reductions <Col N="173" /> in costs, increases in production and productivity, expansion of home and export sales, and, in many instances, an addition to the number of workers previously employed as well as an increase in the average earnings of the workers.</P>
    <P>Whether by availing themselves of technical assistance grants or by adopting such other means as they consider appropriate, industrialists throughout the whole range of our manufacturing economy should, if they have not done so already, lose no time in bringing their businesses to the point of maximum efficiency. Amidst many uncertainties and obscurities in the future, certain things stand clear: as time goes on, the trend towards freer international trade is bound to become more marked, international competition keener, and the need to reach and maintain the highest pitch of productive efficiency, therefore, all the greater.  There will be no room in trade or industry for the inept or the inefficient.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreements, the British Board of Trade have requested reviews of the import duties on the following items:&mdash;braid, wheaten breakfast foods, wooden furniture (other than bedsteads), full chrome leather, cotton bags, tableware not of porcelain or china, unglazed floor tiles of clay, files, carpets and drinking glasses.</P>
    <P>The reviews of these import duties are being carried out by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Productivity Committee was established in January, 1959.  It is composed of representatives of management and workers and of educational and other services. The Committee maintained its liaison <Col N="174" /> between the European Productivity Agency and Irish organisations during the past year.  It organised further successful joint labour-management conferences; a two-day seminar held in University College, Dublin, in May, 1960, was followed by a further three-day conference at Skerries, in September.</P>
    <P>The Committee appears to have had considerable success in helping to develop a new outlook on productivity, and I understand that its future plans are aimed at developing a more widespread interest in the importance of increased productivity and the measures necessary to achieve it.</P>
    <P>Progress reported: Committee to sit again.</P>

Is there not an offence there?  Surely the Attorney General cannot now proceed to defend this company again in the Supreme Court?</P>

In that event he shall, with the agreement of the woman (except in case of urgency) arrange for another medical practitioner to attend to provide the services, including, if necessary, attendance at the confinement, on his behalf.  In such a case the health authority is not responsible for any payment to the second practitioner. The remuneration, if any, for his services would be a matter for himself and the doctor for whom he acted as substitute.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that, in County Kerry, difficulty is being experienced by many persons in the lower income group, including old age pensioners and widows, in obtaining a medical services card from the health authority for the area.  I understand that applications for medical cards are dealt with speedily by the health authority and <Col N="182" /> that there are no arrears of applications awaiting decision by it.</P>
      <P>The determination of an applicant's eligibility for a medical card is entirely a matter for the Kerry County Council as health authority for that area.  Each application is considered on its merits.  No fixed means scale is observed but the general circumstances and income of the applicant's household are taken into account. This may result in the refusal of individual applications, including sometimes those of old age pensioners and widows, where the circumstances of the applicant's household, generally, are reasonably good and it is felt by the health authority that the provision of private medical services for the applicant would not cause hardship to the family.</P>
      <P>Should the Deputy, however, be aware of a particular instance in which it appears that a refusal to issue a medical card has resulted, or is likely to result, in genuine hardship, I shall have inquiries made from the Council, if he furnishes me with details of the case.  While I am prepared to make these inquiries, I wish to make it clear that I have no functions concerning the determination of eligibility for general medical services in individual cases under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, this being entirely a matter for the health authority, as I have already mentioned.</P>

      <P>The number of applications received in the ten months&mdash;April, 1960, to January, 1961&mdash;was 1,560, or 536 less than in the four months February to May, 1961.</P>

      <P>No main lines have been closed.</P>
      <P>I am informed by C.I.E. that no separate figures are kept which would show the net contribution to the improved financial position of C.I.E. due to the closing of branch lines and no accurate estimate could be made without considerable research.  The closing of these lines has led to considerable changes in the pattern of traffic, but the bulk of the former railway traffic has been retained by the Board.  The original estimated savings of expenditure, due to the closing of branch lines, have been realised and for the year ended 31/3/'61 these savings amounted to approximately £214,000. This figure, which is the saving effected by providing services by road instead of by rail in the areas concerned, can be taken therefore as broadly representing the net contribution made to the financial position of C.I.E. by the closing of the branch lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power why the opening of the Cork Airport will be delayed for some six weeks from the date already announced, namely, 1st September, 1961, when the cement strike was not of that duration; if there is any hope that the airport might still be opened before the date now proposed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The delivery of supplies of cement from the factories ceased on 29th April and supplies were resumed on 5th June.  Owing to the very high consumption of cement at Cork Airport, no substantial stock was held when deliveries ceased.  Hence, all major constructional work involving the use of cement was retarded by <Col N="194" /> a minimum of five weeks working time. The postponement of the date for commencement of restricted operations by six instead of five weeks is due to several factors.  The interruption occurred at the best time of the year for outdoor construction and it may well take longer in the autumn to recover the time lost.  It is also necessary to bring the technical facilities to a more advanced stage of completion to meet the less favourable weather conditions which are to be expected later in the year.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the past eighteen months have been most unfavourable to constructional work. Weather conditions in 1960 were the worst experienced for a record number of years.  In spite of this, the work at Cork Airport had been pressed forward to the extent that I was confident that the difficulties would be surmounted to allow the commencement of operations on 1st September.  It is a great disappointment to me that this further difficulty has negatived the exceptional earlier efforts which had been made by all concerned.</P>
      <P>I want to impress on the House that the commissioning of a new international airport is no light matter. Stringent requirements have to be met in relation to aeronautical communications, landing aids and air traffic control procedures.  These involve the installation of complicated electrical cabling, landing lights and advanced electronic instruments.  Many people, seeing a completed runway, may feel that no more is required but I assure them that this, though a primary requirement, is far from the only one.  Even to achieve the new date of 16th October, exceptional efforts are required from all concerned in the provision of Cork Airport.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the provisions of the Insurance Acts relating to the taking of legal proceedings against companies, I would refer the Deputies to the reply which I gave to a Question on this subject on 7th June, 1961.  The Insurance Acts provide that a company which issues a policy of industrial assurance which is illegal or <i>ultra vires,</i> shall be liable to repay to the <Col N="196" /> policy holder any premiums paid under the policy.</P>
    <P>Information regarding the policies issued in the case referred to by the Deputies did not come to light until the recent action in the High Court was reported, and it was not possible, therefore, to consider the question of legal proceedings before the statutory period had actually expired.</P>
    <P>As I announced some time ago, the legislation relating to insurance is at present being reviewed in my Department, and consideration will be given to the question whether any change in the law would be desirable in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>In the past twenty-one years seven requests either for the repeal of Combined Purchasing legislation or for amendment thereof to enable local traders to supply the requirements of local institutions were received in my Department.  I am satisfied that the Combined Purchasing Scheme enables local authorities to purchase commodities of a uniform standard at more favourable prices than would be obtained under local contracts and that it would not be in the interests of the general body of ratepayers to amend the law in the manner suggested.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been dealing with the new capital investment in Irish Steel Holdings for the purpose of extending the company's activities.</P>
      <P>The Irish Steel Holdings Limited, Act, 1960, permits the Company to increase its share capital to £4 million, to be subscribed, as required, by the Minister for Finance.  All major contracts in connection with the Company's development programme have now been placed.  Payments made in respect of commitments to 31st March, 1961&mdash;excluding expenditure amounting to £30,000 which has been charged against the Company's own resources &mdash;total £1.4 million approximately.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the expansion plans of the steel works at Haulbowline Island will take at least three years to complete.</P>
      <P>Virtually a new steelworks is being built on the site of the existing one; and I would like to pay tribute to management and workers at Haulbowline for their efforts which have resulted in not only maintaining but actually increasing output despite the large-scale development which is going on.  It is estimated that deliveries to the home market in the year 1960-61 will be up by as much as 15 per cent. on deliveries in 1959-60.</P>
      <P>Payments, as approved by Dáil Éireann on 2nd March, 1961, were made during 1960/61 to mitigate the hardships of shop grade workers of the former Great Northern Railway workshops at Dundalk who were found to be temporarily or permanently redundant.</P>
      <P>Payments were at the rate of 30/- and 50/- a week for single and married men respectively during temporary disemployment with increases equal to the benefits lost in the case of workers who were deprived of unemployment assistance owing to the receipt of these <i>ex gratia</i> payments. All payments made in respect of temporary disemployment were deducted from severance payments in any case where a worker who being first declared temporarily redundant was subsequently declared permanently redundant. Severance payments were at the rate of one month's pay for each complete year of service up to a maximum of 24.  Actual payments during 1960-61 were : stand-off pay, £6,275, severance pay, £143,149.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are uncertainties existing <Col N="213" /> which preclude the termination of the scheme just at present but I expect that the position regarding the future employment prospects of the workers will very soon be sufficiently clear to allow of the cessation of these <i>ex gratia</i> payments.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Grass Meal (Production) (Amendment) Act, 1959, a new company&mdash;Min Fhéir (1959) Teoranta&mdash;with share capital of £200,000 to be subscribed by the Minister for Finance has been formed and drainage operations have commenced on land acquired at Geesala, County Mayo.  It is hoped to commence the sowing of grass on a small scale and the construction of a grass-drying plant in the course of the year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I arranged for the issue through the post of a series of leaflets urging the public to &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo;.  I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Press, the individuals and the organisations who lent their support to the idea behind this campaign and I would urge them to continue their support for Irish products.</P>
    <P>The gross national product is provisionally estimated to have increased in 1960 by 4 per cent. compared with 1959 as against an annual increase of 2 per cent. envisaged in the Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  It is pleasant to be able to record a further year of progress and expanding economic activity and to thank all sections of the community, who by their co-operation, have enabled us to exceed the target set in that programme.</P>
    <P>The increasing number of factories established by external interests to cater for export markets should lay the foundation for a further expansion in industrial output and employment but we must not overlook the vital part which has been and is being played by our own people&mdash;by the Irish industrialists who have steadily increased their output and who are now meeting with increasing success in export markets and by the Irish workers who have shown skill and adaptability and a willingness to co-operate in the expansion of production and the adoption of new and more efficient methods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> I would urge any of our industrialists who have not yet done so to examine the possibility of expanding into export markets.  The rewards are considerable from the points of view both of the individual and of the nation as a whole.  I would also urge trade unionists and workers to co-operate in the efforts of employers to increase exports.  By doing so they will not only be securing their own future, through the increased prosperity of the concerns in which they work; they will also be helping in the provision of employment for fellow citizens who might otherwise have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>The State has continued to do its part to stimulate increased industrial activity.  During the past financial year An Foras Tionscal approved grants amounting to £1,591,250 for projects located in the undeveloped areas, bringing the total provision for such grants to £4,614,600.  Of this amount grants totalling £2,115,700 were paid to 31st March, 1961, leaving outstanding commitments of £2,498,900.  The total capital investment involved in the approved projects amounts to over £11 million and it is expected that they will give employment to over 8,000 persons.  Sixty-one projects assisted by An Foras Tionscal are in production in the undeveloped areas and there are 29 other projects for which grants have been promised and which are in varying stages of development.  A substantial number of these projects are related mainly to exports.</P>
    <P>The increase of £150,000 in this year's provision for the undeveloped areas, as compared with last year's may be taken as an indication that the tempo of industrial development is still increasing in the undeveloped areas and that commitments entered into by An Foras Tionscal in respect of projects which have not yet reached the grant paying stage, warrant an increase of this order.</P>
    <P>As regards grants by An Foras Tionscal for industries outside the undeveloped areas, during the year ended 31st March, 1961, An Foras Tionscal approved grants amounting to £1,686,000, bringing the total grants approved for such projects to £2,779,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> Of this latter sum, grants totalling £537,000 were paid to 31st March, 1961, leaving outstanding commitments of £2,242,000.  The total capital investment in the 34 approved projects amounts to about £15½ millon.  It is estimated that these projects, which are mainly in the export field, will employ about 6,500 persons.</P>
    <P>Deputies will probably be aware, particularly from local press reports, that I have been under considerable pressure, especially in the past few months, to abolish the distinction between the undeveloped areas and the rest of the country, thereby removing the disparity in the maximum grants available for industry as between the undeveloped areas and the rest of the country.  In support of this view, it is sometimes suggested that the labour pool in the parts of the existing scheduled areas will be exhausted shortly and that the labour demands of projects sited in these areas can then only be met by importing labour from other parts of or outside the undeveloped areas.  Also, it is suggested that the rate of industrial development in the undeveloped areas has been enormous, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the country.  This is not so; figures available to me disprove conclusively this suggestion.  As regards the suggestion that the labour pool in the undeveloped areas will shortly be exhausted, I feel that we are still some distance from that goal.</P>
    <P>I do believe, however, that the time is approaching when a review must be undertaken of the original concept of the undeveloped areas and of the industrial grants scheme.  Among the matters which would be covered by such a review would be the desirability of making greater use of the discretionary authority granted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Undeveloped Areas Acts to enable other parts of the country to qualify for the more favourable grants applicable in the undeveloped areas. Experience of the industrial grants scheme to date makes it clear that a review of the type mentioned would be a complicated and lengthy process. <Col N="216" /> Pending the undertaking and completion of such a review, it will be my general policy to continue to schedule areas outside the undeveloped areas only where they are &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; areas contiguous to the undeveloped areas proper.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, however, to make certain limited amendments of the legislation in the near future and a Bill containing these amendments was introduced to-day.  Its main purpose is to provide additional moneys for the payment of industrial grants by An Foras Tionscal: it is now clear that the amount of money authorised for industrial grants, up to 31st December, 1963, is likely to be committed well in advance of that date.</P>
    <P>The exploration and development of our mineral resources continued at a steady pace during the past year.  The agreement which was concluded with American interests for the carrying out of a comprehensive scheme of exploration for oil and natural gas in this country came into force on the enactment of the Petroleum and other Minerals Development Act, 1960, and the granting of an exploration licence to Ambassador Irish Oil Ltd. in March, 1960.  The Company furnished me with a report on their first year's operations up to the end of March, 1961.  The report shows that the Company are proceeding in accordance with the terms of the agreement and the exploration licence.  They carried out geological and other investigations over all areas considered prospective throughout the year, and they had a seismic survey undertaken in the midland and north-western counties in the period October to December, 1960. The results of the investigations and survey are stated to have been encouraging.  The Company is at present carrying out an overwater seismic survey along the coast from Galway to Tralee.</P>
    <P>I have recently agreed to proposals for the reorganisation of the structure of the oil exploration group.  These proposals involve the dissolution of the Irish Company and its replacement by American registered subsidiaries of Ambassador Oil Corporation, Continental Oil Company of Texas, <Col N="217" /> and the Ohio Oil Company.  I am satisfied that the Continental and Ohio Oil Companies are efficient and reputable and that they have at their disposal financial and technical resources which will enable the work of exploring for oil in this country to be completed more quickly and will thus make available sooner any benefits that would accrue to the country from the discovery of oil.</P>
    <P>St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd. continued in production of copper and pyrites at Avoca throughout the year giving employment to about 500 workers.  A decline in the world price of copper during the second half of 1960 did not help the Company.  There has, however, been some recovery in copper prices recently and this, together with increasing production and an improvement in the grade of copper produced, should put the Company's operations on a better basis.</P>
    <P>The new Abbeytown Mining Co. Ltd. which resumed production of lead and zinc at Abbeytown, County Sligo, in 1959 continued in production throughout the past year.  Exploration work for copper at Allihies, County Cork, by the Emerald Isle Mining Co. Ltd. has continued but the stage has not yet been reached where the mine can be brought into production.  There has recently been an infusion of fresh capital into the venture by Denison Mines of Canada, a large scale uranium company and it is understood that an extensive drilling programme will be carried out in the area in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The exploration in the Leinster and Connaught coalfield which is being financed from American Grant Counterpart Funds is progressing satisfactorily. The drilling so far carried out has been effective in giving precise information as to the existence of coal, the thickness of the seams and the quality of the coal in certain areas, and as to the absence of coal in other areas.  The drilling campaigns in both coalfields are still some way short of completion and the full significance of the results being obtained cannot be deduced until information <Col N="218" /> has been gathered from all the planned boreholes.</P>
    <P>A scheme of technical assistance grants for private exploration of minerals in accordance with the White Paper Programme for Economic Expansion is also in operation.  Grants of up to one-half of the cost may be given where there are likely to be commercially workable deposits of minerals in an area and their development is desirable in the national interest.  During the past year Canadian and American firms have shown a continuing interest in the investigation of the mineral resources of the country.  Facilities were granted to some of these firms to enable them to carry out exploration work.</P>
    <P>Exports in 1960 attained the record level of £152.4 million, representing an increase of £21.7 million (or 16.6 per cent.) over the 1959 figure.  Imports totalled £226.4 million an increase of £13.7 million (or 6.5 per cent.) over the previous highest figure of £212.6 million attained in 1959.  In the result the import excess, which was £81.9 million in 1959, fell by £7.9 million to £74 million in 1960.</P>
    <P>The substantial improvement in export trade affected all export groupings, the most marked improvement being in the category &ldquo;Other Raw Materials and Manufactured Goods&rdquo; which showed a rise of £8 million over 1959.  Exports of food, drink and tobacco increased by £7.6 million, and of live animals by £5.6 million.  A feature of the latter trade was its change in structure, the emphasis in 1960 being on fat instead of store cattle.  While imports exceeded the 1959 figure by £13.8 million, a very large part of that amount, namely £12.7 million was in respect of materials for manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for a further extension of the activities of Córas Tráchtála in accordance with the Government's policy of intensifying export promotion activity.  It has been arranged that the Board will take over general responsibility for the promotion of design in industry.  A sum of £40,000 is being provided this year to continue the advertising and promotion <Col N="219" /> of Irish whiskey in the U.S.A.. While results are necessarily slow, they indicate a measure of success in stimulating interest in Irish whiskey in the American market.  Export sales to the United States in the past two years were 57,726 proof gallons in 1959 and 52,905 proof gallons in 1960, representing in each year a substantial increase over the 1955 export sales figure of 39,513 proof gallons which was the previous highest total. The Irish whiskey distillers have been bearing a substantial and increasing share of the cost of the joint campaign of institutional and brand advertising. With the reduced subvention from State funds, the distillers must now assume a greater share of the cost.</P>
    <P>Encouraging as has been the expansion of our industrial exports we must not allow ourselves to be lulled into any false sense of security.  It should be obvious to everybody that it will become progressively more difficult for us to sell in certain export markets, namely the Common Market and the EFTA Market.  The gradual reduction of tariff barriers between the members of each of these groups will naturally intensify competition in their markets. For us this is particularly important in so far as the British market is concerned. We have had the substantial advantage of free entry.  That advantage will contract in value according as other countries approach and achieve free entry.  There is, as Deputies will be aware, the possibility, if not indeed the probability, that some re-grouping may occur in the not too distant future which may further affect our competitive position in the British market.  It is imperative, therefore, that we should constantly strive for greater efficiency if we are to maintain, not to say expand, our exports even to our nearest market.</P>
    <P>The necessity to strive constantly for greater efficiency is not however limited to the export trade.  It applies with equal force and urgency to manufacture for the home market.  For some years past, manufacturers have been warned of the possibility of Ireland becoming associated with some European free trade movement which <Col N="220" /> would involve the reduction and eventual elimination of tariffs and the abandonment of other forms of protection. Time and again it has been emphasised that in the light of this possibility it was incumbent on every manufacturer to make increased efficiency his first concern.</P>
    <P>I am sure that most manufacturers took these warnings seriously, but I fear that the atmosphere of alertness which prevailed when the proposal for a European Free Trade area was first under active consideration may have relaxed with the abandonment of that proposal and that with the passage of time some at least of our manufacturers may allow themselves to be lulled into a false sense of security. This would be a grave mistake.  It is obvious that trading relationships in Europe may change, and change quickly.  In this situation the only sensible course for our manufacturers is to plan their business, as stated by the Taoiseach during the course of a recent speech at Killarney, on the assumption that if a Western European economic community, including Britain, comes about, this country will go along with it, and will have to accept, with membership, an obligation to dismantle our industrial tariffs and quotas over some period of years.</P>
    <P>It has been several times said to me that this is a difficult period for manufacturers because they cannot forecast the future.  I do not accept this.  Any sensible manufacturer will be doing himself good, and doing well by the country, if he assumes that the era of protection is ending and if he puts himself, by all the means at his disposal, in a position to meet unrestricted competition in the home market.</P>
    <P>It may be recalled that in the course of my speech last year on the Estimates for my Department I ventured the opinion that the coming year would bring significant progress in the tourist industry.  I think it will be agreed that that confidence has to a great extent been justified.  Estimated income from visitors in 1960 reached a record figure of £42.4 million compared with £37.8 million in 1959.  This means that in the three-year period since 1957 there has <Col N="221" /> been an increase of about 30% in earnings from this source.</P>
    <P>As I also mentioned last year, shortage of hotel accommodation was threatening to become the chief barrier to the further development of the industry and so certain new grant and tax incentives were introduced in January, 1960, to encourage the expansion and improvement of such accommodation.  These incentives have already produced beneficial results. During 1960, 76 hotel projects were undertaken which have resulted, <i>inter alia,</i> in the provision of more than 600 new bedrooms.  The overall capital investment involved in these projects was of the order of £1 million.  Other projects have been initiated which will result in a substantial increase in the volume of accommodation for visitors.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants for the development of major tourist resorts is now well under way and proposals for projects at the various resorts are taking firmer shape.  The nature of these projects, however, calls for careful co-ordination between Bord Fáilte Éireann and the local interest concerned and for that reason progress in the initial stages is necessarily slow.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the Fair Trade Commission completed their inquiry into the supply and distribution of motor spirit and motor lubricating oil and they have recently furnished me with their Report.  The Report is at present being studied and it will be published in due course.  The Commission have recently held an inquiry into certain aspects of the supply and distribution of cookers and ranges.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the Commission have also made Fair Trading Rules relating to entry into the wholesale trade in domestic and household electrical appliances.  In addition, the Commission continued to keep under review the operation of Orders and Fair Trading Rules and, as in previous years, they gave advice and assistance to manufacturers and traders who experienced difficulties in relation to the supply and distribution of goods not covered by existing Rules or Orders.</P>
    <P>Recent strikes in essential industries <Col N="222" />&mdash;an example was the C.I.E. bus strike &mdash;have prompted me to consider whether our present industrial relations machinery can be improved.  This question is at present under examination but no decisions have as yet been taken.  Before a decision is made, I will arrange consultation with representatives of employers and workers.</P>
    <P>The Government have introduced legislation to provide for increased holidays for workers.  At present, in addition to the public holidays or days in lieu, workers are entitled to one week's annual leave with pay.  Very many workers have, through collective bargaining, secured an additional week's annual leave and the new legislation will make this standard of two weeks' holidays, plus the Public Holidays or compensatory days off, a statutory minimum.  It is the Government's hope to have this legislation in force so that it will benefit workers in the coming holiday season.</P>
    <P>The review of insurance legislation is at present proceeding.  While an amount of work has been done, it will not be possible to introduce a comprehensive amending Bill in the present session.  Present indications are that the Bill will not provide for any radical changes in the existing law.</P>
    <P>It will probably be necessary, however, to introduce a special Bill to increase the limit of £2,000,000 for export credit insurance provided for in Section 2 of the Insurance Act, 1953. The increase in our export trade is tending to make that limit too low.</P>
    <P>An Cheard Comhairle was established in April, 1960, under the Apprenticeship Act, 1959.  Its function is to secure improvements in existing arrangements for the recruitment and training of apprentices.  An Chomhairle is representative of employers, workers and educational interests.  Its first task was to determine policy and I am glad to be able to report that, within a few months of its establishment, An Chomhairle agreed unanimously on a progressive and imaginative statement of policy.</P>
    <P>The next step in the progress of An Chomhairle&mdash;and this is already in hands&mdash;is promotional in nature.  It <Col N="223" /> must attempt to create a climate of opinion among the various interests concerned which will be favourable to change and improvement.  It must, at the same time, commence to implement its policy in the various craft trades.  I understand that An Chomhairle hopes, in the near future, to commence the examination of a number of trades under the Act and, since it cannot examine all the Trades simultaneously, to promote voluntary efforts at improvement in a number of other trades.</P>
    <P>Apprenticeship as a method of training can be regarded as successful only if it produces an adequate and adaptable force of skilled men to meet the problems arising in an era of industrial expansion.  The apprenticeship system in Ireland is not at present geared to do this.  An Cheard Chomhairle has the important, but difficult, task of securing the necessary changes. It has made a good start; but if it is to make rapid progress it must have the goodwill and co-operation of the trade unions and the employers.  One thing is certain, we cannot allow the impetus which has been achieved to be checked in the years to come by shortage of skilled men, and by deficiencies in skill arising from inadequate training methods.  It is up to An Chomhairle to use its powers firmly, but fairly, to see to it that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made with the drafting of legislation to amend and consolidate the Companies Acts.  In addition to effecting such amendments as have been shown to be desirable, it is intended that the new Act will bring together in a single measure all the law in this field, at present scattered throughout a number of enactments. It is not possible as yet to say when the Bill will be introduced, but every effort is being made to expedite its preparation.</P>
    <P>A review of the law relating to trade marks, designs and patents is being carried out by the Patents Office in order <i>inter alia</i> to meet certain changes in the international Convention <Col N="224" /> on these matters, to which this country is a party, and also to keep in line with the international trend in trade mark design and patent practice.  It is already clear that legislative proposals will have to be submitted to the Dáil in due course.</P>
    <P>A review of the law of copyright, which is contained in the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Acts, 1927-1958, has been completed and I hope to have a Bill prepared on the subject before very long which will provide for the protection of sound and television broadcasts and for various other amendments of the law.</P>
    <P>That represents the statement as already prepared on the administration of the Department of Industry and Commerce during the past year.  If there are any other details or facts the House would like me to elucidate, I shall be glad to do so in my reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The most significant fact about the Minister's speech, was, I think, the omission from it of any reference to the cost of living.  The Minister gave a review of the activities of his Department and covered a great number of topics without making a single reference to the cost of living and, in particular, any reference to the recently published figures which show a further rise in the consumer price index.  Since 1957, when this Government were elected, there has been a continuous rise in the cost of living. In 1957, the February index, just before the present Government were elected, stood at 135.  The latest figure, which was issued for the middle of May, 1961, shows that it now stands at 150.37.  This increase in the cost of living has occurred during a period in which there has been a continuous reduction in import prices.  The Government have had the advantage of a fall in import prices compared with the conditions which existed during the term of office of the previous Government when import prices were rising.  The rise in the cost of living, therefore, is all the more remarkable now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, individual items have shown a very substantial <Col N="225" /> increase.  As well as the consumer price index, food items have increased on the latest figures by 0.97 of a point and sundries by 0.68, so that food alone has increased by about 17 points since 1957.  Clothing has increased by over four points and housing and sundries by 11 points.  In addition to these items, there have been very considerable increases in other commodities widely consumed, such as tinned salmon, 15 per cent.; condensed milk, 4 per cent.; biscuits, 10 per cent.; cocoa, 12½ per cent.; and other groceries, 15½ per cent.  At the same time bus fares have increased by no less than 14 per cent. and train fares by 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I say, these increases occurred at a time when import prices were falling and we have the position that, over the past four years, there has been a very substantial increase in the cost of living.  The very latest figure issued, the consumer price index, shows a further rise.  It is of some significance, I think, that the Minister omitted to make any reference to these in the course of his remarks.  He also omitted to indicate what the prospects will be for the future.  The Taoiseach was reported in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 8th July, 1956, as stating that &ldquo;We can hold out a genuine prospect of price stability.&rdquo; That statement was made at a time when import prices were rising.  There has been a continuous decline in import prices during the past four years but, despite that, there has been this substantial and continuous increase in the cost of living, an increase affecting all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>In addition to the items I have mentioned, many other items, affecting in particular the lower paid sections in the community and large families, have increased in price.  Flour has increased by 89 per cent.  Bread has increased by 69 per cent.  Butter has increased by 22 per cent.  We have the situation therefore that, although we have reduced the price paid for wheat to our own producers, we are charging our own consumers substantially more for bread and substantially more for flour. We are also charging them substantially <Col N="226" /> more for butter.  These increases have to be borne by those same people who are obliged to bear the impact of the increases in bus fares and train fares and who have, at the same time, to meet increased social welfare contributions by reason of a recent decision.  They are also obliged to pay an increased cost of 10/- as compared with 6/- for hospital accommodation under our health services.</P>
    <P>These increases are all being borne by people who were promised in 1956 that there was a genuine prospect of price stability.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously with that undertaking being given, the present Government undertook, if elected, to provide over a five-year period 100,000 new jobs.  That programme was outlined in very considerable detail and, in order to have a certain margin or enough leeway, the figure for any specific year was not strictly defined but, over a five-year period, it was estimated that the target would be achieved.  Now, after four years in which this Government has had the advantage of stable economic conditions, a comfortable majority in the House, and a co-operative and constructive Opposition, we find that, although there has been an expansion in industrial production, the figures quoted by the Minister show that last year only 3,400 additional people secured employment in manufacturing industry.  It is, I think, notable that, despite the increase in industrial production, the increase in the numbers employed in manufacturing industry is not great.  Indeed, the increase in production that has occurred here is lower than the average European increase.</P>
    <P>Instead of having reached the target set out in 1956 by the people who now constitute the Government, we find that this year, according to the figures published in the <i>Economics Statistics</i> issued at Budget time, there are now 51,000 fewer people employed in Ireland as compared with the number employed in 1956.  Side by side with that decrease, very large numbers have emigrated, and continue to do so.  Some few months ago, in reply to a question in the British House of Commons, <Col N="227" /> figures were published which showed that the number of working emigrants who went into Britain for the first time from the Republic in 1959 was 64,000; in 1958, the number was 58,000.  These figures are based on the number of insurance cards issued to people entering employment in Britain for the first time from the country.  In the short space of two years, we have the position, therefore, in which not only have we fewer people employed here as compared with 1956 but, at the same time, we have continuous and sustained emigration to Britain.  In the same period this country has made very substantial State investments.  It is disappointing to find that for the amount of money invested the return is comparatively small.</P>
    <P>I have here before me the report of An Foras Tionscal.  I noted the figures contained in the Minister's speech.  In relation to investment both from State sources and other capital invested in projects since the initiation of An Foras Tionscal, and including grants under the Industrial Grants Act, we find that for a total investment of over £7,000,000 the total number employed is estimated at 5,800.  I noted, too, from the Minister's speech that the total capital investment in 34 approved projects amounted to £15,500,000 and it was estimated that these projects would employ 6,500 persons.  Whether the earlier or later figure is taken, for a total investment of that magnitude the number employed is not very considerable. Indeed, only a slight impact was made on the problem that has to be surmounted here.</P>
    <P>I have always held the view and I am convinced that progress in industry is essential, if we are to provide employment for our own people.  The figures taken over any period of years show that the trend away from the rural areas is continuous.  The most optimistic hope would be that we could maintain the existing level of employment in agriculture.  We cannot hope for an increase in agricultural employment.  If, therefore, we are to provide employment for those persons who leave agricultural occupations as well as for the boys and <Col N="228" /> girls who reach manhood or womanhood each year, we must seek opportunities through industrial development and expansion.  The prospects of providing increased employment to a very considerable extent depend on such expansion and development.  It is, therefore, of vital interest to the country that we should consider the developments that are taking place and carefully examine the return which is shown for the large-scale investment being made from both State and private sources.</P>
    <P>It is satisfactory to note that industrial production last year increased and that the trend is in the right direction but it is well to keep that matter in proper perspective because compared with the expansion in industrial production in other European countries, we still lag behind many of those countries and our increase is not up to the European average.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the developments likely to take place with the advent of the Common Market. The House and industrialists will be anxious to hear what steps the Minister and the Department of Industry and Commerce have taken to keep industrialists abreast of possible development in that field.  This is a matter which has been the subject of considerable Press comment and interest for a number of years.</P>
    <P>While various changes and alterations in the attitudes of various countries have been canvassed from time to time, the actual developments have been in certain respects slight.  It does appear from references in our own newspapers and in the British Press and from recent statements in the British Parliament as though the British Government are giving this matter closer attention than was the case up to now.  If that is so, and if the British Government reach a decision on it, our interests will be vitally affected.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that whatever decision is reached in regard to the Common Market must be a national decision and not a Party one.  The welfare of the nation is involved and whatever action is taken will have <Col N="229" /> permanent and serious consequences which will affect our economic interests. It is important, however, that, at this stage, before a decision is taken or before any further developments occur elsewhere, we should generally gear ourselves to meet the likely consequences of a decision to join or to be associated with the Common Market. For these reasons, the Department of Industry and Commerce should take steps to advise manufacturers and keep them informed on this matter.</P>
    <P>Very many references have been made by persons qualified to express an opinion, by economists, by people who write on these subjects, to the effect that this development, whether it is in the form of membership of the Common Market or of a European Free Trade Area, will mean, as the Minister said, stronger and fiercer competition for Irish industry.  That competition will not be confined to the domestic market; we will have to meet it on the British market also.</P>
    <P>It has been a tradition of this Party to see that the trade which we have with Britain is developed and exploited to the full.  At the present time the trade between this country and Britain amounts to over £200,000,000 annually, on a two-way basis and, by any standards, that is a sizable sum.  Our interests will be directly affected by the action the British Government decide to take.  With the problems which will concern many industries, with growing competition not only on the home market but also in the export market, it is important that our industrialists should develop their efficiency and gear themselves on that basis.</P>
    <P>What that will involve for industrial concerns here is a matter on which those directly affected are probably in the best position to express an opinion or to have views, but from the consideration which has already been given to the matter, it would appear that it will involve structural changes in industry.  Developments in Britain and Western Europe tend towards larger units.  In some cases, there have been mergers of existing firms; in other cases, firms have been the subject of take-over operations; in <Col N="230" /> still other cases, firms make agreements in regard to marketing technical information, sales, distribution, production, and so on.  In this country, firms, generally, are relatively small and more numerous so that mergers or agreements are less easily accomplished.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, important that there should be the maximum co-operation possible.  In that regard, discussions might well be initiated under the auspices of the Department of Industry and Commerce with the trading bodies concerned, representatives of manufacturers, the Federation of Irish Industries, the F.U.E. and the trade unions because all concerned have a vital interest in this matter.  In the likely absence here of the developments which have occurred elsewhere because of the size of the industrial units here, there is a very strong case for the Minister and the Department taking the initiative to secure co-operation and agreement between the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>If discussions were initiated on this matter, I have no doubt they would have beneficial results, first of all, in securing as far as possible a correct appraisal of the likely consequences and of the prospect of action being taken to meet the situation which would develop and then it would be necessary to provide the basis on which there could be further progress and development.  This is a matter that will tax the resources of our industrialists and manufacturers.  It involves not merely our welfare but the welfare of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The development of the tourist industry is one of the brightest prospects before this country and one which affords an opportunity for substantial development in the future.  The figures for last year show a further increase in the number of visitors here as well as an increase in tourist earnings. Again, it is satisfactory to note that increase but, from figures published in the last report of An Bord Fáilte, the increase in income for the year ending the 31st March, 1960, showed that this country was less noteworthy than other European countries according to the annual reports of the O.E.E.C.  Tourrism <Col N="231" /> Committee.  For the years 1955 to 1958 there was an increase in tourist income of 12 per cent. for this country. In the case of Britain it was 25 per cent.: West Germany, 64 per cent.; France 30 per cent.; Switzerland, 5 per cent; Italy, 48 per cent. and Austria, 103 per cent.  With the exception of Italy, where the potential is probably already pretty fully developed, this country was less than half the lowest figure for increased income. Therefore it is important that we should exploit that development to the full.</P>
    <P>The work which An Bord Fáilte are doing in collaboration with individual organisations has contributed a great deal towards expansion and improvement in that regard.  I have referred here on previous occasions to the grants and loans provided for hoteliers who wish to expand accommodation and while these facilities have been availed of to a considerable extent&mdash;even in the past year An Bord Fáilte estimated approximately £750,000 was being spent by hoteliers in providing increased accommodation either in the way of new buildings or additions providing up-to-date accommodation&mdash;it seems to me that one of the deterrents in this connection is the fear of revaluation and that hoteliers are prevented from availing of the opportunities which exist because of the fear of revaluation.  That is one of the matters that I believe should be the subject of consideration by the Department as well as by An Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Very substantial efforts have been made to attract tourists by the promotion of special events of tourist interest.  These have been proved to be of very considerable value.  I think the most remarkable example is the very considerable contribution which the Irish Hospital Trust has made in that respect, the international golf competition at Woodbrook which has been held there for the past few years. That has been most successful and has attracted world-wide attention, providing this country with the opportunity of seeing some world-famous golfers in competition with our own <Col N="232" /> equally famous golfers.  Now, the decision that has been announced that for 1962 the Irish Sweep Derby which will take place at the Curragh will probably be the most valuable race in the world, has directed attention not only to this country but also to the value of Irish bloodstock.</P>
    <P>These individual undertakings by the Irish Hospital Trust as well as other efforts that are being made all contribute to a very considerable extent towards developing the tourist trade.  We have vast, untapped resources in America.  According to the most recent figures we have an increased number of visitors from the United States but in view of the fact that this country has in the U.S.A. over 20 million, or perhaps 25 million people of Irish birth or extraction, we have there a potential that has not been fully and adequately developed. At present we have the enormous advantage, from a prestige point of view, of the fact that the President of America is of Irish extraction.  We should exploit these advantages to the full and seek, as I think was once said by Deputy Norton when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, to secure capital from the United States, as he did from families of Irish birth or extraction taking a holiday every ten years in this country which would have a most salutary effect on our economy.</P>
    <P>It is surprising how little is known of this country in the United States. It is only when promotional activities are undertaken, when efforts are made by Government Departments, by Government missions or by a State body, or even by private enterprise or when, in some other way, trade missions or individual manufacturers go to the United States that they realise the vast potential that is there and the problem of tackling it effectively.  We now have the opportunity, which was not available previously and which has to a considerable extent focussed attention on this country, of exploiting an advantage which we can utilise to the benefit of our economy and, I have no doubt, to the benefit of our already good relationship with the United States.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> During the Minister's remarks he referred to the fact that there was a change in the arrangement under which oil development would be undertaken here.  Does this decision mean that the Ambassador Irish Oil Company ceases to exist and if so could he state what is the financial strength of the new company?  Are there Irish directors and if so, what is the extent of the Irish holding in the company?  Could he also say what alteration in the programme does this change envisage and to whom is the prospecting licence now available?</P>
    <P>As I understood from the Minister's remarks, there is now a joint company. Previously there was Ambassador Oil Company and that company had furnished a report for their first year's working.  Now we find that that having been completed there is a reorganisation of the structure of the group and they have been replaced by American-registered subsidiaries of Ambassador Oil Corporation, the Continental Oil Company of Texas and the Ohio Oil Company.  The Minister is satisfied as to the reputation of these companies and their financial resources but it does mark a very substantial change from the arrangement which was previously made.  I believe we are entitled to further information on this matter.</P>
    <P>In connection with an announcement which was made some time ago and which was referred to here last week I would like again to refer to the decision of the Board of Aerlinte to be associated with the new hotel company here in the establishment and equipment of three new hotels.  It is accepted that we need here substantially increased and improved hotel accommodation and the decision to establish these hotels is in no way questioned.  However, it does seem a matter on which the House is entitled to express an opinion, that the association of an air company&mdash;particularly an air company which has recently embarked on the very competitive and costly transatlantic air service and which has already a full plate&mdash;with a hotel project is something which was certainly not envisaged at the time the <Col N="234" /> company was set up and, in view of the large number of privately-owned hotels and private companies, something which might better be left to private enterprise.  As I understood from the remarks of the Minister for Transport and Power, the companies concerned declined to go ahead with the project unless Aerlinte were associated with it.  In view of the size of the Aerlinte investment that seems a somewhat strange qualification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the over-all responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce for industrial development, I was anxious to make a reference to it.  However, I do not wish to pursue the matter except to say I would be glad to hear a statement from the Minister in reply.</P>
      <P>Since the end of the war this country has made many trade agreements with Continental countries as well as trade agreements with Britain. Without exception the trade balance between this country and these Continental countries is heavily adverse. While it was inevitable and natural at the end of the war period, in view of our requirements of many commodities and the leeway that had to be made up from the war years, that imports from these countries would be considerable, the time has now arrived when we should review these trade agreements critically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a great number of years these agreements have been either renewed on an annual basis or periodically and with minor exceptions the trade with Continental countries has been heavily adverse.  This country as a member of O.E.E.C. implemented the trade liberalisation measures which were agreed under O.E.E.C. auspices and we find that while other countries agreed to implement these trade liberalisation measures, when it came to putting them into practice, administrative and other restrictions were placed in the way and while a <Col N="235" /> country was committed to 90 per cent. liberalisation in theory and had signed such an agreement, in practice that was not so.</P>
    <P>The same is true in respect of trade agreements.  This country has many rights under the trade agreements but in certain cases devices and procedures are adopted to defeat their purpose.  Whatever the method adopted the time has now arrived when we should critically re-examine these agreements.  If our trade balance is found to be heavily adverse, in so far as any steps are available to us we should take appropriate action to remedy the position.  It may be that we have not shown sufficient initiative, that the competitive quality of some of our goods is not comparable or not capable in certain respects of meeting competition from other countries.  In certain respects and for certain commodities it is quite capable of competing and we have secured very valuable trade with the Continent.</P>
    <P>Overall, the picture is one in which the continental countries sell very substantially more than we sell to them; in some cases it is three to one in their favour.  We should therefore examine the situation to see if any steps can be taken which would alter these terms to our advantage.  The view was expressed here on previous occasions that if any action was necessary it would be taken but so far as one can see agreements are renewed on an annual or periodic basis without any substantial alterations and the adverse trade balance which has existed for so many years continues year after year. I would be glad also to hear the Minister's observations on these matters when he is concluding.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his remarks referred to two matters which are expected to be the subject of amending legislation in the near future. One was that of company law reform. This matter was the subject of investigation by a committee some years ago and their informative report was produced on the basis of which amending legislation would be introduced.  I am <Col N="236" /> glad to hear it is proposed to amend the legislation and bring it up to date in one comprehensive measure.  I hope there will be no avoidable delay in introducing the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>The other matter is the subject of insurance.  Although I gathered from the Minister's remarks that while the question was under review it was not very likely that there would be any substantial alterations.  In view of any possible public disquiet on this question I would urge the Minister to proceed as rapidly as he can with the examination of the problem and if necessary to introduce the legislation without delay.</P>
    <P>The other matter I wish to refer to is the question of industrial relations. I understand from the Minister's speech today that this matter is still the subject of consideration by the interested parties, employers' organisations. This country, or indeed any country, cannot expect to make progress without harmonious relations. That has been expressed as a matter to which there are two sides.  Whatever problems are involved ought to be capable of solution by persons of goodwill, who are prepared to discuss these problems, and if changes in legislation are desirable, there is no doubt that the Dáil would be willing to pass that legislation.  But, in the first intance, this matter must be the subject of discussion and consideration by the organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>The various disputes which have occurred and which have affected production in other economic spheres, such as transport and distribution, have all seriously interfered with industrial progress.  Happily, most of them were settled before any irreparable damage was done, but the events which occurred are the indicator of the path of danger in that regard.  It is therefore important that the interests concerned should submit their proposals to the Minister, who, in turn, can submit them to the House without any further delay, so that no lack of harmony will impede the progress which is vital not only to the <Col N="237" /> interests of those concerned, whether employers or employees, but to the national interest as well, and on which the future progress and development of the economy depends to such an extent.  I hope this matter will be examined by the parties with a full sense of responsibility involved and that the proposals which are made will reflect the mature and careful consideration of men prepared to act in a reasonable manner, conscious of the high responsibility which devolves on them as well as the interest which the nation as a whole must have in this very important question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister covered a fairly wide area in the course of his speech on the Estimate.  There are some aspects of the matters dealt with on which I should like to get some more information, if it is convenient for the Minister to supply it when concluding on the debate.  For instance, on Page 13 of the Minister's typescript, I observe the Minister states that 61 projects assisted by An Foras Tionscal are in production in the undeveloped areas and there are 29 others for which grants have been promised or which are in various stages of development. I wonder could the Minister give us a broad picture of the counties in which these actual projects are located and a further picture of the areas where the 29 other contemplated projects will be located.  We might, therefore, get a picture of the extent to which new industries are being established in that broad piece of territory described as the undeveloped areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to ascertain from the Minister whether there have been any cases in which industries started in the undeveloped areas have, because of difficulties of one kind or another, been compelled to close down.  I know of one instance where a particular firm found it necessary to take its plant to Dublin or close to Dublin because it did not feel it could operate economically in a western area.  But, side by side with that, I should like the Minister to give us an indication of the industries in the undeveloped areas and to give us a picture, if there is any such picture to paint, of where there <Col N="238" /> have been any failures of industries launched with the assistance of An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>On page 14 of the typescript, the Minister refers to 34 projects which have been approved for industrial grants in areas, I take it, outside the undeveloped areas.  Could the Minister tell us where these 34 projects are located so that again we might see to what extent the country is being covered by new industries assisted by grants or special legislation for promoting industrial development?</P>
    <P>The Minister refers on page 16 to a change in the agreement which the State had with the Ambassador Oil Corporation.  I am not just too clear whether in the future we are to have the Ambassador Oil Corporation and two of its subsidiaries operating here or whether Ambassador Oil have pulled out and future operations will be in the hands of The Continental Oil Company of Texas and The Ohio Oil Company, which are stated to be registered subsidiaries of Ambassador Oil Corporation.  The Minister seems to be satisfied that the two companies that are taking over from Ambassador Oil, or taking over with them, whatever the position is, are reputable and efficiently equipped firms.  I have no doubt the Minister has taken steps to check this.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech, the Minister said the results of the investigations which have been carried out by Ambassador Irish Oil Company, that is, the Irish portion of the American Ambassador Oil enterprise, were stated to be encouraging.  Would the Minister find it possible to amplify that?  Has the company or its exploration teams found oil anywhere in Ireland?  If so, has the company found the oil in what might be described as merchantable quantities?  Is there any prospect that that oil can be brought to commercial use?</P>
    <P>I know that any people associated with the search for oil will tell you that you can find oil in a considerable number of places as oil, but the difficulty is to find it in merchantable quantities.  It is one thing to be told there is oil in two or three counties <Col N="239" /> here, but it is another matter if it is only a bucket of oil that can be found after a day's operations.  I should like to know from the Minister if he could expand on what he says and give us some idea as to what justified the phrase &ldquo;encouraging results&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should also like to find out from the Minister whether the exploration team found any natural gas in the course of their explorations.  From my talks with this group, I got the impression that they had more hope of finding natural gas which could be pumped into the cities and towns than they had of finding oil in merchantable quantities.  I would be more than satisfied if they did find natural gas which could be pumped in sufficient quantities to supply a few cities and large towns because in that event the moneys would not be misapplied.  If the Minister does not think it undesirable, he might give us some further information as to what progress this oil company has made.</P>
    <P>At page 19, the Minister refers to the promotion of whiskey exports and he says a sum of money is being provided this year for advertising and promoting the sale of Irish whiskey in the United States.  He says, quite rightly, that while results are necessarily slow, they indicate a measure of success in stimulating interest in Irish whiskey in the American market. Anybody with any experience of trying to popularise Irish whiskey on the American market knows from the moment he touches the problem that he is up against a heartbreaking job because of the frustrations that confront him at every turn.</P>
    <P>I remember on one occasion being in a large hotel in Washington.  The manager was Irish-born and took great pride in his association with a certain northern county with which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is very familiar. I asked him if he sold Irish whiskey, if there was any demand for it and, if so, what the demand was like.  He said: &ldquo;We do not stock it at all because nobody asks for it&rdquo;.  I asked him had he never tried putting <Col N="240" /> it on the shelf.  He said: &ldquo;We did that on one occasion, but it was there for months.  Nobody asked for it&rdquo;. I asked him if his salesman had done anything to push it.  He said: &ldquo;I do not suppose he did any more for that whiskey than for any other whiskey.  The fact is, if it were an attractive whiskey, people would come in and ask for it.  If they were willing to do that, we would be willing to stock it, but there is no use in keeping something in stock for a long time before one can sell it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that in large areas of the United States, they do not know whiskey is made in Ireland at all and, if one wants to tell them about the quality of Irish whiskey, one has to deliver a long lecture.  One has to tell them how long we have been making whiskey and apprise them of the fact that even the Russians acknowledge that whiskey is a special Irish product. Most people in America have never heard of Irish whiskey.  When it comes to advertising, one finds that the cost of advertising in American papers is appallingly high and £40,000 or £50,000 could be used up in one day's advertising in some of the larger newspapers.  A sum of £40,000 spread over the 50 or 52 States makes very little impression <i>vis-á-vis</i> the vast advertising that goes on in American newspapers.</P>
    <P>Our whiskey producers will have to face the fact that they will have to spend a great deal more money before they can make any substantial impression on the American market.  There are, I think, very obvious advantages to the national economy in promoting the sale of Irish whiskey abroad.  The Scots sell about £35,000,000 worth of whisky in the American market.  That gives one an idea of what whisky is worth to them.  By comparison, our sales are trifling.  It ought to be possible by consistent effort to make a substantial impression in time on the American market.  Irish whiskey is a completely home-made product. Everything in it from the barley to the finished product, to the label on the glass bottle, is home manufactured. From that point of view, it is <Col N="241" /> a product that should be pushed wherever we can sell it.  The American market seems to offer the best opportunity because America is a whiskey-drinking country and whiskey does not have to compete there with any keen competition from wine as it does on the Continent of Europe.</P>
    <P>Irish whiskey is, of course, very heavily taxed in this country, and the distillers have been complaining for many years that they have been asked to bear an unreasonable burden in that respect.  I think they have made a case for some relief from taxation having regard to the extent to which they are burdened.  If I were the Minister, I would frankly face up to giving the whiskey distillers some reduction in taxation, on the understanding that, for a period of years, the amount of the remission would be utilised for advertising and promoting sales of Irish whiskey in the United States and elsewhere.  If we can once establish ourselves in the market, we can hold a good position there.  The difficulty is to get a foothold.</P>
    <P>I remember meeting a gentleman whose name was world famous two years ago.  He occupied high office in the Eisenhower administration.  He told me he could not understand why more Irish whiskey was not consumed in America.  He said he did not think it was even consumed by the Irish in America.  He said: &ldquo;I like a spot of whiskey myself and any time I pass through Shannon, I make sure to take some with me because I do not like my cellar to be without Irish whiskey. I reckon it is one of the best in the world.&rdquo;  I jokingly asked him if he would allow me to say that to the Irish whiskey distillers but he thought using his name might constitute a slight political risk for President Eisenhower at the time, and we had to leave it at that.</P>
    <P>That gives some idea of how we could make a better impression on the American market if the merits of Irish whiskey were driven home properly. That can only be done by spending money.  We must spend generously and hope that an investment in advertising Irish whiskey there will bring returns, not instantaneously but progressively. <Col N="242" /> If we can hold our place then in the American whiskey market, we can make what is a permanent investment in the sales of Irish whiskey in a market which is socially, and as a matter of habit, favourable from the point of view of the consumption of Irish whiskey.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers on page 6 to the establishment of new industries and congratulates the Industrial Development Authority on the work it is carrying out.  He says it continues to show satisfactory results.  I should like to join with the Minister in congratulating the I.D.A. on the excellent work it has done.  I am sure the Minister, like myself, is glad that his Taoiseach did not put into operation the threat which he made in 1950, namely, that the first thing he would do if a Fianna Fáil Government returned to office in 1951 was to abolish the I.D.A.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that it is a good mark for the Taoiseach that, having appraised the situation, he did not do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach could not tear his hair out quickly enough the day he was told about the establishment of the I.D.A.  He fulminated from these benches and said that one of the first things Fianna Fáil would do was to get rid of it.  We gave the I.D.A. a contract that we never intended to give it in order to make the job of getting rid of it more difficult. But, of course, the Taoiseach relented.  The I.D.A. was spared the woodman's axe and has now lived to enable the Minister, like his predecessor, to pay tribute to them for the excellent work they have done.  I am not blaming the Minister for threatening to exterminate the I.D.A.  What I am doing is joining with him&mdash;I can do it publicly; he may have to do it privately within the solitude of his own soul&mdash;in congratulating the I.D.A. on surviving the Herodian threat of his colleague, the Taoiseach, to kill the I.D.A., in 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>All I said was that the fact that the Taoiseach did not do it was to his credit.  He was man enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="243" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not unprepared to recognise that he did not carry out his threat to annihilate the I.D.A. The I.D.A. has done very valuable work in the meantime and I hope other threats which the Taoiseach may make during the rest of his political life will be measured against the wisdom he displayed in sparing the life of the I.D.A.  In any case, the I.D.A. has lived and has done this excellent work.  If it continues to do it, let us all be glad it is doing it, in the interest of the whole nation.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred on page 20 of his speech to the expansion of exports. Here, I am sure, everybody will join in expressing satisfaction that exports continue to expand.  I have no doubt that the expansion is due to the tax reliefs we are giving firms now in respect of exports.  Not merely is the newly-established firm getting tax relief on exports but even the old firm is getting tax relief in respect of an increase in exports of its products over and above the level of a datum year. I have no doubt that that very valuable reform instituted by the previous Government to encourage exports has yielded and will continue to yield very satisfactory results.  I do not think any other country in the world is treating industrialists as generously as we treat them here.  Whether you take the undeveloped areas or the nominally developed areas, so far as the establishment of new enterprises is concerned, the facilities made available do not find a parallel in any part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income tax concessions also represent an encouragement to industry of which everybody not completely bereft of wisdom ought to take advantage because, obviously, these are not concessions which can continue forever and which in fact may be brought to a very rude end, if the full provisions of the Treaty of Rome are implemented when it comes to our being a member of the Common Market.  Therefore, anybody who wants to get his exports geared to a satisfactory and permanent level ought to do so with the minimum of delay and thus ensure that his industry has the benefit of these concessions while <Col N="244" /> it is possible for us to make them available.  We may well be told that in future we are going into the Common Market and cannot subsidise exports, which is equivalent to subsidising production, by giving income tax reliefs on the basis of exports.</P>
    <P>However, whatever the reason, I am personally glad that our exports continue to expand and that we are continuing to sell a greater volume of our production on the export market.  The worst mistake that could be made, however, in this connection is to think that everything is magnificent and that we have nothing to do now but to pull in the oars and let the boat go anywhere it likes, that the waters are bound to be calm and the atmosphere halcyon for the rest of our lives.  There could be no bigger mistake.</P>
    <P>All the indications are, and the Minister seemed to think, that we are going to move into a period of competition which will be keener than anything we have known.  Already, the countries in the Common Market have substantially reduced their tariffs <i>vis-à vis</i> one another.  If Britain goes into the Common Market, the British will be compelled to fall in line with the other countries in the Common Market. That will mean that the British market will be open without customs duty to the products of other Common Market countries.  We will have to compete in that highly competitive market with British goods as well as the goods of other Common Market countries.  That will be a pretty agonising exercise for a number of our industries.  It will be a pretty agonising exercise in the case of a number of our industries which have been established with the aid of a tariff and yet can supply only the home market and even then not in its entirety and have never been able to export even to the British market because their prices are above British prices.  If such an industry has to meet British or German or French competition on the level, it will be extremely difficult for them to survive and many of them will have to go.</P>
    <P>Of course, I was not present at the recent conference in Killarney at which the Taoiseach spoke.  Judging by the <Col N="245" /> report of the speech, he spoke well from the point of view of illustrating the needs of industry here <i>vis-à-vis</i> the possibility that one of these days we may find it necessary to go into the Common Market.  I understand from people who were there that they did not take the advice too kindly.  One man put it to me that it was like listening to the death sentence on an industry.  This person employs a substantial number of workers and he came away from the conference saying: &ldquo;It is only a matter of deciding how long we can keep going if we have to compete with British and American interests.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister must know, and the Department of Industry and Commerce certainly know, a number of industries which we have been able to maintain only by a tariff and some of which never have been able to reach the export stage.  What is to be done for those industries?  I asked the person to whom I have already referred what he thought he would do.  I must confess he did not seem to have any obvious remedy at hand. It might very well be that industries like that should try to find continental groups to work with them so that they might get the benefit of their techniques and skills and, more than that, get access to the overseas markets to which it might be possible to export Irish-produced goods.  These markets are not at present available to existing Irish industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised the question of whether Irish industrialists understood the position.  I know that the Minister's speech is intended to gear them to an awareness of what is coming.  I noticed that the matter has been referred to by quite a number of speakers in recent months but I still do not believe industrialists fully understand what it means for them that in future the heavy overcoat of protection must come off and they will pretty well stand as industrial nudists in Ireland trying to compete with producers elsewhere.  It will only be a matter of time to decide how long they can withstand the wintry economic blasts that will blow from Britain or the Continent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> In the Federation of Irish Industries, there are various industrial groups and I think it might be possible&mdash;it would certainly be desirable&mdash;for these people to be seen individually or in groups and to arrange to discuss individually with them and have brought home to them not only the necessity of thinking out what their future should be against the background of membership of the Common Market but that they should also be asked to prepare plans and say: &ldquo;Here is what we intend to do to meet the competition which obviously is going to face us in all its ferocity.&rdquo;  It is not just good enough to close down those industries and say: &ldquo;We could not survive.&rdquo;  Large numbers of workers have dedicated their lives and special skills to this type of employment and it would be tragic for them and the nation if, because of the inertia and the supineness of those who control industry, it was to go out of existence.  Certainly that should not be allowed to happen, no matter what powers the State has to take in order to preserve industry for the benefit of the nation.</P>
    <P>Of course it is very easy when you are doing some little export business and looking at a balance sheet to say: &ldquo;That pays 10 per cent.  Everything is all right.  Probably you cannot do much better than that.&rdquo;  That mentality will not allow us to survive very long unless we are able to stand on our own feet without the props of quotas and tariffs against the severe competition that will come if we join the Common Market.  It may be that some people believe that you can have an E.F.T.A. or a European Common Market in Europe but that somehow or other the ancient Irish nation will be able to survive strong and powerful in spite of these two massive trading groups.  Our whole economic policy here has been built up largely on the reasoning of Arthur Griffith, a policy of industrial development and of protecting our industries by tariffs and quotas.  That was a product of the Revolution, a product that has guided every Government since 1922, but the policy of Arthur Griffith in Europe today has nobody to defend <Col N="247" /> it.  You cannot defend it in the circumstances in which Europe has been redrawn and recast in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is now quite clear that if we are to live and be reasonably prosperous and stable, we can only do so on the basis of our own skill and ability to produce first-class products and sell them in keen competition with everybody else who produces the same type of produce even though the other fellow may have years of tradition behind the manufacture of a particular product of which we may have had only a few years' experience.  That is the kind of competition that we shall have to face in the future.  I do not believe&mdash;apparently some people in this House pretend to believe it&mdash;that we can do what we like, independent of what the British do.  We cannot. The British market is our best and natural market.  It is the market to which we can export at the lowest possible prices, lower than any other country in Europe.  They understand our people; the two peoples speak the same language; currency presents no difficulties nor do methods of measurement. Our whole trading relationship has been on the basis of a British-Irish interchange of trade and Britain is obviously the best market from our point of view.  To think we can tell Britain that they can go their way and, that with our heads up in the air, we are going to go the other way, is nonsense.  We can live going the other way only by getting somebody to lend us money to support our standard of living.  That will not go on very long unless we get ourselves into the position of being self-supporting and able to pay our debts.</P>
    <P>I am all with the Minister in what he says here, but I urge him to try to get these different industrial groups together, tell them what is coming and, at the same time, get from them some indication of the plans they have for the time, whenever it comes, that membership of the Common Market is the only course open to us.  As I view the situation about the Common Market, it is not a question of whether you join it or not: if the British join, <Col N="248" /> then we can export nothing to Britain and Britain, by being a member of the Common Market, would be compelled to impose tariffs on our goods while, at the same time, she would be opening her own markets to countries against which there are at present very heavy tariffs.  Anybody who gives the matter even the slightest thought will realise that, whether we like it or not, we must follow the line the British take, because it is on that line that we can best sell our goods and maintain a viable economy.  To think of staying out of the Common Market if Britain goes in and selling our goods to the impoverished people of Asia and Africa is just crying for the moon. It cannot be done.  We must sell our goods to the people who want them, who can pay for them and who, in turn, will establish mutual trading relations to the benefit of both countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to industrial relations.  On that subject, I think the time has arrived when the old Industrial Relations Act should be reexamined. It has been in operation now, I think, since 1946, for 15 years. During that time, the Labour Court has done magnificent work by reason of its recommendations always being accepted but one shudders to think what would have happened all these changing years if there had been no Labour Court to intervene in these disputes and bring together people whose tempers probably had got the better of them.  The very fact that so many of its recommendations have been accepted is a tribute to the work of the Labour Court.  We can all rejoice in the fact that in spite of all difficulties, notwithstanding the peculiar nature of the Irish temperament, it was possible to get so many recommendations accepted after the Court's patient and painstaking investigation of the problems presented to it.</P>
    <P>I think&mdash;and I believe others will support me in this view&mdash;that the time has probably arrived to make a further advance along that road, to see to what extent we can make the Labour Court recommendations more effective and more commanding.  This is an extremely difficult issue as far as the <Col N="249" /> trade union movement is concerned. The trade union movement will not accept compulsory arbitration but it might be possible to devise machinery which stops short of that and yet give the trade unions some method by which disputes, particularly in the essential industries, could be adjudicated on.</P>
    <P>I should imagine, that by 1961, the ordinary worker realises that the right to strike is a very valuable weapon which distinguishes between the serf and the free man.  However, the ordinary worker knows perfectly well that a prolonged strike can cause havoc in his home and havoc with his domestic budget.  If he can be shown there is a reasonable means of avoiding a strike, which he exercises only because he thinks it is the last weapon left to him. I believe he may well be wooed to the situation in which he will accept a reasonable alternative, provided he can keep what the trade union movement regard as its inalienable and inviolable right, namely, the right to withdraw its labour at any time it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>I think the tone of recent speeches indicates it may well be possible to find a solution for the problem but if I would leave any word of advice with the Minister on this matter, it would be to be as audacious as possible in trying to find the machinery but to make sure in the long run that the machinery is voluntarily accepted, because if it is not, the machine will not function at all. You can get voluntary acceptance of a suitable type of machinery which, as I said, preserves the right to strike but at the same time provides the industrial worker who has a dispute with his employers with some alternative to parading the pavements as the only method of enforcing the claim which he thinks has every possible justification.</P>
    <P>There is one question I should like to ask the Minister.  About two years ago, on this Estimate I asked the Minister what the position was in respect of man-made fibres.  At present you cannot export to Britain without duty any garment that contains man-made fibre. That duty is payable on the garment <Col N="250" /> even though it contains less than one per cent of man-made fibre and even though the man-made fibre was British made.  In other words, you could buy from, say, I.C.I. in Britain 300 yards of it in a piece of cloth, export the cloth to Britain, and pay duty on it. There is no duty if it does not contain man-made fibre but if it does contain man-made fibre duty must be paid on the whole lot, although the value of the man-made fibre in the garment may not amount to more than a penny or twopence.  This problem goes back to 1925.  An effort has been made by the British to get the matter sorted out because it seems illogical that such a small amount of this commodity which is of British origin should attract duty on the value of the whole garment.  I should like to ask the Minister if any progress has been made in that field, if we are likely to have an early decision and if the decision is likely to be a favourable one.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the coalfield surveys which are taking place and said that some surveying had taken place in the Leinster and Connaught coalfields.  Can the Minister tell us something more than is in the report? He says that drillings so far carried out have been effective in giving precise information as to the existence of coal, the thickness of the seams and the quality of the coal in certain areas and as to the absence of coal in other areas. Could the Minister let us know what sort of material has been found in these areas?  Is it anthracite, steam or bituminous coal.  Are the seams which have been found any thicker than the ones we have been working in the Leinster coalfields or in Arigna and does whatever has been discovered so far hold out the prospect that we will be able to work these coal deposits in such a way as to supply an increasing quantity of our domestic requirements and obviate reliance on the importation of so much coal from outside sources?</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to refer, a matter touched upon by Deputy Cosgrave, is the absence of any reference to the cost of living in the Minister's speech.  It is the first speech I recollect for a number of years in <Col N="251" /> which there has been no reference to prices, price movements or anticipation of stability in prices.  I should like to know what caused the omission. Although I am very tempted to do it, I do not want to come down flat-footedly on the side of saying that the absence of any reference to the cost-of-living index figures is a clear indication that the Government have completely abandoned any effort to control prices.  That, of course, is notorious.  I imagined that the Government might still at least follow up their assertions that they were continuing to supervise prices and were concerned about the cost-of-living index figure.</P>
    <P>In the past four years, the index figure has increased by 15 points from 135 to 150.  That is a pretty hefty increase, especially from a Government which, on the eve of the last general election, told us if they were put back into office, they would maintain the food subsidies and control prices.  We have seen the food subsidies go.  We have seen the control of prices abandoned; and there is not in operation today a single price control order. The Prices Advisory Body has been abolished and the Prices Bill itself has been put in a pigeonhole, as the Minister said, there to repose until such time as it may be thought desirable in the dim and distant future to take it down and look at it if an emergency ever overwhelms us.</P>
    <P>It is because of the Government's attitude on the question of prices that the ordinary man in the town and in the country areas is paying today a higher price for every commodity he buys than he paid five years ago. During the past year, a despicable trick was played on the people.  The farmers who grew wheat were naturally disappointed at the bad harvest and they expected the State as a whole would compensate them for the loss. What happened?  The Government told Grain Importers Ltd. to buy the wheat at a guaranteed price, and allowed the millers to charge an increased price for flour and bread so that, in fact, the compensation paid to the farmers for last year's bad harvest was paid for by the consumers of bread and flower.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> The consumption of bread and flour impacts heaviest on those with the smallest possible incomes.  Bread and flour are used mainly in the homes of working-class people.  It was that section of the community which had to bear in the main the compensation for the fact that last year's wheat crop was an unsatisfactory crop, inasmuch as it was not millable to the extent at first thought.  There were other backs in the country better able to bear that burden than those of the unfortunate consumers of bread and flour.  The Government ought to have found the money elsewhere besides asking that section of the community to bear a burden so heavy as that.</P>
    <P>At all events, the effect of what the Government did then and what they did in 1957 was to create a situation in which bread is now dearer than it ever was in the memory of any living person.  That is one of the momentous achievements of the Government. Bread is now 1/3½d. for a 2-lb. loaf, a price it never reached before.  The Government ought not to have abandoned them but ought to have kept a normal check on bread prices in order to make sure that the consumer section of the population got fair value for their money and that somebody stood sentinel in a situation in which, almost every day of the week, one heard of other increases in prices by some percentage or other. However, I suppose it is not possible to hope that the Minister, at this belated stage in his ministerial career, will want to change his mind or apologise for the change in policy.</P>

      <P>The Minister has now been nearly four years in office.  Seeing that the policy of the Government and the Minister has changed, I suppose it is too late now to expect any reformation?  Not even the sight of the general election will produce any reformation from that standpoint. Therefore, I suppose we must take these things to the hustings and submit them to the judgment of the <Col N="253" /> people, in the hope that, when they vote, they will remember all the rosy promises made to them, all the glittering prizes held out to them, and how sadly they were disappointed when they got into the queue to cash the promises and receive the prizes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say my reactions to the Minister's speech were that he gave us a sober document of quite satisfactory progress over the past 12 months, but that it was one which, I feel, failed to take cognisance of the developments which have been threatening for the past five or six months and which are bound to eventuate in the not-too-distant future.</P>
      <P>A quick look at some of the statistics which the Minister supplied to us indicates that industrial production in 1960 was satisfactory compared with 1958 and 1959 and that an increase, taking 1953 as base, of 15 points is something to be grateful for.  I think the Minister might have gone a little further in these particulars and compared industrial progress here with the progress in other OEEC countries over the past three years.  I think he would have found&mdash;probably he has found it&mdash;that, although our progress is encouraging in comparison with some of the other countries of Europe, we still continue to lag behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a sobering thought to realise that, in spite of the satisfactory increase in industrial production, the total number obtaining increased employ-in industry during 1960 was only the very small figure of 3,500 persons, that is, an increase from 146, 190 in 1959 to 149,600 in 1960.  When we consider this modest increase, we must have regard to the fact that over the past three years industrial production has increased coincidentally with the general boom conditions in Europe and the United States.  It is not being pessimistic to visualise that the same conditions may not apply in the years ahead.  In fact, I think there is distinct evidence that Britain is having considerable difficulties in maintaining her export markets.  If that is so, the British market itself may not offer the same opportunities to Irish industrialists as it has offered in the past two or <Col N="254" /> three years.  If the British market turns against us to any degree, our whole hopes of continuing to increase the export of manufactured goods may receive a serious setback.  I should like the Minister to make some estimate of the opportunities for continuing the increase in the export of manufactured goods, having regard to the likely change in conditions in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister might also have been a little more realistic in giving us figures for the number of industries which closed down during the past couple of years.  I am aware from my own knowledge in my own city that three industries closed down during that period.  I do not pretend to lay the blame at the Minister's door in that regard, but certainly I think that when we are talking about the number of new industries established or about to be established, it is only right that we should get the other side of the picture and that the House should be given particulars of industries that have, for one reason or another, ceased production.</P>
    <P>The number of new industrial undertakings started in 1960 certainly is an encouraging figure, 45, of which 30 have outside capital invested in them. The Minister estimates that these industries will have an employment potential of from 5,000 to 7,000 persons. In addition, there are 30 factories in course of construction which will employ a further 5,000 workers.  These are encouraging figures and the Minister is to be complimented on the picture he put before us.  But we all appreciate that, even if industrial employment is increased by from 5,000 to 7,000 per year, it is far short of the estimate of the 25,000 new jobs which we must provide, if we are to make serious inroads into the continuing high level of emigration which, in spite of the rosy picture presented by the Minister, still continues at the very high rate of at least 40,000 per year.  Those are the figures given by the Minister for Finance when making his Budget statement and I am quite certain they do not overestimate the position.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with other <Col N="255" /> speakers who have complimented the Industrial Development Authority on its activities in recent years.  Certainly it has shown commendable enterprise in trying to attract outside industralists to come to Ireland and set up their plants here.  We should remember, however, that the attractions which bring industrialists to this country are not confined to the generous terms we offer in the way of grants and tax concessions on the export of industrial goods.  Conditions in other countries must be taken into consideration.  In some there is over-employment.  In others&mdash;and this is particularly true of those countries situate in proximity to the Iron Curtain&mdash;the situation politically is, to say the least of it uncomfortable. Industrialists find this country, therefore, a very useful and a very promising haven for their industrial activities.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I wonder if we are not being over-generous to outside industrialists at the expense of our own manufacturers.  I am well aware that there is a feeling abroad that the home manufacturer has waxed fat behind protective tariffs over the past 30 years and there are grounds for this criticism. It would, however, be most unfair and quite wrong to apply that criticism generally to all Irish industrialists. Some of them have done a very fine job indeed.  Some of them have taken advantage of the protection given by successive Governments over the past 30 years to modernise their factories, train their workers, and put on the home and export market goods of first-class quality at competitive prices.  These firms are undoubtedly reaping their reward by their increasing inroads into the export trade.</P>
    <P>A number of firms have not taken advantage of the protection of the past 25 or 30 years and, when the wider European trading area comes into being, as come it certainly will in some shape or form, these people will find themselves in very sore straits indeed.  The tragedy is that not alone will they, as individuals, suffer but their many workers will find themselves in a very precarious position, <Col N="256" /> unless a sense of urgency pervades the owners of the factories in question. I do not altogether blame these industrialists in this regard because, up to quite recently, they had an assurance from the Taoiseach himself that it was his intention to reserve the home market for the Irish industrialist.  In theory that may have been a very good thing; in practice, it is now likely to prove a very negativing influence on the desire of industrialists to modernise plant and increase export trading.</P>
    <P>On several occasions I have made reference to the difficulty of the normal small industry in this country accumulating capital in order to plough that capital back into the industry concerned.  Up to now no Minister for Finance has thought it worthwhile to encourage manufacturers to plough back more of their profits into modernising their plant and buildings by giving concessions in relation to the retention of profits. Encouragement of that kind in the past would now be paying dividends and we would not be in the position of having Irish industrialists&mdash;there must be a large number of them&mdash; without the requisite capital to carry out amalgamations or specialise in the way that the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, and other Ministers, have indicated will be necessary in the years ahead.  These things cannot be done overnight and, unless the Minister and the Government indicate in very clear and specific terms the type of assistance they will give to Irish industrialists to enable them to carry out these changes and reconstructions, the industries will be in a very serious position.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have any conception of the type of competition with which we are likely to be faced if our small home market is thrown open to the highly efficient plants situated in Great Britain and on the Continent.  I have always been in favour of encouraging outside industrialists to come in here and set up plants, provided they have the right type of industry to offer, but we will, I think, have to make assistance to the home industrialists the basis of <Col N="257" /> Government assistance.  In the last analysis, the native industralist is much more likely, with his roots in the country, his family connections and all that, to want to survive and continue in difficult times as against the foreign industrialist who sets up a branch factory here and has nothing to do but pull out if the winds of change get too harsh for him in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the assistance given by his Department in relation to the employment of industrial consultants.  He stated that that had been a great success.  I am very glad to hear that.  We lack two things in this country.  One is a high level of management.  While I think that does not apply to every industry, there is in general, a lack of high-quality management.  That has been repaired to some extent now by the activities of the Irish Management Institute. We also lack technical assistance, though the Minister's Department in recent years has been rendering some assistance in this regard.  It is unfortunate that a couple of years ago, the Minister, or his predecessor, thought fit to reduce that assistance from two-thirds to one-half of the cost of engaging industrial consultants.  I regarded that as a retrograde step at the time and I think the Minister should consider restoring the grant from its present proportion of one-half to its original proportion of two-thirds.</P>
    <P>The introduction of works study, flow-line techniques, and all these other methods are not, I think, sufficiently understood either by the workers or the employers.  It would be helpful if some agency like the Productivity Committee were to give lectures to groups of workers and employers on works study and other methods.  If the employers and workers appreciated the benefits that would flow from modern methods of production there would be greater co-operation in the utilisation of these methods.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to certain tariff reviews that have been carried out. These reviews take a certain length of time&mdash;at least a couple of years, if not <Col N="258" /> longer.  I should like to ask what the situation will be if we have to face up to a vastly accelerated time-table for the reduction or elimination of tariffs. Up to now the Industrial Development Authority has looked after this task. Will the Authority be competent or has it got the necessary personnel to carry out the drastic review that may be called for if we become associated in some way with a larger trading area?</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to the duty on man-made fibre imported for the manufacture of clothing.  I have raised this matter time and again over the past two or three years.  I hope the Minister will accept Deputy Norton's request for some information as to the progress his Department has made in relation to having this duty eliminated altogether.  It is a most unfair duty.  I do not recall the reason for its introduction but, if it was introduced in the early 1920's, I should imagine it was done to protect the British man-made fibre industry.</P>

      <P>As in previous years I propose to review briefly the more significant vital statistics for the preceding calendar year.  The figures I quote are provisional but experience indicates that the final figures will not differ materially from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> In 1960 there were more births, more marriages and less deaths than in 1959.</P>
    <P>The number of births registered was 60,730, an increase of 542 on the previous year.  The rate, at 21.4 per 1,000 population, was again appreciably higher than in neighbouring countries. In England and Wales the figure was 17.1 and in Scotland 19.4.</P>
    <P>The number of marriages in 1960 was 15,494, an increase of 74 on 1959.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths was 32,660, a decrease of 1,585.</P>
    <P>There has been a steady downward trend during the past decade in the death rate from tuberculosis.  The trend continued in 1960 and the number of deaths from all forms of the disease fell to a record low figure of 468, which was 49 fewer than in the previous year.  Equivalent to a rate of 17 per 100,000 of the population, the mortality from the disease in 1960 was in striking contrast with the position in 1950, when the death rate was almost five times as high.  The figures for incidence also fell, the number of new and reactivated cases in 1960 being 3,478 compared with 4,344 in 1959.  Such progress is encouraging; but the fact that so many new cases occur each year shows that a large pool of infection still exists.  This is disquieting, as it indicates that the measures for the prevention and early diagnosis of the disease which are ready to hand are not being availed of as widely as they ought to be.  I should emphasise that this is especially the case with B.C.G. vaccination and mass-radiography.</P>
    <P>Experience has established that B.C.G vaccination is particularly valuable in the case of young persons who leave rural areas to work in towns and cities as many country-born children eventually do.  Yet the latest figures available, though they are an all time record, show that many of them do not yet realise that this easily-acquired protection, which can be the means of preventing grave illness, is there for the asking and should be fully availed of.  Mass-radiography is aimed primarily at detecting tuberculosis in the <Col N="260" /> early stages when treatment is likely to be most effective.  It offers to all, old as well as young, a necessary check upon lung and other respiratory and chest conditions.  Yet in 1960 only about 10 per cent of the population came forward for X-ray.  This is far from satisfactory.  The ideal would be that everyone should undergo this simple check-up once a year.  Perhaps this ideal will never be attained, but if it were, it is certain that probably the vast majority of us would emerge from the check with a clean bill, so far as tuberculosis is concerned.  The ascertained fact, however, is that 3 per thousand of those who undergo this check-up are shown to be suffering from the disease in a more or less active from and the question arises&mdash;who knows which of us comes within that category?  The answer is none of us who has not submitted himself to an X-ray during the year and secured a clean bill on the test.  That only 0.3 per cent of those who have themselves X-rayed should be found to be infected indicates that for the vast majority the outcome of an X-ray examination is likely to be highly satisfactory and most re-assuring.  And even for the few who are warned that they require immediate medical attention the outlook is not too gloomy; for the community will come to their aid in the most practical way.  First of all since T.B. is an infectious disease, medical attention and treatment, whether in the home or a sanatorium, is given free of charge. Secondly, subsistence allowances are granted where necessary in respect of a dependent spouse and children.  No person, therefore, need be deterred by financial considerations from availing himself of the mass-radiography service. The service indeed may well save his life, since, if an infective condition should be detected by it, all the health services are available to the individual concerned and will afford him the latest and most effective treatment.  Moreover, the X-ray may detect other unsuspected conditions, conditions possibly, which may yield to treatment at an early stage, but which, if neglected may prove intractable.  In short, the minutes spent in having an X-ray may purchase many years of life.</P>
    <P>But, of course, tuberculosis, though <Col N="261" /> still a significant killer and highly important because it is infective, is by no means the most lethal of the conditions with which modern society has to cope.  Last year cardio-vascular diseases and cancer were again the two major killing diseases.  The former in fact, was responsible for 10,633 deaths, as against 10,830 in 1959&mdash;by no means a notable decline.  In the case of cancer, unfortunately the decrease was scarcely apparent, the overall mortality at 4,759 being only 18 deaths lower than in the previous year.  While the mortality figures for these diseases are consistent with the prevailing world pattern, the picture, so far as cancer goes, would have been a little brighter, had it not been for the fact that the number of deaths from those forms of it which are grouped under the title of lung cancer, showed a significant increase from 601 in 1959 to 648 in 1960.  Since there is abundant evidence of a correlation between heavy cigarette smoking and death from lung cancer, the figures for cancer deaths carry a grave warning to all who smoke.</P>
    <P>With maternal and infant mortality, our experience has been much better and the rates have continued to fall. The maternal mortality rate was 0.58 per 1,000 births, as against 0.65 the previous year, while the infant mortality rate was 29 per 1,000 live births as against 32.  This continuing improvement is heartening.  It is especially so when allowance is made for the pattern of late marriages and large families in this country.  Nevertheless, figures for neighbouring states indicate that further improvement is possible.  Thus, in 1960, the maternal mortality rate in England and Wales was 0.4; in Scotland it was 0.3; and in Northern Ireland it was 0.4.  The infant mortality rates in these areas were: England and Wales, 22; Scotland, 26, Northern Ireland, 27.</P>
    <P>The most dangerous period in the life of an infant is what is known as the peri-natal period, extending from the 28th week of gestation to the end of the first seven days of life.  This fact was emphasised by a study published some years ago by the World Health Organisation.  The study <Col N="262" /> showed that, while infant mortality in general has decreased sharply, mortality at birth has not decreased to anything like the same extent.  In addition, the study indicated that almost a third of peri-natal deaths occur on the day of birth; that the death rate is considerably higher for boys than for girls, but that far more girls than boys die of congenital malformations of the nervous system.  The reasons for all this are not yet clear, and the fact that a high percentage of peri-natal deaths listed in the study were described as being due to &ldquo;ill-defined or unspecified causes&rdquo; went to show that much has yet to be learned about the problem.</P>
    <P>About six years ago, the World Health Organisation invited Ireland, Sweden and the Netherlands to undertake a special survey as an initial step towards determining what action could be taken to reduce this peri-natal mortality.  All three countries agreed to accept the invitation; and, on my immediate predecessor's invitation, the Medical Research Council agreed to conduct the survey here.  I am glad to say that the work has been proceeding very satisfactorily and that it is anticipated that results will be available for analysis this year.  It is impossible to say, of course, what contribution the work will make towards a reduction in the number of deaths in future, but I know that every member of the House will agree with me that participation in pieces of research such as this, well thought out and carried through on an international scale, is worth while and will join with me in thanking the Medical Research Council for its ready co-operation.</P>
    <P>Turning to the communicable diseases, we find that deaths from poliomyelitis rose from 2 to 17.  The number of cases of this disease noted in 1960 was 183.  As the House is aware, a vaccination service which gives a high degree of protection against it has been in operation since April, 1957.  Its scope has been widened every year since then, and in the current year is being widened still further.</P>
    <P>The service now provided by health <Col N="263" /> authorities is available to persons in the lower and middle income groups between the ages of 6 months and 40 years, to expectant mothers in those income groups and to other special categories.  These include hospital staffs, certain practising nurses, medical and dental students, teachers, and other public health staff who might come into contact with poliomyelitis cases, together with the families of persons in these groups.  The service is free of charge to persons in the lower income group and the special categories mentioned.  For those in the middle income group, outside the special categories for which, as I have stated, it is free, reasonably small charges are made.  Provision is also being made for a fourth injection where appropriate.  In view of the wide coverage which the service now offers, there is no reason whatever why anyone should take the risk of contracting &ldquo;polio&rdquo; rather than be vaccinated against it.</P>
    <P>I cannot be too strong in urging everybody to avail of the several vaccination and immunisation services which their local health authority provides, not only against poliomyelitis, but against diphtheria and small-pox. It is true that we have had no case of small-pox for many years and that the incidence of diphtheria has declined considerably and this may be the reason why the number of persons who have taken the precaution of protecting themselves against these diseases is disappointingly small.  Prophylactic safeguards against the risk of contracting these diseases are available free of charge to everyone without exception, and yet they are not being generally availed of.  Such lethargy is not only disappointing, it increases the risk that, should one or two cases occur and remain for even a relatively short time undetected, a very grave and widespread situation may develop with great rapidity.</P>
    <P>To turn now to the Estimate itself, the largest single item is that included under subhead G&mdash;which provides for a total of slightly over £9,000,000 in grants to local health authorities in aid of their expenditure on health services. <Col N="264" /> These grants are authorised under the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, the effect of which, nowadays, is broadly to commit the State to meet half the cost of local health services.</P>
    <P>The total cost of these services in the present year, having made allowance for such receipts as charges on patients, will be about £18 million.  This compares with £17.6 million last year, and £16.8 million in the year to 31st March, 1960.  The corresponding totals for 1953/54, the last complete financial year prior to the partial introduction of extended health services under the Health Act, 1953, and for 1956/57, the first complete year after the introduction of the services, were £11.2 million and £15.8 million respectively. While there was thus a definite increase in the cost of the health services in the period immediately following the coming into operation of the 1953 Act, and while the cost has continued to increase more gradually since, the whole of this increase cannot be attributed to the Health Act.  Not by any means.</P>
    <P>Quite a substantial factor has been the making good of regrettable deficiencies in our health services, deficiencies which common humanity demanded should be remedied, Health Act or no Health Act, as rapidly as possible.  The increased facilities which have been provided for the care and treatment of mentally-handicapped children is an example of this.  In 1953 there were 1,460 beds for such children.  This year we have 2,734 and it is hoped to bring this figure up to 3,000 by 1963-64. Not only has the capital cost of these additional beds been met almost entirely from the Hospitals Trust Fund, but the greater portion of the actual cost of maintaining the children is covered by the capitation grants paid by local health authorities, who are in turn recouped as to one-half of their expenditure from moneys provided under this Vote.  Thus the cost of caring for these young patients is borne almost completely by the ratepayers and taxpayers, and is increasing from year to year.</P>
    <P>In 1953 the capitation rates payable <Col N="265" /> to these institutions were generally in the region of £2 5s. Od. per week and were payable in respect of about 1,400 children.  To-day they vary between £3 10s. Od. and £4 per week, and are payable in respect of about 2,400 children.  In 1953 the cost of this service was of the order of £190,000; to-day it is in the neighbourhood of £450,000, perhaps even more.  It will almost certainly be more next year and more still as time goes on.  But what are we to do about it?  Who of our critics will tell us to call a halt in dealing with this problem?  Are they not urging us to spend more and more money to solve it?</P>
    <P>Expenditure on drugs and medicines used in our mental hospitals during 1953/54 was £25,000.  This year it will probably be £122,600, which is quite a considerable increase.  But the increase is spent in the main on newly-evolved drugs, most of them drugs the established therapeutic value of which is high, the drugs which give so much relief to the mentally disturbed. Thanks to them the whole approach to mental illness has been altered.  There is now hope in most cases, if not always a complete cure, at least a marked alleviation of suffering. Thanks to them also the general atmosphere of our mental hospitals has changed.  Their patients are more peaceful, calmer, and less fractious than they used to be.  But the drugs which have brought all this about are expensive; they increase the cost of the services, and accordingly they send up the rates.  But is there any Deputy who is prepared to urge that for these reasons we should cease to buy them, cease to use them, and turn our now peaceful and curative mental hospitals back again into the bedlams they once were?</P>
    <P>Apart from increases of this nature, originating in a fuller recognition of the obligations which the community in general has towards its more hapless members, account must also be taken of the undeniable fact that the rates of remuneration enjoyed by the personnel of the service have been substantially increased.  This increase is in no way peculiar to the health <Col N="266" /> services or ascribable to the operation of the Health Acts.  To the extent to which the increases are not represented by an actual rise in living standards, they are a reflection of the fact that, throughout the world, there has been a significant fall in the value of money. To obtain a true picture of the increase in expenditure which can be attributed solely to the growth of health services as such, it would be necessary to eliminate these factors.  This would entail breaking down an intricate cost complex into its elements.  In view of the fact that the final result would be of no practical utility whatsoever, it would be futile to waste time and money on such a task.  There is, moreover, a better and more realistic way of approaching the problem available to us.</P>
    <P>The relation which the amount expended from public funds on a particular service in any year bears to the gross national product in that year is a measure of the real burden which the service in question imposes on the community. Applying this standard to our expenditure on the health services since 1953, a picture, and it is a true picture, emerges which will confound our critics &mdash;that is so far as costs are concerned. The percentage of the gross national product represented by the amount of central and local taxation required to pay for health services in 1953 was 2.14.  This proportion has risen to 2.92 in 1956 but by 1958 had declined to 2.77.  In 1959 the percentage was 2.70 and it is estimated to be 2.71 for 1960. It would seem therefore, that not only has equilibrium been reached in the proportion of the national product spent through rates and taxes on health services, but that in relation to the capacity of the community to pay for them, the cost of the health services tends to decrease.  This is as one would expect in a prospering community.</P>
    <P>During the past year there have been statements to the effect that the additional services provided under the Health Act, 1953 are now costing the ratepayers considerably more than had been forecast in 1952 when the Bill was under discussion.  Recently in this House, a figure of 8/- in the £ was mentioned as the amount of the increase. <Col N="267" /> I am referring to the Dáil Debates of 14 March, 1961, Column 550.  In arriving at this conclusion, Deputy Thaddeus Lynch, who postulated that figure, appears to have overlooked the significance of certain administrative changes brought about by the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>Prior to the coming into operation of that Act, local authorities in their capacity as public assistance authorities provided a wide variety of health services and the cost of these was shown in the rate demands, as well as in the rating returns and the accounts, as public assistance expenditure.  The services thus scheduled as public assistance services included such major items as the dispensary service, general hospital services and the county home services &mdash;all of which are undeniably health services, and nothing else but health services.  On the other hand the medical services provided by local authorities, as health authorities, were limited to such services as school health inspection and control of infectious diseases &mdash;that is, to a very restricted range of special activities.  But prior to the coming into operation of the Health Act, 1953, it was only the expenditure on such services which was classified as health expenditure and defrayed from the &ldquo;health&rdquo; rate.</P>
    <P>The 1953 Act rationalised this absurd classification so that expenditure on services which were in fact health services, though previously included under the head of public assistance, was thenceforth debited to the health account.  Consequently a comparison of the &ldquo;health&rdquo; rate for a year prior to 1954 with the &ldquo;health&rdquo; rate in later years is invalid.  If it is sought to obtain a realistic picture of the rate position in any year it is necessary to bulk the &ldquo;public assistance&rdquo; rate with the &ldquo;health&rdquo; rate proper. If this is done it will be found that, in the counties, the average increase in the rates between 1953-54 and 1960-61 was just under 3s. in the £. Not all of this increase was due to the improvement and expansion of existing services or the introduction of new ones.  I have already shown <Col N="268" /> indeed that a substantial fraction of it has been generated by a wholly adventitious factor, to wit, the decline in the value of money.</P>
    <P>In the county boroughs, the average increase corresponding to the figure of just under 3s. for county areas was 5s. in the £, and here again a substantial portion of the increase has been due to the same factor, one which is completely extraneous to the Health Acts.  A rough estimation shows that about half of the increase could be ascribed to this and other adventitious factors.  When, therefore, allowance is made for such factors, as it must be made, the average real increase in rates which may be attributed to the improvement and expansion of the health services since 1953 is not 3s. in the counties and 5s. in the county boroughs, but only 1s. 6d. and 2s. 6d. respectively.</P>
    <P>The figures which I have given are average figures, taken over all the counties in the one case and over all the county boroughs in the other.  To bring home the point in concrete terms, however, I shall take as examples, the cases of typical farmers in Limerick, Kildare and Monaghan, assuming that in each case the valuation of the farm is £30 and that one agricultural labourer is employed.</P>
    <P>In the year 1953/54, the rate in Limerick County in respect of health charges, including mental hospitals and all public assistance charges, the most of the latter being, as I have pointed out, medical in character, was 8/1d. in the £.  The gross amount of rates payable by our Limerick farmer in respect of these services would thus have been £12 2s. 6d.&mdash;if account were not taken of the allowances payable by way of Agricultural Grant.  In fact, these allowances reduced the impost on this Limerick farmer by £8 17s. 8d., and left the net sum of only £3 4s. 10d. as the amount which he was required to pay in rates in respect of the financial year 1953/54 to meet the cost of all health and public assistance services, including medical services, provided by his local authority.</P>
    <P>For the farmer in Kildare with a <Col N="269" /> £30 holding, the corresponding amounts for that same year of 1953/54 were £14 17s. 6d. gross and £3 19s. 4d. net.  For the farmer in Monaghan, the figures were £11 10s. 0d. gross and £3 1s. 4d. net.</P>
    <P>Now let us turn to the year 1960/61 and see what the increase was in terms of the actual cash payments which would fall to be made by these three farmers.  For the farmer in Limerick, the total rate in respect of health and public assistance charges had risen to 11/11d. in the £, that is, by more than the national average and the gross amount of rates payable by him to meet these charges had risen to £17 17s. 6d.  Again, however, when account is taken of the allowances payable by way of Agricultural Grant the actual charge falls to be reduced considerably, the amount of the reduction being £13 0s. 5d.  This leaves a net amount of £4 17s. 1d. payable. Accordingly, the actual amount of rates which this farmer is called upon to pay for health and public assistance charges in 1960/61 is £4 17s. 1d. as compared with £3 4s. 10d. in 1953/54, representing an increase of only £1 12s. 3d., in return for which he becomes entitled to the benefit of the extended services under the 1953 Act for himself and his family.</P>
    <P>For the farmer in Kildare, the corresponding increase is £2 1s. 10d., being the difference between the net amount of £3 19s. 4d. payable in 1953/54 and the net amount, £6 1s. 2d., payable in 1960/61.  In the case of the Monaghan farmer, the increase in the rates actually payable is £2 1s. Od. which is the difference between £3 1s. 4d. net in 1953/54 and £5 2s. 4d. net in 1960/61.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, averaging the increase in the amount which would be payable in 1960/61 as against 1953/54 in these three cases, we find that it represents no more than 38/4d. over the seven year period.  This is equivalent to an increase of 15?d. in the £, which is a long way from the 8/- postulated by Deputy Thaddeus Lynch.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, all of this 38/4d. is not properly chargeable against the 1953 Health Act.  A substantial portion <Col N="270" /> of it, perhaps even half of it, has been engendered by influences, like inflation, which have operated to increase the cost, not merely of the health services, but of every commodity and of every service, whether it be health, transport, education, food, clothing, entertainment or otherwise.  Making allowance for the effect of this all-pervading and predominant factor, it cannot be contended by any reasonable person that over the whole seven years the increase in rates payable in respect of a residential holding of £30 valuation, and properly attributable to the operation of the 1953 Health Act, amounted to more than £1 per year.</P>
    <P>The remaining subheads of the Estimate show little change compared with last year and, apart from Subhead N on which I will speak later, do not call for any detailed comment.  I may say though that the increase under Subhead A is accounted for by an addition to the medical staff of my Department to bring it up to the authorised full strength and by the general salary increases.  The increase under Subhead F is due mainly to provision for the cost of the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap, to which I shall refer later.</P>
    <P>With regard to Subhead M, I referred last year to the purpose of the provision of £3,000 then made under this subhead, namely for obtaining advice and assistance on the establishment of a rehabilitation centre.  Progress with the formulation of the necessary scheme was not as rapid as had been anticipated and consequently the provision was not utilised. It is repeated this year, and with the establishment of the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Dún Laoghaire &mdash;a matter to which I will refer later &mdash;the expenditure of the allocation in the current financial year may now be anticipated.  An allocation of £1,000 was also made under the Grant Counterpart Agreement with the United States for the study of methods for the diagnosis, prevention and cure of pneumoconiosis in mine workers. Provision to spend this is included in this year's Estimate.  Expenditure from the subhead will be recouped <Col N="271" /> from the American Grant Counterpart Special Account and provision has been included in the Appropriation-in-Aid Subhead for a receipt of a similar amount to that referred to above, namely, £4,000.</P>
    <P>The fact that liquidity has been restored to the Hospitals Trust Fund has enabled me to authorise the resumption of hospital building on a number of projects.  Among these is the new Erinville Maternity Hospital in Cork, on which work is now in progress. This hospital will provide accommodation for 54 maternity and gynaecology patients and a neo-natal unit of 14 cots.  A new nurses' home is in course of construction at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe.  Special attention is being directed to the improvement of conditions in mental hospitals and among the more important projects commenced is a new 60-bed admission unit at Cork Mental Hospital.  Work has also started on a scheme for the improvement of the water supply and the provision of central heating and new sanitary annexes at Clonmel Mental Hospital. Contracts are on the point of being placed for the building of extensions at the Home and School of the Immaculate Conception, Cregg House, Sligo, which caters for female mentally handicapped persons.  This project will provide 143 beds.</P>
    <P>Planning has almost been completed and it is expected that tenders will be invited in the near future for the building of extensions at St. Mary's Convent, South Hill, Delvin, where mentally handicapped persons are also cared for.  This scheme envisages the provision of 120 beds.  Work is also well under way on a building to house the cobalt therapy unit at St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin.  This form of treatment has not up to now been available here for patients suffering from cancer. A specially equipped and staffed radioisotope unit is also being provided at St. Luke's Hospital which in addition to catering for the needs of the hospital, will also provide a service for other hospitals requiring it.  The total cost of the projects which I have mentioned <Col N="272" /> is estimated at £830,000; and all of them, provided nothing extraordinary occurs, will be carried through to completion.</P>
    <P>Among the major voluntary hospital schemes to which approval was given in the past year was the resumption of work on the new St. Vincent's Hospital at Elm Park.  This will be a teaching hospital and will, therefore, be a most important addition to the hospital services in the Dublin area.  A grant of £1,500,000 has been promised for the project and planning work in connection with the superstructure is now in progress.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report that good progress is being made in planning the new Coombe Hospital and present indications are that it should be possible to commence building operations next year.</P>
    <P>Other works approved in principle at voluntary hospitals include the provision of accommodation for nurses at the North Charitable Infirmary, Cork, improvements in the accommodation at Cork Dental School, a new theatre suite and the renewal of the electrical installations generally at Jervis Street Hospital, and the reconstruction of premises at the National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street, to provide accommodation for nursing staff.  A scheme for the extension of accommodation at St. Vincent's, Lisnagry, County Limerick, will provide additional facilities for the care of female mentally handicapped persons.  The carrying out of improvements at St. Teresa's Home for Girls, Blackrock, County Dublin, where similar patients are cared for, has also been approved.</P>
    <P>On the local authority side, particular emphasis has been placed on improving the conditions in mental hospitals and county homes.  A short list of urgent works at mental hospitals has been drawn up and considerable progress in planning has been achieved.  The gross cost of the works involved is estimated at about £1,000,000.  I confidently expect that work on a number of these projects will start this year.  The decision, to which I referred last year, to press ahead with the planning of comprehensive <Col N="273" /> schemes of improvement in the county homes is being implemented with all possible speed.  Due, however, to the complex problems involved, and the very extensive nature of the work required, the planning is taking somewhat longer than I had expected.  This programme for the improvement of standards in the county homes is not being assisted by the Hospitals Trust Fund but, in accordance with a decision taken in September, 1951, will be financed from the Local Loans Fund.  Half of the loan charges, however, will be recouped to the local authorities concerned from the Vote for my Department.</P>
    <P>Among the more important works at local authority general hospitals which I approved during the past year and which are now being planned, are a scheme of improvements at the County Hospital, Wexford, and the provision of additional beds at Sligo County Hospital, including a sub-regional ear, nose and throat unit.</P>
    <P>There is an important aspect of hospital building to which, I feel, I should refer&mdash;that of the need for proper maintenance.  It is a matter which, unfortunately, has not received due attention from health authorities in the past.  The seriousness of it has been highlighted for me by recent cases of neglect, extending over many years, on the part of local authorities in relation to their mental hospital buildings.  The result of this continued lack of maintenance of the fabric of these buildings is that the unfortunate ratepayers of the areas concerned will now be faced with a heavy bill to remedy the widespread serious structural defects which neglect has allowed to develop.  The old adage &ldquo;a stitch in time saves nine&rdquo; is surely apposite here.</P>
    <P>Many of our health institutions, notably the mental hospitals and county homes, were built in the last century.  It should be obvious to the controlling authorities that, in such cases particularly, periodic inspection of the buildings and prompt attention to defects are vitally important for their proper preservation and for the <Col N="274" /> comfort of the patients and staff housed in them.  Furthermore, there has been a capital investment during the last thirty years of many millions, mainly from the Hospitals Trust Fund, on new local authority hospitals.  It is an obvious and essential part of the obligations of health authorities to see that these new hospitals are kept in a proper state of repair, and thus ensure that no part of these vital capital assets will be lost for the want of necessary maintenance.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department to examine this general problem, so that everything proper will be done to make certain that health authorities regularly and effectively will inspect all their institutions and operate a systematic maintenance procedure whereby structural defects will be remedied without delay.  Henceforth an effective check will be kept on the manner in which health authorities are fulfilling their obligations in this matter.</P>
    <P>The hospital treatment of tuberculosis does not now make the same demands on our resources as in recent times, so that the available accomodation is substantially in excess of needs. Steps are being taken to use for other health purposes those of the redundant sanatoria which can be adapted economically to such purposes.  During the past year, the reallocation of surplus tuberculosis accommodation brought a measure of relief to overcrowding in the mental hospitals.  The former sanatorium at Ballyowen, County Dublin, has now been opened for the treatment of acutely ill female mental patients. The former sanatoria at Shaen, County Laois, and at Listowel, County Kerry, were taken over to make room for some of the patients accommodated in overcrowded conditions at the mental hospitals at Portlaoise and Killarney.</P>
    <P>Because of certain difficulties in securing trained and experienced personnel, I have not been able to utilise Woodlands, in County Galway, as I had hoped.  Portion of it, however, is now being used for the purposes of a new industrial undertaking, pending the erection of its own factory.</P>
    <P>In the field of mental health a Commission of Inquiry is now investigating <Col N="275" /> the problem of mental handicap, and I hope in the very near future to announce the establishment of another, which will concern itself with mental illness.  These two Commissions are complementary and between them they will cover all aspects of the mental health services.  It will give some idea of the magnitude of their task when I say that the mentally ill and mentally handicapped occupy nearly as many places in hospitals as do all those treated for physical ailments.</P>
    <P>The main problems associated with the provision of a service for the mentally handicapped were set out in a White Paper which was published in 1960.  Very briefly they are: the organisation of services for the ascertainment and assessment of the degree of mental handicap; the establishment of domiciliary and out-patient services; the provision of appropriate institutional accommodation for those needing it; the organisation of an aftercare service; the provision of training and placing in employment of suitable persons; and last but by no means least, the recruitment of adequate trained personnel to provide the necessary services.</P>
    <P>These are formidable problems, and, inevitably, an attack upon them will cost a considerable amount of money. As I have previously emphasised, I regard it as essential that our services should be well conceived, well planned and calculated to yield the best results to those for whom they are provided, so that there will be no wastage of time, money or effort on haphazard, ill-considered, or non-productive developments.  In drawing up the terms of reference of the Commission free to advise me on every aspect of the care of those thus afflicted, to report objectively on our services as they exist and to recommend such changes as it considers desirable.  Pending the report of the Commission all possible steps to supply obvious needs will be taken.  At the moment we have accommodation in residential institutions for 2,734 patients, and <Col N="276" /> when the works now about to commence are completed, we shall then have about 3,000 places.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the Commission on Mental Illness have similarly been drawn to permit the Commission to examines all the problems involved with the utmost objectivity. I wish to assure the House, though, that any improvements in the facilities for mental treatment, which are obviously necessary and which can be made meantime, will be carried out without waiting for the Commission's report.</P>
    <P>During the past year a small reduction of 143 in the number of patients in mental hospitals was achieved.  Overcrowding in our district mental hospitals and auxiliary institutions is still, however, a major problem.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned two of the ways in which we are seeking to alleviate it&mdash;new building within the mental hospitals and the utilisation of redundant sanatoria accommodation. Even in advance of the report of the Commission on Mental Illness, I hope and trust that the ultimate solution will not be found along those lines. Indeed, as a layman, I feel quite certain that, in the future, treatment services will be developed outside the mental hospitals; whereby it will be made possible to discharge patients, under suitable conditions, at an earlier stage than at present.</P>
    <P>An interesting proposal made during the year and one to which I was happy to accord approval was the establishment of two day-hospitals, serving the towns of Monaghan and Cavan and the countryside immediately surrounding them.  The Monaghan unit should be operating in the near future.  The Cavan unit will come later.  I am sure that the House will appreciate the importance of these developments. Under them a patient who attends at a day hospital will have the benefit of the full range of therapeutic facilities ordinarily available only to hospital in-patients, but will also remain in contact with his family and his normal environment.  In this way he can avoid the sometimes painful process of rehabilitation and readjustment which is <Col N="277" /> the lot of the in-patient on discharge from a residential institution.  Moreover from the point of view of expenditure on health services, the day hospital offers considerable advantages. Less accommodation is required, and nursing and other costs are lower.  But needless to say I want the House to understand that this is the merest secondary consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to overstress the importance of this development&mdash;many conditions of mental illness cannot, for instance, be dealt with in such hospitals&mdash;but I think the House will join with me in congratulating the Cavan-Monaghan Mental Health Board and its staff on the initiative they have shown.</P>
    <P>A notable step forward in the organisation of rehabilitation services has been taken with the recent opening of the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Dún Laoghaire.  This centre will be operated by the Sisters of Mercy, in collaboration with the National Organisation for Rehabilitation.  Certain building works will be necessary in order to better adapt the hospital to its new purpose, and I have indicated that a grant from the Hospitals Trust Fund will be made to meet the cost of an approved scheme.  I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the combination of effort by these two organisations which is producing a more effective and economical result than could otherwise have been achieved.  Another new development in this field is the recent opening by the Irish Sisters of Chairty of an outpatients' clinic planned to provide a range of rehabilitation services at St. Anthony's, Merrion.</P>
    <P>In singling out for special mention the work of these bodies, I am not unmindful of the very valuable public service given by other voluntary bodies, great and small, throughout the country which have been operating rehabilitation services, perhaps in narrower fields, for some years past.  They have, by their efforts, put the community very greatly in their debt.  There is, however, an element of danger in such effort if it is not co-ordinated.  Overlapping <Col N="278" /> of activities could lead to waste of effort and money, and to frustration. The prevention of such overlapping and the achievement of co-ordination without regimentation was one of the objects which my immediate predecessor, Deputy T. F. O'Higgins, had in mind when he established the officially-appointed National Organisation for Rehabilitation.  I have decided, as a matter of settled policy on my part, that before official support can be given to the establishment or development of any rehabilitation project, the advice of the Organisation will be sought.  I have no doubt that such advice from that objective and broadly-based body will be of the greatest value to me, to future Ministers for Health and to the various groups operating in this field.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a few points in connection with the operation of what are known officially as the General Medical Services.  Due to the extensive press publicity given to them at the time, Deputies are doubtless aware that in certain cases fees were accepted by dispensary doctors from persons who were entitled to general practitioner services free of charge, and of the action I felt compelled to take.</P>
    <P>A district medical officer, that is to say a dispensary doctor, when he accepts one of these much sought after appointments enters into a solemn contract with the health authority, in consideration for the payment of a salary, to provide, to the best of his professional ability and without charge, for every person in his district determined by the health authority by the issue of a medical card to be so entitled, a comprehensive general practitioner medical service at the officially appointed dispensary at the officially appointed time, or at the patient's home if he is unable, because of his illness, to travel to the dispensary. Consequently, deliberate failure to give prompt and adequate attention, the conscious creation by his actions of the feeling that a better or more prompt service would be given if a payment were made, a demand for a fee or the acceptance of a fee or other reward, constitutes a breach of the <Col N="279" /> obligations to the patient and to the health authority into which he entered voluntarily in accepting appointment.</P>
    <P>I believe that the attitude of the very large majority of dispensary doctors towards their eligible patients is above reproach, but, if a dispensary doctor is so callous as to exploit the need of a poor person who is without means to engage a private doctor, then I am certain that Dáil Éireann would not expect me or any other Minister for Health to tolerate such exploitation. I feel confident that the House will, accordingly, endorse the warning which I now give that lack of proper attention to eligible patients or the demanding or acceptance of fees from them, will be dealt with most severely. Health authorities have recently granted a liberal increase in salary to district medical officers so that the argument, invalid though it always was, that dispensary doctors were entitled to accept fees because their salary was inadequate has even less substance than it had before.</P>
    <P>Experience of the operation of dispensary medical services has shown the need from time to time for the revision of dispensary districts in various areas, but more especially in urban centres, in order to improve the standard of services in those areas, by, for example, affording relief to district medical officers, responsible for the care of an excessive number of eligible persons, or by allowing the attendance of eligible persons at more convenient centres.  During the past year certain dispensary districts in the Dublin, Limerick city and Cobh areas were altered in this way.  Major revisions are also under consideration in Cork city and suburbs, Galway, Kildare and a number of other health authority areas.</P>
    <P>In dealing with such revisions in the larger urban areas I have thought it wise to depart, where possible, from the rather rigid sub-divisions of such areas previously in operation.  Instead, it is intended where appropriate to have one dispensary district embracing the whole urban area.  Duties can then be allocated to an appropriate number of district medical officers in the dispensary district, each one being assigned a <Col N="280" /> sub-division of the district.  This arrangement will be more flexible, as the sub-divisions may be varied administratively by the manager, with the consent of the Minister.  It will allow the health authority to deal speedily with problems arising out of shifts of population within the urban area.</P>
    <P>Under an Age Limits Declaration made in January, 1960, the retiring age of 70 was fixed for dispensary doctors, to operate from 1st July, 1960.  The age limit for other officers in the local authority services is 65.  Following representations made to me, by individual dispensary doctors and by groups of such doctors, in which the unusual nature of the position of dispensary doctors was stressed, I took measures to ease the effect of the Declaration in certain respects.</P>
    <P>These measures included the postponement of the operation of the Declaration from 1st July, 1960 to 1st January last, the raising of the age limit for dispensary doctors who had reached the age of 67 years on 1st August 1960, to 72 and the fixing of an age limit between 70 and 72 for those between 65 and 67 on 1st August, 1960.  In addition, I arranged that dispensary doctors may, when they retire from their permanent posts under the revised age limits as thus fixed, be in some cases retained in a temporary capacity for a while.</P>
    <P>These concessions ensured that no dispensary doctor would have to retire without having a reasonable period in which to prepare for retirement.  However, it was also represented to me that, these doctors being part-time officers, their pension compensates only for the loss of official emoluments and makes no provision for loss of private practice or disturbance of residence following upon retirement. This could constitute a hardship on officers who could previously expect that they might continue in office until death or voluntary retirement.  To alleviate such hardship it is proposed, under Subhead N of the Vote, to make special compensatory payments to dispensary doctors retiring under the age-limit order within seven years of its <Col N="281" /> commencement.  The payments will take the form of a supplement to the pension payable by the health authority, varying in amount from 50 per cent. of the pension for those retiring this year down to 10 per cent. for those retiring in 1967.  In all cases payment of the supplement will cease to be paid six years after the doctor's retirement.</P>
    <P>In addition, to compensate for loss of the use of official dispensary residences, it is intended to make lump sum payments varying from £500 for those retiring in the year ending on before 1st July next, down to £100 for those retiring in the year ending on 30th June, 1965.  This part of the scheme of compensation will cease to operate on that date.  The estimated cost in the present year of supplements to pensions is £7,100 and that of the lump sum payments is £3,900.</P>
    <P>These supplements and lump sums will fall finally on the Exchequer; health authorities will not be required to meet any portion of them.  Any necessary statutory provision will be included in a forthcoming superannuation Bill; but in the meantime, I am anxious that the doctors concerned should not remain out of their money and consequently, if the House agrees, I propose to authorise payment as soon as possible after the Estimate has been taken.  For that purpose, I am asking that the Estimate should be reported immediately after it has been passed in Committee.  I should be grateful for the co-operation of Deputies in this matter.</P>
    <P>There have been references from time to time to the desirability of providing a choice of doctor for persons eligible for the general medical service, by substituting for the dispensary service a panel scheme for persons in the lower income group.  This question was examined in my Department as far back as 1953, when Deputy Dr. Ryan was Minister for Health.  It also received the close attention of Deputy T. F. O'Higgins when he was Minister. I also have considered it very carefully. Apart, however, from the important question of extra cost, and the burden which this would impose, particularly <Col N="282" /> on the rates, there are practical difficulties and disadvantages in this proposal which cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a panel scheme pre-supposes the abolition of the dispensary system in its present form and the remuneration of participating doctors on a capitation basis.  This, of course, would constitute something of a major revolution.  Apart from this, a highly practical consideration is the fact that in many of the rural areas&mdash;indeed in substantially more than one-half of the total number of dispensary districts&mdash;the dispensary doctor is the only doctor available within a reasonable distance.  Consequently, in actual practice there cannot be a true choice of doctor in such areas.  Indeed, one can go further and say that, were it not for the inducement of the regular salary attaching to the post of dispensary medical officer, there would be little to attract private practitioners to set up practice in remote districts with small scattered populations.  It will be appreciated, therefore, that if it were not for the present system, there probably would not be the services of even one general practitioner available for the lower income group in these districts and, incidentally, for persons in other income groups who can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>This objection does not, of course, apply to urban areas nor to all rural areas and we could consider a selective panel scheme for suitable districts.  On the face of it, this seems feasible but I doubt if it would secure universal acceptance.  The provision of a panel scheme in any area would be considerably more expensive than the present arrangement.  In the typical county which includes both urban and rural areas, and in the areas of the Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford health authorities, this would mean that the local authority would be asked to provide, and finance to the extent of one-half, a more expensive service for the town dwellers than for the remainder of their ratepayers.  Now, it is true that urban authorities already provide services and amenities&mdash;water supply, sanitation, lighting and so on&mdash;which it cannot or at least does not provide for most of the rural dwellers, and this <Col N="283" /> often gives rise to bitter complaints from the rural ratepayers.  It is only rational to anticipate that county health authorities will be reluctant to concede a further expensive service to the urban areas, and to do this largely at the expense of the rural dweller.</P>
    <P>Even if we could surmount this hurdle and bring in the panel scheme in selected areas, I can foresee at least one other big disadvantage in its operation.  As Deputies will be aware, eligibility for the General Medical Service is governed by inclusion in the General Medical Services Register.  The local authority decides the cases which are deserving of inclusion in the register and the standards which they apply are not infrequently a vexed local issue, some echoes of which we hear occasionally in this House.  In saying this, I do not wish to infer that I believe that there is any general cause for complaint, but if any Deputy does believe that there are grounds for complaint, let him consider what the effect of introducing a panel scheme would be.</P>
    <P>At present, it does not cost the local authority very much to add another name to the Register.  The dispensary doctor's salary must be paid in any event and, apart from maternity cash grants, the only extra liability in respect of an additional individual would arise from the supply of drugs and medicines.  This easy position would not obtain under a panel scheme. Every name added to the Register would mean that the local authority would pay to a doctor on the panel a <i>per capita</i> payment for that person (and, if he had dependants, for each of them) and would also have to budget for the medicines which might be prescribed for them by that doctor.  A definite and immediate liability to expend a sum of, perhaps, £10, might be incurred by the inclusion of an additional name in the Register.  This being the position it is likely that there would be much greater reluctance to allow an individual's name to go on a panel than there is now to grant him a medical card.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from this that such a <Col N="284" /> change cannot be readily made.  It is, of course, a possible improvement which must fall for consideration in the future development of the health services; therefore I have arranged for my Department to assemble all the relevant facts and estimates of costs, and in due course the Minister for Health will be in a position to study the matter again in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>It may be that some Minister for Health will be able to devise a scheme which will give a choice of doctor to everybody who is entitled to have general practitioner services free of cost to himself and his family.  In all realism we must recognise that this is not likely to be feasible in this country, having regard to the pattern of distribution of the population.  I think, however, it is essential that it should be accepted that it would be inequitable to provide such a service for urban dwellers only while requiring the rural ratepayers to contribute in proportion to their valuations to the actual cost.  It seems to me, therefore, that if the right to choose their own doctor is to be afforded to these members of the lower income group who are resident in our cities and towns, the urban ratepayers must be asked to foot the bill.  Indeed, there is a strong case in equity for permitting each urban area itself to decide whether it will allow those of its citizens who are within the lower income group to have a general practitioner of their own choice.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, it is my policy, as it was my predecessor's, because of the limited amount of funds and dental personnel available, to urge local authorities to concentrate mainly on providing dental treatment for those who will benefit most from such treatment, namely children.  This means, of course, that only a limited dental service can be made available for eligible adults, those in the lower income group.  Such improvements in the situation as we can achieve by the recruitment of wholetime dental officers in areas where they are urgently needed, and, in a number of the larger areas, by the appointment of senior dental surgeons who will organise and co-ordinate the services as well as carry out dental treatment themselves <Col N="285" /> will still be inadequate for the provision of a comprehensive service for all those eligible.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of public disquiet from time to time here as in other countries, as to the possibility of &ldquo;fall-out&rdquo; from tests of nuclear weapons giving rise to a dangerous level of radioactivity in our food.  I have answered various Parliamentary Questions in connection with it.  During the past twelve months this matter has been the subject of a special study by officers from all the interested Departments.  The results of the study, and of the tests which were undertaken in the course of it, will shortly be published.  I can say, however, at this stage that the conclusions are reassuring and indicate, as we had anticipated by extrapolation of the results of similar tests in Britain, that no danger exists from radioactive fall-out in this country.</P>
    <P>In speaking of last year's Estimates I referred to the Health Authorities Act, 1960.  Since that time the transition to the new health authorities for the Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford areas has been effected smoothly and with the minimum of disruption.  The division of the expenses of the new Health Authorities as between the bodies which appoint them is an important feature of the Act and in this connection it is gratifying to record that agreement has been reached in the Dublin and Waterford areas in regard to the basis of contribution.  Temporary arrangements, as provided for in the Act, are in operation in the Cork and Limerick areas and discussions in regard to the permanent basis for dividing the costs in these areas are in progress.</P>
    <P>Many of the more important provisions of the Mental Treatment Act, 1961, were brought into operation on 1st April last.  These included those relating to superannuation.  The remainder of the Act will be brought into operation very soon.  The relevant Regulations have been drafted and the necessary consultations are almost at an end.  When the Bill was before the House I announced that I hoped to translate the complex superannuation <Col N="286" /> provisions into more simple language and to issue this paraphrase as a memorandum to the staffs of district mental hospitals so that they could appreciate the effect of the options provided for.  I am afraid that when the memorandum is issued in the near future it will be found not to be as easily understood as had been originally hoped but I know that interested Deputies and staff organisations will understand the difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the decision of the Supreme Court in regard to the Solicitors Bill, 1954, it has been found necessary to consider the provisions in the various Acts relating to the registration of medical practitioners, dentists, nurses, pharmacists and opticians, dealing with disciplinary control in cases of serious misdemeanours which would lead to the persons concerned being struck off the appropriate register.</P>
    <P>When we speak of broad developments under various aspects of health legislation or mention improvements which have taken place in the health services, it is sometimes easy to overlook the fact that these developments and improvements could not have been achieved without the aid of the necessary professional, technical and ancillary personnel.  It is important that, in order to secure and retain staff of the required calibre and to ensure that the services will be of the highest quality, the remuneration offered to them does not lag behind that in comparable employments elsewhere.</P>
    <P>During the past year I was glad to be in a position to accord unqualified approval to the implementation by health authorities of increased salaries for certain grades of medical and dental personnel.  The increases were the outcome of negotiations between representatives of the various staffs concerned and their health authorities. I hope that the improvements granted will have the effect of attracting into the local services an adequate supply of suitable personnel and that they will help to overcome the difficulties which have been experienced in the recruitment of certain grades, especially junior medical staffs and dental surgeons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> In the case of nursing staff, proposals for increased remuneration are at present under consideration locally, following the submission of claims affecting all grades of nursing personnel employed in the local service.  When proposals are received in my Department, I shall be glad to consider them as sympathetically as circumstances will permit.</P>
    <P>It has been contended that the 1953 Health Act has been responsible for an unwarranted increase in the cost of our health services.  I have already shown</P>
    <P>(1)  that much the greater part of any increase which has occurred has been due to the fall in the purchasing power of money and that this influence has been world-wide in its operation and</P>
    <P>(2)  that a substantial fraction of the increase has been occasioned by our efforts to make good certain acknowledged but deplorable deficiencies in our existing services, as, for example, the provision made for the treatment of mental illness and for the care of persons labouring under mental handicap in various forms.</P>
    <P>Our efforts to deal with these and other problems, like the problem of rehabilitation, have resulted in increased charges on the community. But these have been largely offset by economies in the longer-established services, so that the net effect, as I have shown, has been to stabilise and, indeed, to slightly reduce, the over-all cost of the services in its relation to the gross national product.</P>
    <P>We must all recognise, however, that, in its attitude towards the maintenance of the health of its individual members, the community must conform to the spirit of the times.  It cannot be indifferent to the sufferings of even its least worthy citizen.  Indeed, in charity, it is bound to succour him and, if he should be ill, to do its utmost to ensure that all therapeutic facilities available to it will be afforded to him.  Equally such facilities must be available to all others who may require to have recourse to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> With the increased development of medical knowledge and skill, the scope of all such services must expand.  Unfortunately, it would appear that a concomitant increase in the cost of them cannot be avoided.  So the natural trend is for the cost of health services everywhere to increase.  I submit that I have demonstrated that in our case the increase, if any, has been nominal, though the improvement in our services has been striking.  Taking everything into account, the amount which Dáil Éireann is now being asked to vote for the maintenance and improvement of the health services is reasonable, and I recommend the motion accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the matters which have been referred to by the Minister and with the point of view we desire to express, I think I should say that this is the fifth Estimate speech which the Minister has made as Minister for Health.  Personally, I am glad to see that he has not lost any of the strength, virility and mode of expression which he has demonstrated so well in this House over the years.  If in what I have to say on this important Estimate I appear to be critical of the Minister, I hope it will be understood it is not criticism of the Minister personally, because the Minister is a person for whom I have always entertained a very high regard.  Having said that&mdash;having &ldquo;cleared the decks,&rdquo; if you like&mdash;may dealing with the Estimate, inevitably deal with the Minister as Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech here today the Minister has displayed&mdash;I assume intentionally &mdash;a certain feeling of complacency with regard to our health services, our present situation and what has taken place over the last few years under his administration.  I wonder is that justified? First, I would ask the House to examine the record and to have regard in this debate to the fact that the Minister is now rendering an account to the House of his stewardship over the past five years.  Inevitably, <Col N="289" /> in discussing this Estimate, we must have regard not merely to the events of the last 365 days but also to the events of recent years, if we are to come to a proper decision as to whether the Department of Health has been properly administered or not.</P>
    <P>We all know&mdash;many of us bear the battle scars of it&mdash;that, over the years, the subject of health has been a source of considerable controversy, controversy along a variety of lines, conducted and carried on by different persons&mdash; a controversy which at times had good aims and objects, but one which, at times, was bitter, spiteful and harmful, and, from a national point of view, dangerous.  Indeed, the Health Act of 1953, under which the Minister administers many of the services he has referred to in his speech, was passed through this House at a time when this controversy of dissension and bitterness was, perhaps, at its height.  Indeed, I can recollect, as most Deputies can recollect, that in 1953, when the Health Act was passed through this House, there was a state of almost open warfare between the then Minister for Health and the medical profession and persons in allied professions.  That situation was deplorable.  It would not be proper for or open to me to go into the reasons for it, but I do not think the reasons matter.</P>
    <P>At the time the Health Act was introduced the situation was on all grounds most unsatisfactory.  I recall to the House that, when the Government changed in 1954, it became my duty and my aim to end that unsatisfactory situation.  I think I can say with some justification that I succeeded. By 1957 dissension and bitterness had entirely disappeared and when the present Minister became Minister for Health in 1957 he entered upon his high office with considerable advantages. The heat was off Health.  I shall not say that the flags had been struck, but the drums had certainly ceased to roll.  It is fair to say that many medical men had seen for the first time the inside of the Custom House, had learned to meet the officials of the Department of Health, and had realised that these officials did not wear horns and tails and cloven feet.  That was a <Col N="290" /> very healthy situation then and it was a potentially healthy situation when the Minister assumed office.  I mention that because I think it is a matter that should be mentioned now.</P>
    <P>In 1957 the stage was set for a period of orderly progress and advance in health matters.  Perhaps to some extent I was at fault, but I have no doubt that in 1957, no matter what way one looked at the health services, there was tremendous room for expansion and improvement and the country was entitled to expect from the Minister for Health that whatever snags, problems and difficulties remained to be tackled would be tackled, resolved and overcome.  They were entitled to expect from the Minister a continued attention to the improvement of health services and the implementation of the Act of 1953.  I shall have something to say about that later.  They were certainly entitled to expect that the last four-and-a-half years would have been devoted towards improving the health services available to them.  There continues to be a whole variety of problems which require tackling.  The recruiting of staff and the management of local authority hospitals is one example.  I shall refer to that again.  The provision of a dental service, of an ophthalmic service and of an aural service had not been solved in 1957.  One would have expected that they would all have received attention in the last four-and-a-half years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the problem of rehabilitation, again one would have expected in the last four-and-a-half years that the provisions of Section 50 of the Health Act would have been put into operation.  In a variety of directions it was resonable to expect that some progress would have been made in the last four-and-a-half years. When the present Minister assumed office he had available to him a huge fund of goodwill and all he had to do was to avail of that goodwill in the interests of the services for which he is responsible.</P>
    <P>We all know that unfortunately that was not to be the evolution of events. Beginning in a small way&mdash;whether it was intended, or accidental, I am not concerned which&mdash;a new break began <Col N="291" /> to appear between the Minister and the medical profession.  I am not concerned with who began it.  It is very little consolation to persons around whom war is waging that some particular person or one particular side fired the first shot.  I am concerned with the effect that the renewal of strife between the Minister and the medical profession has had&mdash;not on doctors; I am not concerned with them and I do not speak for them; not on the Minister; I am not politically concerned in any way with the Minister, and I certainly do not speak for him&mdash; on the health services and on the people of the country.  We have had in the last four years, blowing sometimes hotter, sometimes colder, but consistently, a continued exchange of bulletins, incivilities of one kind or another, between the Minister for Health and the medical profession.  We have had letters in the Press, replies, statements carrying particular meanings, half threats, and all the rest of it.</P>
    <P>Indeed, quite recently, the Minister has apparently decided not to use his own name and he has got somebody else to write these letters for him.  The voice is the voice of Jacob but the hand is the hand of Esau and I have little doubt, so long as the Minister continues to display the attitude that he must score off the medical profession, or the Medical Association, no basis for an understanding can be established.  As I say, I am not concerned with the rights or wrongs of it, but I am concerned with the effect of it; and the effect has been&mdash;the Minister must realise this&mdash;that there has grown up a sense of frustration, of bitterness and a profound lack of trust in so far as the medical profession is concerned.  So far as the Department of Health is concerned, the Department has been deprived of the advice and the assistance it should have had in the last four-and-a-half years.</P>
    <P>I know that this is a political question. The Minister has been in politics long enough to know these things better than I do but I would expect that a hard-headed politician may feel that politically it is a sound thing to war with the medical profession.  Politically, <Col N="292" /> there may be votes in continuing a senseless strife with Irish doctors but I do not think that that is in itself a justification or, indeed, an attitude that should be adopted by any Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Last year, I referred to this matter and I appealed, in so far as an individual Deputy could, for some birth of understanding on the part of both the Medical Association and the Minister. The point of view I expressed was repeated by other Deputies.  The fact is that there has been no change and no effort on the part of the Minister or, so far as I know, of anybody else, to bring this senseless rowing to an end.  It has continued just the same, unabated, and the people have had to bear the consequences.  It is now too late, I suppose, for the Minister to do anything about it.  The Minister has introduced his last Estimate and accordingly we can only look in another direction for restoration of some measure of peace and harmony between the medical profession and the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I do not understand what the dispute is about but certainly there is no question of principle, policy or philosophy involved because those differences were overcome a number of years ago.  What is involved now is, perhaps, just a disharmony in personalities more than anything else.  The effect of all this is felt by the people.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to refer to what I regard as the problems which face the Minister and which should have been engaging his attention.  In this debate today, the Minister has defended the Health Act and the policy enshrined therein, in accordance with his duties as Minister for Health, but there are grave criticisms to be levelled at the manner in which the services under the Health Act are at the moment provided.  I propose to mention some of these difficulties as they appear to me in order to illustrate the vast amount of work which still remains to be done before this country has available to it a proper health service.</P>
    <P>In the first place, I should like to refer to the general medical service. <Col N="293" /> I suppose that service is best understood by mentioning the words &ldquo;medical cards&rdquo;.  The general medical service was put into the Health Act introduced in 1953 to replace the red ticket system of medicine.  Indeed, I remember speeches made by the Minister's predecessor and other members of the Minister's Party at that time. One could only feel that something wonderful was to be achieved if the red ticket were to cease and this medical card were to take its place. The reality behind the general medical service for the poor is that nothing new was intended and that the same service as previously existed was carried over in the Health Act, 1953. That, of course, is the dispensary system of medicine that was first introduced here under the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1851.</P>
    <P>I shall not spend any time in criticising the dispensary system, but I do say that it was never intended to be anything more, and has not been anything more, than an emergency service for sick or dying poor people.  It was so introduced.  That was the object of it 100 years ago when starvation and famine stalked this land.  It was intended to provide an emergency medical service against the mishap of starving poor Irish people dying.  That is the philosophy behind the service. That is what it was designed to achieve.  Unchanged, it is in the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>I wonder was that understood?  In 1953 or 1954, when people were asked to vote for the Fianna Fáil Health Act, was it understood that the very medical service which they were promised was merely the mixture as before, the British dispensary charitable medical service which had been in existence under the Public Assistance Act of 1839 and other statutes? In any event, there it is, in the Health Act, under Section 14, and it is provided in accordance with regulations which have to be made and which have been made by the Minister for Health and it is available to persons defined as persons who are unable by their own industry or other lawful means to provide for themselves.  That is the definition of a pauper and this <Col N="294" /> is a pauper service, intended for that purpose and, in fact, in accordance with that section, so operated.</P>
    <P>I should like to question&mdash;I was certainly concerned about it when I had the responsibility&mdash;whether that kind of free medical service is good enough for this country.  Is there any reason for the complacency the Minister displayed with regard to it here this evening?  Is it good enough that in 1961 this country would have precisely the same medical service as it had in 1851?  Are we to shrug off the fact that 110 years have passed and that certainly in relation to the duty of a State towards its citizens there has been a growth and a profound change in social outlook and in what is regarded as being the duty and the obligation of a State.  There it is. That is the general medical service that we provide today for this country and the Minister for Health is complacent about it and, apparently, thinks it is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>That service, bad as it is, poor as it is, is administered in a particular way under dispensary medical officers appointed by health authorities on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commission to provide the service in particular areas.  Could anything be worse?  Granted that the dispensary system is a poor quality service&mdash;as it is administered by a single doctor who is paid a salary for doing it, obviously the type of service is going to be very bad indeed.  There is no incentive to provide a better or improving service, no incentive on the part of the doctors.  They do their best, I know, within the limitations of the dispensary service.</P>
    <P>The Irish dispensary doctor has done a tremendous amount but there is little incentive for better medical practice. Many dispensary doctors in the more populated areas also find they have so many calls upon them that they cannot deal adequately and properly with sick people in their homes.  Remember the service as it is operated in accordance with the regulations is a service for the sick poor at a stated dispensary at a stated time.  They must be in the place designated at the appointed time <Col N="295" /> but if a poor person is sick and in his home, the doctor must call upon him. That takes time.  It involves the difficulty of doing it and, of course, frequently that sick person is sent to hospital because the doctor has not time available adequately to treat him as a domiciliary patient.</P>
    <P>The result of this cheap, poor, medical service has been, in many cases, a very high hospitalisation rate.  I often wonder, as I have mentioned before, whether, in saving halfpence and pennies on general medical services, we have not been adding quite enormously to the health services bill in relation to hospitals.  I have little doubt that the high hospitalisation rate in this country and, particularly in the most populous areas, is due to the fact that under the present dispensary medical service, it is found the easier thing to do to send the person concerned to hospital.  That is one defect, and a serious one that should command attention.</P>
    <P>There are other defects which must be faced.  The free medical service under the Health Act is available, of course, only to a limited section of the population.  Those who qualify within the definition are the very poor who cannot provide for themselves. No medical service is available for anybody else.  I wonder was that appreciated and understood when the Fianna Fáil health scheme was put before the people in the 1954 general election. Was it understood that under this Act the worker, the small farmer, or the ordinary self-employed person who becomes sick or whose child becomes sick has no claim whatever to avail of the medical service in this country? He has to go out in the middle of family illness, pay the doctor, go to the chemist, and pay for drugs and medicines and face all the increasing expenditure on these matters.  Under the services as they are, that person&mdash;and there are hundreds of thousands of them&mdash;is not entitled to any benefit.</P>
    <P>Apart from the limited scope of the general medical service, it is also true &mdash;I think this may be accepted now but it certainly is strange&mdash;that those <Col N="296" /> who provide the money for the service, those who have to bear the cost of it, the ratepayers, no matter what their rates may be, must finance the health authority's contribution towards the cost of the general medical service and they are still deprived of any benefit from it for themselves.  That is a strange position.  It is strange that the cost of this service should fall upon many people who are automatically deprived of any benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I mention this question of the general medical service as one problem inherent in the administration of the Health Act that should have got attention over the past 4½ years.  When I was Minister for Health, I expressed the hope that something might be done in an administrative way to improve the dispensary system of medicine and I suggested providing at least a choice of doctor.  I think I mentioned that last year on the Estimate and the Minister &mdash;I am personally obliged to him&mdash;has obviously given the matter some considerable attention in the past 10 months.  I wonder what decision he has come to because in his speech here today he was&mdash;if I may say it without being offensive&mdash;blowing rather hot and cold.  He said it would be a good thing to provide a choice of doctor but there were difficulties of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I agree that there are difficulties and I think anybody who studies this problem would not be surprised to hear that difficulties did exist, but the difficulties that are there now in 1961 are all difficulties which I certainly anticipated back in 1957.  If it is the concern and obligation of the Minister for Health to provide within the framework of legislation passed in this House the best possible service, why, in the past 4½ years, were these problems and difficulties not tackled?</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Health Act lays down that a general medical service is to be provided by health authorities in accordance with regulations made by the Minister.  That does not mean any kind of a health service.  It means that a Minister charged with that responsibility must ensure, within the limits of his powers and the legislation <Col N="297" /> passed, that the best possible service is provided.  He may have difficulty with his colleagues. That is one obstacle he must overcome, but I have little doubt that if it had engaged his attention over the past 4½ years progress could have been made.  The fact unfortunately has been that the Minister, so far as the record is concerned, gave this matter no attention, with the result that he can come in here with his fifth Estimate speech and refer for the first time to a choice of doctor in relation to the dispensary service and say: &ldquo;Well, I am having the problem assessed so that somebody else, if he wishes, can deal with it.&rdquo;  That was a very poor report for the Minister to give to the House. In relation to health, we have given the Minister every possible opportunity to make progress.  We have not tried to make health a political issue as it used to be and if we are critical this year on the subject of health, we have good grounds for being critical.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the dental service.  I do not know whether you realise, Sir, that away back in 1953 this House in passing the Health Act of that year passed the section which provides that &ldquo;a health authority shall&rdquo;&mdash;not &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;in accordance with regulations, make available, either, as may be specified in the regulations, without charge or at charges approved of or directed by the Minister&rdquo; a dental service and dental appliances for all persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952 and for their dependants, for all adult persons whose yearly means were less than £600&mdash;it is now £1,000&mdash;for all farmers with a valuation up to £50 and everybody else who could establish any case of hardship.  All these people, their wives and families and all poor people were, under Section 21 of the Health Act, 1953, to have a complete dental service and, in addition, were to be supplied with all the dental appliances, dentures, and so on, they might require.</P>
    <P>That is a section of an Act of Parliament passed eight years ago, part of the Fianna Fáil health scheme, part of the case they made to the people in the general election campaign of 1954 <Col N="298" /> when they had posters up referring to health and wealth: &ldquo;Vote for Fianna Fáil: Look at our health scheme&mdash; a free medical service.&rdquo;  A dental service was to be provided for 85 per cent. of the population, for all poor people, all insured persons, all self-employed people up to £600 income, all farmers up to £50 valuation, and then for good measure, for anybody else who had a hard luck story to tell.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what report the Minister can give us now in 1961 as to when this service will be provided. It is worth recalling that my immediate predecessor in office as Minister for Health who steered this Bill through the Dáil was obviously sublimely confident or perhaps he was affected by other views, when he made these regulations and decided to bring this scheme into operation.  When I became Minister for Health, I was appalled when I came to look at this problem of the dental service away back in 1954.  Apart altogether from the money&mdash;I did not know where the money was to come from&mdash;neither the dentists nor the facilities were available. I decided at that time as a limited decision&mdash;although I was committed by an undertaking given by me on behalf of my colleagues as fully as possible to implement this Act&mdash;that this section dealing with the dental service could not then be operated and with the authority of the then Government, I decided not to proceed with it at that time and to concentrate on building up the school dental service.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred in his speech today to that decision which was taken seven years ago to build up the school dental service and to continue whatever service was possible for poor people.  Is that all the Minister has to say?  That is the decision I announced in 1954 and indeed I was ballyragged in this House by the Minister's colleagues as to why I had scrapped the grand Fianna Fáil dental scheme contained in Section 21.  I explained to them then and I hope I have convinced them that it was not possible then to implement it.</P>
    <P>What progress has been made since? What, if any, progress has been made over the past 4½ years in providing <Col N="299" /> this dental service for which this House was asked to legislate by the Fianna Fáil Party?  Is legislation passed by this House just to be treated as if it had never been passed?  I am speaking as one who opposed this section and opposed this Bill and I am speaking across the House to a Minister who supported it and voted for it. Is this just to be thrown away as if this section had never appeared on our statute book&mdash;a dental service for 85 per cent. of our people?  I did not believe it was possible at the time and I think it has been proved that it was not possible and was not intended. However, what I am concerned about is, what in fact has been achieved?  I decided to concentrate on a school dental service and the Minister has continued it.  I assume the Minister will be able to tell us what progress has been made in that regard.</P>
    <P>What about poor people?  Let us forget about all the 7,000 insured workers that were supposed to get a dental service.  Let us forget about the self-employed person and the farmer up to £50 valuation and the hard-luck cases.  All these people were led to believe they were to get dentures and the services of dentists on the rates. Surely in the last four and a half years the Minister should be able to tell us that at least some progress has been made in providing a dental service for poor people?</P>
    <P>Of course, we know the Minister cannot tell us that.  Today in this country, just as in 1954, there are poor people who have been applicants for dentures.  They hold medical cards. They are persons unable to provide for themselves, who have been seven, eight or nine years waiting for the provision of dentures, people who, nine or ten years ago, had all their teeth removed. In accordance with that section, they applied to the local health authority for the provision of dentures.  Of course, they cannot get them because the service is not there.  The scheme has not been devised.  No progress has been made in providing the service and they are without any relief.</P>
    <P>Again, if the Minister, instead of <Col N="300" /> spending his time carrying on an abortive row with the I.M.A., had been, as he should have been, concerned with the poor people who were supposed to benefit under this section, we would expect him to be able to say: &ldquo;Well, I cannot yet bring in Section 21 in full, but at least I am now in a position to provide a dental service for poor people.&rdquo;  Instead he says in his speech here today what I had to say&mdash;and I was ashamed to have to say it&mdash;to every health authority in the country seven years ago.  I had to say it but I certainly would have felt that seven years later somebody else would have been in a position to report something a bit brighter.</P>
    <P>There it is.  There is a dental service under this Health Act of 1953 and it might as well never have been put into the Act.  I do not know why the House was asked to pass that section, a section which puts a statutory obligation on health authorities to provide this service&mdash;a service that apparently never was really intended to be provided and certainly a service in regard to which the Minister has not been able to show any progress.</P>
    <P>That is the dental service under the Health Act, but there is also an ophthalmic service.  Again, an ophthalmic service was one of the carrots put before the people in the general election of 1954.  They were told that, under the Fianna Fáil Health Act of 1953, there would be available not only for poor people but for every insured person, his wife, his children, and his dependants, for every self-employed person running a small shop or whatever it may be, for his or her dependants, for every farmer&mdash;not the small farmer only but every farmer up to £50 valuation&mdash;an ophthalmic service with the services of specialist and experienced people.  They were told that if they or any of their dependants required them, they would get glasses and ophthalmic appliances under this service.</P>
    <P>That is in Section 21 of the Health Act.  Again, this service was not to be a discretionary matter; it was to become a statutory obligation on the health authority.  I do not know what has happened about this service.  It <Col N="301" /> certainly is not there.  The Minister cannot tell us anything about it.  Apart from the glasses provided under the Schools Medical Service, as far as I know there are no ophthalmic appliances or glasses provided at the moment even for poor people.  This scheme is not operating.  Again, one would expect the Minister to be able to report some progress in this respect.</P>
    <P>There are two services, a dental service and an ophthalmic service.  I have little doubt that many a Fianna Fáil Deputy or candidate made grand speeches some seven or eight years ago about the benefits that were to be provided in this kind of service.  But there is a third one, an aural service.  Under Section 21 of the Health Act, 1953&mdash; again with no question of discretion&mdash; every health authority is placed under a statutory obligation to provide hearing aids for persons who require them &mdash;all insured persons and their dependants; all farmers up to £50 valuation; all self-employed persons up to £600 a year and so on.  Everybody must have known when this was urged here that any service of that kind would have been a difficult, and, probably, an expensive one.  But the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Health would have nothing to do with that.  It could be provided; it was going to be provided; it was put into the Act.  But where is it today?  I would suggest that one could count on one's ten fingers the number of hearing aids that have been made available, even to poor people, in the last eight years.  The service just is not there and there is no evidence that it is going to be there.</P>
    <P>Again, leaving aside insured persons, farmers and so on who could be expected at least to contribute to the cost of these things, poor people who have no other means apparently can go to their grave without them.  If they need a hearing aid, they certainly will not get it.  The only trouble is they will not be able to hear the apologies made to them for not providing the service they were promised.</P>
    <P>There are three services under this Act about which we do not know anything.  But the story does not end there.  The Health Act of 1953 also provided, in Section 50, that a <Col N="302" /> health authority shall&mdash;again there is no question of discretion&mdash;make available a service for the training of disabled persons for employment suitable to their condition of health and for the making of arrangements with employers for placing disabled persons in suitable employment.  Again, this rehabilitation and maintenance service for disabled persons was part and parcel of the Health Act this House passed eight years ago, and again we are entitled to know what progress has been made in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a slender reference to rehabilitation.  He referred to the National Organisation of Rehabilitation which I established.  I established that Organisation as an advisory body to examine the problem of rehabilitation and to advice the Minister for Health on the way in which the necessary services could best be provided. That Organisation was set up in, I think, the year 1955.  I do not know when it reported, but I should have expected that the Minister today would have been able to give us some indication or evidence of this service going into operation.  Instead, he referred to the fact&mdash;I was glad to hear it&mdash;that the Lourdes Hospital in Dún Laoghaire has been taken over.  The decision in that respect was taken twelve months ago.</P>
    <P>I do not regard the taking over of a hospital for this particular purpose as anything more than a mere beginning in the provision of this service. When I was concerned with the problem there was considerable agitation on the question as to whether one of the two existing fever hospitals in this city should be made available for rehabilitation. That was six or seven years ago.  I appreciate that probably the wisest thing would be to have a national rehabilitation centre but that, in addition, there ought to grow up in each health authority area some system for referring disabled persons to a particular centre and providing, under Section 50 of the Act, for their training and their subsequent employment in the particular health authority area.  I cannot understand how any responsible Minister charged under Act of Parliament with a particular <Col N="303" /> duty can allow these provisions just to lie there, as if they had never been passed.  A rehabilitation and training centre is urgently needed.  Those provisions were one of the finest features of the Health Act of 1953.  I think it is a great pity that today, eight years later, this urgent problem should be shrugged off as something that is apparently unworthy of Ministerial attention.</P>
    <P>I am glad the centre is now available. I am glad it will be in a hospital run by an Order with a fine nursing tradition.  But considerably more will be expected.  At the moment a voluntary body is concerned with the problem of rehabilitation and in seeking public understanding for and appreciation of the problem of disabled persons in this particular year. This is the year they have dubbed &ldquo;Rehabilitation Year&rdquo;.  The Organisation has visited different counties, talking about rehabilitation.  It is talking about a problem that many people do not know exists.</P>
    <P>Had Section 50 of the Health Act of 1953 been put into operation and administered, as it should have been, there would now be available at least an understanding of the problem and at least some limited arrangements would have been in operation to provide for the placing of disabled persons in employment.  They are not there and any work that is being done in that respect is being done by a body of enthusiastic people who are doing their best with limited means.  The Minister said that the object of the National Rehabilitation Organisation was to co-ordinate the activities of different bodies.  I agree that was the primary object and I would have hoped that. with the support and understanding of the Minister, that Organisation would now be in a position to make Section 50 of the Health Act something real and vital instead of just, as it is, so many black letters imprinted on a statute book, overlooked and forgotten.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the real position is that the Health Act of 1953 was intended as an election gimmick.  It was not really thought out except for the limited purpose of getting for those <Col N="304" /> who proposed and supported it some political advantage.  Although that Act was opposed by the Fine Gael Party, I, as a member of that Party, and as a member of the last Government, had the responsibility of being the first to try to implement it.  I think I can conscientiously say that I brought to the effort of implementing it as much enthusiasm as if the Act represented my own political view and outlook.  I have little doubt that, when I charge the Minister with his failure to provide the services that should have been provided, the services have not been provided because it was found impracticable to provide them.  The deduction is, therefore, that the policy enshrined in the Health Act of 1953 has proved after a fair trial to have been erroneous.</P>
    <P>An attempt to build on to a pauper system of medicine a health service for a modern State could never succeed. The cost of the attempt, as the Minister has had to admit, is out of all proportion to the benefits conferred. In many cases that cost has had to be borne by those who will never benefit. In only one respect in the last eight years has any real progress been made in health matters.  I refer to the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme. That scheme, which came into operation in 1957, has been a considerable success.  It is the one bright spot in our health services in recent years. Maybe it is a beacon.  Maybe it is an indication that it is along the lines of real community effort that real progress should in the future be expected.</P>
    <P>I want to pass now from the administration of the Health Act to one or two other matters.  The Minister has referred to the building of new hospitals. He has referred to the liquidity of the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  He says that because of this apparently newfound liquidity it is now possible to proceed with the building of Erinville Maternity Hospital, Cork, the new Coombe Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin.  I should like to say again, for the record, that if there had not been a change of Government in 1957 these three hospitals would now be receiving patients. They were part of the building programme that I had approved of and <Col N="305" /> given directions for completion in 1956. I decided that these and other hospitals would be built in accordance with that scheme in the belief and on the assumption that the income of the Hospitals' Trust Fund would continue to be not less than £2,000,000 per year.  I should like the Minister to say, when he is concluding the debate, whether I was wrong in that respect or not.  In fact, the Hospitals' Trust Fund income has been very much more.  If the building programme that I had approved of had not been interfered with, the St. Vincent's Hospital and the other two hospitals that the Minister mentioned would now be completed and also a variety of smaller projects throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister decided that that was the wrong approach and that he would not permit the building of any of these hospitals until there was banked up in the Hospitals' Trust Fund a sufficient sum to pay for the building of these hospitals, assuming that they could be put up just like that.  I wonder was that wise?  Four-and-a-half years have been lost.  I have little doubt that costs have gone up in the interval and that they could have been built at a cheaper cost four-and-a-half years ago. In the interval the money that has been accumulating in the Hospitals' Trust Fund has been invested, has been lent by the trustees to the State, put into our National Loans.  I wonder has that been a good thing or would it have been wiser, as the money came in, to spend it on designated projects over a definite period so that all the time the money would be used for useful purposes. I assert that these three hospitals would now be completed if the decision which I took had been observed.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter.  The Minister said at the conclusion of his speech, in relation to the subject of staffing, that a recognition of a fair reward and higher remuneration for medical staffs would be beneficial&mdash;I agree&mdash; and that it should lead to the overcoming of difficulties in the treatment of certain grades, particularly junior medical staffs and dental surgeons.  I wonder what is the position with regard to junior surgical staffs in the local <Col N="306" /> authority hospitals?  Certainly, if my information is correct, many of our county surgeons, highly qualified and first-rate men, find it extremely difficult to carry on without some reliable surgical assistance available to them. I believe that this is largely a matter of money and organisation.  I should like to feel that some progress is being made in that regard.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister could not refer to everything, but he did not refer to what the present position is in relation to nursing services.  Perhaps when the Minister is concluding the debate he will be able to tell us what progress has been made in the last 4½ years in the provision of a district nursing service. It was, I think, the correct policy, decided on some years ago, to aim at having as the right-hand of the dispensary medical officer in small districts in every county a district nurse who would be able to help in domiciliary nursing and in a variety of other field work.</P>
    <P>I should like to feel that that type of nursing service has grown in recent years and that there are more district nurses available now than there were initially.  My feeling in relation to that kind of service was that it should be patterned on the idea of the Jubilee nurse and that that type of girl should be encouraged to come into the health authority service and to provide general nursing for persons in need.  I hope the Minister may be able to tell us something about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal in detail &mdash;of course he could not&mdash;with the present situation in relation to the school medical service.  I should like to know generally how often a school medical inspection is carried out. Certainly, some years ago the interval between medical inspections was quite frighteningly long.  I should like to feel that the interval is now not as great and that more frequent school medical inspections are carried out.</P>
    <P>These are the matters I wanted to mention on this Estimate.  I think, as I have said, not in relation to the Minister personally but in relation to the administration of the Minister in the last 4½ years, the progress which <Col N="307" /> should have been made has not been made.  Problems which should have been tackled have not been tackled.  I feel that this has been due to Ministerial distraction by rows and strifes with the Medical Association and bodies of that kind, which have added up to nothing but frustration for the people.  The people have had a continuance of a health service which, even at the best of times, would not be very good, but in which the snags and difficulties are very much greater now.  It is not surprising that, as a result of all that, people are profoundly dissatisfied.  In relation to all these matters the Minister must take responsibility and it is for these reasons that I have moved that the Estimate be referred back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a most comprehensive review of the activities of his Department for the past 12 months.  Yet, like Deputy O'Higgins, I think it may be well if we get back to fundamentals and deal first with the problems that we&mdash;particularly in our own areas&mdash;find are still weak links in the chain of health services.  The first of these, I believe, is the problem of our dispensaries.  In very many instances, particularly in South Cork, these dispensaries are deplorable.  The Minister is, to a large extent, responsible for that.  I do not say he is solely responsible because, long before he became Minister for Health, the local authorities could perhaps have concentrated more on providing financial help for the replacement of these disgraceful buildings but in 1957 under the Health Act a little work was going on to replace these old buildings.  Then, the present Minister for Health said that, bad as the situation was, he would see to it that the grants for the erection of these buildings would be completely removed.  That was a big loss to the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the action of the Minister local authorities found themselves in the most unenviable position of having to provide more money for the erection of dispensaries at a time when all opinion, even among the members of his <Col N="308" /> own Party, was in favour of more co-operation and financial help for local authorities.  The Minister decided in 1957 to cut out the grants then being made available to local authorities. Even at this late stage, I ask the Minister to have this matter re-investigated and see if he is not able to advance a little more money so as to provide more financial help to local authorities for the very necessary dispensaries.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of new hospitals. New hospitals have been erected in the past few years, and in the years prior to that, but we know there is need for much more work in that respect.  The Minister undoubtedly is fortunate because according to what we hear the amount of money being made available from the Hospitals' Trust Fund and becoming available for the erection of hospitals, is increasing.  Much more should come to the hospitals as the gift it was intended originally to be.  Unfortunately, some people are having too big a slice out of it.  No wonder they have race horses.  I suppose that is not the Minister's fault.</P>
    <P>In Cork we are in the unfortunate position of wondering what the Minister will do.  Shall we ever know the result of the regional hospital versus St. Finbarr's controversy?  I shall not go into details because no doubt my colleague Deputy Barry will blossom forth about it in a way that may appeal more to the Minister than my contribution.  Yet it is time this &ldquo;joke&rdquo; were ended.  We have some money going astray before being devoted to the proper use for hospital purposes, more of it going astray in squandermania&mdash;not being spent by the Minister but spent in fees amounting to £50,000 that have been handed out in connection with the proposed new regional hospital in Cork, a hospital that probably will never be built. The money is gone and even if it is not all paid to the people concerned it will have to be paid.  After all that we have only the land and no hope of a hospital.</P>
    <P>The question arises: do we need that hospital?  We want the Minister to decide that.  I should like to anticipate <Col N="309" /> the Minister saying that some members of the various local authorities in Cork are divided in their views on this but, strangely enough, it is one thing on which Deputy Corry and I agree.  We believe there is no need for the regional hospital because in the past few years St. Finbarr's has been so improved that we now have specialist services there that we did not have eight or nine years ago when some of us believed the regional hospital was required.</P>
    <P>In view of the services we now have in St. Finbarr's, we believe it would be far more beneficial if we could utilise the space available in the County Home part of the building for the improvement of St. Finbarr's, providing more accommodation where we have such good services.  That would be a better proposition than to start building a regional hospital, which we know, would mean duplication of specialist services.</P>
    <P>Being a regional hospital we would only have a quota of beds available there.  We believe it is essential that the Minister should decide.  We take it he will be in favour of Deputy Corry's view this time and not in favour of the regional hospital but the money that is available for the project is money that is due to Cork although not yet handed over and should be made available for St. Finbarr's and other local hospitals. The money is available, we believe, and it is needed.</P>
    <P>Money is necessary for the improvements required in these old&mdash;I hate to use the word&mdash;workhouses in Kinsale and Youghal.  We are anxious to have these improved for the sole purpose&mdash;which is fundamentally important, I believe, when approaching the question of improved services in St. Finbarr's&mdash;of transferring patients from St. Finbarr's to them.  Even if the Minister's architectural advisers are against this proposal&mdash;the architect in Cork was against it&mdash;these professional gentlemen often want to build from the ground-up beautiful new buildings.  We are trying to be practical and improve the existing ones some of which are solid stone <Col N="310" /> structures.  Even if we must replace the roofs or make improvements inside, nevertheless we have foundations and solid walls to build on. If we could do that and get the permission of the Minister and financial assistance for making a start on improving these old buildings in Kinsale and Youghal it would automatically mean a transference of 300 or 400 patients from the county home part of St. Finbarr's.  That will give us the necessary space on which to build for the improvement of the general hospital at St. Finbarr's about which we are so concerned.</P>
    <P>We want the Minister to decide this.  I do not wish to be sarcastic but I suppose the life of this Parliament will not be prolonged by more than a few months.  Whatever we do afterwards, let us, before we go, have a decision in favour of St. Finbarr's as against this regional hospital.</P>
    <P>There is the old problem of the small hospital building in Cork.  I cannot understand why the Minister is so adamant in refusing to let use be made of the fever hospital in Macroom.  Members of the local authority last Friday went out and inspected that building.  It would be a great benefit if permission were given to allow 25 to 30 patients to be transferred there.  That building is lying idle and surely there must be an end to that.  The Minister spoke of the dispensary doctors and of their duties in connection with medical cards.  I agree with him that there are some good dispensary doctors and some very bad dispensary doctors.  I suppose that applies also to Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond </NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know enough about them.  As regards the dispensary doctors, some of them have the happy knack of advising an unfortunate person to go and see a specialist in a particular part of a certain city.  The person is often sent to hospital as a private patient for which he is going to pay dearly. That does not happen in all cases, to be fair to the dispensary doctor, but <Col N="311" /> we cannot stand for people being sent to a specialist who sends them to a hospital where they are given private accommodation which they cannot afford.</P>
      <P>The Minister completely ignored the problem posed day after day not by the dispensary doctors but by our county managers.  The Minister always seems to have a particular regard for these managers but it is about time he realised that very often the manager in the local authority is far more responsible for some of the problems which arise each day affecting the lives of the people who should be getting these benefits but who are not.  Deputy O'Higgins spoke quite rightly of the position of the insured persons and of those who should automatically get benefits under the Health Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry and other members of the local authority will no doubt recall decisions made by the county manager, now the health authority manager, denying people the benefit that should have been theirs in respect of the provision of dentures.  One aspect alone in which predominance was given to the view of the manager was in relation to the age of the applicant. If he were around 70 years of age and had his teeth removed, the manager might decide he was too old to benefit and that he must continue for the rest of his life without dentures. As Deputy O'Higgins said, the provision in the Health Act specifies not that we &ldquo;may&rdquo; but that we &ldquo;shall&rdquo; give these benefits.  It is about time these managers were given a direction by the Minister; the members complain often enough.  When the managers of the various counties come together and plot their campaign it is very hard for any local authority member, from whatever Party, to upset the pattern set by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as being denied this dental service, people are denied hearing aids to which they are also entitled.  There are cases in County Cork of people who should have got this benefit and to whom it was denied.  The manager <Col N="312" /> will insist that the person must be almost stone deaf, secondly, that he or she must live somewhere around Patrick's Street where the traffic is as dense as it has been in Dublin for the past few nights and, thirdly, that he or she must be the father or mother of a young family so that, in the event of the death of the person, he or she would be a loss to that family.  That nonsense should be ended.  The people should be given what they are entitled to under the Act and the Minister should be able to tell the managers where to get off in this respect.</P>
    <P>People are also entitled to spectacles under the Act but there is a long waiting list.  People are kept waiting for twelve months, two years or longer for a pair of spectacles.  No wonder people are dissatisfied with the situation. As a member of the Labour Party I would support the introduction of a Health Act that would be of benefit to these people.  In spite of the intentions of the then Minister and of those who supported the Health Act when it was passing through the House, the people are being stymied and being denied their rights by these dictatorial managers.</P>
    <P>Another extraordinary case has arisen in Cork.  I do not know if it applies in other counties.  If a person is receiving a blind welfare allowance at the age of 60, 68 or 69 and then gets an old age pension at the age of 70, the blind welfare allowance continues. However, if an old age pensioner becomes blind at the age of 70 or over after receiving the old age pension, he will get no welfare allowance from the manager.  That is the most unchristian behaviour anyone could expect in connection with the health service.  The Minister should have this matter investigated.  What I am telling the Minister is not just hearsay. Members of his own Party from Cork city and county can bear me out.  It is about time those who supported the introduction of the Health Act and those who, by their votes, decided that the Health Act would be put into operation ensured that it will not be left to a few dictators to decide what should be given and what should not be given under that important Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> Of course, we have the problem of medical cards.  I have to admit the position is even worse now than it was with the damn red ticket.  The home assistance officer reports on the means of the applicant and it ends up with the manager.  People we believe should get medical cards are denied them, but it is extraordinary to see some of the people who get them. The present manager in Cork showed the line he was taking.  To qualify for a medical card, the family income should not be more than £6 per week.  If it exceeds that figure, the manager says such an applicant may be deprived of a medical card.  Taking into account the difference in money values, it means that a person who had a wage of about £3 per week prior to 1952 should not get a ticket for the dispensary, and that a person who had a wage of £2 5s. or £2 6s. prior to 1939 should not get a ticket for the dispensary, but we know that such people were entitled to that service at that time.  But now if such people have a shilling or two over £6 a week, they are denied that service. In the case of a man with a wife and one child, £6 10s. is the maximum ; and if there are two children, the second child is worth only 5s. 0d.  In my opinion, the manager should be far more liberal in his approach to this matter.  If we have a Health Act at all, let it be a good one.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins mentioned some schemes.  It might be possible to have these in a few years, but I am concerned, not with the future, but with the present.  When we are dealing with our estimates in the county council in February or March each year, the manager is quick to get money for this, that and the other thing, but he is just as quick to act contrary to the view of the members and refuse to give medical cards to people we believe to be entitled to them.  The Minister should have a conference&mdash;not a conference for cutting down such as we have had in the past&mdash;to see that these people will get medical cards.  He should tell the managers to realise that present money values should not be related <Col N="314" /> to the value of money at a time when medical cards were given on a different basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister drew attention to the establishment of the Commission on Mental Health.  I am glad such an approach is being made, but there is one weakness in it.  Examine the activities of each Government Department, find out the number of commissions established, the length of time they took to report and how little notice the Minister or the Government ever took of their reports.  I am afraid that by the time we get the report of this new commission and it is acted upon, there will have to be a very big change in the country.  If we are to judge by what has happened in the past, conditions in our mental hospitals and the treatment of our patients will be in the same deplorable state for a long number of years.</P>
    <P>We have the present extraordinary position whereby the staffs in mental hospitals very often have to live in overcrowded conditions.  They are very often in the position&mdash;I am speaking particularly of Cork&mdash;of being denied overtime or proper time off.  They are not provided with the necessary facilities for people working in mental hospitals.  They have very onerous jobs and they should get much better treatment, more opportunities for advancement in their profession and better wages and conditions than they have at present.  I ask the Minister, while waiting for the report of the commission, to consult with the unions concerned and get the full facts of the conditions in which some of the staffs have to live in their off-duty hours.  We should start by making these improvements and not wait for the report of the commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins spoke about the schools medical service.  I should like to inquire about the length of time elapsing between each examination.  I know that up to a few years ago in Cork it was not uncommon for a medical officer to call to a school and not be seen there again for another three years.  Of course, it was not his fault; it was due to shortage of staff.  Though I believe the position is better now, it <Col N="315" /> still could be considerably improved upon.  In my opinion, the weakness is that, even if we had sufficient staff, the Act lays down that a child must be medically examined only three times during his school going period.  That is not sufficient.  I have known of some extraordinary cases myself.  I know of a child who was examined by the medical officer in the local school and found to be all right, but in the period before the next examination the child became ill.  The parents had not a medical card and could not obtain benefit.  Because they could not prevent the child from getting sick before the next examination in the school, they lost all the benefits of the schools medical service as well.  It is essential that there should be provision to protect the health of the child right through the school years, from six to 14, particularly in the case of parents who do not hold medical cards.  I think it is important that such provision should be made.</P>
    <P>I mentioned specialists.  I want to refer now to their counterparts, the dispensary doctors.  I have always been of the opinion that a better dispensary service would be the ideal. Away back in 1951 some of us pleaded with the then Minister for Health, and eventually secured from him the right to employ a general-trained nurse in dispensary areas.  The nurse has proved invaluable and I believe that a general-trained nurse should be available in every dispensary. That would help to relieve the problem of overcrowding in the dispensaries attached to hospitals.  Some dispensary doctors are better than any specialist.  Many people will not go one foot beyond them because they realise they can depend on the local man.  They know his abilities.  If we avail of their services along properly co-ordinated lines we can, I believe, build up an excellent local service.</P>
    <P>It is an odd commentary on the development of medical science that, as the years go on, there are more and more specialists and more and more medical problems for which specialists are needed.  An even odder commentary is the fact that that <Col N="316" /> evolution is not helping the community as a whole or improving the health of the people generally.  I admit we need our specialists.  Far be it from me to take from them in any way, but very often the local man is better than the best of them.  If we co-ordinate the dispensary service, supply properly trained nurses, and improve facilities generally, we will, I believe, improve the health of the people.</P>
    <P>Hospital charges were increased some few years ago from 6/- to 10/- per day.  If we could keep the people out of the hospitals by giving them better services in their own areas we would be doing a good day's work. We might, indeed, be able to prove that the Health Act of 1953, with all its weaknesses, is some contribution towards improving the lot of people faced with illness and the heavy financial burdens illness can involve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry </NameTxt>
      <P>I heard Deputy O'Higgins tonight speak of Saint Vincent's Hospital and how he was prepared to allocate some £2,000,000 from the Hospitals Trust Fund to that hospital in 1956, and I began to wonder.  I should like to see the records of the Cabinet meeting of the inter-Party Government in 1956 at which it was announced that there was £2,000,000 anywhere, and to see the fighting there was for it.  Two million pounds rings a kind of bell in my ears.  We are back in 1949.  As Chairman of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance I received an urgent message from the Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Browne, to proceed immediately, with my Vice-Chairman and the county manager, to meet him in his office in the Custom House to deal with a matter of the utmost urgency, namely, the building of a new regional hospital in Cork.  I remember coming up here with the late Pa McGrath, God rest his soul, the Lord Mayor of Cork and my Vice-Chairman, and the county manager at the time.  We met the Minister and his advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were informed at the meeting that this hospital was urgently required. We told the Minister we had no money.  We left with a guarantee <Col N="317" /> of £2,000,000&mdash;the very sum that Deputy O'Higgins mentioned here tonight&mdash;and the advice to proceed at once with the hospital.  I had to call a special meeting of the Board of Assistance.  We had the architect there and all the assistance we could get in order to prepare plans and specifications and send them up to the Custom House.  Those plans and specifications are still hanging around and the old carrot is still being dangled by the Department of Health. Whenever we go forward for a grant for Saint Finbarr's Hospital, or anything else, the carrot is dangled: &ldquo;But you are getting a regional hospital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, all that was long before Saint Vincent's Hospital was thought of. I wonder what caused the change ? Why was it decided to spend the £2,000,000 earmarked for Cork in 1949 for this regional hospital on Saint Vincent's Hospital in Dublin in 1956?  That is one of the things on which I should like to be informed. As Deputy Desmond said it is about time this carrot was buried.  The people of this country have paid out of public funds £60,000 odd for paper plans for the Cork regional hospital. I do not know if we are a special benevolent society for architects or that public funds are there to be distributed to the professions in this manner, but this carrot has been kept in the Department and every time it is dragged out into the light of day, there are a few thousands more for the architect for a new plan.</P>
    <P>It is time it were ended.  Nobody wants it.  In Cork there is a new sanatorium in Sarsfield Court and there are over 100 beds idle in that hospital at the present time.  When we were moving patients from various hospitals to Sarsfield Court we were told that we would have to reserve beds there for patients from other counties. I think it was 50 beds for County Clare. Now we are left with all the beds empty.  Are the various authorities to whom these beds were allocated paying for their proportion of the beds or is the Cork ratepayer paying for all? That is a matter to which the Minister should turn his attention because our <Col N="318" /> rates are high enough.  With the spectacle before us of over a hundred idle beds there, is it not time that some sanity should enter the Department of Health so that we could get rid of this bugbear of a regional hospital?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister, the next time he is in Cork, take a look at the monument erected by the Department of Health over a number of years, a look at the heaps of muck piled up there, where weeds are growing on 32 acres, and consider that £60,000 of public money is buried there, and then ask himself what kind of Department of Health we have?  When sensible suggestions are submitted to the Department of Health, such as Deputy Desmond alluded to here to-day, they are ignored.  There are many disused buildings in Cork County which we are anxious to convert into homes for the aged and infirm who are at present in St. Finbarr's.  I can boast that after a hard fight I succeeded in having kept in my constituency the only county home apart from St. Finbarr's left in Cork.  I held it there in spite of all Governments and all Parties.  The people are happy in it.  It is far cheaper to keep them there than in St. Finbarr's.  We have expended a pretty considerable amount of money on St. Finbarr's Hospital over the years. It is a first-class hospital in every respect to-day, with only one fault, and that is the question of accommodation for patients.  If we could transfer the 300 aged and infirm people who are there to Kinsale and Youghal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGalvin" hpid="Mr. Galvin Mr. Galvin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Galvin </NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry </NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we would be in a position to provide accommodation in St. Finbarr's for our patients.  Unfortunately, the Department of Health evidently wants another job for an architect.  We were preparing a wing there for some 20 orthopaedic patients before the orthopaedic hospital was started.  We got our own engineer to prepare plans and specifications for work costing £8,000.  We got an order from the Department of Health to employ an architect, who, of course, is paid fees, based on every £1,000 of the cost.  The more thousands he puts into the job, the bigger the fee.  The <Col N="319" /> cost of the plan and specifications prepared by him was £19,000.  I can challenge the Minister to deny that we came to the Department of Health and told him we had plans and specifications for the preparation of this wing at a cost of £8,000 and that we had no more money and, rather than turn down the architect, we got the £11,000 from the Department.  They were prepared to pay for the architect.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Desmond has said, there will be changes here.  This is the last year of this Dáil.  A new Dáil will assemble here in the coming year and I will be missing a lot of the nice faces I see around me to-day when I come back.  I should like this job to be finished.  Neither the Minister nor the Department need hope that they will get rid of me.  They will not.  I am anxious that the job will be finished, that we can get rid of the regional hospital magpie.  Let us get down to bedrock.  Let them send the £2,000,000 to Cork together with the interest due on it since 1949, since the Minister guaranteed it to us, and let us provide decent homes for the people with the money.</P>
      <P>I was amazed to hear Deputy O'Higgins here to-night.  I know the Health Act has caused a great deal of trouble.  I have witnessed various scenes here over the Health Act that many of us would prefer had never happened in this House.  I have seen a poor Minister who brought in this Health Act, poor Deputy Dr. Browne, being harassed by two or three legal luminaries before he ran out and left Act and Ministry and all.  Deputy O'Higgins told us about the Act brought in in 1953 and he demanded to know why it was not operated for eight years.  He said there were no dental services provided and wanted to know why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a faint recollection of being on those benches over there for a period and there was a certain Deputy Thomas F. O'Higgins a Minister for Health in 1954, 1955, 1956 and on until 1957.  What was he doing at that time about the dental services which he said were not operated for eight years?  The Act came in in <Col N="320" /> 1953.  What was he doing from 1953 to 1957 about the dental services if they were not in operation and if, according to him, they are not yet in operation ?  That was the most amazing indictment that I have ever heard by a man of himself.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins went on then to deal with the provision of spectacles. The same thing happened here and the same thing happened to disabled persons.  All of these were covered in the 1953 Health Act which was not operated by the present Minister who came into office in 1957.  There was a gap of three or four years during which Deputy O'Higgins was here as Minister for Health and did not do any of these things himself.  That is what I am wondering about.  The official report of Deputy O'Higgins speech would be well worth reading in that respect.</P>
    <P>I do not know where Deputy O'Higgins got his information. According to my information, some 700 sets of dentures are provided each year in South Cork Board of Assistance area and if the Minister has neglected his duties and no dentures are being provided, who is getting all these 700 sets of dentures?  That is something I should like to know.  I know we are also providing spectacles in the South Cork area.  As Deputy Desmond said, we may not be providing all the dentures needed and we might have a long list waiting for spectacles but we are providing them. In some way or other Deputy O'Higgins was up in the air.  Does he think that the same bad game that he evidently practised, according to himself, is being carried out by the present Minister, that there are no dentures, no spectacles, no this or that as was the case when he was Minister ?</P>
    <P>I admit, like Deputy Desmond, that certain managerial forces, I suppose, are working to deprive the aged people of the dentures to which they are entitled.  It is about time that the manager got special instructions but we can move for the suspension of the manager and let the Minister deal with him.  There is provision for dealing with the manager in that way and I <Col N="321" /> should like all managers to remember that.  The elected representatives of the people have a way of dealing with them if they go too far.  Had it not been that one gentleman went away in time I think I would have done it.</P>
    <P>Regarding medical cards, I say frankly that a considerable section of people who, before this Health Act was ever heard of, would be treated in the ordinary way and without question by the dispensary doctors are now questioned.  I refer to the agricultural worker.  Deputy Desmond gave the scale but I have seen an unfortunate man who as an agricultural labourer on a very poor wage reared seven children.  During that time there was no Health Act and he was entitled to health services for himself and his family from the dispensary doctor in the area without question.  If there was any question, he got a ticket from me and got the services.  At present he is not entitled to services.</P>
    <P>They now say his wage is over £6 or at least the accumulated wages of himself and his family are over £6, and therefore he can get nothing.  You will hear this kind of statement : &ldquo;This man has a daughter working in Glanmire getting £2 a week.&rdquo;  That, added to the £5 odd that the man earns, brings up his wages.  You will also hear it said : &ldquo;He has a son working who was thinning turnips last week and got 35s.&rdquo;  That is added in.  All those things are added together to deprive the man of his right to get a card.</P>
    <P>We all know that in the case of young people at the present time, if they are earning, their families get very little, if any, money at home.  The fathers and mothers cannot make them give it.  There is no use in pretending they can.  I have seen some cases of this where, since the doctors got wise, or since those new medicines came out, there is a bill of 35s. a week for pills and there are not very many pills in the box you get for 35s.  I think this is all grossly unjust and, as Deputy Desmond said, I do not think the members who voted for that Act voted for the manner in which it is at present being administered.</P>
    <P>What is the position in regard to the <Col N="322" /> distribution of the Government grant in respect of free boots for Cork county?  What is the position as regards its administration ?</P>

      <P>I make a last appeal to the Minister to let us have some decision on the regional hospital in Cork County.  I was surprised to hear Deputy O'Higgins asking about the £2,000,000 he was going to give to St. Vincent's Hospital. The last decision we had from the Minister was that there was no money available for seven years for the regional hospital and that the £2,000,000 that was guaranteed by Deputy Dr. Browne when he was Minister for Health in 1949 was not there at all.  We want to know some time where we are.  When the South Cork Board of Public Assistance representatives send up to the Department for grants to which they are justly entitled, let us have this carrot of the £2,000,000 for the regional hospital no longer dangled under our noses and given as an excuse for giving us nothing.</P>
      <P>As a matter of curiosity I would like the Minister to bring his team of officials down to Cork.  I will guarantee him decent treatment and a hearty welcome from the Cork representatives. Let them go out to Wilton and look at the graveyard of the £60,000 they have buried at the regional hospital there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin </NameTxt>
      <P>May I say I have seen some very good work done under the Health Act?  I have seen children who would probably be invalids for the remainder of their lives, were it not for that Act, being sent to hospital where the best medical services were made available to them and being returned home fit boys and girls able to take their place in school and in the community for the remainder of their lives. That is a tremendous benefit conferred by the Health Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> However, we as public representatives do find ourselves sadly disappointed in regard to the operation of the Health Act.  As councillors and Deputies we are expected to be able to put through various claims made by parents and when we approach the authority concerned we are told those people are not eligible. No later than last Monday I was approached by a married couple who were living with one of their parents in a house whose valuation was £12 or £14.  They had a family of six and had sent their little girl to hospital in Dublin at their own expense.  I should like to ask the Minister if that child is entitled to treatment in hospital free of charge under the Health Act, because the child is only 12 years of age.</P>
    <P>The problem of dispensaries is one that should be carefully considered. A circular was sent out to the local authorities some time ago asking that, where at all possible, dispensaries be closed and the services of the doctor in the area be terminated.  That would have happened in my county if it had not been for the protest made by the people who asked that the dispensary be kept open.  A dispensary is very important to a great number of people.  A large section of our people depend on the dispensary doctor and the dispensary itself and if this service is taken from them it would be a terrible loss to these people.</P>
    <P>Approaches are often made to us in respect of the provision of dentures and spectacles and also in relation to the blind pension.  The blind pension is one of the hardest things for an applicant to obtain.  Many people are unable to qualify for a blind pension, although they may have no employment and are able to do very little because their eyesight is seriously impaired.  They have to go through a gruelling test.</P>

Another matter to which I want to refer is the question of water supplies and hygiene regulations.  I seem to be out of order again.  In referring to mentally-retarded children I hope I am not out of order.</P>

      <P>The problem of mentally-retarded children is a serious one in my constituency.  Public representatives and clergy are constantly approached to have children placed in some of these homes where treatment is afforded to them but the only answer they get is that there is a long waiting list.  The other day the first sod was cut prior to the building of a hospital in my constituency and I was told that it would be 1964 before the hospital would be completed. I would ask the Minister to do his utmost to provide accommodation and treatment for mentally-retarded children. It is a very serious matter that many of these children must be kept at home with the other members of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell </NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke for quite a long time, about an hour and twenty minutes, and during that period he gave some quite interesting statistics.  I was disappointed with one aspect of the Minister's speech&mdash;the almost cursory reference he made to cancer.  Beyond stating that 4,700 people died of cancer last year the Minister ignored this second highest killer almost completely and, if I recall correctly, the same thing happened in regard to his speech last year.  I would have thought that, as the question of the treatment and diagnosis of cancer comes within the ambit of his Department through the Cancer Association of Ireland, the Minister would have availed of the opportunity today to tell us something of what is being done by the Cancer Association in particular and what efforts are being made to find an answer to this dread disease.  I quite appreciate, and I know from my own past association with the Cancer <Col N="325" /> Association in St. Luke's Hospital, that the treatment of cancer, and particularly the effort to find some way of stopping cancer, is something that takes a lot of money.</P>
      <P>Cancer research runs into millions of pounds and it takes very wealthy countries such as the United States and Great Britain to amass the necessary personnel to undertake research to any degree.  But small countries such as our own have made valuable contributions towards finding a solution of the cancer problem.  Some three or four years ago an effort was made by the Cancer Association to undertake cancer research based on statistics collected from doctors in hospitals throughout the country. These statistics related to the type of cancer from which the patient died, the place they lived, the environment, type of employment and other details which, collected together and properly analysed, would, it was felt at the time, have given valuable information to those seeking a solution of the cancer problem.  I do not know what happened that development.  I no longer have any associations with St. Luke's Hospital.  Certainly, when this research was established there were high hopes it would prove, if a small, certainly a valuable contribution to the general problem of cancer research. I hope the Minister when replying will be able to give the House some information as to what has happened in regard to that matter.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister mention in his speech that at long last the cobalt unit is to be installed at St. Luke's Hospital, where it will be available not only for patients attending that hospital but also for those attending the other Dublin cancer hospitals.  Those of us who several years ago expressed the hope that one day this country might have a cobalt unit will be glad of this news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make some comments on the question of dispensary services which the Minister dealt with at some length in his speech and which were adverted to by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.  I must say I agree with Deputy O'Higgins's wish that the dispensary patient would have a choice <Col N="326" /> of doctor.  I agree with the Minister that this may be difficult in practice but I am not convinced it is insoluble. I think, given the necessary goodwill, it should not be beyond the resources of the Minister's Department to devise a system whereby a man, a woman or a child should be able, within reason, to seek the doctor of his or her choice. It is wrong in principle that this choice of doctor should be confined only to those who can afford to pay.  I am sure the people who devised the 1953 Act had it in mind that at some future date choice of doctor would be an integral part of the system.</P>
    <P>It is time we thought about getting away from the whole idea of a dispensary service as such.  The very name &ldquo;dispensary&rdquo; is associated with a past period of our history which we would rather forget about than remember.  In talking about the dispensary service we should associate it more closely with the giving of social welfare benefits rather than with health services.  I should like to see the health services developed through health clinics that would not be associated with the giving out of public assistance funds.  I feel they are two distinct services and should not be combined together in the same building or even sections of the same building.  The dispensary buildings we have throughout the country &mdash;many of them old and all of them uncomfortable&mdash;in the winter time when these unfortunate people have to queue up and wait either for the dispensary doctor or a pittance in the shape of public assistance, do little credit to this year of 1961.</P>
    <P>The ideal would probably be to have properly staffed clinics with specialists available.  Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Desmond, I think, referred to the fact that there seems to be a growing tendency now to pack people off to specialists, even for the most minor complaints.  If the specialists were available close to the patient's family doctor, it would be a far better system than packing them off to already overcrowded hospitals.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies made references to the dental services.  I know it is the desire of the Minister, as it was of his predecessors, that the emphasis in dental <Col N="327" /> services should be placed on preservation and conservation of teeth.  I am in wholehearted agreement with that point of view.  If the dental services are carried on as in present circumstances, that desire of the Minister, particularly in regard to dental services for children, will never be carried to fruition. It is quite impossible with the present number of dentists&mdash;certainly in my own constituency and particularly in Limerick city&mdash;to hope to give an adequate service to the number of children, particularly school children, who should attend and have their teeth seen to at an early age.  I hope the Minister will look more closely into this side of the problem than he apparently has done in the past.</P>
    <P>I think it is completely wrong&mdash;I do not know what the statutory obligation is&mdash;that a person who cannot afford a set of dentures has to wait perhaps a year or two years before getting them. Any public representative knows of many cases where a person's teeth have been extracted and they have to wait two years before they could get dentures. The excuse given is that there are not sufficient dentists to look after the children's needs and also the needs of adults who cannot afford to pay for dental services themselves.</P>
    <P>I was also glad to hear the Minister say that at long last he has sanctioned an extension to St. Vincent's Home for child mental defectives at Lisnagry, Limerick.  This is a long outstanding need.  Despite a very severe shortage of beds, the work carried out there by the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul is remarkable.  I am personally aware that although the bed accommodation is less than 40, they have never had less than 150 children seeking admission to the institution.</P>
    <P>It may be too soon for the Minister to say something about the operation of the joint health authorities but, if he has any information at his disposal, I think the House would welcome some information as to the success of the joint health authorities, particularly in regard to the services given and the economies which the Minister visualised <Col N="328" /> when he was introducing the Bill a year or so ago.  I think I am correct in saying the Minister made no reference in his speech to the working of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  That is a scheme for which I have a great regard.</P>

      <P>I think I am correct in saying that in past years the Minister has made reference to the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  However, it does not matter.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme is a scheme that seems to be succeeding. I am sure the Minister wishes it every success.  I do not know how far we could go along the road of providing limited health services confined to certain income groups.  Every public representative has had experience of complaints about the issuance of medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon </NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell </NameTxt>
      <P>There do appear to be inexplicable differences in the issuance of these cards to different families.  It is often hard to understand why one family cannot get a medical card while another family, with comparable income, enjoys this facility.  It is, I know, too much in present circumstances to expect the country to consider a completely comprehensive national health scheme.  I have a feeling that, once you step on the road of giving services to those who need them free of cost, inevitably you must face up to bringing in at some time or another a comprehensive scheme covering practically all classes.  I know that would be a very expensive scheme and probably one we could not afford but, until we have some all-embracing scheme, public representatives are bound to get constant complaints from people who feel they are not getting that to which they think they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, I should like to make reference to a section of our health services to which no reference so far <Col N="329" /> has been made here to-night.  We have heard references to the doctors, and to the Minister <i>vis-à-vis</i> the doctors, but there has been no reference at all to the nursing profession. I should like to say a word on their behalf.  Recently misgivings have been expressed with regard to the reward which nurses get for their work.  We have all at one time or another come in contact with the work of this body. If ever work was a vocation that of nurses certainly is.  I should like to join with others outside this House who have appealed to the Minister to consider better remuneration and conditions for the nursing profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fantastic situation&mdash;I think even the Minister will agree with me in this&mdash;that the Minister for Health in this country should not be talking to the only body that represents the entire medical profession in Ireland.  The Minister says it is their fault and they say it is his fault, but can we conceive any other man in the public life of this country spending four years as Minister for Health in a situation in which he cannot exchange common courtesies with the representatives of the medical profession?  I cannot help feeling that, if the Minister ever searches his own conscience, he must feel that in some measure he is falling down on the job.  Surely the Minister for Health cannot be doing his job as it ought to be done if he has cut himself completely off from the practising medical profession of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a quarrel somebody must always take the initiative to put an end to it.  If the Minister's thesis is true that the Irish Medical Association is altogether unreasonable, does that not throw all the greater burden upon him to demonstrate to the country at large that he is prepared to go, not only half way, but even further, in order to establish normal relations with that body?  If he had done that, I think that demonstrably the force of public opinion would operate very quickly to make anyone who sought to continue to act unreasonably to desist. But the reason that no such public <Col N="330" /> opinion has manifested itself is that the bulk of our people do not believe that the fault is all on the side of the medical profession.  They believe that a great deal of the fault is due to the notorious vanity of the Minister.  Now that would not be a reasonable allegation to make against the Minister if one were not prepared to produce some visible proof of it.  When the Minister proceeds to employ anonymous stooges to write anonymous letters to the paper saying they think he is perfectly right, signed <i>&ldquo;Pro bono publico&rdquo;</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know that the pseudonym <i>&ldquo;Pro bono publico&rdquo;</i> was ever employed, but when you find a man in the position of the Minister hiring stooges to communicate to the Press proclaiming him to be a valiant man, but yet carefully eschewing the responsibility of defending their proposition as a logical argument, that seems to me to breed the air of vanity and effrontery.</P>

      <P>If he is unwilling to resolve it, surely that would suggest he is allowing his vanity to override his responsibility.

Maybe there are some things that we will not agree about but let us find the things we can agree about and get on with them.&rdquo;  One thing is certain&mdash;could I get agreement on this proposition?&mdash; we cannot contemplate an eternity in which the Irish Minister for Health will not speak to the Irish medical profession.</P>

      <P>This is the cheerful language of the benevolent autocrat but, of course, in this troubled democratic world in which we live, autocrats, however benevolent, are not acceptable.  It has become the recognised right of a free society with professions and trade unions, that men shall have the right freely to organise and to choose their own spokesmen. I have often had to negotiate with trade union leaders, both in my public capacity and in my private capacity, whom I did not like but we were able to say to each other quite specifically: &ldquo;We are under no illusion.  You do not like me and I do not like you but I happen to be Minister for Agriculture and you happen to be the person chosen to speak for the employees in this particular branch of the Department. Let us forget our mutual dislike and see how far we can go to resolve the issues joined between us.&rdquo; It is possible to do it.  There is no need to love everybody with whom you have to transact business.  If that were the case, very little business would ever be done.  Is it unfair to say that it is also an indication of vanity if a man is prepared to negotiate with nobody who does not first protest that he loves him?</P>

I do not think the public will long stand for a Minister who says: &ldquo;That is their problem.  They have got into the difficulty and let them get out of it.  I wash my hands of it.&rdquo;  That is not, if I may say so, with respect, what the Minister is paid for.  The Minister is a paid servant of the public and that is a proud title.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter into which I propose to go in the remaining quarter of an hour.  I think they could be carried on very much more satisfactorily if there were reasonable relations between the organised medical profession and the Minister for Health.  I do not think the Minister should lay it down as a condition precedent to such relations that the doctors should choose people whom the Minister likes to represent them in any discussion that may be requisite.  That is an unreasonable condition.  No rational body of men, whether they be labouring men or professional men, will ever accept it. When that is a condition precedent, there never can be the proper relationship between the Minister and the medical profession that ought to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to a matter about which I feel deeply: The Minister is now embarking on a distribution of Hospitals Trust Funds for the erection of St. Vincent's Hospital and certain other hospitals.  I want to say most categorically that I am convinced that the policy of the Minister for Health in holding up the building operations of those hospitals was dictated by a pure desire to play politics and I believe it has had two results: (1) it has denied to a great many of our people services which they had a right to enjoy; and (2) it has driven thousands of workers, skilled and unskilled, into emigration <Col N="335" /> during the past four years.  I think the Minister will agree that, in 1957, there was a high incidence of unemployment in the building trade. Are we not all agreed on that?  We remember the Fianna Fáil Party making ghoulish propaganda.  Is that not so?  They were rushing around the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that there was higher unemployment in the building industry.  Was that not the truth?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Loughman asks: &ldquo;Was it not the truth?&rdquo;  I agree.  The truth was there was high unemployment in the building industry. It is very typical of Fianna Fáil that the Deputy does not know what the truth was but, whatever it was, he was telling it.  That is an exact definition of Fianna Fáil truth.  He did not know what the truth was but, whatever it was, they were telling it. That is the Deputy's degraded propaganda, his ghoulish glee, at the unemployment then existing in the building trade.</P>
      <P>At that time, plans were sanctioned for St. Vincent's Hospital, the Coombe Hospital, Erinville and other hospitals that would have involved a very considerable volume of employment in the building trade, skilled and unskilled.  You would have tided over a number of skilled workers until other buildings of a mercantile kind revived and you would have kept them in Ireland with their families.  I say that the Minister for Health, purely for political reasons, operated the same confidence trick that Deputy Noel Lemass operated in Dublin Corporation. Was it Deputy Noel Lemass or Deputy Briscoe?</P>

I now allege that he had in his office on the day that he entered it plans to build four substantial hospitals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

His reply was: &ldquo;Not one penny until the money is put on the desk.&rdquo;  This Minister for Health replied that not a penny would he authorised to be hypothecated for the building of these hospitals unless and until the money was in the till.  It is quite true to say that the Minister could say: &ldquo;Maybe the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes will blow up in the morning and that everything will go bang.&rdquo;  If that philosophy underlies Government finance, we should close the country down and announce that we rest confidently on the bosom of the British Treasury who will see us through the trials that will come.  That was not our policy.  Our policy was to say that we had the means to do what was necessary for our people's welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the Estimate. It was the Estimate to drive the workers out of the country to the point where the Minister is now in the embarrassing position that he finds it hard to get the skilled workers necessary to allow building to proceed at all.  That is due to the fact that he wanted to make his little contribution to fool Deputy Loughman and poor Deputy Geoghegan into believing that Ireland, of all the countries in the world, could not afford to build a hospital wall because she did not know where the money would come from.</P>
      <P>It is not the first time that Fianna Fáil has gravely injured this country by doubting its survival and there is no greater injury that you can do a country than to raise, as a political campaign, the scare that your own country cannot survive.  This country survived long before the name of Fianna Fáil was ever heard and it will be here long after they are forgotten.</P>

      <P>I welcome that signal of assent from the battered ranks who uttered it but they cannot deny that, if the Minister had made available from the Sweepstakes Fund the money to build these hospitals, thousands of young men who are to-day building in England could, and would be building in Ireland and hundreds of patients who are doing with second-class accommodation could, and would be having the best in their own country.  I do not think that is anything to be proud of and I think the Minister might well hang his head in shame.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy, in so far as it is available, is shown in the following table.  It is not possible to exclude pensions from the total of wages, salaries and pensions.  It should be observed in relating the total wages, salaries and pensions to the premium income in respect of employers' liability business and to the employers' contributions to the Social Insurance Fund, that not all concerns pay employers' liability insurance and that certain salaries and other earnings of employees are not subject to social insurance contributions.</P>
