      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go ndeonfar suim nach mó ná £375,980 chun slánaithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Mhárta, 1962, le haghaidh Tuarastail agus Costais Roinn na Gaeltachta, maille le Deontais le haghaidh Tithe agus Ildeontais-i-gCabhair.</P>
      <P>Taispeánann an Meastachán don bhliain seo méadú de £41,240 glan ar an soláthar a rinneadh don bhliain seo caite.  Sé an chúis is mó atá leis an ardú sin ná méadú de £31,300 a bheith sa soláthar le haghaidh Tithe Gaeltachta agus méadú de £16,400 a bheith sa soláthar le haghaidh Scoláireachtaí Saoire agus Scoile sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá méadú de £5,000 sa soláthar le haghaidh Coláistí Gaeilge agus tá méadú de £9,525 sa soláthar do Thuarastail agus Costais na Foirne.  Ina gcoinne sin, áfach, tá laghdú de £20,000 sa soláthar do Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> Éiríonn an breis-soláthar do Thuarastail agus Chostais Taistil toisc a bheith riachtanach don Roinn foireann sa bhreis a fhostú chun déileáil leis an méadú in obair na dTithe a tháinig de thoradh an Achta nua a ritheadh sa bhliain 1959.  Fairis sin do b'éigean don Roinn post tar-uimhreach do Phríomh-Oifigeach a chur lena teachlachas mar tá Príomh-Oifigeach tugtha ar iasacht do Ghaeltarra Éireann. Ina chás siúd, áfach, aisghnófar ó Ghaeltarra Éireann an tuarastal a híocfar leis an bPríomh-Oifigeach sin ón Vóta seo agus glacfar an t-airgead a haisghnófar amhlaidh chun creidis mar Leithreasa-i-gCabhair don Vóta &mdash; Fo-mhírcheann N 3.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-Mhírcheann C déantar soláthar le haghaidh deontas faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht).  Sa bhliain airgeadais 1960/61 críochnaíodh 167 dtithe nua, feabhsaíodh 300 tithe, cuireadh soláthar uisce i 149 dtithe, cuireadh saoráidí séarachais i 145 tithe, cuireadh seomraí folcaidh feistithe le huisce te i 113 tithe, feabhasaíodh an córas sláintíochta i 4 tithe, agus rinneadh méadú speisialta ar 19 dtithe. Fritheadh ós cíonn 2,100 iarratais nua i rith na bliana, is é sin 500 níos mó ná sa bhliain roimhe, agus tháinig méadú mór ar an líon cásanna inar tosnaíodh ar an obair.  Ceadaíodh deontais de luach tuairim is £217,000 i thart ar 1,700 cásanna i gcomparáid le deontais de £126,000 in 800 cásanna sa bhliain airgeadais roimhe sin.  Cuireadh tús le Scéim na Seallaí Saoire agus Scéim na mBrúnna agus táthar ag súil go rachaidh na Scéimeanna sin chun cinn go maith sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Tháinig méadú arís ar an gcaiteachas faoi na hAchtanna ó £84,864 i 1959/60 go £136,000 i 1960/61.  Is léir ó na figiúirí atá tugtha agam cheana go mbeidh méadú arís ar an obair sa bhliain airgeadais seo agus meastar gur gá £181,000 a sholáthar chuige i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Is cúis sásaimh dom an dul ar aghaidh atá á dhéanamh sa ghné seo d'obair na Roinne agus an feabhas atá ag teacht dá bharr ar chúrsaí sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Is as Fo-mhírcheann D a cuirfear an t-airgead ar fáil i mbliana le haghaidh Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht. Rinneadh soláthar de £150,000 <Col N="1168" /> do na scéimeanna sin anuraidh ach níorbh fhéidir ach timpeall dhá dtrian den soláthar sin a chaitheamh mar níorbh fhéidir scéimeanna áirithe a thabhairt chun críche chomh luath agus a bhí beartaithe.  Meastar anois gur leor £130,000 in aghaidh na bliana le haghaidh na Scéimeanna sin.  Tá súil agam gur ag dul i bhfeabhas a bheidh an taobh sin den scéal feasta.</P>
    <P>D'ainneoin an laghduithe sa soláthar, áfach, ba mhaith liom a rá go mbeidh mé toilteanach gach scéim rathúil a molfar don Ghaeltacht a mheas go báúil agus nach gcuirfear aon mholadh fiúntach i leataoibh cheal airgid.</P>
    <P>Tá na Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sonraithe i gcuid a III den Mheastachán. Chífear go bhfuil an soláthar céanna á dhéanamh i mbliana le haghaidh na mbóthar agus a rinneadh anuraidh.  Is do bhóithre áise is mó atá an soláthar seo agus sa bhliain seo caite, d'íoc an Roinn £31,000 as bóithre áise agus timpeall £5,000 as bóithre contae.  Tá an-éileamh i gcónaí ar na hoibreacha sin.</P>
    <P>Tá ísliú de £5,000 sa soláthar a moltar i mbliana le haghaidh uisce-sholáthair nó séarachais.  Níor caitheadh ar na scéimeanna sin anuraidh, áfach, ach timpeall £10,000 &mdash; sé sin timpeall £9,400 ar scéimeanna móra réigiúnacha agus timpeall £600 ar mhion-scéimeanna.  Ní mór glacadh leis go mbíonn moill ag gabháil le hullmhú scéimeanna fairsinge i gcúrsaí uisce-sholáthair agus nach féidir bheith ag súil leis go mbeidh cásanna aibidh i mbliana le haghaidh níos mó ná an £20,000 d'íoc astu.  Is eol dom, ámh, go bhfuil go leór réamhoibre á dhéanamh fé láthair i ndáil le húllmhú scéimeanna nua a bhéas ag teacht isteach i ndiaidh a chéile amach anseo.</P>
    <P>Le haghaidh na muir-oibreacha moltar an soláthar céanna i mbliana agus a rinneadh anuraidh.  Caitheadh timpeall £12,500 ar na hoibreacha sin an bhliain seo caite agus táthar ag súil le dul ar aghaidh mar an gcéanna i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Níl ach £15,000 á sholáthar i mbliana do na Tithe Gloine i gcomparáid le £30,000 anuraidh.  Caitheadh thar £20,000 ar na tithe gloine anuraidh; ar an bhfiche teach atá á dtógáil i gConamara agus an dá theach déag i <Col N="1169" /> dTuar Mhic Éadaí.  Táthar sásta gur leor an soláthar de £15,000 don obair atá le déanamh i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Trí mhíle, cúig céad punt atá á sholáthar i mbliana faoi Scéim na Muc. Dáileadh 75 chráin san iomlán anuraidh agus táthar ag súil le 113 chráin a dháileadh i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Tá ísliú sa soláthar don Scéim Solais agus Teasa.  Ceapadh an scéim seo le haghaidh na n-oileán nach féidir an leictreachas a sholáthar dóibh mar atá á dhéanamh don tuaith i gcoitinn ach táthar tar éis riachtanais na n-oileán sin a shásamh anois agus níl gá le níos mó ná soláthar comharthach don scéim i mbliana.  Ní miste a mhíniú gur chuir an Roinn bun-trealamh solais agus teasa ar fáil faoin Scéim do thuairim 650 teaghlaigh ar na hoileáin Ghaeltachta agus gur ghlac na teaghlaigh uile go fonnmhar leis an Scéim.  Tuigtear dom chomh maith gur cheannaigh suas le leath na dteaghlach sin trealamh breise dhóibh féin.</P>
    <P>Chífear go bhfuil méadú de £2,500 san iomlán a moltar le haghaidh Meánscolaíochta.  Tá san áireamh i mbliana scéim nua trína gcabhróidh an Roinn le húdaráis meánscoileanna sa Ghaeltacht chun cóir taistil a chur ar fáil do dhaltaí a mbíonn aistear fada le déanamh acu chun freastal ar mheánscoil. Íocfaidh an Roinn suas go dtí 80% de chostas ceadaithe na seirbhísí iompair.</P>
    <P>Táthar ag moladh £7,500 le haghaidh Hallaí Siamsa i mbliana.  Tá sé seo níos ísle ná an soláthar a rinneadh anuraidh ach tá forbairt na scéime seo níos moille ná mar a bhí coinne leis agus ní raibh de chaiteachas uirthi anuraidh ach £3,750.  Táthar sásta de gur leor an soláthar de £7,500 i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú de £2,000 sa soláthar do scéimeanna ilghnéitheacha.  Áirítear iontu siúd taitneamhachtaí cosúil le páirceanna imeartha, linnte snámha, piniúirí liathróid láimhe agus a leithéid a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Tá san áireamh iontu freisin trialacha talmhaíochta a ceapadh le haghaidh maoth-thorthaí agus fataí luatha a fhás sa Ghaeltacht, agus is astu a tabharfar cúnamh airgid i leith aon togra eile a nglacfar leis i rith na bliana.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom ar an ócáid seo mo bhuíochas a ghabháil arís leis na Coistí <Col N="1170" /> Áitiúla, na Coistí Talmhaíochta Contae, na Comhairlí Contae agus na heagraíochta eile a chomhoibríonn leis an Roinn chun na Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin éagsúla atá luaite agam a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Faoi fho-mhírcheann E den Mheastachán tá £2,000 á sholáthar arís i mbliana chun deontais bheaga a thabhairt le haghaidh imeachtaí cultúrtha agus sóisialacha, mar shampla, deontais le haghaidh Feiseanna agus Féilí Drámaíochta agus cúnamh airgid chun oirnéisí ceoil agus a leithéidí a chur ar fáil do Choistí Áitiúla sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá £48,000 dá sholáthar faoi fho-mhírcheann G le haghaidh an deontais £5.  Níl aon athrú anseo ón soláthar a bhí ann anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Chífear go bhfuil méadú go dtí £10,000 sa soláthar faoi fho-mhírcheann H le haghaidh Coláistí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Cé nár caitheadh ach timpeall leath an tsoláthair a bhí ann chuige sin anuraidh meastar go mbeidh riachtanas leis an suim sin i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Moltar soláthar de £100,000 a dhéanamh i mbliana mar Dheontas-i-gCabhair do Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Is ionann an soláthar sin agus an méid a híocadh le Gaeltarra Éireann anuraidh mar Dheontas-i-gCabhair.  Féadfaidh na Teachtaí eolas a fháil faoi imeachtaí an Bhoird le linn na bliana 1959/60 ó Thuarascáil agus Cuntais an Bhoird don bhliain sin a tíolacadh don Oireachtas le déanaí, amhail mar a foráltar le Alt 31 (5) agus Alt 32 (1) den Acht Um Thionscail na Gaeltachta, 1957.  Cé go dtaispeánann na Cuntais sin go raibh laghdú sna díolacháin sa bhliain 1959/60 tuigtear dom go bhfuil feabhas ag teacht ar an scéal sin de réir a chéile anois, cé gur féidir nach mbeidh an feabhas sin le tabhairt faoi deara sa Tuarascáil agus Cuntais don bhliain 1960/61 a tíolacfar don Oireachtas chomh luath agus is féidir é i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Níl aon athrú ar an soláthar a moltar le haghaidh Taispeántas Drámaíochta Gaeilge agus ní dóigh liom gur gá dom aon rud a rá faoi.</P>
    <P>Faoi fho-mhírcheann M den Mheastachán tugtar cúnamh do Choistí Áitiúla chun scoláireachtaí saoire sa Ghaeltacht a thabhairt do pháistí ó áiteanna <Col N="1171" /> lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Le roinnt bliana anuas tá líon na bpáistí a bhíonn páirteach sa scéim sin ag dul i méid agus i mbliana tá soláthar de £10,050 á mholadh di i gcomparáid le £8,600 a soláthraíodh anuraidh.  Fairis sin do cuireadh scéim thrialach ar siúl anuraidh trínar chuir Gael-linn timpeall 300 páistí ag freastal ar scoileanna éagsúla sa Ghaeltacht ar feadh téarma scoile amháin do gach páiste.  Tá beartaithe an scéim sin a leathnú i mbliana ionas go gcuirfear suas le 1,050 páistí chuig scoileanna Gaeltachta &mdash; gach páiste acu ar feadh téarma scoile amháin.  Íocfaidh mo Roinn deontas nach mó ná £19 le haghaidh gach páiste, faoi réir uasteora de £19,950.  Mar sin, idir an dá chuid den scéim seo, beidh £30,000 san iomlán ag teastáil i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Is sontasach an feabhas a tháinig ar shaol mhuintir na Gaeltachta faoi rialú dúchasach.  Is beag teach scoile sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht go mb'éigean é a dhúnadh cheal dóthain tinrimh &mdash; ach b'éigean cuid acu a fhairsingiú de bharr méadú líon na ngasúr.  Má tá eolas níos fearr acu ar an mBéarla anois, tá sé amhlaidh de dhroim bearta oideachais a ceapadh amach d'aonturas chuige sin. Ach níl siad ag tréigint na teangan náisiúnta agus ní thréigfidh an fhad is a bhéas Éire fré chéile gníomhach chun a hathbheochana.</P>
    <P>Chíonn siad go bhfuil fás marthannach gach uile Shamhradh i ndiaidh a chéile ar líon na bhfoghlaimeoirí a thaganns mar chuairteoirí ina measc. Scaipeann na cuairteoirí seo a lán airgid ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Ní bheidh mé sásta go mbeidh chuile theaghlach sa nGaeltacht ag coinneál foghlaimeoirí, Samhradh i ndiaidh Samhraidh, agus cuid mhaith acu á gcoinneál i rith na bliana chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Is ionann sábháil na Gaeltachta agus scaipeadh na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre. Má tugtar suas den iarracht cé thógfadh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta tabhairt suas freisin?  Tá eolas anois ag aos óg na hÉireann ar dhá theangain, agus táimid ag teannadh leis an am nuair a bhéas an oiread Gaeilge ag lucht na Béarlachta is atá de Bhéarla ag lucht na Gaeltachta.  Is é an t-oideachas an tairbhe is marthannaí agus is buaine is <Col N="1172" /> féidir a chur ar fáil do aos óg na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ar an ábhar sin tá meánscolaíocht dá soláthar dóibh.  Ar an gcaoi seo béidh sé ar a gcumas chur isteach ar chuid mhaith de na postanna oifigiúla agus tráchtálacha atá coibhrithe don sórt sin scolaíochta agus, dá bharr sin, coinneofar tuilleadh acu in Éirinn. Teastaíonn an t-oideachas leanúnach, freisin, leis an mbrabach is fearr a bhaint as a bhfuil de bheartaíocht ann do leas gheilleagrach na taoibhe sin tíre. I ndáil leis seo, béidir go mbeidh sé inspéise a lua go bhfuil liaison curtha ar bun idir an Roinn agus an Foras Talúntais.</P>
    <P>Is cúis sásúlachta liom nach bhfuil gníomhacht an Fhorais coibhrithe don Achréidh, ach go bhfuil spéis faoi leith aige i saothrú an tsléibhe agus an phortaigh, agus tuiscint dá réir sin aige dó.  Is obair fhoighdeach í seo, ach le cabhair an Fhorais agus comhar na gcomharsan beifear ag súil le toradh maith uaithi.</P>
    <P>Tá an dubhshraith bainte, agus táthar ag tógáil uirthi.  Tuigeann muinntir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil an oighreacht náisiúnta is uaisle ina gcúram siadsan. Táim sásta go bhfuil meas ag an gcuid eile den náisiún ar an oighreacht sin. Má déantar gníomh de réir an mheasa sin, déanfaidh cúpla glúin eile le cúnamh Dé, Gaeltacht den tír fré chéile.</P>

      <P>Tuigim.  Ag éisteacht leis an Aire, ba shoiléir nach raibh rud ar bith sa ráiteas ach urnaí agus beagán maitheasa.  Táim anbhródúil as an gceantar stairiúil inar rugadh is inar tógadh mé &mdash; ceantar Riocaird Bairéad, an file, agus ceantar Sheáin Uí Ruadháin a scríobh an leabhar clúiteach úd <i>Pádraic Mháire</i><Col N="1173" /><i>Bhán</i>, leabhar ina bhfuil scoth Ghaeilge Mhuigheo, atá i mbaol a báis faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>Ar feadh na mblianta ceanglaíodh an Ghaeilge, an teanga, le cúrsaí polaitíochta.  Ceanglaíodh an teanga go mór mór le cúrsaí Fhianna Fáil.  Ní raibh ansin ach cur i gcéill.  Mar a déarfá, cuireadh dallamullóg ar na daoine, ach rinne sé an-díobháil don teanga.  Tá mé lánsásta faoi sin. Cuireann sé masmas ar go leor daoine agus d'éirigh siad ina haghaidh nó chaill siad suim inti.  Ba mhaith liom an méid seo a rá.  Ní le Fianna Fáil an teanga. Is linn uile í, agus, arís, lig dom a rá gur linn uile í.  Má fhaigheann sí bás is tubaiste náisiúnta é gan dabht, ach má fhaigheann an Ghaeltacht bás is cinnte go bhfaighaidh an teanga bás freisin.</P>
      <P>Is é seo an cúigiú Meastachán do Roinn na Gaeltachta ón Rialtas.  An bhfuil pointe nua ar bith ann?  An bhfuil ann dóchas ar bith do mhuintir na Gaeltachta?  An bhfuil feabhas ar bith ar staid na teanga?  Ar tógadh aon bhreis mhór tithe sa Ghaeltacht?  Ar bunaíodh aon tionscal ann &mdash; aon tionscal nua?  Ar cuireadh fostaíocht ar fáil do mhórán eile de mhuintir na Gaeltachta?  Tá a fhios againn go léir na freagraí ar na ceisteanna sin.</P>
      <P>An ndearnadh aon rud go mbeadh dóchas ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta dá bharr?  Tá siad ag imeacht ina mílte, bliain i ndiaidh bliana.  Níl rud ar bith fiúntach á dhéanamh chun an Ghaeltacht a chur ar a bonnaibh.  I mo bharúilse tá deireadh le dóchas na ndaoine.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bunaíodh an Ghaeltacht ar dtús agus nuair a ceapadh mise im Aire, shíl mé go raibh seans agam faoi dheireadh rud maith mór a dhéanamh ar son mo chomharsana agus ar son daoine eile ar fud na tíre a bhí sa chás céanna leo.  Tháinig athrú rialtais agus ní raibh deis againn an rud maith mór sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sé an tuairim a bhí againn nach raibh ach an t-aon slí amháin ann chun sin a dhéanamh &mdash; an Ghaeltacht a chur ar bhonn ceart eacnamaíochta.  Chun é sin a chur i gcrích mholamar gnó na Gaeltachta a aistriú go Bord a bheadh ní amháin éifeachtach ach a mbeadh an dearcadh ceart náisiúnta aige agus gan aird aige ar chleasanna polaitíochta.  Is <Col N="1174" /> mí-ámharach mar a tharla.  Níor ghlac an Rialtas leis an seans.  Níor thug siad aird ar bith orainne ná ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Is Roinn éadóchais í Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Bunaíodh í leis an nGaeilge a chaomhnú agus a leathnú.  Bliain i ndiaidh bliana bhí suim mhór airgid gan caitheamh.  Cad chuige?  Is admháil béal dúnta é sin i mo bharúil nach féidir le muintir na Roinne slí ar bith a cheapadh chun an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Cén fáth nach bhfuil an tAire sásta é a chaitheamh.  &ldquo;Mair, a chapaill, agus gheobair féar&rdquo; a deir an seanfhocal ach &ldquo;bás, a chapaill, ceal féir&rdquo; polasaí an Aire anois.  Mura bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire agus ag a chuid comhairleoiri conas an t-airgead atá sa Vóta a chaitheamh, inseoidh mise dóibh conas é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Cuiridís deireadh leis an deontas cúig phunt.  Tá sé ina scéim cúig phunt rófhada.  Tá a fhios againn go léir go bhfuil laghdú ar luach an airgid agus uime sin ba cheart scéim ocht bpunt a dhéanamh de.  Rud eile, ba chóir an deontas a thabhairt in aghaidh gach páiste trí bliana d'aois in áit seacht mbliana.  Tá go leor teaghlach sa Ghaeltacht a labhraíonn Gaeilge lena gcuid páistí go dtí go dtéann siad ar scoil.  Dá gcuirti an scéim i bhfeidhm ó aois trí bliana ní chosnódh sé níos mó ná an méid a spáráiltear sa Vóta gach bliain.</P>
    <P>In speaking to this Estimate for the Department of the Gaeltacht, I am conscious of the desire at all times that the proceedings of this House in relation to the Department of the Gaeltacht and, indeed, in relation to any other Department, where it might be possible, should be conducted entirely in Irish.  The newspapers of this country are, by and large, the most exact barometers of public opinion that we can find.  I recall that on the Estimate for the Department of Education last year Deputy Jones, in his constructive speech exhaustively covering the whole field of education, spoke entirely in Irish and in not one Irish newspaper was his name mentioned.  He had several constructive things to say about education.  It was a pity his remarks were lost in the lack of publicity that <Col N="1175" /> attended the fact that he spoke entirely in Irish.</P>
    <P>I come myself, as I have already said in Irish, from an historical part of the country, linguistically, at any rate, and from a literary point of view.  I come from the country from which there is still extant the beautiful poems of Richard Barrett of Gorthamore.  I come from the village of Seán Ó Ruadháin who is still happily with us the author of <i>Pádraig Mháire Bhán</i> which contains the cream of the Irish language.  I wonder how many Deputies have read <i>Pádraig Mháire Bhán?</i>  I wonder how many have read the poems of Richard Barrett, the most notable of which is Eóin Cóir.  I am sure the number if an exact census were taken, would be appallingly small.</P>
    <P>As I said, when speaking in Irish, when I was afforded the opportunity and the very distinct privilege of becoming Minister for the Gaeltacht I thought I was on the threshold of realising the dreams that first impelled me into public life in order to be able to do something for my neighbours and those people in other counties similarly situated economically.  I believed, and the Government to which I belonged believed &mdash; and we have not changed our views since &mdash; that the method by which the Gaeltacht can most effectively be saved is to establish there a sound economic policy consistent with the raw materials available, the capabilities of the people and not alone their local but their national aspirations</P>
    <P>It was with that idea in mind &mdash; feeling that it was trammelled by the Civil Service, a feeling which, by the way, no longer can be so confidently justified &mdash; that we set up a board to deal with the affairs of Gaeltarra Éireann, the activities of which were largely confined to the Gaeltacht.  I have been accused many times here of ulterior and base motives in drawing attention to the affairs of Gaeltarra Éireann as I found them under Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta and as I still continue to find them under Gaeltarra Éireann, a semi-State board.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House and the country that my interest in these <Col N="1176" /> matters dates from a date far behind my first election here.  Deputies will readily understand that interest when I tell them that there is situate, first of all, in the village at home where my family attend Mass, where we do our shopping, a Gaeltacht knitting industry. It is now run by Gaeltarra Éireann in the village of Geesala.  I live a mile from that village.  There is another in Belmullet, in the same barony.  There is one in Muings, Carrateigue, Pollathomas and Bangor-Erris.  Dotted all around me are these little centres of local industry originally initiated by the Congested Districts Board.</P>
    <P>I saw the way that work never seemed to increase.  There never seemed to be any great increase in the number employed.  I was conversant with the appalling wages that were paid.  I was equally conversant with the excellent work turned out by the girls working in those centres.  I felt that if ever the opportunity came, as it did come, I would try to do something not alone to increase the employment content but to increase and ameliorate the conditions of employment. Those were my motives when I began my work.  Those are still my motives.</P>
    <P>So long as there are people in my part of the country and, to my knowledge, others similarly placed, the same kind of people &mdash; in Donegal, Galway, West Cork or anywhere else &mdash; where young members of the families of smallholders or labourers in those districts can find employment, I shall be relentless in my efforts to see that things are conducted in such a manner that the very best possible results will be obtained for them.  Therefore, I do not speak here in anger.  I speak in sorrow as to the results that have been achieved in that regard.</P>
    <P>The principal preoccupation in the areas of the Gaeltacht with which I am conversant at the moment appears to be the desire to get a ticket out of it by car, bus, rail, boat or plane at an emigrant fare to the cities of England or to the cities of America. It interested me greatly &mdash; an interest that was accompanied with a certain degree of shock &mdash; that at last some local person with no political interest &mdash;if anything politically favourable to <Col N="1177" /> the present Minister for the Gaeltacht &mdash;complained that not enough English was being taught in the Gaeltacht. That statement was made in Tourmakeady at the conclusion of an Irish week there which the Minister for the Gaeltacht attended and performed the closing functions.</P>
    <P>I suppose there are people who would have accused that young enterprising merchant in Tourmakeady of being anti-Irish and of wanting to establish English in the Gaeltacht. There are people who would dispose of the views he expressed by calling him a &ldquo;shoneen.&rdquo;  I am sure the Minister for the Gaeltacht was shocked not alone to hear the statement made but to find that it was made in pursuance of an established conviction that emigration is the only future for the young people of the Gaeltacht, that they should be fitted out educationally in English for the conditions of the land to which they will have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>No other interpretation of that spontaneous utterance by that courageous young man is possible than that emigration is now accepted as an established procedure in the Gaeltacht and the congested areas, in the absence of any planning on the part of the Department.  There does not appear to be any planning in a Department which does not spend its full Vote in the year.  This is the kind of Department I should expect to come back in the course of a year looking for a substantial Supplementary Estimate in order to deal with the pressing matters in the areas which the Department was set up to guide, advise, protect and extend.  But no, that has not happened.  We hear the same old story and we have the same old subheads.</P>
    <P>It is true that there has been an increase in housing grants, but side by side with that increase, it has been made more difficult for people to obtain these grants.  The hairsplitting that goes on about Irish being the language of the house, whether it is strong, whether it is weak, or whether it should be treated as a case of half and half is really appalling.</P>
    <P>The situation is such that a man in the Gaeltacht of Connemara may <Col N="1178" /> marry a woman from East Galway or anywhere else&mdash;even from Cork&mdash;who is not proficient in Irish because it has not been her spoken language.  She comes to the Gaeltacht to live and bring up a family.  The husband may speak perfect Irish, and the children may go to the local school and, with his help and the teachers' help, become proficient in Irish, but just because the mother who has chosen to come into this Gaeltacht area, from better land probably, and from a place in which the conditions of life are probably easier, is not proficient they are penalised.  That is not doing the Irish language any good.  The children will grow up in bad housing conditions and they will be told it was not possible for them to get a new house because their mother did not know Irish or did not have an opportunity of knowing it.  They will very soon drop the language.</P>
    <P>I appeal even at this late stage to the Minister to exhort his housing inspectors to allow some degree of the human element to enter into their examinations. I do not want them to make it easy to obtain a grant but I want them to make it an encouragement and an inducement to learn the language.  I do not want it to be a fraud as it would be if grants were given indiscriminately to households which did not have any Irish at all. I want them given in an environment where an effort is being made, where the local school is situate in the Gaeltacht and all subjects are taught through the medium of Irish, and where Irish is the common language of the people.  The Gaeltacht housing grants should be an encouragement and an inducement to learn the language.</P>
    <P>The remark I now want to make would probably be more appropriate to the Vote for the Department of Education. The Department of the Gaeltacht, either by way of advice to, or in conjunction with, the Department of Education, should revive the summer courses for teachers.  If the people are anxious to establish an all-country Gaeltacht, as is the pious exhortation at the end of the Minister's speech, it is highly desirable that the Department of the Gaeltacht, again in conjunction <Col N="1179" /> with the Department of Education, should immediately engage in a revision of teaching methods.</P>
    <P>I was speaking some time ago to a gentleman from Israel.  On the setting up of the new Israeli State, they were confronted with tremendous difficulties in re-establishing their language as the spoken language there.  The degree of success attained by them is worth studying in order to see if by their methods, or by some adaptation of them, we could improve the situation here in regard to the Irish language. Let us not cloak the facts for one moment.  The situation is that the Gaeltacht is dwindling and the number of people speaking Irish in their everyday lives is rapidly becoming smaller.</P>
    <P>For goodness' sake, do not mind what people say on the census forms because, with an eye to the future, people will say on census forms something which is not a fact at the present time. We are not at all the saints we are made out to be in this island, and when it comes to what one might call census manoeuvring, we might well be termed scholars.  I ask the Department to keep a particular eye on the Statistics Office in that regard.  The most wonderful story ever known of the success of Irish will be found and when the facts come to be published, I have no doubt in the world that the number of Irish speakers will be found to have increased beyond all comprehension. But that is not the fact.  It is only something that is put on a census form with an eye to the future in case at some future time someone might be entering for something for which Irish is a sort of blue card, as it were, an Open Sesame, and a person might be confronted at some future time with the fact: &ldquo;You said on the census paper at such a date that you did not know Irish.  How do you come to know it now?&rdquo;  Those are the things that have to be watched and when those little absurdities are killed, we may expect to make some progress in regard to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I mentioned housing but I want particularly to deal with the question of holiday chalets.  I think the Minister replied to a question yesterday put down by Deputy Desmond in this regard. <Col N="1180" /> This Gaeltacht Housing Act is a good one and the facilities offered to the people are substantial, particularly the financial ones.  I thought the grants in respect of the chalets were a bit low having regard to the rising prices and all the rest of it.  However, when I find that in the whole of the Gaeltacht of Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Cork and Waterford there were, in the first place, only 27 applications for these chalets&mdash;14 were granted and seven refused&mdash;and that in reply to a supplementary question I am told&mdash;I may be wrong in this; I am open to correction by the Minister now&mdash;there are only six of them finished or nearing completion, that is bad and the Department will have to have some sort of reassessment of this business.</P>
    <P>I would not like to state positively and categorically that this whole chalet business is a failure but certainly it has not gone off to the start I am sure the Department expected and that I expected.  I have been advocating in my own Gaeltacht, at any rate, the importance of tourism there.  It is of extreme importance and anything this Department would do towards the development of tourism in these beautiful areas, with their scenic amenities, if not unrivalled certainly on a par with any in the world, would be welcomed.  We must be given the weather but weather not-withstanding, even in regard to the restoration of Irish, there is a sort of mystic quality that goes with the hills, the glens, the streams and the roar of the sea.  All these things are important in a people's make-up and tourism is extremely important in an area such as this.</P>
    <P>The people should be advised in these areas to provide their own home-made bread and their own butter, their own bacon and such fish as they can get for the tourist, instead of silently dispatching some child out of the house to the local shop in the event of having to give a stranger a meal at a price.  In the Gaeltacht we give for nothing or we do not appear to give at all.  Asking people to pay for a meal outside the recognised hotels and guest houses is something <Col N="1181" /> the people do not appear to have adopted so far.  Instead of sending to the local shop for a piece of cold ham, a loaf and maybe a bit of cake that is there for a week, the people should provide their own cooking and what they produce themselves. Otherwise the stranger gets the impression that this what the people eat themselves every day.  What is good enough for the people of the Gaeltacht in their ordinary every day life, should be good enough for the visitors who come their way, and it is. I have heard visitors say so and that is an aspect of the development of the Gaeltacht to which particular attention should be given.</P>
    <P>There are people who would say that that would militate against the use of Irish.  Of course it would militate against the use of Irish as between the resident of the Gaeltacht and the visitor but it does not prevent a native of the Gaeltacht turning to his mother and father or turning to a son and talking in Irish to them instead of to the visitor.  You see that happening in every country in the world where one member of a family who is able to speak the language of the visiting stranger turns round to the other members of the family and says to them in their language what he has been saying to the stranger.  It is something that should be watched but it is not necessary that it should be regarded as something that will do them damage.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the reasons for which I first took an interest in the affairs of Gaeltarra Éireann.  I am sure Deputies who have been listening to me so far today, if they have not been bored, are at least surprised that I have been so mild in my approach to this whole matter so far.  I propose to continue to be mild, at the same time devoting very close attention to the affairs of Gaeltarra Éireann in spite of the admonition I received from the <i>Sunday Review</i> last Sunday that I should give up the whole miserable affair and that, coming from Mayo, I should be the first to recognise stone walls.  I recognise stone walls but I am not afraid of them and if the whole machinery of the Department and of Gaeltarra Éireann is so geared as to <Col N="1182" /> become a <i>Sunday Review</i> stone wall through which I cannot go or over which I cannot leap I am still un-afraid to have a try.</P>
    <P>This Board of Gaeltarra Éireann was set up under legislation to which all sides of this House gave approval. It had been initiated by the last Government under Deputy Costello's administration and, if my recollection serves me right, the heads of the Bill were there ready.  The present Government carried on obviously recognising the merits of the case for such a Bill. It came into being and I must confess I was shocked when I saw the list of its first directors.  The first chairman got out as fast as he could.  No explanation has been given since for his getting out although I pressed very hard for it on the occasion of this Vote last year.  It was not forthcoming on the simple basis that Mr. Briscoe did not tell us and I did not ask.  Mr. Briscoe left and there has been no permanent chairman of this Board since:</P>
    <P>The Chairmanship and the managing directorship of this board has been undertaken alternatively by the permanent head of the Department of the Gaeltacht, the Secretary of the Department.  Recently I was pleased to see that after a long absence Mr. Fitzpatrick who used to be assistant director in the Gaeltacht Services when it was run by the Civil Service was brought back as managing director and I saw in that for the first time a gleam of hope that there was somebody brought in with some knowledge and some experience.  As far as the rest of them &mdash; I do not want to go through them individually &mdash; I think the whole country knows they must have been selected strategically and geographically in the interests of Fianna Fáil, not to mention certain other relations of either consanguinity or affinity.  Of course in the reports themselves we have the evidence of the failure of this board and its alternating chairman and managing director and I propose to exclude straightaway from any observations which I intend to make the present managing director, Mr. Fitzpatrick, who has nothing whatsoever to do <Col N="1183" /> with these two accounts before us today.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister say in his address to us today of Gaeltarra Éireann?  It is common knowledge that everybody engaged in this country in the manufacture and sale of tweeds, knitwear and linen is successful and doing good business but Gaeltarra Éireann, with all the resources that the State can provide for it as a semi-State body is losing sums of money every year that are really astounding.  From the year 1958-59 to the year 1959-60, as on page 7 of the accounts for 1959-60 we see a drop in the total sales from that year to the next of £30,154. That should not be if this organisation were properly managed and if it were being conducted properly.  Of course it is difficult&mdash;and that is something the public do not know&mdash;to see any other result when the person who was the sales manager up to recent times in Gaeltarra Éireann was one and the same person whom I, in full agreement with the acting chairman of the board and the then permanent head of the Department, as a result of a Departmental inquiry, dismissed from the service of Gaeltarra Éireann as an agent.</P>
    <P>That was the sales manager who was brought back and the sales are gone down from one year to the next by £30,154.  All that was due not to lack of knowledge but to sheer neglect of Gaeltarra Éireann business while most of the time was being devoted by this person to a very extensive business of a similar kind of which he was principal shareholder.  You can dismiss people for misconduct or for any reason that is consistent with a breach of the contract into which they entered.  However, it should not be possible, on a change of Government, to have a person brought back into the service because he is a friend of somebody&mdash;I am not talking about Gaeltarra Éireann; I am enunciating a principle&mdash;in spite of the fact that that person has been dismissed as a result of a departmental inquiry ordered by a Minister, the findings of which were concurred in by the departmental head. <Col N="1184" /> Changes of Government do not change standards of morality.  In passing, may I say that even though this person has now left Gaeltarra Éireann, for what reason I do not know, he is still on the Taoiseach's invitation list to official receptions in Dublin Castle, there misconducting himself as he did in Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>In his seven-page speech the Minister devoted slightly over a third of a page to the affairs of Gaeltarra Eireann and this is what he says:</P>
      <P>It is proposed to provide £100,000 this year by way of Grant-in-Aid for Gaeltarra Éireann.  This amount is the same as that paid as grant-in-aid to Gaeltarra Éireann last year.</P>
      <P>Here comes the gem:</P>
      <P>Deputies will obtain information of the proceedings of the Board during the year 1959-60 from the Report and Accounts for that year which have recently been presented to the Oireachtas in accordance with Sections 31 (5) and 32 (1) of the Gaeltacht Act, 1957.  Although these accounts show a reduction in sales in 1959-60 I understand that the position now shows a gradual improvement, although this improvement may not be evident in the Report and Accounts for the year 1960-61 which will be presented to the Oireachtas as soon as possible this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told: &ldquo;You will get information from the accounts.&rdquo; Speaking <Col N="1185" /> last year on the Estimate, I brought to the Minister's notice certain aspects of the accounts of 1958-59 which seemed to me, as a layman in the matter of accounts, as not being a real picture.  In fairness to the Minister, let me say he promptly undertook to look into the matter and to let me know what the situation was. In the 1958-59 accounts the losses were down to £82,000.  On the first view that would appear to be a very satisfactory situation and indeed for a little while I felt like doing a little bit of private boasting, that we had been the people who thought of this legislation to set up the board and I was about to say: &ldquo;Well, now, were we not right&rdquo;?  I congratulate the Minister, my successor, for actually setting up the board and bringing this business to such a wonderful stage of fruition &mdash; only £82,000 of a loss as against something like £130,000 or £140,000 the year before.  Nobody could refrain from saying: &ldquo;This is marvellous.  This is a great board in spite of what we thought about them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister undertook to look into the matter and he did.  That was on the 10th June, 1960.  On the 14th July I asked the Minister &ldquo;if pursuant to the undertaking he gave in the Dáil on the 10th June, 1960 to have the published accounts of Gaeltarra Éireann for 1958-59 investigated he will state the position regarding the accuracy or otherwise of the said accounts&rdquo;.  The Minister replied to me:</P>
    <P>Níl mé go fóill i riocht raiteas mar sin a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>In other words, he was not ready to make a statement of that kind yet.</P>
    <P>I then said: &ldquo;Perhaps the Minister would be able to give it to me if I repeat the question next Tuesday.&rdquo; The Minister slipped into English, and said: &ldquo;I do not think so.&rdquo;  I stated: &ldquo;I shall repeat the question.&rdquo;  Then Deputy Dillon came into the picture and referred to certain findings and remarks made by him as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, whereupon the Minister said that he had given an undertaking that he would examine it.  I kept on pressing; I asked did that mean the Minister will not be in a position to clarify the <Col N="1186" /> situation before the Houses went into Recess and the Minister said: &ldquo;That seems likely.&rdquo; In point of fact the House went into Recess and we got no further information.  I repeated my question on 20th July, 1960, and the Minister told me that inquiries were still proceeding and that he was not in a position to make a statement.  We went into Recess.</P>
    <P>I kept on making these inquiries about these particular accounts and it was not until 16th March, 1961, when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Ó Briain, replying for the Minister, stated that the figure standing at £82,000 odd as losses for Gaeltarra Éireann in 1958/59 was not the correct figure; that it was too little by some £14,114.  Anxious to find out where this mistake occurred &mdash; I believe it was a mistake and I am prepared to concede that much, but it was a mistake which I shall show should not have occurred &mdash; I wanted to know to what particular items this amount was to be attributed.  I was informed by the Minister in reply to subsequent questions that it referred to the toy industry section only of Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Minister did make inquiries and he did have revaluation done.  In the course of these inquiries there was an examination of the stock, unaltered from 1958/59 to the date of the inquiry, in the factory at Kilcar and in the stores at Teelin and Dunkineely. I need not go into the various items under the headings of &ldquo;Wool Waste&rdquo;, &ldquo;Oil&rdquo;, &ldquo;Unfinished Tweed&rdquo;, &ldquo;Finished Tweed&rdquo; and so on.  It transpired that there was an over-valuation in respect of them to the extent of some £12,000 odd.  I will give the Minister the correct figure and ask him to deny it, if he so wishes.  The over-valuation on 31st March, 1959, was £12,086 2s. 7d.  Why did not the Minister tell me there was an over-valuation there as well as an over-valuation in the toys?  He knew it. That information was at his disposal when I asked these questions.  The idea obviously was to confine the over-valuation to a branch of this industry where it might be possible to show that it was a genuine mistake, namely, to the toys.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> I think it would be a good thing now for the Minister to tell us exactly how that mistake was made.  I know how it was made.  I know where certain calculations for other purposes outside of the accounts were included with the actual valuation and we accordingly get an over-valuation of the toys to the tune of over £14,000. If you add that £14,000 to the £82,000 you get bigger losses than are shown in the balance sheet.  If you add the £12,000 odd for the over-valuation at Kilcar, Teelin and Dunkineely you will get bigger losses still.  Mark you, I have no knowledge of the over-valuation that was deliberately done in order to bring losses down on paper with regard to knitwear, linen and lace.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister questions in the course of the year about the half-yearly position with regard to losses in Gaeltarra Éireann and the Minister told me that Gaeltarra Éireann were not obliged under statute to keep half-yearly accounts.  That, of course, was not what I asked.  I asked if he would let us know what the losses were at 30th September, 1958.  The Minister did not answer that question.  He said he would not ask Gaeltarra Éireann to give an account they never published. That would, of course, have been perfectly legitimate if it was not at the time well-known to the Minister and well-known to the Board of Gaeltarra Éireann, in conjunction with whom he was conducting an inquiry most minutely, that on the 30th September, 1958, Gaeltarra Éireann was showing a loss for the year 1958/59 of £71,223. Having regard to that fact, and it is a fact, how could it be regarded as a reasonable mistake to make to say that they lost only £11,000 in the next six months, making a total of £82,000? That is where I ask the House to think, that is where I ask the country to think, that this statement of a loss of £82,000 was a little more than a mistake and was, on the part of someone or other, a deliberate action in order to cloak accounts.</P>
    <P>Not alone in regard to Gaeltarra Éireann but in regard to all the other semi-public bodies, Córas Iompair Éireann, E.S.B., Bord na Móna, and <Col N="1188" /> so on, we have the customary parliamentary procedure being adopted in the reply: &ldquo;As this is a matter concerning internal trading, I would not ask them.&rdquo;  I asked questions about debts due and debts written off by Gaeltarra Éireann in the course of the year.  I was told it was an internal trading matter.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the accounts of Gaeltarra Éireann is such that when anybody challenges them they fold up; they are not certain. Within the last year they bluffed their way to the threshold of the court and then, when they saw that the plaintiff was serious about the allegations he was making and that he could substantiate them and that it would be bad for business that these allegations should go forth, they paid the total of the amount claimed plus a very substantial sum for costs.</P>
    <P>The system being adopted by them with regard to the issue of credit notes to various people is nothing short of disgraceful.  A person has only to say: &ldquo;This garment is unsuitable.  It is not according to specification.  It is not in accordance with the warranty given.  It has faded.  Something has happened.&rdquo;  It is sent back; no questions; out goes a credit note.  What becomes of these garments that go back in large numbers to Westland Row? That shows that this body has no confidence in what it is making and has no confidence in its ability to prove to the public that its goods are as good as any other.</P>
    <P>The whole situation is an extremely sorry one and one which merits very close examination.  I said that I hoped this Board would have a national outlook and would be competent, but on the face of things the display of competence here is far from great.  Gaeltarra Éireann is riddled with political friends and close relatives of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They may well have got there on merit with interviews specially framed and questions carrying high marks suited to certain applicants. They may well have got there on merit on that basis but it is a rather curious coincidence that they all happen to come from the same body of political thought.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> I shall now deal with the correct losses of Gaeltarra Éireann.  There are people within the employment of Gaeltarra Éireann who know perfectly well that before the end of June of last year, at a time when the Minister said he could not make any statement in regard to the £82,000 loss which I queried and which he could not in fact make until the following March, 1961, it was a matter of common agreement within Gaeltarra Éireann that losses for 1958/59 should stand around £147,000 instead of £82,000 as published and now admitted as wrongfully published.  There may be some reason for this.  I do not think it is a good thing that these things should be withheld from the people.  The people should know if the losses are great and they should be told why. Such losses might well be inevitable.</P>
    <P>With regard to these two accounts, may I make another observation?  The 1958/59 account is the first account published for this company.  The 1959/60 account is the second and last one published.  If the accounts were designed to be documents from which information could be easily gleaned, they would follow in certain sequence, headings would remain the same and there would not be different terms used in one as against the other.  But, there is, I am convinced, buried in the accounts of 1959/60 a sum that represents further losses and which is covered in some way here by these figures.  It might well be possible that they are contained in the statement on page 10 where &ldquo;lúide díluachadh&rdquo; is entered at £40,656, having been entered at £21,135 the year before.</P>
    <P>I invite people to look at the footnote on page 10 which, in effect, says that a different system of costing has been arrived at and that as a result there was an increase in the value of finished goods of about £31,821.  That, of course, is complete fake in order to cover other heavy losses.  If a person has something in his shop or store valued at £100 and he owes £200 and somebody challenges him and says he is not solvent, all he has to do is to alter the valuation and to say that the stuff in the store is worth £250 on a new method, about which we are not told anything as to how it works, and <Col N="1190" /> suddenly he becomes solvent overnight merely by adopting some other system or changing the value of something.</P>
    <P>The House requires to be told more minutely about this particular method. It is noteworthy that the note is signed by only two members of the Board and by the Secretary and Accountant.</P>
    <P>There is no sequence.  Of course, putting the £14,000 that they say was a mistake the year before, into the 1959/60 accounts as losses that do not relate to the year's trading is just a little piece of book-keeping camouflage which just will not get by.  This is the kind of thing that makes people lose confidence in bodies such as this. In fact, I do not think the people have any confidence in this body at all and I do not blame them.  In fact, it is one of the avenues where public moneys are being expended that will have to be carefully re-explored, re-examined and re-assessed.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here that statements made from time to time by me are reckless, without foundation. It has been suggested on one occasion by no less a responsible person, totally divorced from recklessness of any kind, than the Tánaiste, Deputy MacEntee, that I had the life of a man on my hands.  I leave it to the public to judge that matter.  But if somebody is accused of directing them to make wrong statements and is caught up in a mesh of fraud, out of which he cannot extricate himself, and he decides to end his own life, that is a matter he has brought upon himself.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his predecessors have made a very grave mistake in treating all this matter on a political basis.  They should have welcomed an inquiry when it was first asked for. They should have got it going.  Had they done so, they would have found they would not have had to withhold matters from the public under the guise of their being internal trade.  I asked the Minister several other questions, some of them personal questions, which I shall not go into.  I suppose he cannot be blamed for using the guise of internal trade to hide them.  We are doing reasonably well in toys, but in tweeds and knitwear we should be doing ten times as well <Col N="1191" /> as we are, if things were being properly run.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Minister made a mistake in treating this matter politically and protecting people behind a political smokescreen that should not have been allowed into any business.  Had that not been done, they would have come out of this much better, as would we all in the political life of the country.  When things like that happen, we are all dubbed with the one brush as being people with low standards who allow things to pass just because they have been happening for a long time, who allow low standards to become the highest standards by practice.</P>
    <P>Those principles are entirely wrong. They must be corrected by somebody at some future time if there is to be any hope left to the Irish people in their public men.  An inquiry would have revealed there was something wrong and Gaeltarra Éireann would probably be bringing in accounts to-day that would not be open to suspicion, that would be good accounts and on the accuracy and veracity of which the public could rely.  As I said, I have been warned by a Sunday newspaper circulating here to drop &ldquo;this miserable affair&rdquo;.  It is a miserable affair.  This is the last occasion in the reign of this Government on which I shall be addressing myself to this question.  If I have pursued it with tenacity, I have done so as a matter of conscience.  Given the opportunity, I shall pursue it further.</P>
    <P>If I am being told by the barometer of the public press that I should recognise a stone wall, it is a scandal that even the Attorney General, in relation to the affairs of Gaeltarra Éireann in the one and only court case he saw fit to bring the case, behaved like Sigurani in the Wilma Montesi case in Rome in 1953, 1954 and 1955.  When the facts appeared to be going against him, he directed his counsel to withdraw.  It is a pity that the levels have been brought so low.  It is a pity that it is being accepted, even by the public Press, that a Government appears, a Department <Col N="1192" /> of State appears, the Attorney General appears and everybody appears to have the right to form themselves into a stone wall through which and across which the arrow of truth may not pass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention in the debate will be very brief indeed. During the course of the twelve months just ended, I, in conjunction with many other Deputies representing Gaeltacht areas, have had occasion to make representation to the Minister and his Department for improvement schemes in these poor areas.  I know what the people of the Gaeltacht of Tír Conaill are going to say when I go back and tell them that, out of £150,000 voted last year for improvement schemes, only £100,000 is being spent.  Fifty thousand pounds is being returned to the Exchequer and the reason given by the Minister to-day is: &ldquo;It was not utilised because some schemes could not be completed as early as had been intended.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have a stiurthóir in the Gaeltacht and we have many officials.  We are crying out for employment there. But here some £50,000 is returned to the Exchequer simply because the works could not be completed during the year.  In other words, the works had not begun in time and the money is only allocated when they know it cannot be spent.  Is it not a crying disgrace that the £50,000 voted by this House for these poor, unfortunate people, who are compelled to seek employment across the water in Britain, has been returned to the Exchequer? What will my friend, the Deputy from Connemara, say when he goes back and tells the people of Rossmuc and Carna that his Minister, who also represents the same county, was unable to spend that £50,000 extra last year?  I know what the people who are crying out for roads in the Rosses and Gweedore will say when I tell them that £50,000 was returned to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a shame that these schemes were not begun in time and completed before the year ended.  It is something the Minister should not allow to happen.  I note he has now reduced <Col N="1193" /> the amount allocated for improvement schemes by £20,000.  In other words, we voted £150,000 last year but could spend only £100,000.  Therefore, that is the excuse for voting only £130,000 this year.  If we take the £130,000 and take into account the £50,000 unexpended last year, does it not mean that only £80,000 is being voted for improvement schemes in the coming year?  Again, we will find that some of that £80,000 will return to the Exchequer for the simple reason that the work will not be commenced in sufficient time.  Is there not laxity on the part of some office?  Surely schemes that have been voted and sanctioned one year, and where the work is not carried out, should be commenced early in the following year? But, despite that, £50,000 is returned to the Exchequer, and that is the excuse offered for reducing the Vote this year by £20,000.</P>
    <P>Among the schemes introduced by the inter-Party Government to provide employment in the Gaeltacht was one for the allocation of seine-net fishing boats.  I do not know whether I am wrong in accusing the Minister of discontinuing this scheme.  It may be the baby of the Minister for Fisheries and his Department.  But I know the scheme was introduced for the purpose of improving the livelihood of fishermen living in the Gaeltacht areas.  I think it was a very good scheme whereby boats were supplied to the Gaeltacht without the usual deposit of five or ten per cent.</P>
    <P>These boats cost anything up to £12,000 and it is very difficult for fishermen to procure the deposit.  It was a scheme in which I had great faith in so far as the fishermen of the Gaeltacht were concerned, but I cannot see any mention of the Gaeltacht boats in the Minister's speech today; not one solitary sentence refers to them.  What has become of the scheme?  Is it the usual practice, that because it was initiated by the inter-Party Government it should be dropped?  I would like to know where are the boats that were provided annually in the days of the inter-Party Government and why the scheme then initiated has been dropped.  It is something about which <Col N="1194" /> the people of the Gaeltacht will require an explanation.</P>
    <P>In the Gaeltacht of Tir Conaill we looked forward to the spreading of the greenhouse scheme.  Personally I did not approve of the scheme at the beginning. I always said it would never be a success until heat was installed and, since heat has been installed, they have become an economic success.  Why have we not expanded the scheme?  I am thinking of the island of Arranmore where migration is probably at its highest, and not only migration but also emigration.  I always thought it would be an ideal site for one of the greenhouse schemes.  It is lying under the sun and sheltered from the western gales.  I always thought Arranmore was a place where we could have experimented with an extension of the greenhouse scheme.  I think I know the reason nothing was done.  There is a small pocket on the island in which Irish is not spoken and the stiúrthóir of Roinn na Gaeltachta has decided to punish the entire island simply because English is spoken in the harbour village.  However, perhaps some other Minister in some other Government will see that justice is done for the island of Arranmore.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay referred at length to the administration of the Gaeltacht housing grants.  I do not wish to make accusations against the Gaeltacht housing inspectors but there is no child on whom there is more faitiós or shyness than the child in a Gaeltacht House.  When an inspector calls at these houses and speaks to children in a dialect to which the children are unaccustomed&mdash;and children in Donegal are not accustomed to the southern or western dialects, particularly the younger children &mdash; and when they are addressed by an Irish speaker from a different Gaeltacht, this shyness overcomes them and they do not answer.  Very often the people have been refused the Gaeltacht housing grant on the grounds that Irish is not the spoken language of the family. That is most unfair and many a time I have said in this House that we should appoint officers to the Gaeltacht only from that particular Gaeltacht, or officers who are accustomed to speak <Col N="1195" /> in the Irish of that particular Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The Minister should busy himself with the fact also that Gardai from different Gaeltachta are being posted to Gaeltachta where their dialect is not understood and they are not getting the confidence of the people and not being the success they should be.  There should be no difficulty whatever in finding Connacht-speaking Gardai to man the barracks in Connacht and the same applies to Ulster and Munster. Sending a man from Ballyferriter to the Gaeltacht of Donegal where his dialect is completely misunderstood, is absolutely useless and doing more damage to the language than would have been done if they sent an English speaker to the place.  The Minister, who is really the liaison officer between the various other Government Departments, should busy himself with those matters.  If he did, he would be doing a good deal for the language.  Let us face facts.  Has the boundary of any Gaeltacht extended within the past 30 years?  Instead of extending, the boundaries are contracting and no people know that better than those who frequent the Gaeltacht.  I know it is a problem and it is going to be a problem to retain the Irish language as a spoken language.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking in this House some 10 years ago when I advocated that we should subsidise the sending of children to the Gaeltacht throughout the year and not only during the summer months.  I suggested that every bean a'tighe in the Gaeltacht should become a hotelier or a boarding-house keeper, and that by doing that we would be helping the Gaeltacht economy and have every square inch of ground tilled to provide vegetables and root crops to feed these children.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Minister, although rather late in the day, refers to this on page 7 of his speech when he says:</P>
    <P>I shall not be satisfied until every household in the Gaeltacht accommodates students every summer and until many of them also provide accommodation throughout the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> It is some ten or eleven years ago since I first advocated this scheme on this Estimate and now it is still a hopeful prayer of the Minister.  Why has something not been done?  It is one of the methods whereby we can save the language and also retain the residents of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to another matter which is causing great concern to the people of the Gaeltacht.  For some years past the hand-knitting industry has been a success, apart from that of Gaeltarra Éireann.  There are distributors of wool who distribute it among the knitters in the Gaeltacht who are able to earn a few pounds in the week.  What is the Government's latest method of attack on the people? The social welfare officer is going around endeavouring to ferret out every penny earned by these unfortunate knitters and if the menfolk are in receipt of unemployment assistance, old age pensions, or I.R.A. pensions, the earnings of the unfortunate knitters are assessed against the means of the menfolk who are recipients of these pensions, or of home assistance, and they automatically lose the pensions which they have been receiving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that, but as I said before, the duty of the Minister for the Gaeltacht is to look after all the interests of the people living in the Gaeltacht.  I am referring in particular to one case of which I am aware in a townland in the Rosses area where an old soldier of the I.R.A. has now had his military service pension cut simply because his women-folk are alleged to have earned a few pounds by distributing knitting to the knitters in the area.  If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle says I should not mention that case, I shall not but I would like the Minister to take note of it.  If I had the opportunity of mentioning it I would go into further detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate asks for additional money for Scéim na Muc.  We have <Col N="1197" /> a fairly large Gaeltacht in County Donegal, but the grunt of a pig is as rare in it today as a Fianna Fáil interrupter at a public meeting.  I do not know where these additional sows are going, but certainly we have seen none in the Rosses or Gweedore.  There are other schemes which might be more beneficial to us and I think that in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture there is provision for the distribution of sows.  This statement in this Estimate is merely padding, as far as I can see.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into detail on the affairs of Gaeltarra Éireann. Deputy Lindsay has exposed them very well, but I should like to protest against the curtailment by Gaeltarra Éireann of the outdoor weaving in Donegal.  I remember twelve months ago or less when one of the directors of Gaeltarra Éireann, a Parliamentary Secretary, a Senator and myself attended a protest meeting against the dispersal of hand looms in the neighbourhood of Glencolumcille, Carrick and Glencar.  We were then assured by the director and the Parliamentary Secretary that this was merely the change over from the single loom to the double loom and that in a very short time, in a matter of weeks &mdash; I think there was a county council election coming on &mdash; there would be recruitment again of not only trained weavers but of trainees as well.  Since then Deputies have inundated the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann at Glencar to give employment to trained weavers and we get the same answer every time.</P>
    <P>The latest move was to transfer some of the girls from Crolly to Dublin.  Both Deputy Breslin and myself protested but were told they were merely going to Dublin as trainees for the transition at Crolly from the making of rag dolls to the manufacture of plastic dolls.  But we could see magnificent examples of plastic chairs manufactured in the Donegal factory.  On inquiry as to the sales and the demand for these chairs we were told that not a solitary chair had been sold.  We asked where they were on exhibition and they told us two of them were in a Grafton Street <Col N="1198" /> window in Dublin.  In the name of goodness, how can you expect to sell plastic chairs made in the Gaeltacht from an exhibition in Grafton Street?</P>
    <P>If the advice tendered by Deputy Breslin had been accepted they would have been put on exhibition in the boarding houses and hotels throughout the Rosses and Gweedore where people might have been tempted to buy them knowing that by doing so they would be giving employment in these areas.</P>
    <P>I think the Sales Manager of Gaeltarra Éireann should make a serious effort to advertise these magnificent plastic chairs now being made at Crolly so that the workers there can be maintained in the area instead of emigrating from it.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom mar fhocal scoir moladh mór a thabhairt do lucht oibre Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Má tá Gaeltarra Éireann ag cailleadh airgid, ní hiad a gcuid oibritheoirí atá ciontach leis, mar oibritheoirí is fearr i bhfad iad ná na daoine sna bailte móra.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot at all see why there should be a special Department of State to look after the expenditure of a little over half a million pounds to preserve the Gaeltacht in this country.  I think that could be done more effectively, more efficiently and more expeditiously if the responsibility were divided between the Departments of Local Government and Education.  Since Gaeltarra Éireann is an independent body they should be able to look after their own affairs but if the allegations made here by Deputy Lindsay are correct <Col N="1199" />&mdash;and he challenges contradiction &mdash;I think Gaeltarra Éireann should be brought under the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that I do not want to see the Minister for the Gaeltacht deprived of his post but I think we should be realistic in this matter and realise the futility of establishing a special Department for the disposal of half a million pounds.  I say that realising fully that the language and the Gaeltacht are the real symbols of nationhood and have been over the years.  With regard to the Gaeltacht itself, there was one activity which did not come to light in the years gone by, &mdash; the benefit provided over the years by students who go among the people of the Gaeltacht year after year and who have learned to love the Gaeltacht and to appreciate the difficulties of the people who live there.  These students go there to learn the language and it would be a pity if they were to have any Anglicising influence on the people of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I spent a few days in the Western Gaeltacht in Kerry last year and I found that a lot of people there had not a word of Irish.  They mix around with the people and I cannot see that this can do very much to preserve the language in those areas where it is still spoken.  With all due respect to the Gaeltachta of Connemara and Donegal, I think that the purest Gaeltacht there is is in the Dingle peninsula. I think the most attractive dialect of the lot is the one we hear in that area.  I do not want to decry the Connemara or the Donegal dialects. We in Munster have that conviction and I believe it is correct.  If we are anxious about the Gaeltacht, if we are anxious to preserve it, there is all the greater necessity for us to preserve the Gaeltacht in the islands round the coast.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to mention Inis Cléire in this debate today.  It is an island where we have Irish spoken fluently and effectively still.  It is an island with approximately 230 souls. It is an island seven or eight miles from the coast of Cork.  It is an island which has only four boat services in the week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> The people there are committed to paying rates that are really extravagant. It is impossible for them to pay the 5/- return journey to the island.  If we are serious in our efforts to preserve the Gaeltacht and the people in the Gaeltacht, we should do something by way of alleviating the hardship in respect of those people.  If they have to come to the mainland to do business or for Holy Communion and Confirmation, one can well imagine what an impact that has on the meagre family purse.</P>
    <P>These people are restricted in their activities and restricted in regard to the society they would like to meet. They are confined and isolated in that little island.  During the past financial year they decided that they would only pay half the rate demanded.  I know this has nothing to do with the Gaeltacht. I recommend them for it.  They are confined and having regard to the conditions in which they live, they should not be asked to honour these commitments at all.</P>

      <P>I realise that.  Besides, they have not the same amenities as we have here.  The roads have no tar macadam.  There is no surface on the roads and there are no motor cars on the island.  I believe there is a tractor or two on the island.  That shows what an effort they must make in order to survive.  Fishing for them, too, is a hazardous life.  They are not all fishermen. About one-sixth of them are people over 70 years of age and about a quarter of the population are under 16 years of age.  Something should be done by way of giving them cheap fares and a cheaper boat service.</P>
      <P>I believe that C.I.E. operate the boat services to the Aran Islands.  Why do not C.I.E. operate the services to Inis Cléire?  I think they should provide the people with a daily service at prices competitive with the prices existing elsewhere.  There is a good deal of comment locally that the boat was not left for tender and that the crew are not sufficiently paid.  If that is a fact, I think it is a scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying to preserve the Gaeltacht <Col N="1201" /> elsewhere while we have a Gaeltacht off the coast of Cork where the real Celts live for generations, where the language is still alive and spoken. Something substantial and progressive will have to be done for these people. If there was never a Gaeltacht in those islands, the fact remains that the people on those islands are citizens of the State and they are entitled to whatever services we can provide for them. These services should be comparable with the services provided on the mainland.</P>

      <P>Ba cheart a chur in iúl don aos óg gurb é an príomhrud, agus an rud is fearr is féidir leo a dhéanamh ar dtús, líofacht a fháil i labhairt na Gaeilge. Tá an nós a bhí ann fad ó &mdash; ní rófada ó shin é ach oiread, tríocha bliain ó shin &mdash; imithe.  An uair úd dá ndéanfadh duine botún gramadaí nó rud ar bith mar sin dhéanfaí gáire faoi i gcomhluadar lucht na Gaeilge.  Tá an lá sin imithe agus is maith an rud é.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, molaim an tAire agus an méadú atá Roinn na Gaeltachta a thabhairt do scoláirí, mic léinn, agus do dhaoine fásta chomh maith, chun dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus eolas a fháil <Col N="1202" /> ar labhairt na Gaeilge inti.  Chomh maith leis an obair atá Roinn na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh, tá siad ag cuidiú le scoláireachtaí a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>Tá obair mhaith á déanamh ag buíonta agus ag coistí ar fud na tíre, Coiste na bPáistí, Comhaltas Uladh, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge agus mar sin de.  Faigheann na coistí sin, agus na grúpaí sin, an-chreidiúint sna páipéir as na scéimeanna éagsúla atá ar siúl acu.</P>
    <P>Ach ní bhíonn bolscaireacht ar bith uaireannta mar gheall ar an bpáirt atá á imirt ag an Roinn.  Deárfainn nach bhfuil aon scoláireacht dá dtugtar nach dtugann Roinn na Gaeltachta nó an Roinn Oideachais páirt an-mhór den chostas.  Deir Gael-Linn gur chuir siad, agus go bhfuil siad ag cur, an oiread seo scoláirí agus páistí chun na Gaeltachta.  Deir dreamanna nua eile freisin an rud céanna.  Sílim féin gur bheag an chreidiúnt a thugtar uaireannta do Roinn na Gaeltachta as ucht an 70 nó an 60 faoin gcéad den chostas a íocann siad.</P>
    <P>Sa Gháeltacht féin, má theastaíonn Gaeltacht uainn, agus cainteóirí Gaeilge inti, agus caoi a bheith ag na páistí ar fud na tíre an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim, tá sé riachtannach cabhair eacnamaíochta a thabhairt do na limistéir sin feasta. Ní h-aon mhaith a bheith ag caint faoi náisiúnachas nó Gaelachas nó labhairt na teangan mura bhfuil slí bheatha chompordach sa Gaeltacht do na daoine atá ina gcónaí ann.  Ar a shon sin, sílim féin gur gá breis fuinnimh a chur laistiar de dhéantúis áirithe éagsúla a chur ar bun sa Ghaeltacht. Ní féidir leis na daoine atá ann slí bheatha a bhaint amach dóibh féin ar na feirmeacha beaga atá acu.  Mar sin, is gá slite eile a bheith ann chun cabhair a thabhairt dóibh agus slí amháin is ea tionscail fhóirsteanacha a chur ar bun.  Tá beagán de sin á dhéanamh ach ní doigh liom féin go bhfuil go leor den obair sin ar siúl faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Tá ceantair agus contaetha ar fud na tire ina bhfuil dul ar aghaidh mór déanta ó thaobh monarchana agus tionscail a chur ar siúl.  Is dócha go bhfuil buntáistí áirithe acu siúd.  Bíodh sin mar atá, ba chóir go mbeadh roinnt de chontaetha an Iarthair in ann dul <Col N="1203" /> chun cinn chomh maith agus atá áiteanna eile.  Tá na hoibritheoirí ann i measc muintir na Gaeltachta, tá eolas céirde lámh acu agus tá intleacht thar an gcoiteann ag muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Sílim féin nach bhfuil aon difir idir contaetha an Iarthair agus na contaetha ina bhfuil dul chun cinn tionsclach déanta ach amháin b'fhéidir an fad atá siad ó chalafort Bhaile Átha Cliath, calafort Chorcaí nó calafort Bhéal Feirste nó na calafoirt eile.  Ní deacair an rud é an mí-bhuntáiste sin a cheartú ar dhoigh nó ar dhóigh eile.  Tá obair fhónta á déanamh ag an Roinn seo agus ag na Ranna Stáit eile.  Tá feabhas tagtha sa méid airgid a chuirtear ar fáil don Ghaeltacht agus do na tithe ann. Tá deontais mhaithe á bhfáil ag na daoine ann.  Tá deontais speisialta fá choinne uisce reatha a chur sna tithe.</P>
    <P>Ní chreidim na daoine a deir go bhfuil an iomarca á dhéanamh agus go bhfuil an iomarca á dhéanamh ag an Roinn seo nó ag Ranna éagsúla an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht.  Ní ceart go gcreidfí na daoine a deir an méid sin.  Tá feabhas mór tagtha ar ghnéithe éagsúla de shaol na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht. Rud nach maith linn is ea go n-imíonn cuid de mhuintir na Gaeltachta thar lear ó am go ham i rith na bliana. D'fhéadfaí cuid díobh a choimeád sa bhaile ag obair ar fhoraiseacht sa Ghaeltacht nó cúnamh nó leathchúnamh a thabhairt dóibh i dtionscal na hiascaireachta.  Sin dhá shlí inar féidir obair mhór a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go dtabharfar aire speisialta do na contaetha ina bhfuil Gaeltachta i dtreo go mbeidh ar a gcumas a gcion a dhéanamh sa dul chun cinn tionsclach atá ar siúl ar fud na tíre le roinnt blianta anuas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Department of the Gaeltacht has discovered the service that can be done that part of the country for which it is responsible by An Foras Talúntais and its peat land station at Glenamoy.  I believe it has a very substantial contribution to make to important developments in the Gaeltacht and it is good news that the Minister for the Gaeltacht has woken up to that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker said there is not <Col N="1204" /> much use in urging the people of the Gaeltacht to keep the language alive and to stay in the Gaeltacht if they cannot be comfortable there.  I would suggest to the Minister that one of the greatest discomforts the people of Connemara have to contend with is when they have a large rock sitting in the middle of their garden around which year after year they have to plant their potatoes or cabbage or whatever else they may require for their house.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, having discovered what An Foras Talúntais can do to help the people of the Gaeltacht, he might with advantage revise his attitude to the Department of the Gaeltacht and invite the land rehabilitation project, through their Connemara Scheme, to help in expediting the work of removing the rocks or helping the people to remove the rocks from their small holdings in Connemara, West Donegal and other counties where they constitute a perennial problem to the people trying to earn their living on the small holdings which they have.</P>
    <P>I notice that Scéim na Muc which was introduced here with such a flourish by Deputy Moran when he was Minister for the Gaeltacht does not seem to be very widely availed of. Inasmuch as it duplicates services already available to the Pigs and Bacon Commission, I do not suppose we need be much surprised at that.  I am not going to speak at length on this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I believe the Gaeltacht Department has very valuable work to do.  That has been touched upon at some length by Deputy Lindsay.  But I want to sound a note of warning.  I was Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee for several years and it was my disagreeable duty, as Chairman of that Committee, to review the accounts of the Gaeltacht industries on more than one occasion.  So grave was the confusion then existing that I directed a special meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts to be held in order to try to disentangle the confusion.  In the course of my special inquiries at that time it emerged at one stage that a storekeeper, who was dealing with the stocks then, found that he had not <Col N="1205" /> enough stocks in the sheets to meet what ought to be there, so he simply took the stock sheets out and altered them.  Only after a physical check had been made of the stock was this extraordinary procedure detected.</P>
    <P>I then arranged with the Comptroller and Auditor General that a special audit would be done and, on the conclusion of that audit, some kind of accounts were presented.  Anyone who likes to look at the printed record will find that, as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I regarded the situation as extremely unsatisfactory but, inasmuch as the whole business was now going to be transferred to an independent board, if I was assured that the independent board could be given an opportunity of starting off with a clean sheet and with true and accurate stocks, I was prepared to draw a line under the whole business and wish it well under its new administration. I got the most categorical assurances that, whatever mistakes had been made up to that, every precaution would be taken to see that when Gaeltarra Éireann, the new company, was set up their stocks would be precisely what they truly were, all other relevant assets and liabilities would be precisely and accurately determined, and the new body would get a fresh start on a guaranteed solid basis.  All that can be verified by reference back to the printed reports of the Committee on Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>Now, Gaeltarra Éireann has been proceeding for two years.  The last report we have is for 1959/60 though, so far as I know, the year ends on 31st March.  This is the middle of July.  I do not think it would be extravagant to expect a body like this to be in a position to present its accounts to Dáil Éireann within three months of the close of this financial year.  We have not got the accounts for the year ending 31st March last. The last accounts we have are the accounts for the period ending 31st March, 1960.  On page 5 there is a statement which says there is a loss of £104,835 trading losses for the year.  It was discovered that through a mistake too high a price to the tune of £14,114 was put on the stock on hands at 31st March, 1959. That sum is put in the accounts for the <Col N="1206" /> year 1959-60 as &ldquo;Cailteanas nach de chionn trádála&rdquo; sa Chuntas Sochair agus Dochair.  When one comes to look at the &ldquo;Cuntas Sochair agus Dochair&rdquo; there is no item marked &ldquo;Cailteanas nach de chionn trádála&rdquo;.  There is an item &ldquo;Cailteanas nach mbaineann le trádáil na bliana&rdquo; but the sum referred to in the note in the report is &ldquo;Cailteanas nach de chionn trádála&rdquo;&mdash; £14,114.  The sum mentioned in the &ldquo;Chuntas Sochair agus Dochair&rdquo; is &ldquo;Cailteanas nach mbaineann le trádáil na bliana&rdquo;&mdash;£17,264.</P>
    <P>I may not be a Celtic scholar, nor yet a chartered accountant, but I have a bowing acquaintance with the Irish language and I have some familiarity with simple accounts.  If you state in your report that you propose to show in the profit and loss account a sum of £14,114 representing a mistaken valuation on the stock in the previous year, which you wish to show as an additional loss in this year, it does not seem to me to be a rational procedure to insert an item in the profit and loss account of losses of £17,264 which did not arise from trading in the year.</P>
    <P>There may be an explanation of that but, on the face of the account, it is unsatisfactory and I suggest to the Minister &mdash; I assume he saw the draft accounts before they were finally printed for presentation to the Oireachtas &mdash; that an entry of that kind in accounts presented to him would entitle him to say that such accounts lack clarity at least and there ought to be an explanatory note in the profit and loss account in similar terms to that in the report, and also an explanatory note if the amount included in the profit and loss account does not correspond with the amount referred to in the appropriate paragraph of the annual report.</P>
    <P>This is evidence to me of loose procedure and I do not think any rational firm could approach its shareholders at the end of the year's trading and simply say: &ldquo;We made a mistake of £14,000 in the valuation of our stocks last year and we are going to bring that into this account as a loss accountable otherwise than by trading and so we have put £17,264 in as a loss that did not arise out of trading <Col N="1207" /> last year.&rdquo; I think such a presentation of account would cause uproar at any reasonable general meeting of shareholders and I am astonished that the Comptroller and Auditor General's staff would permit accounts to be presented to the Minister with an obvious discrepancy of that kind.  I am equally astonished that the Minister, acting on behalf of the Oireachtas, did not say to the accountant that these accounts are at least ambiguous and they ought to be clear.</P>
    <P>I should like to see Gaeltarra Éireann succeeding and I want to say quite clearly that if there is anybody in this country who expects Gaeltarra Éireann to earn a profit on its normal trading he is daft.  If Gaeltarra Éireann is charged to make a profit one of the first things you have to do is to dismiss half the employees it has and close down half the centres. I want Gaeltarra Éireann to keep these centres open, to give the people who are living around these centres the work that it is the intention of this Oireachtas they should have, and I am quite prepared to justify to Dáil Éireann some loss on the operations of this business if I am satisfied that we are getting fair value for whatever grants are made.  But, there should be at some stage &mdash; and Gaeltarra Éireann has now had two years to grapple with it &mdash; some effort to introduce elementary efficiency into the operations which it conducts.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that Gaeltarra Éireann labours under the initial disadvantage that owing to the multiplicity of its centres for manufacture it has its raw materials scattered all over the country.  Let nobody underestimate the problem of keeping strict account of raw materials so distributed. It can be done; it should be done but it is not an easy thing to do and I am not prepared to express excessive surprise if sometimes there might be an oversight as to the detailed specification of stocks in remote centres.  But, surely the time has come when the central depot of Gaeltarra Éireann should have a better means of maintaining its stocks than scattering their finished products over <Col N="1208" /> a miscellany of depots all over the city of Dublin and elsewhere.  Is there any central place where Gaeltarra Éireann can gather its stocks when they are received from the various centres where they are manufactured, store them properly and display them effectively for sale and furnish orders with dispatch from readily accessible stocks?  I believe one of the great mistakes that is crippling Gaeltarra Éireann at the present time is the fact that it has not a central sales depot where all its stocks could be maintained under close supervision. Until that is done it is impossible to imagine that there would be any reasonable administration.</P>
    <P>I want to sound this note of warning. We are dealing with public money. I have so strong a natural prejudice in favour of Gaeltarra Éireann and the kind of work that they are doing that one is inclined to lean backwards and say mistakes will occur and difficulties will arise but there is a limit.  The Oireachtas has gone out of its way to give this body the status of a trading company and has gone on to say &ldquo;and if you make reasonable annual losses, we are prepared to accept that without complaint owing to the nature of the work and the kind of employment that you give&rdquo;.  That should not give the board of this company the feeling that loose administration is good enough or that we are not to comment harshly on such a note as appears in the accounts relative to the loss to which I have referred, on the ambiguity that appears in the accounts, which is well calculated to create confusion, and on the fact that these features appear after the Committee on Public Accounts has commented most stringently on similar mistakes that had been made while the industries were directly administered by the Department itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister will make a very great mistake if he does not realise that the report we have today for 1959/60 must cause considerable heart searchings by all those who read it with interest.  He must share the responsibility for the shortcomings that are here revealed and I am bound to tell him that, having all the sympathy that it is possible to <Col N="1209" /> have with the work with which Gaeltarra Éireann is charged, I feel these accounts give rise to grave anxiety that there is still serious mismanagement. I can only hope that when the accounts for 1960/61 come to hand there will be some reassurances in them that the looseness of administration that has characterised them heretofore has disappeared.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to the Minister one suggestion which might help to bring more order into their affairs and that is that they should centralise their sales and stock depot in Dublin and not have their merchandise scattered all over the city, much less in some of the manufacturing depots down the country.  Whatever steps they are requested to take they should be resolutely taken.  Otherwise, the continual disposal of job lots, soiled merchandise, will constitute a recurring cause of comment which will do Gaeltarra Éireann serious harm and give rise to the gravest misgivings in the minds of all of us who are responsible for the public money that is invested annually to meet the losses that arise from the continued maintenance of these industries.</P>

      <P>Tá súil agam ná tógfaidh an tAire orm é má deirim gurab é an rud atá uaim ná fios a bheith agam cá bhfuil an Ghaeltacht. Cuireadh Roinn na Gaeltachta ar bun chun caomhnadh a dhéanamh ar dhaoine fé leith gurab í an Ghaeilge a dteanga dhúchais agus an teanga is mó atá á h-úsáid acu i ngnáth-obair an lae.  Tá mé dall, agus tá na Teachtaí eile sa Dáil dall, ar cad iad na limistéirí ina bhfuil an teanga á labhairt ag na daoine i ngnáth-obair an lae agus cá bhfuil na ceantracha gur ceart agus gur cóir an t-airgead a vótáladh anso a chaitheamh chun feabhas a chur ar a saol.  Tá súil agam ná tógfaidh an tAire orm é nuair adeirim go bhfuil an t-eolas sin ag teastáil uainn, gur gá é bheith againn agus nach bhfuil sé againn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mí Bealtaine chuireas ceist ar an Aire i dtaobh cad tá déanta ag an Roinn ó cuireadh ar bun í chun an t-eolas sin a fháil.  Dúirt an tAire go cneasta liom gur thángadar ar réiteach i dtaobh na limistéirí ar Gaeilgeoirí <Col N="1210" /> mórchuid de na daoine iontu tar éis an Roinn a bhunú.  Ach tá a fhios aige féin go bhfuil cúntas le fáil ó Roinn na Staidrimh adeir nach bhfuil eolas cruinn acu, nach bhfuil eolas cruinn ag an Rialtas.  Má chreideann an Rialtas go bhfuil an t-eolas cruinn sin acu, tá mearbhall orthu mar níl an t-eolas cruinn ann.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire ar an Meastachán rudaí den tsaghas seo i dtaobh beatha na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht, pé áit ina bhfuil sí, gurab íontach an feabhas atá tagtha ar shaol mhuintir na Gaeltachta fé rialú dúchasach.</P>
    <P>Táimid ag caitheamh airgid agus ba chóir fios a bheith againn cá bhfuil an t-airgead sin dhá chaitheamh chun go mbeidh tuiscint chruinn againn go bhfuil maitheas ag teacht as an gcaitheamh airgid sin.  Is mian leis an Dáil an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh mar mhaithe leis an dteanga agus chun an Ghaeltacht a neartú sna limistéirí úd ina bhfuil an teanga ag na daoine ó dhúchas.  Le déanaí bhíomar ag ceiliúradh teacht Naomh Phádraig go hÉirinn.  Nuair a tháinig sé is beag scríobh a bhí ag na daoine ach nuair a thángadar isteach ar an scríobhnóireacht is i nGaeilge a scríobhadh chuile rud.  Ón ndúchas sin a d'fhás an teanga.  I nDún na nGall, i Muigheo, i nGaillimh, i gCiarraí agus i bPort Láirge tá suim acu sa Ghaeilge ó thosach.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta Mac Loingsigh gur ceart go mbeadh gnáth-bhia an cheantair le fáil ag cuairteoirí a thagann go dtí limistéirí na Gaeltachta. Aontaím leis an moladh sin mar sé is mó is cás linn maidir leis an Ghaeltacht agus leis an airgead atá dhá chaitheamh inti ná na daoine a bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu ó dhúchas. Cuireadh an Roinn seo ar bun ceithre nó cúig bhliain ó shoin chun an meon sin a chothú.  Tá súil agam nach dtógfaidh an tAire orm é nuair a fhiafraím de céard é an limistéar ina bhfuil an teanga dhá labhairt anois ó dhúchas.  Nuair a chuir mé an cheist sin air i mí na Bealtaine ní raibh a fhios aige.  Níl a fhios ag an Rialtas; níl a fhios ag an Dáil agus níl a fhios ag éinne.  Do cuireadh fiosrachán ar bun i 1956 faoi na <Col N="1211" /> daoine atá ag labhairt Gaeilge ó dhúchas.  De thairbhe an fhiosracháin sin agus nuair a bhí aithbhreithniú déanta, bhí na figiúirí bun ós cionn leis na figiúirí a fuaireamar ón Rialtas roimhe sin.  Bhí difríocht de 50 faoin gcéad i dtaobh an limistéir agus 30 faoin gcéad i dtaobh na ndaoine a bhfuil eolas ar an dteanga acu.</P>
    <P>Níl aon eolas san ráiteas a thug an tAire don Dáil inniu faoi na limistéirí go dtugtar an Ghaeltacht orthu. Níor thug sé aon eolas dúinn ach oiread faoi na h-áiteanna a bhfuil súil aige an t-airgead seo a chaitheamh iontu.  Dúirt sé agus measaim go bhfuil sé dáiríre:</P>
    <P>Is beag teach scoile sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht go mb'éigean é a dhúnadh ceal dóthain tinrimh &mdash; ach b'éigin cuid acu a fhairsingiú de bharr méadú líon na ngasúr.</P>
    <P>Dúirt sé gur beag limistéar inar gá scoil a dhúnadh ceal tinrimh.  Céard iad na limistéirí sin; céard iad na scoileanna agus cé mhéid acu atá ann?  B'fhéidir gur fearr dom an cheist sin a chur ar an Aire Oideachais. Dúirt an tAire freisin:</P>
    <P>Scaipeann na cuairteoirí seo a lán airgid ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Ní bheidh mé sásta go mbeidh chuile theaghlach sa nGaeltacht ag coinneál foghlaimeoirí, Samhradh i ndiaidh Samhraidh, agus cuid mhaith acu á gcoinneál i rith na bliana chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go raibh an tAire dáiríre nuair a dúirt sé é sin ach cuirfidh mé an cheist air arís.  Cá bhfuil na limistéirí agus cá bhfuil na tithe ar a bhfuil sé ag caint?  Má tá an t-am agus an t-eolas aige, b'fhéidir go dtabharfaidh sé freagra ar na ceisteanna sin dom.  Is beag iad na ceantair ina bhfuil an teanga dhá labhairt go coitinn sna laethe seo. Séard tá mé ag iarraidh a fháil amach ná an bhfuilimid ag baint tairbhe as an airgead seo atáimid ag soláthar don Roinn seo.  An bhfuíl an t-airgead seo ag déanamh an maitheas is mó is féidir leis do na daoine agus do na limistéirí a thuilleann é?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> Níl ach cúpla focal eile le rá agam ar an Meastachán seo.  Nuair a chuir mé na ceisteanna úd ar an Aire i mí na Bealtaine dúirt sé go ndéanfadh sé an t-eolas a sheoladh chugam.  Chuir sé léarscáil chugam ach níl maitheas dá laghad san léarscáil sin.  Níl ann ach spota dúigh ar phíosa páipéir. Níl sé beo.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil scoileanna leagtha amach uirthi, oifigí phoist agus áiteanna eile. Ach tá an Roinn ar bun anois le cúig bhliain anuas agus táim cinnte nach bhfuil athrú ab fhiú trácht air tagtha ar an gceist.  Tá foireann de chainteoirí dúchais ag obair san Roinn agus dúirt an tAire liom ar an 13ú de mhí na Bealtaine seo caite go bhfuil obair mhór dhá déanamh acu.  Ach cén toradh atá ar a saothar?  An aon íonadh é go bhfuilimid ag lorg an eolais seo ón Aire agus an méid airgid atá se ag iarraidh orainn a sholáthar don obair seo.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Kerry County Council made provision in the rates for the years 1960/61 and 1961/62 for the cost of the extension of the dental services available to school-children in Caherciveen, Castle-island, Dingle, Kenmare and Killorglin.</P>
      <P>The Council proposes that this service should be provided by private dentists remunerated on a sessional basis, i.e., on the same basis as already obtains for the provision of a similar service in the larger towns of Killarney, Listowel and Tralee.  Now that the Council has agreed to the appointment of a Senior Dental Surgeon whose duties will include the co-ordination and supervision of the dental services in the county, I propose to approve of this extension.  This and the other dental services in the county will be subject to review when the Senior Dental Surgeon has taken up duty and has had an opportunity of studying and reporting on the dental services in County Kerry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That will suit me.</P>
      <P>Following is the reply:</P>
      <P>I have seen the Press report of the interview referred to by the Deputy.  Normally, I would regard myself as precluded from divulging in reply to a Dáil Question any information about the private affairs of a commercial concern.  In view of inaccuracies contained in the statement by the Chairman of the Company as published, however, I feel obliged in the public interest to put the matter in its proper perspective.</P>
      <P>The Company's ideas as mooted to the Department of Industry and Commerce in 1958 related to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) the development of a free port in the Shannon estuary;</P>
      <P>(ii) the transhipment of ores and oil, using vessels of 100,000 tons and over;</P>
      <P>(iii) the provision of a terminal for giant ocean passenger liners, and</P>
      <P>(iv) the development of an industrial hinterland.</P>
      <P>It transpired that the Company had made no detailed examination of the practicability or economic prospects of their ideas.  Nevertheless, they indicated that they would require from the Government such far-reaching concessions as (a) power to acquire land compulsorily; (b) exemption from Customs and Excise duties for 99 years; (c) exemption from Irish taxation for 66 years and (d) exemption of the proposed port area from the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested to the company that they should, as a first step, examine the economic merits of their ideas and that for this purpose they should consider engaging the services of an economic consultant or research organisation.  At the same time, however, it was pointed out to them that the question of establishing a Free Port in this country had been considered by the Port and Harbours Tribunal, 1930 and again by an inter-Departmental Committee in 1945.  It had <Col N="1226" /> emerged from these investigations that the cost would be very substantial and enquiries made both at home and abroad had suggested that the extent to which Free Port facilities here would be utilised was highly problematical. The Government had no reason to believe that the situation had altered in any respect and that still remains the position.</P>
    <P>The Company subsequently commissioned a London research organisation to carry out a survey.  The relevant report indicated that none of the commerical interests approached in the course of the survey was prepared to say that it would use a port on the estuary.</P>
    <P>However, some months afterwards, in February, 1960, the Company claimed at a meeting in the Department of Transport and Power that they had now established the feasibility of:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the transhipment of ore using very large vessels to Shannon and smaller vessels from there to Europe;</P>
    <P>(b) the transhipment of grain by the Company themselves;</P>
    <P>(c) the establishment of an oil refinery at Shannon and transhipment from the suggested refinery.</P>
    <P>They also had in mind:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(d) a dry dock for vessels up to 150,000 tons;</P>
    <P>(e) the possible development of steel works; and</P>
    <P>(f) the development of industries in the hinterland.</P>
    <P>The cost alone of the pier and associated facilities and the dry dock would, I understand, be of the order of £14 &mdash; £15 million.  No estimate was mentioned of the cost of the other items &mdash; the oil refinery, the steel works and the miscellaneous hinterland industries.</P>
    <P>In a formal written statement to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Chairman of the Company claimed that a number of industrial and commercial concerns, mainly in the oil and iron ore and steel industries, had <Col N="1227" /> expressed interest in the Company's proposals.  Enquiries made at my direction to the oil and iron ore concerns named in this statement elicited the information that they had expressed no interest whatsoever in the estuary ideas.</P>
    <P>Although no firm proposals for industrial or other development at the Shannon estuary had been received from the Company or any evidence of outside support for the Company's ideas, the Government, before taking a final decision on the Company's representations, appointed an inter-Departmental Committee to meet representatives of the Company for the purpose of obtaining, in a precise way, such information concerning the Company's proposals and such evidence of support for those proposals as, in the opinion of the Committee, the Government would require before considering the question of signifying their approval of the proposals generally and before deciding on any concessions or facilities that might be extended to the Company by the State.</P>
    <P>The Committee met representatives of the Company on 29th April, 1960 and submitted an interim report to me on 13th May, 1960 to the effect that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) the Shannon Estuary Company Ltd. had formulated no proposals designed to give practical effect to their various ideas for the development of the Estuary and the establishment there of major industries;</P>
    <P>(ii) the company had produced no evidence that their ideas for the development of the Estuary were practicable;</P>
    <P>(iii) the Company stated that all their plans were now subject to modification &mdash; they now attached considerable importance to general cargo and no longer regarded the transhipment of either ore or oil as essential to the viability of the project;</P>
    <P>(iv) the Company accepted the need for the formulation of firm and precise proposals and for the production of positive evidence of <Col N="1228" /> support by external commercial and financial interests;</P>
    <P>(v) the Company had agreed, in effect, that no acceptable evidence had been adduced in support of their repeated claims that the project had attracted the interest and support of external commercial interests; and</P>
    <P>(vi) the Company had accepted the position that, pending the submission of formal proposals, the Committee could make no progress.</P>
    <P>On 5th July, 1960 Mr. O'Brien was interviewed in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  He mentioned that he had discussed the estuary scheme in Geneva with the Venezuelan Minister for Labour (Dr. Solis) who expressed interest in the project and that the suggestion was being pursued through the Venezuelan Embassy in London.  I would have been ready to examine on their merits any sound proposals put forward by the Shannon Estuary Co. Ltd. for the handling of Venezuelan ore at Shannon but no such proposals have since been put to me.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Brien also intimated at the interview of 5th July, 1960 that because of internal organisation difficulties the Company were making a fresh start with their proposals.  They had engaged a firm of consultants and a panel of experts in London to prepare a detailed assessment of the whole estuary project.  Mr. O'Brien said that the consultants' report would be in the nature of a blue print and that the Company would get in touch with the Committee when the report was available.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report was made available to the Committee on 7th November, 1960.  It contained preliminary proposals, expressed as such, for a provisional layout of portal facilities in the Shannon estuary, roughly estimated to cost £8,500,000. The report examined very briefly the following considerations which, it stated, favoured development:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) the natural physical advantages of the Estuary as a site for a harbour;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> (ii) the availability of labour in Ireland;</P>
    <P>(iii) the availability of suitable riverside sites in the Estuary;</P>
    <P>(iv) existing Government assistance by way of grants and tax concessions for the development of industry.</P>
    <P>From these considerations, the cossultants compiled a list of potential industries which, the report stated, &ldquo;could with advantage be located in the estuary&rdquo;.  The report did not deal with costing, marketing or financial aspects nor was it suggested by whom the industries might be financed and established.  No examination was made of the merits of the basic general ideas for the development of the estuary or of the crucial question of the economics of transhipment.</P>
    <P>At Mr. O'Brien's request, the Committee met the Shannon Estuary Company on 9th November, 1960.  The Company claimed that the consultants' report made it clear that Shannon had advantages which made it worth developing as a major port and that, with the report, they were now in a position to go out and &ldquo;sell&rdquo; Shannon if they could be given an indication of the support of the Government for the project.  They indicated that they were now concerned not so much with transhipment as with a terminal port having a large steel industry and all ancillary activities.  They said that they were satisfied from their discussions with potential users that their ideas were fully justified.  They were not in a position, however, they said, to produce evidence of definite interest by anybody or of the preparedness of organisations to finance the proposal, without a prior indication of Government approval, guarantees or concessions.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in the way of granting exceptional tax and other concessions in the estuary area to the exclusion of other industry-seeking areas in the country were explained again to the Company, who were, of course, aware of the grants and tax concessions available in the normal way for industrial promotion in the estuary area and elsewhere throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> It was explained to the Company with regard to their request for treatment on the same basis as the Shannon Free Airport Development Company that this Company was established for the specific purpose of absorbing possible unemployment at Shannon Airport due to the advent of jet aircraft and developing the Airport's air freight potential to the full by exploiting the advantages of the existing free airport as a site for industries using air transport and on the basis of precise industrial projects.</P>
    <P>The Committee intimated to the Company that an early report would be made to the Government if the Company would furnish a statement setting out (i) their observations on the consultants' report; (ii) a statement of their proposals arising out of their consideration of the report; (iii) the nature of the interest displayed by third parties; and (iv) an indication of the minimum by way of a statement of Government approval or encouragement they required at this stage to help them to develop interest in their ideas.  The Company agreed to do so.</P>
    <P>No such statement was furnished by the Company but on 15th December, 1960, the Chairman sent a letter to the Committee stated to be the Company's appreciation of the estuary project at that stage.  They acknowledged the position (i) that the port idea would be justifiable only if an industry could be established in the estuary to make use of the facilities; (ii) that there was no immediate prospect of the establishment of an oil refinery, and (iii) that the Company's proposals depended entirely on their ability to produce even one substantial user capable of justifying the establishment of the proposed port; they had in mind ore smelting and steel making and the transhipment of ore or processed ore.</P>
    <P>The letter asked that, in the event of the Company producing an industrial project for location at the estuary and of the Government being satisfied that it was an economic project, they should be granted the following concessions:</P>
    <P>(i) that the Company be appointed the Port Authority (for the Shannon <Col N="1231" /> estuary area including Foynes but not including Limerick);</P>
    <P>(ii) that the tax concession given to Port Authorities be extended to the Port Authority to be set up at the Shannon Estuary;</P>
    <P>(iii) that a Customs free area, to be defined, be established; and</P>
    <P>(iv) that concessions similar to those offered by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company should be made available to industries establishing themselves in the Shannon Estuary area.</P>
    <P>The Committee, having considered this request, made their final report to me.  On consideration of the report and the recommendations made in it, which the Government accepted, the Company were informed by letter dated 9th March, 1961:</P>
    <P>(i) that the Government, in pursuance of their declared policy to support to the maximum extent any worthwhile proposals for industrial development, have given careful and sympathetic consideration to the request by the Company for the grant of exceptional facilities and concessions to enable them to pursue their ideas for the establishment of a harbour in the Estuary as the basis for the possible creation there of an industrial estate;</P>
    <P>(ii) that in the absence of any evidence</P>
    <P>(a) that the creation of such a harbour would be a viable undertaking,</P>
    <P>(b) of specific proposals for financing the developments from organisations which are satisfied of the soundness of the project, and</P>
    <P>(c) that any external interests would be prepared to use the harbour facilities which might be provided in the Estuary, or would undertake the development of industrial projects in the Estuary area in association with such harbour facilities, or otherwise,</P>
    <P>the Government would not be prepared to consider the grant to the <Col N="1232" /> Company in the Shannon Estuary of facilities and concessions of a character not available (save in the exceptional circumstances of Shannon Airport) for any other area in the country, or to any other commercial Company, under the existing provisions for the promotion of industrial development; and</P>
    <P>(iii) that, nevertheless, the Government regard as commendable the desire of the Company to promote industrial development in the Shannon Estuary and that, if any of the industrial developments envisaged by the Company emerge as practicable projects, they would be given the most sympathetic consideration under the existing provisions for encouraging new industries; and furthermore in such event, that the Government would also be prepared, in principle, to sponsor measures to authorise any special harbour arrangements which could be shown to be necessary and justified.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise, therefore, that the Company have been informed that if they put forward practicable proposals for industrial development in the Shannon estuary area, these proposals would be given the most sympathetic consideration under the existing provisions for encouraging new industries and that any harbour arrangements that were necessary would be sponsored.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with some of the statements in the report in the <i>Irish Times</i>.  The Chairman of the Shannon Estuary Company Ltd. is quoted as saying that the Government adopted an attitude to their proposal very different from that adopted to many projects sponsored by foreigners. It is alleged that the foreigners were not compelled to the &ldquo;proof&rdquo; stage to the same extent.  I am not aware of any other case where the promoters have asked the Government to declare their support, even provisionally, and to promise quite exceptional facilities for industrial proposals until these proposals had, at least, been defined. It is a normal requirement in connection with the presentation of any proposal that facts and figures and convincing evidence of the practicability <Col N="1233" /> of the project and precise information as to the sources of and the amount of capital available be furnished.  Until such is done no consideration can be given to the grant of any facilities.  In this case I have been given no indication as to where the very large amount of capital which would be needed for the establishment of a harbour, dry dock, etc. is to come from, no indication as to who, if anybody, would use the port for transhipment purposes, no evidence of the economics of transhipment at Shannon, and no indication as to who would sponsor and finance the heavy industries which the Company consider would be necessary to justify a port of the order visualised.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Brien complains particularly that the Government's failure to openly support the Company's ideas is preventing the development of the interest and sympathy of many British and U.S. concerns.  The fact is that the policy of the Irish Government to welcome and, through grants, tax concessions, etc., to encourage in every possible way the development of industrial proposals has been widely publicised in Britain, the Continent and America. Even against this background of Government encouragement, I must repeat that Mr. O'Brien has not so far produced evidence of interest by anybody or of the readiness of any industrial or commercial organisation to be associated with his Company's ideas.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Company were cautioned against premature and injudicious press publicity and in the light of the facts given in my foregoing review of the whole case the reason for sounding this note of caution will be obvious to Deputies.</P>

When the Committee has made its recommendations, the Government will then consider what form the assistance will take.</P>

      <P>May I ask a further question because I think there is a good deal of misunderstanding about this matter?  As the Minister will recall, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in recent speeches have indicated that industrialists in this country should put their house in order in preparation for the forthcoming Common Market situation. They referred to rationalisation, integration and specialisation and indicated in that context that the Government would be prepared to assist them.  Does the Minister now suggest that no assistance will be forthcoming unless and until some commission has decided it is necessary?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The very purpose of setting up the Committee on Industrial Organisation is to decide what, if any, assistance will be required.  As I have said, it would be premature for me to indicate what form that assistance will take, but it is clear, since that Committee has been set up, whatever form of assistance is found necessary will be provided.</P>

      <P>Land Commission statistics are not compiled by reference to districts such as North Tipperary.  In relation to Co. Tipperary as a whole, however, the information requested is set out in a tabular statement which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report.</P>

      <P>The position regarding lands in the possession of the Land Commission is subject to constant fluctuation, depending on progress on intake and allotment of land.  Apart from turbary, small residues of allotted estates and lands surrendered by migrants, estates at present on hands for division in County Tipperary are as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are no proposals under consideration in my Department for the carrying out of repairs to the five schools mentioned by the Deputy.  The question of replacing these schools by new buildings is, however, receiving attention and the present position in each case is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Aughleam:</i> My Department has sanctioned a grant towards the cost of the erection of a new school.  I understand that arrangements are being made locally to have a well sunk to provide a water supply for sanitation purposes.  When the Commissioners of Public Works are assured that an adequate water supply is available, preparation of working drawings and a specification for the new school will be undertaken.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Kilmore Erris:</i> Reverend Manager has been asked to obtain a site for a new school to replace the present building, but a site has not yet been offered.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Corclough:</i> A suitable site has been offered for a new school at Corclough. The Commissioners of Public Works have been asked to prepare sketch plans for the proposed new school.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Fishing Station and Shanaghee:</i> It is proposed to erect a new central school at Aughaglasheen to replace these two schools.  My Department has sanctioned a grant towards the cost of the new school and arrangements for its erection are being made by the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Commissioners expect to be in a position to invite tenders in the near future.</P>

      <P>This question appeared on the Honours Leaving Certificate Geography Paper.  A high standard is required of those who take that paper.  The paper is divided into sections.  Each section carries three questions, one of which must be answered.  The question to which the Deputy refers had an alternative.  In that section therefore there were four questions, one of which had to be done.  There was no question of a candidate failing the exam because of not knowing this region in Yugoslavia or the meaning of the word &ldquo;Karst.&rdquo; It creates a wrong impression to maintain that candidates might fail because of this particular question. There were three other questions from which they could have picked in that section.  Sometimes some obscurity exists in questions, but examiners always take that into account when the scripts are examined.</P>

      <P>Not being a Gaelic speaker I have very little to say except that I welcome the translation of the Minister's speech.  I ask the Minister now, when questions are put to him in English and he replies in Irish, would he go further and translate the reply also?  When a question is put in Irish, while he may answer it in Irish, if requested he ought also to answer the question in English.  In other words, I am asking the Minister to help those in the House who do not understand the language but who are entitled to know what is being said because they may want to put a supplementary question.  If they do not understand the answer in the first place they are not able to put the supplementary question.  Does the Minister follow my point?</P>

      <P>The rule that has been established here by my predecessors and which I followed is that if the Deputy who puts down a question which is answered in Irish, as is the established rule, does not understand the answer in Irish and says so and requests a translation in English, he gets it immediately but it has never been the practice to allow anybody to make the request other than the Deputy who put down the original question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone should know what is being said.  That is what we are here for.  Apart from that, although I am rather cynical about all this Gaelic business, simply because certain people are trying to capitalise on it, I do support the preservation of the Gaeltacht because it is a sort of show piece.  While stating that, I still think, as Deputy Dillon has said, that we should scrutinise every account, that we should not pour money in there because to do so would leave the whole business open to abuse.  There are too many people looking for cushy jobs. If they think we are prepared to be over-liberal because it is the Gaeltacht, there will be too many duds there making a good thing out of it. We must look for efficiency and therefore we ought to scrutinise every account and take note of the Taoiseach's remarks that industries that cannot stand up to the Common Market should get out.  That should also apply to people in charge of industries and enterprises in the Gaeltacht. If they cannot make some kind of fist of it they should get out.  There should be no cushy jobs for certain people.  We want efficiency and we want results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not enlarge on the subject because the Gaeltacht is not my area. There are few of my people who know the language.  They find it hard enough to preserve themselves, let alone preserve the language.  Otherwise, I am all in favour of preserving the language in the Gaeltacht.  It will be always a good <Col N="1253" /> show piece but as to whether it serves any other purpose or not I have my doubts.</P>

      <P>If we are not to make some effort to use the language officially then it is not going to make progress.  Deputy Sherwin ought to be a little more careful than to suggest that matters pertaining to the Gaeltacht and the language revival must <i>ab initio</i> be suspect.</P>

      <P>Níor cheart é sin a rá ach oiread.  Ní féidir le muintir na Gaeltachta &ldquo;show piece&rdquo; a choinneáil ar mhaithe le tourists agus eile.  Tá siad ag iarraidh maireachtáil agus támuid ag iarraidh cuidiu leo maireachtáil.  Ní féidir an Ghaeltacht a choimead beo mar &ldquo;show piece&rdquo;. Ní mhairfidh sí mar &ldquo;show piece&rdquo;. Támuid ag iarraidh a bhfuil fágtha den Ghaeltacht a choinneáil agus an teanga a scaipeadh ar fúd na tíre.  Sin é an t-aon bhealach inar féidir an Ghaeilge a shábháil.

It depends on how well we are able to get it spoken in Dublin, Cork and outside the Gaeltacht whether the Gaeltacht will be saved.</P>

'Sé seo na rudaí a dúirt an Teachta Ó Diolúin mar Chathairleach na Coiste sin:</P>
      <P>I think I should direct the attention of the Committee to the fact that it is past events with which we are now concerned.  We are not concerned with suggesting a superior practice for the future, because all this business has been transferred from the Department of the Gaeltacht to the new Board, who are hereafter responsible.  I am bound to say that my experience corresponds exactly with Mr. Ó Braonáin's observation, that there would ordinarily be a yard allowed in a piece of cloth and that that is, in fact, a conservative estimate of the allowance on a 72-yard piece. That reduces this deficit to 4,000 yards and, so far as I know, that would not be at all an unreasonable allowance for cutting patterns, where a manufacturing concern is dealing with the wholesale trade, the retail trade and the making up trade and with an effort, successful in varying degrees, to promote a foreign trade, where agents have to be treated on a very liberal basis in order to provide every facility for someone who is trying to break into a new foreign market.</P>

      <P>Sin cuntas amháin i dtaobh na caimiléireachta a dubhairt sé go raibh ar bun i nGaeltarra Éireann agus sin é an míniú is ceart a thabhairt air, agus tá sé tugtha i bhfad níos fearr ag an Teachta Ó Diolúin ná mar is féidir liomsa é a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, chualamar go raibh caillteanas de £100,000, agus bhí sin ann.  Bhí caillteanas i bhfad anall ag Gaeltarra Éireann, agus arís ba mhaith liom focal eile ón Bhfreasúr a thabhairt mar thacaíocht do Bhord Ghaeltarra Éireann agus sé sin go bhfuil na tionscail seo scaipthe ar fuaid na Gaeltachta in áiteanna iargcúlta sa tír agus tá sé thar a bheith deacair iad a reachtáil fé mar is féidir le dream ghnótha go bhfuil a gcuid imeachtaí ar fad fé aon díon tighe amháin.  Bhí suim ag dreamanna áirithe gnótha sa tír seo ins na monarchain agus eile atá ag Gaeltarra Éireann ach fuair mé amach dá dtagaidís ina seilbh go ndúnfaidís beagnach gach ceann aca, agus dubhairt dream amháin aca nárbh fhéidir ach le dream philanthropic, mar a dubhairt sé féin, a leithéid a choinneáil ar bun.  Is deacair ionaid fhostaíochta a choinneáil ar siúl ar chósta thiar Thír Chonaill, Chonamara agus Mhuigheó. Ach tá sin á dhéanamh ag Gaeltarra Éireann.  In ainneoin na ndeacrachtaí agus in ainneoin na n-ionsaí atá á n déanamh go mí-chórach, tá scéal fábnarach le tuairisciú againn.  Níl sé le feiceáil ins na cuntaisí don bhliain 1959-60 agus níl ach beagán de le feiceáil ins na cuntaisí don bhliain 1960-61, ach san chéad cheathramha den bhliain airgeadais reatha tá an méid seo le rá ag leathanach 22 den Tuarascáil ar an <i>Programme for Economic Expansion for six months to the 31st March</i>, 1961:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gaeltarra Eireann's exports of handwoven tweeds, particularly to Great Britain, have shown a marked increase in the past six months as <Col N="1256" /> compared with exports for the corresponding period a year ago.  Handknit production has continued to expand and the number of knitters now employed by the Board has risen to the record figure of 600.  Special steps are being taken to develop export markets in Britain and the U.S.A. for these goods.</P>
    <P>Sin é an scéal suas go dtí deireadh Márta i mbliana ach tá an scéal i bhfad Éireann níos fábharaighe don chéad trí mhí den bhliain airgeadais reatha, agus tá £30,000 san mbreis thar mar a bhí ann an tréimhse céanna anuraidh.  Leis an eolas sin tá fonn orm Gaeltarra Éireann a fhágáil mar atá sé.  Táim lán tsásta go bhfuil sé ar bhealach a leasa.  Ba mhaith liom anois, ós rud é go bhfuil fonn gáiridhe ar an Teachta Mac Loingsigh, a rá leis gur aisteach gur thagair sé do dhuine amháin a d'eirigh as a chuid fostaíochta dá thoil féin.  Chuir sé i leith an duine sin gurbh é fé ndear an chailleanais a bhí ann san bhliain 1958-59.  Táim ag rá anois leis an Teachta nach raibh an fear sin in a bhainisteoir annsin an bhliain sin beag nó mór.</P>

Bhí ceisteanna freisin ina thaobh seo ón Teachta Mac Loingsigh ina oráid inniu.  Séard a thárla ansin ná go raibh oifigí i gCuan Ealaí i gCo.  Mhuigheo ag déanamh suas na stoc-chuntaisí i gcóir árachais agus tháinig siad ar an bhfigiúir seo £14,000.  Ar bhealach éigin, nuair a bhíodar, níos deireannaí, ag déanamh suas an ghnáth-stoc-chuntas greamaíodh a nóta árachais tré dhearmad don stoc-chuntas seo agus is mar sin a thárla go raibh an figiúir £14,000 dúbalta.  Ceartaíodh an earráid sna cuntaisí le haghaidh 1960-61.  Is furasta earráid mar sin a dhéanamh in aon oifig.</P>
      <P>D'fhiafraigh an Teachta Ó Diolúin ansin faoi fhigiúir cheartaithe, £17,000, sa bhliain 1960-61.  Sé an míniú atá agam air sin ná go raibh sean-chuntas cuistiméara ann de £3,000 a ghlan Gaeltarra Éireann sa bhliain 1960-61. Sé an £3,000 sin atá mar dhifríocht idir an £17,000 agus an £14,000.</P>

Más rud é nach raibh na tionscail seo againn agus dá bhfanfadh na daoine sin ina gcónaí sa mbaile in Éirinn bheadh siad ag fáil bhuntáiste leasa shoisialaigh a thiocfadh suas go méid an chaillteanais.  Ar an ábhar sin, is fearr i bhfad go mbeadh an caillteanas seo againn agus na daoine ag obair san am gcéanna.  Ba mhaith liom béim a leagan ar an bhfeabhsú de £30,000 sa gcéad ráithe i mbliana thar mar bhí sa tréimhse céanna anuraidh.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur air i mBéarla.  Does he approve of the practice of stating in the report of Gaeltarra Éireann that a sum of £14,114 has been put into the accounts of 1959/60 as losses not on the head of trading and then when you turn to the Profit and Loss account which the Report says contains that item you find &ldquo;losses that do not arise from <Col N="1260" /> the trading of the year, £17,264&rdquo;. When I direct his attention to that ambiguity, he is obliged to say the figure of £17,264 does not correspond with the figure mentioned in the Report which contains a further figure for £3,000 of bad debts.  All I am complaining of to the Minister is that surely that is bad practice.  Is not that ambiguity in the Report and unless somebody asks the Minister by way of a motion such as we have down here today, who could know how the difference arose between the figure of £17,264 and £14,114?  How can the Minister justify that kind of accounting?</P>

    <P>The total of these is £25,778,900. I shall deal briefly with the three Estimates in sequence.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare a net sum of £494,900 is provided to meet the salaries and other administration expenses borne on the Vote.  The main variations, as compared with the previous year's Vote, are a decrease of £20,000 for salaries and wages under Subhead A, an increase of £48,340 for Insured Persons' Medical Certificates under Subhead C and an increase of £41,470 under the Appropriations in Aid Subhead.</P>
    <P>The provision of £1,252,000 for salaries and wages under Subhead A shows a decrease of £20,000 on the previous year's provision.  The total amount of the decrease on the Subhead would have been about £36,000 but for a new provision in this year's Estimate of £16,000 to cover the remuneration of staff for the Old Age (Contributory) Pensions Section.</P>
    <P>The increase under Subhead C of £48,340 on last year's provision of £114,720 for Insured Persons' Medical <Col N="1263" /> Certificates is due to an increase in the fees payable to medical certifiers in respect of certificates issued on or after 1st October last.</P>
    <P>As regards the Appropriations in Aid Subhead, as Deputies are aware all the expenses incurred by the Department in administering the scheme of social insurance are repayable by the Social Insurance Fund and are brought to credit of this Vote as Appropriations in Aid.  The increase of £41,470 in the estimated receipts to the subhead is largely the result of the increased cost of insured persons' medical certificates already mentioned, which, as an expense of administration of the insurance scheme, is recoverable from the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>The Estimate of £6,358,000 for Social Insurance for 1961-62 is £1,691,000 greater than the Vote for 1960-61 when the Supplementary Estimate of £412,000 in 1960-61 is taken into account.  The increase of £2,103,000 shown in the Estimate Volume is not now correct.  The Volume was printed before the Supplementary Estimate was passed.</P>
    <P>The increase of £1,691,000 occurs on Subhead A of the Estimate.  In that subhead provision is made for payment by the Exchequer into the Social Insurance Fund of the estimated amount by which the expenditure of the Fund will exceed its income in 1961-62.  The estimated amount is £6,321,000.</P>
    <P>The estimated expenditure of the Fund in 1961-62 is £17,336,000 made up as follows: &mdash;</P>

    <P>The estimated income of the Social Insurance Fund in 1961-62 is <Col N="1264" /> £11,015,000.  It consists of £10,288,000 from employment contributions, £612,000 in income from investments of the Fund and £115,000 in receipts under Reciprocal Arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer contribution to the Fund for 1961-62 under Subhead A is £1,691,000 more than the corresponding provision for 1960-61.  This is the net result of variations in the items constituting the expenditure and income of the Fund.</P>
    <P>On the expenditure side, the main increases are £3,620,000 on Old Age (Contributory) Pensions, £867,000 on Widows' and Orphans' (Contributory) Pensions, £337,000 on Disability Benefit, £142,000 on Unemployment Benefit and £58,000 on Administration Costs.</P>
    <P>The main variation on the income side is an additional sum of £3,338,000 from employment contributions.</P>
    <P>The increases on benefit expenditure in 1961-62, as compared with 1960-61, are almost entirely due to the new Old Age (Contributory) Pensions and the increased rates and improvements in the other benefits effected by the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960, which became operative from 2nd January, 1961.  The aggregate increases of approximately £5,000,000 under these heads in 1961-62, as compared with 1960-61, represent the difference in estimated cost for the whole of 1961-62 as compared with the provision for the March quarter of 1960-61.</P>
    <P>The estimated total cost for 1961-62 of the Old Age (Contributory) Pensions and the increases in rates and improvements in the other benefits amounts to approximately £6,956,000, of which £4,660,000 is in respect of Old Age (Contributory) Pensions.</P>
    <P>The estimated increase from employment contributions in 1961-62 due to the increases in the contribution rates which became effective on 2nd January, 1961 and to increased employment is £4,288,000.</P>
    <P>As regards Social Assistance, the net provision of £18,926,000 for this Estimate in 1961-62 shows a decrease of £2,428,000 on the previous year's <Col N="1265" /> Vote of £21,354,000.  Of this decrease, £2,300,000 arises on the Old Age Pensions Subhead and £115,000 on the provision for Unemployment Assistance.</P>
    <P>The decrease of £2,300,000 on the Old Age Pensions Subhead is mainly due to a reduction of nearly 40,000 in the number of non-contributory old age pensioners because of their becoming eligible for contributory old age pensions or contributory widows' pensions under the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960.  The decrease would have been greater but for the cost of the increased rates of pension and other improvements under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1960, which took effect from the beginning of August, 1960 and cost £489,000 and also a slight upward trend in the number of pensioners which accounted for £67,000.</P>
    <P>The estimate for Unemployment Assistance for the current financial year is £115,000 lower than the vote for this service in 1960-61.  The beneficiaries under this service also received increases in assistance rates and other improvements effected by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1960, estimated to cost £132,000 in the current year.  Owing to the continued improvement in the unemployment position, however, the provision of £1,110,000 for the current year covers this extra cost of £132,000 as well as allowing for the decrease of £115,000 on the vote for this service last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare in introducing his Estimate this year has not gone into the detail that one normally experiences in examining the annual provision for the Social Welfare Department.  I suppose this is contributed to by the fact that during the current year there were a number of changes effected in the social welfare code and the House had more than one opportunity of examining the field of social welfare. But there is one thing clear from the introductory statement of the Minister to which the House has just listened and it is that the measures that were taken on an earlier occasion are beginning to take shape and that the savings <Col N="1266" /> that he reports clearly indicate that the prognostications of those who examined the situation when measures were brought in transferring charges from the normal old age pension fund on to the contributory side of it, are now being fulfilled.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his statement, said that the estimated income of the social insurance fund for 1961-62 is as high as £11,015,000.  This, in comparison with what the State has been devoting to the assistance of these classes is a very formidable sum.  It has been achieved by the fact that &mdash; the Minister I think referred to a figure of 40,000 &mdash; old age pensioners who formerly were a charge on the normal taxation of the State have now been transferred to the category where those in insurable employment and those who employ them are now being called upon each week for the increased contribution required for stamps to meet charges formerly borne by the central exchequer.</P>
      <P>It is true, as Deputies realise, that the relief is not confined only to this Estimate but that the Estimate for Defence will also be able to show a considerable reduction in the amount of special allowances chargeable to that Estimate in consequence of the transfer of so many who were formerly receiving special allowances.  They will also be transferred to the category now catered for under social insurance.  The Minister, of course, even in the very short statement he made, could be expected to work in some window-dressing.  He referred to the continued improvement in the employment position as being responsible for the fact that he was in a happier position than he might otherwise have been.  That is the cuckoo in the nest attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have succeeded in disposing of many embarrassments to the Social Welfare Department by the development of emigration, by the fact that over the last four or five years so many thousands of people who would normally be a charge on social assistance or social insurance have fled the country.  We all know of them in our home localities.  Nowadays when a man or a woman is out of work they <Col N="1267" /> do not wait for any benefit from the Minister's Department; they go out of the country.  The Minister has succeeded, like the cuckoo, in ridding himself of the weaklings.  He cannot, therefore, take too much solace from the fact that he has been compelled to increase the benefits for those who are left.</P>
    <P>It is true also that these benefits to which the Minister adverted have been minimised by the increased cost of living, particularly in the case of the male recipients of social welfare.  Even the humble plug of tobacco gets frequent cracks and on the taxation side these people have been seriously affected by the Government's economic policy.  The most serious aspect of it, however, is not in relation to those classes.  It is unfortunate that the State has been relieved of the problem which it would otherwise have to face, because of the high level of emigration, which Ministers nowadays regard as something inevitable.  They play it down.  We heard the fumbling reply of the Minister for External Affairs when he dealt with the subject on the Estimate for his Department in relation to conditions in Britain.  Emigration is now regarded as an malaise, something over which we cannot exercise control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that far from an improvement having taken place in the employment situation the fact is that people have just fled the country who would normally be a charge on this Estimate.  Any improvements that have been made by way of increased payments are very long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion on which we had an opportunity of criticising the Minister's handling of this Department we referred to the delay in the payment of these benefits.  He alleged that the delay was inevitable, that administrative difficulties were such that <Col N="1268" /> arrangements had to be made which involved the passage of time and therefore payment could not be made until later in the year.  A former Government, however, having decided to increase benefits, effected the increase in a much shorter time.  We regard much of the content of the Minister's statement as not being in accordance with the facts as we see them.  At this stage do we deal with the amendments?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think the Bill must be taken separately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  It is possible that the brevity of the Minister's opening statement can be explained by the fact that we have had opportunities during the past year to discuss various aspects of social welfare.  The confidence which the Minister seeks to exude does not bear much examination.  We feel that if conditions were improved as much as the Government or the Minister would lead us to believe the provisions that are being made to look after the weaker sections of the people certainly do not indicate it.  There is not much sincerity in the protestations about buoyancy in the economy and general well-being if this is the best that can be done.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the payment of disability benefits.  There are institutions throughout the country that have grievous difficulties relating to overcrowding.  We, on local authorities, know that much time will elapse before this serious overcrowding can be remedied.  I suggest that immediate action by way of improvement in the payment of disability benefit could considerably ease the situation. Very few people occupy institutions by choice.  It entails a cost of something between £6 or £9 a week to maintain such people in these institutions. They are severed from normal family ties.  The situation could be considerably alleviated if the Government could see its way to increase disabled persons' allowances.  Any such increase or anything of that kind which would ease pressure on these institutions would be very welcomed indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> Finally, may I emphasise once more that the Minister has improved the social insurance fund by the simple expedient of increasing stamp charges on both employer and employee and has thereby succeeded in relieving his Department of direct responsibility for so many thousands, estimated at 40,000, of non-contributory pensioners who have been transferred to the contributory side of insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Sullivan, I feel that so far as social welfare is concerned I have said most of what I want to say on the Second Reading of the Bill, on the Budget, and on the Vote on Account.  Deputies find that they have quite an amount of work to do so far as the Department of Social Welfare is concerned and I should like to take this opportunity to say that, as usual, I have received nothing but courtesy and help from the Minister and his officials.  I know &mdash; I have had personal experience &mdash; that this is a very difficult Department to administer because the problems that arise are personal problems and not problems peculiar to particular sections. As far as the day-to-day administration goes, it can be said that the Minister and his officials afford Deputies nothing but courtesy and help.</P>
      <P>As far as the general policy of the present Minister is concerned, I am not under any obligation to compliment him because he has demonstrated a pretty conservative attitude in relation to social welfare, the more so when one remembers what Government spokesmen have said about the increase in our prosperity.  I want to make this point as against what is being said by the Minister and, in particular by his Parliamentary Secretary.  It may be thought that the increases given over the last three or four years and in the last Budget have been generous.  When one has regard to the figures given to demonstrate the buoyancy of our economy the increases are pretty meagre.  We have always been led to believe that we can afford increases in social welfare only in proportion to the economic prosperity of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the figures given by <Col N="1270" /> the Taoiseach's office tax revenue has increased pretty substantially since Fianna Fáil assumed office from 1957 to date.  That increase in tax revenue has certainly not been reflected in the amount spent on social welfare.  I want to quote again for the House figures I quoted recently because there are people who believe that we spend far too much on social welfare.  There are people who believe we should not to any great extent give increased benefits to widows and orphans and to the unemployed, for example.  In actual fact we have not spent as much as many people appear to believe in the last three or four years when one has regard to what the intake in taxation has been.  The picture shows we spent a smaller percentage of tax revenue on social welfare and social assistance.  Every time the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary have been urged in recent years to grant increases in respect of various social welfare payments the plea has been that that just cannot be done until the country can afford it.  The Taoiseach and Government Ministers have told us that we have ridden in on a boom of prosperity and all we have to do is to watch ourselves, keep on an even keel, and prosperity will be further increased in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Tax revenue in 1957-58 was £102.7 millions.  Of that we spent £25.5 millions on social welfare.  That represented 24.8 per cent. of tax revenue&mdash;a pretty substantial figure.  In 1958-59 tax revenue was £104.1 millions.  We spent £24.4 millions on social welfare, representing 24.4 per cent. of tax revenue, a reduction of .4 per cent.  In 1959-60 tax revenue was £107.3 millions. Social welfare expenditure was £25.5 millions, representing 23.8 per cent, of tax revenue, a reduction of .6 per cent.  In 1960-61 tax revenue stood at £114.9 millions.  Social welfare expenditure amounted to £26.2 millions, representing 22.8 per cent. of tax revenue.  In 1961-62 it is estimated tax revenue will be £118.3 millions.  Out of that we propose to spend £26.4 millions on social welfare and social assistance.  That will represent 22.3 per cent. of tax revenue.  Whilst in 1957-58 expenditure on social welfare represented <Col N="1271" /> 24.8 per cent. of tax revenue in 1961-62 is it proposed to spend only 22.3 per cent. of tax revenue on social welfare, a reduction in the five years of 1.5 per cent.  I think we could have afforded a little more in the Budget and in the Bill which the Minister will presumably deal with after his Estimate has finished.</P>
    <P>It is also sought to create the impression that the Government have succeeded at some great sacrifice in giving 1/6d. per week to the old age pensioners, increases to widows and orphans, and to those dependent upon unemployment assistance.  In the Budget the impression was quite clearly given that any increase in taxation was due to these increases to old age pensioners and others.  There were many people in my own Party even who said: &ldquo;Oh, one penny on the packet of cigarettes is worthwhile when one remembers our old age pensioners will get an extra 1/6 per week.&rdquo; But the penny on the packet of cigarettes does not go towards the old age pension. There have been certain manipulations to ensure that it will be possible to give this increase while, at the same time, reducing the overall expenditure on social welfare and social assistance.  The penny on the packet of cigarettes is being used to offset the reduction in income tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister's job in regard to old age pensioners has been made relatively simple by reason of the fact that he has introduced this scheme to ensure that there will be a 50 per cent. increase in contributions from both employers and employees during the present year.  The three Estimates we are now discussing indicate that, whilst there is an increase in expenditure in relation to social insurance to the extent of something like £2,000,000, that is more than offset by a saving on social assistance to the extent of £2,400,000.</P>
    <P>Apart from the money that was available, these increases should have been more, having regard to the cost of living index figure.  In regard to these people, I am not concerned about the overall cost of living index figure, because there are many items in it <Col N="1272" /> which do not mean anything to old age pensioners and people dependent on sick benefit, unemployment assistance and so on.  The one thing that strikes me is that between February, 1957, and February, 1961, there was an increase of 17.1 points in the food group in the cost of living index figure. It is true that, so far as the overall cost of living index figure is concerned, there was not the same substantial increase.  But, because these people are dependent on such things as tea, bread, butter and sugar, the withdrawal of the food subsidies imposed much more of a burden on them than on ordinary people in good and remunerative employment.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by mentioning a group in whom I have always shown an interest, the blind workers.  I am aware that at present the National League of the Blind have a claim on behalf of their members employed in the blind workshops at Baggot Street for parity with unskilled workers in the service of Dublin Corporation. Apart from its merits, that claim should and could have been dealt with much more expeditiously than it was.  We have an obligation to these people.  I thought the Minister was going to tell me it was a matter for the Board.</P>

      <P>I was about to point out to the Deputy that, since the Minister has no responsibility, I cannot see the point of raising the matter on this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid you will have to hear me out first, Sir, before <Col N="1273" /> you can decide that.  I believe the blind workers in these workshops have not got a fair crack of the whip in the last 12 months and that their claim does not seem to have been treated properly by the Board controlling these workshops.</P>
      <P>The claim was submitted to the Board in April, 1960.  As a result of some discussion, it was left in abeyance on the assurance that the whole question of wages would be reviewed in the six months from April, 1960.  Nothing was done after that period of six months and in November of that year their claim was renewed.  Still nothing happened.  Their claim was then submitted to the Labour Court in November or December of that year.  It was referred to the Labour Court at conciliation level early in May, 1961.  At that meeting, at which a conciliation officer of the Labour Court was present, the representatives of the Board undertook to resume the discussions not later than the 30th June, 1961, when they would present a new formula for the compilation of the wages for blind workers.</P>
      <P>Both these promises were not fulfilled by the Board.  They broke faith not alone with the blind workers but with the conciliation officer of the Labour Court as well.  There was a further conciliation meeting to take place on the 5th July but that also was cancelled and the Board refused to fix any date for the further consideration of this matter.  The Minister tells me now that the matter is before the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was going there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was referred to them at conciliation level early last year, but because the Board failed to live up to their promises the National League of the Blind, representing the workers, became very annoyed.  I think they threatened and did actually serve strike notice.  I do not know what the difficulties of the Board are.  The Board has power to negotiate with these workers and may make an arrangement with them in regard to wages with the approval or otherwise of the Minister.  I am not quite <Col N="1274" /> clear but, as far as I am aware, this Board is financed by local authorities who contribute a certain proportion to the funds of the Board.  I should like to know from the Minister if all the local authorities of Ireland are contributing to the Board and whether that is voluntary on the part of the local authorities or not.  If it is not voluntary the Minister should ensure by regulation, or, if not, by legislation, that local authorities make a fair contribution towards the employment and rehabilitation of these blind workers.</P>
      <P>It is not sufficient to treat blind workers, and I am not suggesting the Minister does, as inferior workers. They are making an honest and sincere effort to occupy themselves in productive and gainful employment. They are married and have families to cater for.  I do not think it is an unreasonable request to the Board that these workers should have parity, not with skilled workers, but merely with the unskilled workers of Dublin Corporation. Even if the Minister has no absolute function, I would urge him to use his good offices to see to it that this claim will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points on which I should like some elucidation from the Minister and on which I should like to comment.  The first concerns the payments from the social insurance fund to married workers who, because of illness, find themselves deprived of work for a long period.  I am referring in particular to a person who may become afflicted by T.B. and finds himself in an institution for a long period.  I know of a case where a working man was so affected.  His wife and seven children became dependent on payments from the social insurance fund. These payments amount to £4 15s. a week.  The family is committed to paying 7/6 a week rent for a council cottage which leaves the wife and seven dependent children with a net £4 7s. 6d. a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases like that where there is a large element of hardship and where the family circumstances are such, through incapacity of the bread earner, that it becomes impossible to provide <Col N="1275" /> sufficient food to enable growing children to become healthy adults, some exceptions should be made particularly in times like those when the purchasing power of money is so low and the cost of living so high.  I suggest that a little higher benefit should be given in such cases.  I appreciate that an insurance fund of any kind cannot hope to meet the demands of all sections but I think the case I have cited is a worthy example.</P>
    <P>Secondly &mdash; I mentioned this previously&mdash;I should like to make a point in regard to the means test applicable to non-contributory old age pensioners. This is something I would urge the Minister to re-examine because I believe the means test as applied at the moment does not give recognition to the purchasing power of money and at the same time to the scale of allowances in respect of adult dependants living in such homes. I have in mind a case of where two grown members of a family live with the pensioner on a small farm.  The allowance taken out of the earnings of that holding is something like £300 to £350 a year.  Making allowances of that amount is not enough, particularly when we know that under the Agricultural Wages Act a certain minimum is laid down at the other end of the scale.</P>
    <P>I feel that a much lesser sum is sufficient for people working on the place. This is something which is operating against non-contributory pensions in some cases and it is, I think, something which the Minister for Social Welfare should examine as far as small holdings are concerned.  It is the cause of great hardship and, if persisted in, would inevitably leave the old couple alone on the homestead.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to make is in respect of the widow with a family. There again, the analogy is somewhat the same as in the case of the dependant wife and family of an incapacitated workman.  As in that case, here again we ought to be as generous as we can, particularly where there are growing families dependent on this type of social benefit.  I know the Minister can say in reply that this is <Col N="1276" /> something the State is looking after, something which is being provided by the generosity of the people, but if we examine it more closely we will see we are helping young people towards adult life who at a later stage will themselves be contributors to the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would say a word on behalf of disabled persons living at home.  It is generally felt that many of these would be better treated at home instead of entering the institutions provided by the health authorities.  I believe it is the Christian feeling that, wherever possible, they would be left in their homes rather than sent to be accommodated by the local authorities at a much higher cost than would be the case if they obtained a little more assistance from the State to stay at home among their neighbours who would be only too glad to help them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall begin by paying a tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary and all the other officers of this Department.  During the past year I had on many occasions to bring cases to the notice of the Department and on every occasion I was treated with courtesy and, as far as they could, the officials gave me every information they were allowed to give, often to my entire satisfaction.  I feel the increases given in the old age pensions this year were very welcomed.  The amount given in the contributory old age pensions was very much appreciated. Up to this people who had been stamping their cards for many years found that when they reached the age of 70 they were no better off than those who had never stamped a card.  Now there is a matter of £2 a week in the difference.  I think that was a very good development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those people now feel that a hand of help is being stretched out to them but there is this spate of inquisitions which were not there in previous years. Whether it is to recoup some of the increases or not I do not know.  Whatever the cause, there has been much greater inquiry into people's means, into every little detail, even a few domestic fowl.  I know the Minister will say that it is proper there should be a full inquiry and I agree, but I do <Col N="1277" /> not think that small details should be included.  I have had cases this year in which the Department went back over 10 years and made out that a person in 1951 had drawn an old age pension to which she was not entitled.  The person was 84 at the time and there was a dispute as to whether she or her brother was actually the owner of a shop.  After long investigation, after the local papers had come into the fray as well as myself it was decided that arrears were not due by her.  Meantime, that woman was practically driven to the county home over it.  I believe she was fully entitled to what she got.  I think that going back over a person's affairs for 10 years is not right.  I do not blame the officials who must carry out Ministerial orders.  The responsibility rests on the Minister. Even an ordinary debt due for over six years cannot be claimed but the Department go back&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This was not an ordinary debt.  It was money obtained by fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not obtained by fraud.  That was admitted by the Parliamentary Secretary.  This woman was denied her pension for many weeks.  There was no question of fraud but it just shows the policy of the Government of giving with one hand and taking back with the other.</P>
      <P>The cutting off of the small turf supply when these people become contributory old age pensioners is another grievance.  It is a small thing and the Government would be wiser if they had a decent heart and continued these insignificant allowances. I have also had several cases of old I.R.A. allowances being revised when the contributory pensions came. If we are going to give these pensions let us do it decently and not cut off other allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an anonymous letter arrives at a labour exchange about a person drawing either unemployment benefit or assistance that person is immediately cut off and an inquiry instituted.  It may be six weeks before the case is heard by the Board.  That is altogether wrong.  If I have ill-will against a particular man &mdash; I know of cases of <Col N="1278" /> men with families of eight being cut off &mdash; I can write in about him.  We all have &ldquo;good&rdquo; neighbours at times.  A man may be cut off until brought before a referee to have the case decided.  In the meantime that puts a burden on the local authority because if the man comes to me I advise him to go to the home assistance officer to get assistance while he is not drawing a pension.  I do not mind anonymous letters being investigated but in the meantime the man concerned should be allowed to draw benefit until it is proved that he was not entitled to it for that period.  It is wrong that a man with a family should be deprived of any pension because some enemy, someone not friendly to him, writes in suggesting that he has been working. In most of those cases I found it was not proved subsequently that the person concerned had been working but he and his family had to suffer hardship pending the investigation.</P>
    <P>I raised a question today about a man debarred from social welfare benefit.  The Minister said that the insured person had lost his employment under conditions which, under Section 17 of the Social Welfare Act, disqualified him from receiving benefits and he was so disqualified for six weeks from the 10th June, 1961.  This man worked as a telephonist in the post office and had been doing so for 12 months.  He had worked three hours daily from 8.30 to 11.30 and on Sunday, I think, from 8.30 to 11.30.  To get a few extra shillings he also worked from 1.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.  As a result, his total pay for 26 hours work per week was £3.  In May he decided to take employment with the county council who apparently had work involving writing out rates notices.  This enabled him to earn £7 or £8 a week as against the £3 from the post office.  He gave notice to the post office that he was leaving to take up duty with the county council, duty he had taken up in previous years.  He worked in the county council for five weeks up to Thursday, June 15th.  On June 10th, knowing his work with the county council was finishing, he went to the post office and asked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but I must point out <Col N="1279" /> to him that he did not quote my reply in full, that this matter is not decided by the Minister but by an Appeals Officer under statute.  There is an appeal pending against the decision to be heard on the 25th July.  Therefore, the matter is <i>sub judice.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making and which I think the Minister cannot deny is that this man finished work on June 15th.  On June 10th he went to the post office to know if his job was available at £3 a week and was told there would be a letter in the post.  The letter arrived on the following Monday morning telling him he was dismissed from June 10th.  He had left work a month earlier, and got no dismissal notice and had worked with the county council.  After getting the dismissal notice he worked in the county council until the following Thursday which meant that the county council were his last employers and the post office had no right whatever, nor had the Department any right whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Section 42 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, lays it down that these matters are to be decided by a deciding officer appointed under statute.

      <P>I hope Deputy Crotty is not annoyed.  I am not responsible for the Social Welfare Act of 1952.  The Oireachtas is responsible for that.  One of the reasons why these provisions were written into that Act was because there were numerous allegations made by all Parties in this House that political influence was being used to determine issues of this sort.  It was accordingly decided by the Oireachtas that this matter should be taken out of the hands of the political head of the Department concerned and vested in a civil servant. That is the position and the Minister is bound by that situation and can do nothing about it.</P>

      <P>Not merely is that the situation but, if there is an appeal from the deciding officer, it is decided by an appeals officer.  The political head of the Department can do nothing. I have had to write to hundreds of people who have come to me, believing they were friends of mine, and inform them that I could do nothing, this matter was decided outside the office altogether.  I hope the Deputy <Col N="1282" /> will be satisfied with that and allow this case to be determined on appeal in Kilkenny on July 25th.  I have certain information but I do not want to have the case tried across the floor of this House.  The Deputy has made certain allegations.  I do not propose to controvert them.  If I did, I should be making allegations possibly against the person concerned.  Let the matter drop now.</P>
      <P>I am indebted to the House for the manner in which this Estimate has been discussed.  Naturally I did not expect I would get many bouquets, and I did not get many bouquets so far as the generosity of the provisions we are making is concerned.  I would be less than human if I were not grateful for the tributes paid to the officers of my Department and to the Parliamentary Secretary.  He is unfortunately not able to be here today.  From my personal experience I can support everything that has been said as to the courtesy and consideration shown to the general public from the point of view of the administration of the various Acts.  I am, I think, a rather exacting Minister and sometimes very exigent in my demands upon my staff. I have always found them not merely meeting my exactions but, at the same time, careful not to permit those exactions to militate in any way against their dealings with the general public.  The general public do not suffer because the Minister may sometimes impose an undue burden upon his officers.</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan alleged that the cost of the old age pensions had been transferred to the social insurance fund.  That is not so.  The gross cost of the new benefits amounts to £6,960,000.  I am not segregating the contributory old age pensions from the other benefits granted by the Act passed last year.  I am taking the benefits as a whole.  The increase in the contribution income was £4,075,000.  The excess of benefits over contribution income was £2,885,000.  It is quite clearly established on those figures that the contribution income has not met the increased cost of the new benefits. It is true that by reason of the introduction of the scheme of contributory <Col N="1283" /> old age pensions a number of persons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but all of those were not in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions.  A large number were in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions to the value in the aggregate of £2,550,000.  Even allowing for that £2,550,000 there is still an excess expenditure of £335,000 which is being met from the Exchequer.  I am sure Deputy O'Sullivan does not contend that we are not entitled to take that £2,550,000 and set it off against the cost of the contributory pensions which have replaced the non-contributory pensions.  He would not want us surely to give it with both hands&mdash;to allow the people who are getting the contributory old age pension to draw the non-contributory old age pension they formerly had as well and, if he does not argue that, then I cannot see what grievance he has.  I cannot see how he can make the case he did because the case he made can only be made on the assumption that those who were formerly in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions and became entitled under the Act to contributory old age pensions should be permitted to draw both pensions.  I understand the Deputy is not making that case.</P>

In fact it has not been transferred. We are still carrying the full cost of the non-contributory old-age pensions.  On the social insurance fund &mdash; we are contributing £22,885,000 <Col N="1284" /> to cover not merely the cost of those former non-contributory old age pensions but also an excess expenditure, over and above all that, of £335,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the special allowance paid to those who are in grave need.  The amount of the special allowance is £80.  The contributory old age pension represents in most cases 40/- a week or up to 70/- if one takes into consideration the allowance made to an adult dependant spouse.  Therefore, one can make a calculation very quickly and see that the increase which the military service pensioner may draw under the contributory scheme far exceeds the special allowance which could be granted by the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just shown the Deputy we are not getting others to pay for it.  I tried to show that, insofar as figures can convey anything, in a simple calculation which I put before him.  Deputy Corish complained <Col N="1285" /> that the percentage of social welfare to tax revenue has decreased.  If our community is more prosperous, if more of our people are self-supporting, if more of them do not require social assistance, then surely social welfare as a percentage of State expenditure, whether it is financed from tax revenue or from any other source, must go down.  I am glad to hear Deputy Corish admitting that the expenditure on social welfare has decreased in proportion to our tax revenue because it is an admission that, by and large, there are fewer people in need of social assistance than there were in the year 1956-57.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>What about social insurance in relation to social assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the financial consequences of the change in the unemployment situation this year as compared with last year.  I am just taking that as an example.  The draw on the social insurance fund for this year in respect of unemployment benefit claims is estimated to be £595,000 less than last year, an indication that there is less unemployment among insured persons. That cannot be contradicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>And you save money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other side of the account, there is an estimated increase in contributions for this year of £213,000 so that in the social insurance fund which we were told was carrying everything, there has been a financial improvement to the extent of £808,000 due to an improvement in the employment position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again take the social assistance side of the account.  We estimate that by a reduction in the number of persons who would have been claiming unemployment assistance, at the old rates there would have been a saving this year of £247,000, so that if there had not been any change in the rates the total amount which would have been saved to the Exchequer in this year as compared with last year on the social assistance side and the social insurance side would have been £1,055,000 for one year only.  The position of this year as compared with last year is not unique.  Last year was very much <Col N="1286" /> better than the year before.  Of course 1958 was very much better than 1957 and 1957 was better than 1956 because in 1956 the employment register at its peak amounted to 100,000.  The number of persons on the unemployment register at its peak in the year 1956-57 when the Coalition Government was in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That was not the peak, it may be more than 100,000, but it was at its peak when the Coalition Government left office and we took over from them and far from being at its peak so far as the live register is concerned we are now deep in the valley.</P>

      <P>The figures on the unemployment register are at the lowest they have been since 1933.  In the light of this what does Deputy Corish complain of except the fact that people are now so much better off that we have not to spend as much on relieving their destitution and poverty as the State had to expend when the last Coalition Government was in office?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <P>He was too busy talking to the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is, I have not any power to interfere with the Board.  The Board for the Employment of the Blind was set up originally&mdash;I think my predecessor, Deputy Corish, took a leading part in forming the Board&mdash;but he knows it is only one of a number of organisations which look after the welfare of the blind and he also knows that it receives subventions from certain of the local authorities.  I am not certain whether they all contribute now or not.  Deputy Corish when he was Minister had some difficulty in persuading them to contribute, but I think the number contributing is increasing.  I forget the exact amount of the rate they contribute but there is a statutory limitation as to the amount which the Board may receive. Over and above that, the State pays <Col N="1288" /> a certain capitation rate in respect of each worker employed.  It is £40 in the case of any person employed in a workshop and, of course, that £40 per employee is paid to the Board.</P>
      <P>Over and above that the position is this: notwithstanding the grant made to the Board by the local authorities under the Blind Persons Act, notwithstanding the capitation rate, the position is that the Board last year and the year before lost £23,000 and they are naturally concerned to try to keep that institution open.  I think that is a fact that we have to recognise.  Not only that, but all the directors of this Board who give a great deal of their time to it are giving voluntary service. This is not a commercial concern and I shall not go any further than to say that because, as I have stated, this matter may go before the Labour Court and I do not want to say anything here which might be thought to prejudice the approach of the Court to the workers' claim.  But these are facts which we have to take into consideration.</P>
      <P>Again, as I said, Sir, very heavily subsidised as it is already and notwithstanding these subventions, it has lost very substantial sums in the two years' working and naturally people who have accepted the responsibility for managing and administering the concern are very perturbed about that. They feel that they have certain other obligations and I am not going to try to weaken their sense of responsibility for the management of the workshop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comments.  It may not be regarded by some people as a commercial concern, but I think the Minister would also appreciate that the ultimate object was the rehabilitation of people who had not the use of their eyes.  If they lost £23,000 last year and if they are all business men, they may consider it to be a commercial venture that has not succeeded.  I do not think that it should be looked on in that way.  I asked the Minister if he would consider further consultations with the local authorities to see whether or not they could put the Board in a better financial position if they are restricted by lack of funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> I am not certain whether or not the Minister says that this is going before the Labour Court but even in the Labour Court they will be restricted in the negotiation of the claims made by the National League of the Blind if they feel that they just will not have the money to pay the increase and bring these workers on to parity with unskilled workers in Dublin.  I would like the Minister to get away from the phrase if he would, this idea of its being a commercial venture.  Rehabilitation is very important for many people.  The National League of the Blind are very sincere in their efforts to rehabilitate people and I think consultations between the Minister or his officials and the Board might bring the matter to a reasonable conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Once I entrust responsibility to any person I try to restrain myself from interfering with the discretion which naturally he must exercise in the discharge of the responsibility. But let us not forget one thing. Deputy Corish has said that his institution has as its main purpose the rehabilitation of certain persons and you want to be very careful, when dealing with the question of rehabilitation, to make sure that it does not degenerate into demoralisation.  I think that is one of the matters that the people managing this institution are concerned about.  They cannot regard it as a charity.  If it is going to fulfil its function at all, there must be some advertence to ordinary commercial principles in its operation.  I do not say that the commercial element should predominate but it cannot be lost sight of, otherwise the Board will not be able to put through its proper function, that of rehabilitation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 19, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Seventh Schedule to the Act of 1952 is hereby amended by the insertion in subparagraph (c) of paragraph (1) of Rule 3 after &lsquo;each so determined&rsquo; of &lsquo;less, as respects the older member of a married couple consisting of persons each of whom is not less than sixty years of age and neither of whom is wholly or mainly dependent on the means of an individual other than a member of the married couple&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in case the sum of the income (if any) in cash of the married couple of which account is taken under paragraph II of Rule 1 of this Schedule and of the amounts (if any) which were excluded, by virtue of subparagraphs (e), (g) and (h) of the said paragraph II, in the calculation of the said income in cash of the married couple does not exceed £165, the whole of the income in cash of the married couple of which account is taken under the said paragraph II, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  in any other case, so much of the income in cash of the married couple of which account is taken under the said paragraph II as, when added to the amounts (if any) which were excluded, by virtue of the said subparagraphs (e), (g) and (h), in the calculation of the said income in cash of the married couple, amounts to £165&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in substitution for the amendment circulated last week and the purpose of it I might briefly explain as follows.  The purpose of the amendment as originally <Col N="1292" /> circulated, and of the amendment which it is now proposed to substitute for it, is to allow a concession in assessing the means of a claimant to an old age pension who is one of a married couple living together, where the spouse of the claimant is 60 years of age or over and where the couple are wholly or mainly dependent on each other for their livelihood.  Where one of these old people reaches pensionable age and the other has not yet attained pensionable age the proposal here is to make it easier for the spouse who is over 70 years of age to secure the old age pension.  That is the general purpose.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,352,080 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I shall begin by commenting on the more important subheads of the Estimate, with particular reference to those which show substantial changes from the amounts provided last year. This will be followed by an account of the main activities of the Land Commission during the year ended 31st March last and, before concluding, I propose to refer to some matters of a general nature associated with this Vote.</P>
      <P>The net total of the Estimate, viz. £2,327,880, exceeds by £95,940 the corresponding amount provided last year.  The overall increase in the current Estimate is spread for the most part over four subheads, namely D, G, I and L.  I shall deal in detail with these four subheads as I go along.</P>
      <P>Provision in subhead A for salaries, wages and allowances, is at about the same level as last years's figure.</P>
      <P>Subhead B relates mainly to travelling expenses incurred on inspections and surveys under the Land Acts.  This subhead also provides for the incidental expenses.  There is an increase of £4,500 this year, mainly for an anticipated increase in travelling expenses on acquisition and resale inspections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead D represents the taxpayers' contribution in the current year towards the service of Land purchase debt, accumulated on both tenanted and untenanted land, since 1923.  This year, the contribution comes to £905,000&mdash;and of that about £750,000 is required for the purpose of making good deficiencies in the Land Bond <Col N="1294" /> Fund arising from the statutory halving of annuities conceded in 1933.  The moneys in subhead D are in the nature of statutory commitments. They account for almost 40 per cent. of the whole Estimate.  The increase of £15,700 this year is almost entirely due to the halving of purchase instalments which become payable by new allottees as the Land Settlement programme moves ahead.</P>
    <P>Subhead G, under the general title of &ldquo;Purchase of Interests for Cash&rdquo;, provides an amount of £105,000 in respect of two distinct items, namely:</P>
    <P>(a)  £100,000 for purchase of lands for cash in the open market under Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, and</P>
    <P>(b)  £5,000 for compensation payable in cash on the resumption of tenancy interests on the small outstanding residue of estates of the former Congested Districts Board.</P>
    <P>The amount of £5,000 proposed for this residual activity is unchanged from last year.  In respect of purchases under Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, the provision of £100,000 proposed this year constitutes a record sum for the purchase of land by the Land Commission in the open market.</P>
    <P>For a few years after the passing of the Land Act, 1950, the funds available for these purchases did not exceed £20,000 annually.  This provision was increased to £30,000 for 1956-57, but it will be recalled that operations under the Section were brought to a standstill, as an economy measure, in July, 1956, the total expenditure for that year being £18,000.  Activities were recommenced in April, 1958&mdash;a sum of £25,000 being authorised for 1958-59.  A progressive increase in funds has followed each year since then.</P>
    <P>Last year, expenditure on cash purchases amounted to almost £75,000 &mdash;the total area purchased for cash being 1,296 acres, compared with 1,032 acres in the previous year.  Substantial new cash purchases are being entered into this year, on the strength of the record increase in the subhead provision: and, on latest prospects, it seems certain that the provision of £100,000, now proposed for the first <Col N="1295" /> time, will be fully utilised in the year. It is scarcely necessary to remind Deputies that, by the Land Act, 1950, these particular funds are confined to the purchase of lands required for migrants' holdings or to facilitate the rearrangement of fragmented holdings. The bulk of land purchase continues to be financed in land bonds issued under Land Bond Orders made by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Subhead H relates to gratuities payable, pursuant to Section 29, Land Act, 1950, to persons displaced from employment on lands being taken over by the Land Commission for division. The charge to Subhead H necessarily depends on the volume of land acquisition and the circumstances of individual displaced workmen.  Any displaced employee, who is deemed competent to work land, is automatically considered by the Land Commissioners for an allotment in the ordinary way, and, indeed, it is manifestly right that such a person should enjoy high rating on a priority list.  But if a displaced workman is considered unsuitable for an allotment, he is alternatively considered for a cash gratuity, depending upon the length of his service and the availability of other suitable employment.  Last year, 21 ex-employees received gratuities totalling £3,134, or an average of £149 each.  From the passing of the Land Act, 1950, up to 31st March, 1961, gratuities totalling £25,642 have been paid to 224 workmen&mdash;an average of £114 each.</P>
    <P>The funds required to carry out improvement works on estates allotted by the Land Commission are provided under subhead 1.  Such works comprise the erection of dwelling-houses and out-offices; the provision of access roads fencing and drainage; turbary development; repair and maintenance of embankments and so on.  All of these improvement works are indispensable in land settlement operations and the expenditure incurred on them inevitably constitutes a significant portion of the funds made available to the Land Commission each year.</P>
    <P>During the year ended 31st March last, the total expenditure under the <Col N="1296" /> improvements subhead amounted to £632,500, more than half of which was incurred on building works.  The current provision of £690,000, amounting to almost 30 per cent. of the entire nett Estimate, represents an increase of nearly £60,000 on the amount expended last year.  This increase has been proposed so that the tempo of the allotment programme may keep pace with the expanded acquisition programme. Having regard to the social importance of the projects for which this money is required and the employment potential of these works, I feel confident that Deputies will readily agree to the proposal to provide additional funds this year.</P>
    <P>During the year ended 31st March last, the total paid in wages of workmen employed by the Land Commission on improvement works amounted to £227,000.  The average strength of the labour force was 940 workmen. During the past year, an Incentive Bonus Scheme, similar to that being operated in connection with State afforestation, was extended to Land Commission improvement works with the general acceptance of the workers.</P>
    <P>The provision in subhead L this year is a new item.  Deputies will recall that in September, 1958, responsibility for the administration of the Game Preservation Act, 1930, was transferred from the Minister for Justice to the Minister for Lands.  On the debate for this Estimate last year, I welcomed the keen interest which was being taken in the potentially valuable game resources of the country, as demonstrated by the formation of voluntary associations for the development of game resources.  I also mentioned that the subject of game promotion was under consideration with a view to settling lines of longterm practical policy.</P>
    <P>As a first step in this direction, subhead L of the current Estimate makes provision for initial expenditure of £7,500 this year.  It is proposed to devote this sum to making grants for the preservation and improvement of game resources, in accordance with schemes to be approved by the Minister for Lands.  At the outset, such grants will be confined to local organisations which are representative of all appropriate interests. <Col N="1297" /> Regional Game Councils are invited to send their particular proposals as soon as possible to my Department, so that they may receive timely consideration in this year's allocation.  Such proposed schemes should include details of objectives and methods of implementation, together with an estimate of expenditure within the current year and a firm proposal as to local contribution.  Grants will be made, within the total subhead provision, to assist schemes which hold out promise of worthwhile practical results and are backed by efficient local organisation. With these grants now available from my Department, the financial assistance hitherto provided by An Bord Fáilte, as an interim measure, will no longer be necessary. I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the assistance given by Bord Fáilte towards game promotion generally.</P>
    <P>Before passing on from this matter, I should like to say a few words about organisation for game development.  I have already expressed the view that the game movement, like our inland fisheries, is primarily intended to benefit our own people.  This being so, if the movement is to have prospects of wide success, it is essential that it be grounded on local initiative, that it be as widely-based as possible and that it should afford maximum flexibility in the matter of membership.  It would be quite unrealistic to contemplate the development of game resources in this country without the co-operation of the farming community.  It would be also unrealistic not to enlist the co-operation of the various people who&mdash; either individually or in groups&mdash;have devoted considerable time and energy down the years towards conservation and improvement of game stocks.</P>
    <P>I appeal, therefore, for full co-operation of all interests&mdash;agricultural, rural and sporting &mdash; to ensure the success of the game movement. What form this co-operation should take is best left to be worked out between the parties, all of whom are fully organised.  My immediate concern is that a spirit of harmony should be inculcated among all groups concerned in the development of the <Col N="1298" /> country's game resources.  Without harmonious relations, progress will be needlessly slower than it otherwise might be.</P>
    <P>I attach great importance to the emergence of a countrywide network of successful local game councils, successful in the sense that each will have substantial practical achievements to display in terms of improved game resources. The achievements of some local game councils in the preliminary matter of vermin control have been quite impressive.  The main phase of development of game resources has yet to be widely tackled.  It would surely be unwise to accept methods which may not have been adequately tested in practice. A testing period necessarily involves organisational flexibility.  For my part, Regional Game Councils may be assured that every possible guidance and support, in dealing with the practical problems affecting vermin clearance and game restocking, will be forthcoming from my Department.</P>
    <P>Having explained in some detail the salient features of the Estimate, I think I need not elaborate on the remaining subheads which are, in the main, either unchanged from last year or self-explanatory token provisions.  I propose, therefore, to turn now to a comprehensive review of the activies of the Land Commission during the year ended 31st March last.  Some of the statistics are as yet provisional but it is not expected that they will differ to any significant extent from the final returns.</P>
    <P>I shall deal first of all with tenanted land.  It may not be generally known that the number of tenancies which fell to be dealt with under all Land Acts exceeded 400,000.  Of these, some 300,000 were on estates purchased under Land Acts prior to 1923, while approximately 112,000 consisted of tenancies on estates which vested in the Land Commission under the Land Act, 1923, and subsequent Acts.  At 31st March last, all but 2,500 of the pre-1923 cases &mdash;entirely on the estates of the former Congested Districts Board&mdash;had been disposed of; the number of post-1923 holdings awaiting revesting was less than 8,000.  Thus, the aggregate number of tenancies, under all Land Acts, <Col N="1299" /> remaining to be dealt with at 31st March, 1961, has been reduced to about 10,500.</P>
    <P>These residual cases, which are concentrated mainly on acutely-congested estates in western counties, in no way represent a survival of landlordism; the tenants enjoy all the benefit of land purchase, the mere act of final vesting being but the ultimate and conclusive symbol of ownership.  However, because they are often small and badly inter-mixed, rearrangement and enlargement of these holdings, together with general improvements, are invariably essential before they can proceed to final vesting and thus their disposal is inevitably a slow and tedious process.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I consider it a very creditable performance that such a steady rate of vesting has been maintained by the Land Commission in recent years.  The number of holdings revested last year was 1,583.  With some 10,500 holdings, in all, awaiting vesting at 31st March last, we may be said to have reached the final stage of tenanted land purchase.  Indeed, this essential work has already concluded or virtually concluded in fifteen counties, viz., Carlow, Cavan, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Turning to untenanted land, it will be recalled that when last year's Estimate was under discussion, I informed the House that the amount of land bonds made available for land acquisition for the financial year ended 31st March last had been increased from £500,000 to £750,000.  This was, in fact, the highest amount provided for the purpose for upwards of twenty years.  I am glad to say that, as a result of this provision, there has been a pronounced acceleration in all aspects of acquisition activity during the year and, equally important, the prospects for the immediate future are also very bright.</P>
    <P>On the inspection side, which is, of course, the starting point of all proceedings for land acquisition by the Land Commission, an aggregate area of 70,300 acres was investigated during <Col N="1300" /> the year with a view to considering the initiation of acquisition, purchase or resumption proceedings: the corresponding figures for the two preceding years were 52,200 acres and 39,400 acres.  In the course of the year, proceedings were instituted in respect of some 35,300 acres&mdash;compared with 24,200 acres in 1959/60 and 12,890 acres in 1958/59.  The total area acquired, purchased or otherwise taken over during the year, for land settlement purposes, was approximately 34,400 acres, the corresponding areas in the two previous years being 29,500 acres and 31,500 acres, respectively.</P>
    <P>Moreover, at 31st March, 1961, the aggregate area in the acquisition/resumption machine&mdash;in other words, at various stages of proceedings, prior to being taken over by the Land Commission&mdash;was in the region of 36,000 acres: the comparative area at 31st March, 1960, was 27,500 acres while at 31st March, 1959, it was 22,500 acres.</P>
    <P>I think the foregoing figures speak for themselves.  The marked increase in acquisition activity during the year is, of course, reflected in the land bond issues for the year.  During the year ended 31st March last, bond issues totalled £712,690: the corresponding figure for the previous year was £543,602, while, for the financial year ended 31st March, 1959, bond issues amounted to £410,686.</P>
    <P>The additional funds provided last year facilitated the purchase of several large properties&mdash;including the Oranmore &amp; Browne and Brigadier Browne estates in Co. Mayo, the estate of Lord Kildare in Co. Kildare and the Oakpark estate in Co. Carlow, to name put a few&mdash;all of which could not otherwise have been taken over by the Land Commission in a single year. This significant advance on the acquisition side, coupled with the parallel expansion of cash-purchases, to which I referred to earlier, is designed to ensure that intake of land by the Land Commission will be maintained at a level which will make possible an expanded land settlement programme. I think that rural Deputies, and especially those from the Congested Districts, will welcome these encouraging developments which were <Col N="1301" /> made possible by the Government decision to provide additional finance for the acquisition of land by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>On the land settlement side, the past year was one of solid achievement. The total area allotted during the year amongst some 2,180 allottees was approximately some 36,000 acres. In addition, about 1,300 rights of turbary were provided during the year &mdash;the total expenditure on turbary development being £58,681.</P>
    <P>In the 5-year period ended on 31st March last, a total area of about 192,000 acres was divided amongst some 10,300 allottees, compared with an allotment of 161,600 acres amongst 9,350 allottees during the previous five-year term.  Total allotment of untenanted land under all Land Acts to date is upwards of 2¼ million acres; of this total, 1½ million acres was allotted in the period since 1923.</P>
    <P>The migration programme for the year was exceptionally good.  In all, 148 migrants were resettled on new holdings&mdash;the highest recorded number of migrations by the Land Commission in a single year since the war. As a result of these migrations, an extremely useful supply of land was made available for land settlement purposes in the congested areas where, as a general rule, the scope for acquiring land through the normal process is very restricted.  It can be said that for every tenant who is migrated, two or three of the remaining congests have their position improved.</P>
    <P>Five hundred fragmented holdings were rearranged during the past year, a result which is well up to the average. Since 1950, more than 5,200 rearrangements have been effected by the Land Commission.  While the number of holdings awaiting rearrangement is being progressively reduced, the major concentration of the outstanding cases is in the most acutely congested and intermixed areas and intensive effort will be necessary to maintain the current rate of progress.  The full co-operation of the participating congests is a vital factor in the successful implementation of rearrangement schemes formulated by the Land Commission. I must again appeal to any Deputies, who may have an opportunity <Col N="1302" /> of doing so, to impress on tenants that it is in their own interest to co-operate with the Land Commission in this work.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the revesting of tenanted land by the Land Commission. On the untenanted land side, the vesting of allotments in allottees is an important feature of the year's activities.  Satisfactory progress was made during the year.  Altogether, in the case of both tenanted and untenanted land, some 5,200 properties&mdash;comprising holdings, parcels and rights of turbary&mdash;were vested in tenants and allottees during the period.</P>
    <P>As regards housing activities, during the year ended 31st March last, 219 new dwellinghouses and 330 new out-offices were erected and 16 dwelling-houses reconstructed by or with financial assistance from the Land Commission. In addition, advances were made by the Land Commission, in 37 cases, to supplement grants made by the Department of Local Government for the erection of new dwellinghouses.</P>
    <P>Advances ranging from £100 minimum to £200 maximum, related to twenty times the unrevised annuity, have been available from the Land Commission to supplement Local Government Department grants for the erection of new dwellinghouses.  I have now decided to step up the advance to £200 in all cases, irrespective of the size of annuity.</P>
    <P>The evaluation of the prototype houses of new design, erected by the Land Commission in Laois and Westmeath, is under active consideration with a view to the preparation of a range of acceptable new building plans of modern design for Land Commission operations.  This important matter of farm building design will be of long-term significance.  It requires adequate consultation and consideration before a final decision is taken, but the matter will be brought to conclusion as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>Water supply for rural homesteads is a very topical subject just now.  The provision of water supplies for farming and domestic purposes, on or adjacent to newly-created holdings, is not neglected in land settlement operations. For some years past, the Land <Col N="1303" /> Commission have been successfully using their own machinery for well-boring. Water supply commitments, however, are numerous and urgent and well-boring contractors have been engaged to supplement the work of the Land Commission machines.  During the past year, a total of 114 wells was provided.  Every effort is being made by the Land Commission to expedite the provision of water supplies for allottees.</P>
    <P>I should like at this stage to refer to the Land Commission scheme for amelioration of conditions in the flooded areas of the Shannon Valley in Counties Roscommon, Galway, Westmeath and Offaly.  Perhaps I should point out once more that this is not a scheme of flood control; rather is it aimed at affording relief, as far as practicable, from the hazards of flooding, by the erection of new buildings on safer sites, the reconstruction of existing buildings in suitable cases and the provision, where necessary, of dry stands for stock in times of abnormal flooding.</P>
    <P>In all, 109 farmers are concerned in this scheme, which has progressed very well during the year.  The cost of the scheme is being borne by the National Development Fund.  Up to a recent date, total expenditure under the scheme has amounted to £96,000, of which upwards of £50,000 was spent in the past financial year.</P>
    <P>Work already done or in progress may be summarised as follows: 34 new dwelling-houses and 43 new out-offices have been completed.  Nine further dwellings and 3 out-offices are being built at present.  Five dwelling-houses and a similar number of out-offices have been substantially reconstructed and repairs are currently being carried out on another dwelling-house and out-office.  In addition, approach roads and yards have been raised in 24 cases.  Dry stands for stock have been provided for 31 farmers.  The provision of these dry-stand allotments necessitated the migration of six local landowners to new holdings elsewhere.</P>
    <P>For the majority of participants in this important scheme, the approved works are now concluded or nearing <Col N="1304" /> conclusion.  A few eligible participants are still holding back from full co-operation, possibly in expectation that they may get grants for building on sites below flood level.  As I said on previous occasions, it is hopeless to expect the Land Commission to give assistance to build on sites which are liable to flooding.  The point of principle involved in this should by now be fully realised by the participants in question.  In their own interest, it is earnestly hoped that they will agree to move to suitable building sites above flood level.  If they persist in their attitude, they will only have themselves to blame for any unfortunate losses that may occur through future flooding.</P>
    <P>The position regarding payment of land annuities continues satisfactory. Since 1933, out of a total collectible amount of over £68¼ millions, the amount outstanding at 31st March last was £147,438 &mdash; less than ¼ of 1 per cent. The provision of adequate agricultural credit is to-day a matter of major national importance.  This remarkable record of annuity payment is a reliable index of the creditworthiness of Irish farmers and of their willingness to meet their obligations.</P>
    <P>The question of property purchases by non-nationals was debated at some length in this House very recently.  The Government's approach to this matter, as expressed by me on that occasion, is on the records of the House, and I do not now propose to cover the ground in detail again.  I shall, therefore, confine myself to a brief reference to the problem, in so far as one exists, and to a summary of the measures which are being taken to deal with it.</P>
    <P>As Deputies have already been informed, provision is made in the current Finance Bill to strengthen the existing 25 per cent. stamp duty legislation so as to bring within its scope certain procedures which have made it possible for non-nationals, acquiring agricultural land here, to evade payment of this duty&mdash;especially the device of purchasing property through the medium of pre-1947 companies.  In addition, the Bill provides that the Revenue Commissioners will keep the Land Commission informed of purchases <Col N="1305" /> by non-national interests so that reliable information regarding the extent of such transactions may be assembled.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these measures will be adequate to seal off the tax evasion loophole which has hitherto existed and also to provide the Land Commission with all requisite information on property purchases by non-nationals.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on this Estimate last year, I dealt with the concept of the economic holding or, in more up-to-date parlance, the viable farm unit.  My view then was &mdash;that, while it is not possible to &mdash;and nothing has since occurred to cause me to alter that view&mdash; reduce the definition of an economic holding to any dogmatic formula in terms of acreage alone, there is no reason why a compact Land Commission standard holding comprising 33 acres of good land&mdash;or its equivalent in land of varied quality&mdash;should not be fully rewarding in the hands of a competent owner, willing to work his acres intensively, with up-to-date expert guidance from the local advisory service.  Here let me say that over the last decade, the Land Reform movement introduced in Italy made available on average no more than 17 acres per family.  In West Germany, over 90 per cent. of the holdings are less than 50 acres and in oft-cited Denmark, about half of the holdings are less than 25 acres.</P>
    <P>That many of the smaller holdings in our country are models of what efficient husbandry should be, is certainly undeniable.  Indeed, if proof of this were needed, it has been provided conclusively, even during the past twelve months, by the results of various competitions, sponsored by rural and agricultural bodies, in which industrious small farmers, extracting the last ounce from their limited acreage, often carried off the top prizes.  Small farmers, with the initiative to specialize and having sufficient courage and adaptability to avoid sluggish adherence to the farming pattern followed on larger holdings, are demonstrating in many districts that high cash returns are <Col N="1306" /> not incompatible with low acreage. I know it will be contended&mdash;and, I suppose, with some validity&mdash;that these farmers are the exceptions: but, perhaps, it may not be too much to hope that their exemplary industry and up-to-date approach will generally inspire that vigorous spirit of enterprise which is vital so that the small farm may continue to survive as a viable unit, capable of affording the economic security and yielding the cash returns which the occupier is entitled to expect in present-day conditions.</P>
    <P>Our aim is to take all practicable steps to improve the standard of living on the smaller farms, which have for so long been such a typical feature of the Irish scene.  A great deal has already been done or put in train towards providing amenities for the farming community generally, in the form of improved housing, better roads, electricity, piped water supply and so on&mdash;all of which are designed to make life on the land easier and to keep those of our people who are wedded to that life from falling too far behind the ever-improving standards to which other elements of the community nowadays aspire.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the availability of the facilities I have mentioned is just as important to the small farmer as to the more extensive landowner.  However, the small farm gives rise to difficulties which are not generally encountered in the economy of the larger type of holding.  For that reason, something more than the mere provision of these amenities is essential if a higher standard of living on the small farm is to be secured and maintained.  The answer seems to lie in increased productivity, coupled with improved marketing.  At present, the Government is carrying out a systematic examination of the possibilities of increasing the output of the smaller farms&mdash;an examination which will include a study of the technical and marketing possibilities and also of the organisational changes which may be necessary in various small-farm areas.  Meanwhile, the Land Commission, within the limits of its resources, will press on with its <Col N="1307" /> measures for alleviating rural congestion wherever it exists.</P>
    <P>The recent Census of Population questionnaire contained a query aimed at the compilation of up-to-date statistics of holdings in the various size-groups in the occupation of farmers. When the census returns are analysed, it should be possible to discuss the incidence of current congestion on a precise statistical groundwork.  In the meantime, however, the existing information suffices to show that the congestion problem is still far from being solved and that the claims of those already on the land in an uneconomic way must take precedence over other aspiring groups of applicants for land which becomes available to the Land Commission for division.</P>
    <P>Farming competence will continue to be an important determining factor in the selection of allottees.  The objective must be to put Land Commission land into the possession of allottees of proved agricultural ability, whose experience and competence give clear promise that their allotments will be intensively worked to the advantage of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The past year has been one of sustained progress on the part of the Land Commission, with record-breaking results in some spheres.  It is only fitting, therefore, that, before concluding, I should express to the staff, both indoor and outdoor, my appreciation of their good work.  The moneys provided under this Vote will be devoted to a continuation of this important work.  With confidence, I recommend the Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of saying that, having listened very carefully and attentively to the Minister's speech, I could find in it no new proposals.  It contained no declaration of future land policy.  It did not convey either to the House or to the country any suggestion of any serious effort to eliminate the many grievances prevailing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister most sincerely <Col N="1308" /> on his conversion to the usefulness of the Land Act of 1950.  In his statement he referred to the fact that last year expenditure on cash purchases amounted to almost £75,000.  The total area purchased was 1,296 acres as compared with 1,032 acres in the previous year.  He said substantial new cash purchases are being entered into this year. In 1950, when the inter-Party Government were piloting this Act through the House, there was a great deal of opposition to it from the Fianna Fáil Party.  That Act has proved one of the most progressive pieces of legislation ever passed by this House.  It was provided in that Act that employees would receive certain gratuities and compensation if they lost their employment as the result of the taking over of any farm.  It was provided that the Land Commission could purchase land on the open market and pay the full market value for it.</P>
    <P>The 1950 Act is alone responsible for whatever degree of progress the Minister now claims the Land Commission made over the last two years. The Minister referred to the increased acreage acquired, to the increased number of allottees, the increased number of purchases, the greater purchase of land on the open market.  It must be borne in mind that none of these would have been possible were it not for the 1950 Act.  For a long number of years the Land Commission was known as a very big body that moved very, very slowly.  It certainly moves slowly still but it now has machinery available to it to enable it to move more quickly.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister the importance of buying land on the open market.  When a large farm comes on the market and there are uneconomic holders, cottage tenants, farmers' sons, old I.R.A., that farm should be purchased on the open market by the Land Commission under the 1950 Act and those applying for land should be given it.  I cannot understand why the Land Commission has failed to act more effectively in such purchases.  The payment of the full market value encourages owners to dispose of their land.</P>
    <P>In this country we have a number of very extensive farms.  In close <Col N="1309" /> proximity to them there are many small and uneconomic holders.  The Minister must be aware that many large farms are set in conacre.  Under the conacre system many people in the Midlands are ekeing out an existence and paying as much as £25 per acre for conacre for tillage.  Small farmers with a valuation of £12 to £15 take land under this system.  Generally, when they have paid for the seed, the manure, and the cultivation of the land they are very often poorer in the Autumn than they were when they entered on the land in the Spring.  I suggest a special survey should be made by the Land Commission of all land let under the conacre system and a close examination should be made of the system.  They have the power and the right to do so.</P>
    <P>There are many young farmers who would be prepared to lease a farm at an annual rent.  The Land Commission should put such a scheme into operation so that any capital these young men would possess could be available for stock and equipment.  Many of them may or may not have done farm apprenticeship courses but there must be a large number of them born and reared on the land who want to stay on the land if they can do so.  The farm on which they have been reared may be available for only one of them unless it is an exceptionally big one. Many farmers' sons are leaving the land today not because they are eager to do so but because it will not provide a livelihood for them.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend the Land Commission to carry out an up-to-date survey.  The present activities of the Land Commission must be considered out of date.  Many of our land problems in rural Ireland call for efficient and speedy action.  I have often said, and it is no harm to repeat it on this Estimate, that the Land Commission is bound up in many legal entanglements. The Minister should endeavour to release the Land Commission from these entanglements and from the many old Land Acts and regulations which hinder them from bringing about greater progress.  An up-to-date land policy should be formulated to resolve our land problems.</P>
    <P>Very many of our smallholders have <Col N="1310" /> to seek other employment with Bord na Móna or working on roads with the various county councils throughout the country, the reason being that they cannot get a living on their holdings. In parts of my own constituency and elsewhere there are many cottage tenants who would be anxious to work land.  Many of them have to take land on conacre.  Many of them cannot get the grass of a cow.  The attention of the Land Commission has been directed to the fact that many of these smallholders have to graze their cows on the high road.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer the Minister to the report of the Investment Advisory Committee which recommended that lands held by the State should be rented where suitable and short leases made available to promising young men.  I would like to ask the Minister if the Land Commission has studied the report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee and whether they have given that recommendation serious consideration. It is no harm to remind the Minister that in <i>Economic Development</i>, Mr. Whitaker recommends some form of State aid by which aspiring young farmers would be enabled to rent land.  That is the idea I expressed a few moments ago.  When a first-class economist, such as Mr. Whitaker is, with a knowledge of rural Ireland and its problems, makes that suggestion it should be given serious consideration. However, the Minister for Lands neither this year nor last year has made any reference whatsoever to the recommendations made by Mr. Whitaker in <i>Economic Development</i> or to the wise suggestions contained in the Capital Investment Advisory Committee's Report.  The one way in which the Minister can achieve some progress is to give serious thought to those documents.</P>
    <P>This is a problem which must be tackled.  It cannot be said that we have not got the land available.  We have the land available.  That brings me to the point with reference to the statement made by the Minister concerning the purchase of land by aliens.  No matter what the Minister may say, that has become a national problem.  We know <Col N="1311" /> very well that there are aliens purchasing large tracts of land here and we also know that there are many young farmers and creditworthy farmers' sons &mdash;&ldquo;the aspiring farmer&rdquo; as Mr. Whitaker referred to them&mdash;who would be only too glad to rent or lease portions of those lands.  The Land Commission must know when an extensive holding is on the public market and it should be much easier for the Land Commission as a State-backed organisation to enter into the market competitively even with the Germans or any group of aliens, and to purchase the land to relieve congestion&mdash;to give it out to the aspiring farmer either on a rented or leased basis.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has heard of Fintan Lalor.  One of the phrases commonly associated with Fintan Lalor was that the land of Ireland was for the people of Ireland, to have and to hold from God who gave it.  We are now reaching the stage when fine farms of good agricultural land are being bought up by people from the four corners of the world and we are told here now by the Minister, just as we were told when Fine Gael brought in a Private Members' Bill which was introduced by the Leader of the Opposition to deal with the buying of agricultural land by foreigners, that it was not a problem.</P>
    <P>Deputies who represent rural constituencies know that there has been a great deal of comment from the general public, even from some of our Bishops.  Quite recently the Bishop of Cork referred to the fact that Ireland was becoming a country in which there were land hungry aliens.  The Fine Gael Party introduced a Private Members' Bill which merely required the Land Commission to establish a register in which would be kept a record of the nationality of persons buying Irish land.  The Land Commission did not see that such a register would serve any useful purpose.  All the details to be kept in such a register would be details relating to the area of the land, the valuation and the purchase price of the land so that such details would be available.  I fail to see why the Government, when <Col N="1312" /> asked by the main Opposition to accept a Bill of that kind, which was merely to keep a very accurate account of the manner in which the land of the country was being bought up by aliens, would not immediately agree that this was a problem which they could not allow to go unchecked. It is a strange state of affairs, when there are young creditworthy farmers' sons, smallholders, small farmers, paying up to £25 to £30 per acre for conacre and the Land Commission receiving numerous applications for land, to see that a non-national's chequebook will purchase the finest of agricultural holdings in this country.</P>
    <P>It is entirely wrong for any Government to allow the main source of wealth&mdash;and the main source of wealth in any country is its land &mdash; to be bought up in this way.  As a result of the Land Reclamation Scheme we now have a million more acres of land in this country than we had some years ago.  This area has been converted from waste land, rocky land and land growing rushes, etc.  But while we have a million acres reclaimed, how many acres have we now lost to foreigners? I feel that the situation is very serious and one in which the Government are not in touch with the people.  The policy of the Government in this matter should be reviewed and some practical steps taken to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Many tributes were paid in this House to the wise statement which the German Minister to Ireland addressed to his own countrymen.  I think the German Minister deserves to be congratulated for the wise words of advice which he gave to his countrymen.  We know very well that nobody is more welcome to industrial sites; foreigners will be facilitated in acquiring industrial sites, but there is a limit to such facilities and when it comes to first-class agricultural land, some steps should be adopted to prevent such land falling into the hands of non-nationals. If it is on the public market, the owner should be given the benefits of the laws that we have and the full market value paid to him.  The State should acquire the lands and give them out on a rented or leased basis to creditworthy farmers' sons or to <Col N="1313" /> those who are at present paying very high prices for land on the conacre system.</P>
    <P>It has been said many times on this side of the House and I want to repeat that we must have private ownership of land.  The Christian community is based on private ownership.  Private ownership must have the right of free sale.  God forbid that we should ever experience in this country a denial of the right of a man to do what he likes with his own property.  Free sale has been cherished and established in this country.  No matter what Government reigns or rules in future I hope free sale will be maintained and safeguarded for all our people who own private property.</P>
    <P>It is only right that we should show respect for this principle and anxiety to preserve it but we have coming on the market holdings such as those to which I have referred and it is not outside the bounds of possibility to have some institution, if not the Land Commission, set up by the Department of Lands, for the purchase of such lands. I should like to direct the attention of the Minister for Lands to the article <i>Rural Problems and Possibilities</i> by the Most Reverend William J. Philbin, D.D., Lord Bishop of Clonfert.  I do not know if the Minister has read it.  If he has not, I recommend that he should read it.</P>
    <P>The Bishop of Clonfert deals wisely and honestly with the problem which we are now debating in this House and also refers to the fact that it is not outside the bounds of possibility that there should be some institution, perhaps in the nature of a land bank, to which people who want to dispose of land can have recourse and from which people who want land on a rented or other basis can obtain land.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered why in formulating land policy the persons who sat on the Capital Investment Advisory Committee, such as Mr. Whitaker and the Bishop of Clonfert, were not consulted and their advice sought because they are in touch with the many evils associated with the land problems in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands should give this country a practical progressive land <Col N="1314" /> policy that would end the agitations, that would secure people in their land, that would prevent aliens from making a happy hunting ground of this country and living on the fat of the land while small farmers were paying the last halfpenny they possess for conacre land.  Even in this, his last year of office, he should have endeavoured to give the country an idea of what the future land policy of the Fianna Fáil Party would be.  He comes into the House and gives a preamble of the achievements under the 1950 Land Act, which was sponsored by Deputy Blowick and backed by the inter-Party Government.  If you take away the 1950 Land Act the Minister would not have been able to present to this House today a single achievement.</P>
    <P>I want to advise the Minister for Lands to get down to realities in this matter.  Life is completely disappearing from rural Ireland.  Parish schools are closing down.  Parish halls have closed down.  Many small farmers have put padlocks on their doors and galvanised iron on their windows and have gone away.  The disappearance of the parish is becoming a source of anxiety and worry to many people in rural Ireland. Investigations and enquiries are being held in a number of dioceses into the causes of the disappearance of parish populations.  It must be known to the Minister for Education that parish schools are closing down for want of pupils.  That is due to wrong distribution of land.  It is the aim of all of us and it is laid down in our Constitution that as many families as possible should be established on the land.  The most serious problem facing the country today is the fact that the population of rural Ireland consist mainly of young children and very old people.  The in-betweens have gone.</P>
    <P>When the general election campaign opens up many Deputies who sit behind the Fianna Fáil Government will have their eyes opened.  They will notice that the audiences at their meetings will comprise the very old and the very young.  The problem can only be remedied by proper distribution of the available land.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned with the drift from the land.  It should be the concern <Col N="1315" /> of any Government.  It is the concern of every Deputy.  The land of Ireland should be capable of increased production and of maintaining a higher population.  The decline in the rural population due to emigration and to the movement of complete households should have the serious consideration of the Government.</P>
    <P>What functions will a Government have if there are no people to be ruled?  There are many parts of the West of Ireland and the Midlands to-day from which the rural population is disappearing and is being replaced in many instances by foreigners who are buying up land.  Our policy should be to increase the number of economic small farms and to have as many families as possible living and getting a living on the land.</P>
    <P>Let us consider for a moment the policy of the Land Commission with regard to the economic holding.  Every Deputy knows that the Land Commission are giving out portions of land insufficient in size to provide a livelihood for the allottees.  I should like to hear from the Minister what he would consider the size of an economic farm should be.  Most people favour not less than 35 acres.  I feel the size of an economic farm should not be less than 45 acres.  If a man has between 45 and 50 acres, he can have a certain amount of tillage, his own hay, his own grazing and his own meadow.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission are considering relieving congestion they should take into account that many of the people to whom they have given land still have to take land on conacre in order to supplement what they have obtained from the Land Commission. That shows, of course, that the right type of people were selected, because they have worked the land well and wisely.  But it also shows that in the division of a big estate it might be better to allocate one or two farms less, in order to give those receiving the land a holding large enough to live out of.  In that way they would be independent of work on the bogs and on the roads and they would not have to take land on conacre.</P>
    <P>A man who takes land on conacre <Col N="1316" /> will never make money out of it The land may be worked by somebody else next year.  The man taking it on conacre may lime it and manure it, work it in the best possible way, but he is merely working for the person who owns the land and the auctioneer who gives it to him.  I have great sympathy for the people taking land on conacre. It is high time this whole policy were reviewed in the light of an up-to-date and progressive land policy.</P>
    <P>We must appreciate the difficulties of the Land Commission.  It is very easy to criticise.  Deputies know from the volume of callers and post they receive that there are more applicants for land than the Land Commission have land to give.  Naturally, a sharp sense of grievance and disappointment is felt by those who apply for land and do not get it.  If the Land Comsion have not sufficient land to respond favourably to all applications, may we suggest from this side of the House that when land comes on the public market, the Land Commission should buy it at the full market value and that it should be used either to relieve congestion or given out on a rental basis to creditworthy farmers' sons?</P>
    <P>I agree that the improvement works carried out by the Land Commission, to which the Minister referred, works such as drainage, fencing and the erection and repair of out-offices, are works of very great importance.  But further schemes of improvement should be undertaken by the Land Commission.  Have the Land Commission obtained the advice of their engineering staff in relation to the question of the proximity of out-offices to the dwelling-house?  References have been made to the modern Land Commission residences erected in Westmeath and Laois.  No wonder the Minister singled out these modern designs for mention in his Estimate speech.  The plan and lay-out of the houses are certainly a great credit to the Land Commission, and it would be well worth while for Deputies to visit these new holdings to get an idea of their modern design.  We would be unreasonable if we did not pay a tribute to the ability of the architectural section of the Land Commission in providing such attractive residences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> In the experimental houses erected in Westmeath and Laois the out-offices are a reasonable distance away from the dwellinghouse.  That cannot be said of most of the other Land Commission houses.  It can be an advantage to have all the out-offices within a stone's throw of the house, but it can also be a great disadvantage.  The out-offices should be a reasonable distance from the house.  The holding should also be provided with a reasonably large farmyard in which stabling, cowhouses, haggard, grain store and hay and straw ricks can be kept together at the rear of the house but a reasonable distance away.  I should like to place on record the appreciation of the general public for the up-to-date design of the houses to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have a lot of work to do in regard to roadmaking.  It is very little use to provide a holding unless you can provide a right-of-way into it.  We had the disgraceful spectacle of the Dowling estate at Castlefleming, near Errill, County Laois, where it took the Land Commission several months to come to a decision to provide the allottees with a right-of-way to their lands.  Eventually, the problem was solved.  The Land Commission did their best, and I admit that everybody in the locality was not 100 per cent. reasonable. In cases where the Land Commision are dividing large holdings, they should first consider the legal difficulties in regard to the provision of rights-of-way.  The right-of-way should be safeguarded first.  It is extraordinary that a man can be provided with land but that it can be within the power of a group of neighbours to prevent him from entering thereon.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Minister's statement in regard to game councils and the provision of grants.  I welcome this as a step in the right direction. There is a great source of wealth in the preservation of our game.  Wonderful progress has been made by the Inland Fisheries Trust, but we can deal with that on another Estimate.  I want to suggest to the Minister that it would be a very wise move to establish a National Game Council similar in responsibility to the Inland Fisheries Trust.  The wonderful achievements of the Inland Fisheries Trust should encourage <Col N="1318" /> the Minister to take this step in regard to our very valuable game preserves.</P>
    <P>In this country we are blessed with the finest inland fisheries in the world. We can offer them with pride to tourists.  We also have some of the best game preserves in the world and I now want to pay a special tribute to the regional game councils set up throughout the country.  I am glad that the Minister is providing certain grants to help them.  As I said, the Minister would be very well advised to establish a national game body who would be responsible for the allocation of the grants the Minister says will be made available for game preservation.  Such a body could have similar responsibilities in respect to game preservation and cultivation as the Inland Fisheries Trust has in connection with our rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>Committees of agriculture in many counties have provided substantial grants to local game councils.  Bord Fáilte have also been responsible for financial help to such councils, but now it is proposed that Bord Fáilte grants should no longer be available having regard to the grants which will in future be forthcoming under this Vote.  I know that Bord Fáilte did very good work in this regard and I realise very well the amount of money they have contributed towards game preservation in different districts throughout the country, but I cannot agree that they should not continue to do this work apart altogether from the money that would be made available by the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>I hope the grants the Minister will give will be sufficiently generous to enable the game councils to perform their duties efficiently and effectively but at the same time I would advise the Minister to co-ordinate the work of these councils under one national body.  Many Deputies may not realise the importance of this work.  They do know, however, that next to agriculture comes the tourist industry.  It has been built up by the attractiveness of our scenery and by our fisheries.  It could be added to by first class game preserves.  The matter is too important to be handled by the Irish Land Commission alone.  Courageous and <Col N="1319" /> scientific steps are needed and that is why I suggest the work should be in the hands of a national game preservation council.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the vesting of holdings and said that the number vested last year was 1,583.  He went on to say that there were 10,500 still awaiting vesting on March 31st last. I know that vesting must be a very tedious process but I would ask the Minister to try and get the vesting section of his Department to wipe off the arrears as soon as possible.  The vesting of those holdings has been going on for a considerable number of years and I think it is time that all the energies of the Irish Land Commission were turned on the matter. To accelerate the work I would advise the Minister to get the legal section and the vesting section of the Department to work together on this job.</P>
    <P>The Minister says there has been great progress in land resettlement during the past year.  That is very good news but I think that a greater effort could be made in this regard. In the course of his statement the Minister says that up to March 31st last 219 new dwellings had been built, 330 new outoffices had been erected, and 16 houses had been constructed. One of the great problems in rural Ireland to-day is the poor housing of small farmers.  The Department of Local Government provide grants, County Councils provide supplementary grants but when you come to the holdings with a valuation of above £20 you will find the owner is unable to find sufficient money to build a new house.  Very often he cannot obtain a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act because his title may not be in order or there may be other difficulties.  The sanctioning of a loan may be a managerial function and County Managers are very careful that repayment is guaranteed.  Consequently, very many small farmers in Ireland are to-day living in mud-walled, thatched cottages.  Young families are being brought up in these very small, mud-walled thatched cabins.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should formulate a scheme whereby small farmers <Col N="1320" /> can be provided with houses and, as at the time when Section B of the Land Project was operating, the cost should be repayable over 30, 40 or 50 years and put on to the rent.  The Land Commission are only providing houses on holdings they now allocate and their failure to provide houses for small farmers up to that is notable.  They have a responsibility to all the tenants.  They give loans&mdash;very seldom grants&mdash;of £100 or £200 in cases where the Department of Local Government have already sanctioned a reconstruction grant or a grant in respect of a new house.  That does not go far enough. Our biggest problem is properly to house the small farmer for whom the local authority can do nothing, the man without means dependent on what he gets from the harvest.  Such families are severely handicapped and the Minister who represents a rural constituency must be aware of this problem which is a cause of great discomfort and embarrassment.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should provide houses for small farmers.  Let the next generation pay.  Why should one generation toil and slave since the house will be passed on to the next?  This would be a good, long term investment. We are too anxious for a quick pay-off. We want our cash and credits balancing and our accounts in order.  That may be good book-keeping but is of little use to those with no house and no means of getting one.  That is why we need long term planning.  The Land Commission should provide every small farmer who needs a house and cannot provide it himself with a house and let his sons or his successors pay for it. The Minister for Finance and his advisers may not think that is very sound but I feel it is a policy that will eventually pay because it will keep the people at home and, above all, ensure that those needing houses will get them. Local authorities cannot provide these houses: they have no means of getting money for them.  The Land Commission is the only body that can come to the rescue and I beg the Minister and the Land Commission to consider the matter seriously.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Shannon flooding.  Those who represent constituencies <Col N="1321" /> adjoining the Shannon are well aware of the problem existing there for many years.  A considerable amount of money has been spent and valuable work undertaken but that will not prevent lands in the area from being flooded.  I have often wondered why the Land Commission, in conjunction with the Board of Works or with the Forestry Section of the Minister's Department, did not give the Shannon valley question more prominence from the points of view of drainage or afforestation if either is possible.  Now we find the people will still be living on those holdings, still dreading the horrors of floods, of livestock being lost, of being marooned for weeks.  I hope the efforts of the good people in the Shannon valley when funds had to be put up by voluntary subscription and the aid of the Army had to be obtained to bring the livestock and sometimes the owners to dry land will not be forgotten. The problem should be tackled more courageously by the Department of Lands.  They should not wait for some disaster to take place in the Shannon valley but should be fully prepared for it.</P>
    <P>After one very serious flooding, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, I was sent by the Minister to that area for a considerable time with a view to submitting a report to the Government.  There are many obstructions on the Shannon which should be removed.  If the Minister has responsibilities in this respect&mdash;he has referred to it in his speech&mdash;it is of concern to his Department particularly in view of the amount of money already spent.  The Department should consider spending some money on removing the islands and obstructions.  I believe the weir at Meelick is responsible for a good deal of the distress the area has experienced.  According to the oldest inhabitants of the area it is the weir that is doing all the damage.  Now that we have electric power turf burning stations and so on it is impossible that the weir at Meelick has not gone out of date.  Has the Department examined the possibility of removing the weir and allowing the water held back from Meelick to Athlone to have a <Col N="1322" /> free run?  The Land Commission would be well advised to examine the possibility of removing the weir and replacing it by some modern device, at the same time allowing a free flow of water.</P>
    <P>I wonder if it would be wise to spend a considerable amount of money removing islands in the Shannon or whether, if that were done, the current would reconstitute these islands after a period of time.  It would be foolish to expend substantial sums removing the islands if results proved negative in the long run.  I know islands near Shannonbridge and some between Shannon Harbour and Banagher that could be removed.  An effort should be made to have that work undertaken.</P>
    <P>I represent a constituency intimately concerned with the Shannon.  The problem is one which concerns the county councils of Leitrim, Westmeath, Roscommon, Galway, Offaly, North Tipperary and, in some instances, Clare.  A permanent board should be set up charged with responsibility for relieving the plight of those in the Shannon area.  It must be a considerable strain on departmental funds to have to provide aid frequently. County councils should have some responsibility in this matter.  There should be a contribution from the councils so that there will be funds available to meet any emergency. There should be representatives of the councils, of the E.S.B., of the Shannon Navigation, on the board.  At the moment the E.S.B., the Shannon Navigation, the Board of Works and the Department of Lands all have some responsibility.  The moment the floods hit responsibility is shelved by all of them.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to plan when there is no immediate problem to be tackled and when the position can be examined coolly and calmly.  The problem has existed for the past thirty years.  There is nothing in the Minister's speech which gives any hope of an early solution.  Some people have higher farmyards and some have new houses, but there are still many in the flooded areas.  They have been offered alternative accommodation, but they will not leave.  One should not blame them for that.  Generations before <Col N="1323" /> them were born and bred in these houses and it is not easy for people to pull up roots.  The Minister as the responsible Minister should give a lead and not just lipservice when an emergency arises.</P>
    <P>I can never understand why certain areas in the Shannon Valley were selected to receive benefits while other areas were excluded.  Lusmagh has been excluded. The lands there are continuously flooded.  The people have received not one penny piece.  I appeal to the Minister to include Shannon Harbour, the district around Shannonbridge, Banagher, and the parish of Lusmagh. A very small portion of Offaly is included. It is hardly fair.</P>
    <P>There was nothing new in the Minister's speech.  He is probably facing this House for the last time in the lifetime of this Dáil.  I had hoped we might have had an Estimate which would give some hope of a revival in relation to land and which would contain practical proposals. There was nothing practical in the Minister's speech.  The Minister blew his own trumpet.  He patted himself on the back.  But all the achievements of which he boasted were made possible by the Land Act of 1950, the Act he opposed in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>I am keenly disappointed at the lack of policy, the lack of foresight and the lack of understanding shown by the Minister's speech in relation to the problems that exist in rural Ireland.  Indeed, his speech carries in it something of political mourning because, if it were not for the 1950 Act, which was so strenuously opposed by Fianna Fáil, and which they <Col N="1324" /> would oppose again tomorrow if they had the chance, nothing could have been achieved.  The Minister was honourable enough to refer to the Act on at least four or five occasions in the course of his speech.  Because there is so little hope for the future, I am filled with a certain uneasiness.  The land problem is not being tackled as it should. The Minister holds out no hope of implementing a policy based on the principles enunciated by Fintan Lawlor: &ldquo;The soil of Ireland for the people of Ireland, to have and to hold from God alone who gave it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputies appreciate the very comprehensive statement of progress and solid achievement by the Department of Lands under the direction of the present Minister.  The speech of the Deputy who has just sat down is amazing in many ways.  The number of contradictions in it are stupefying. Land was being divided in this country long before 1950.  In his statement the Minister has divided his programme and policy on two lines.  One part referred to what was being done for the people who had already got allotments and the other referred to what it was proposed to do for them and for those who in future would get divided lands.  The Minister set out the amenities that were being provided, water supplies for the homes and roads.</P>
      <P>I intend to speak particularly on those topics.  The county council in Cork has decided that where roads are brought up to the standard of local roadways they will take them over and maintain them.  Where there are through roads which can be classed as of general public utility there is not a very serious problem but many cul-de-sac roads undoubtedly present a problem.  That should be tackled and any arrears of work there should be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals are usually sent to the Special Employment Schemes office of the Board of Works and under a new system where a smaller local contribution is involved these holders make a contribution towards improvement of these roads.  However, in many cases there are only three, four or five towns; <Col N="1325" /> consequently their resources are very small and the contributions are beyond their capacity to pay.  In some instances the Board of Works is agreeable to spread the work over two years so that all the charges will not come upon them altogether.  That is very wise, but if the Land Commission would come to the assistance of the land holders in these divided estates by making a contribution much good work that is waiting to be done for years could be accomplished.  The work needs to be done urgently.  In some cases creamery lorries will not enter these roadways unless they are improved very speedily.  It is really a great hardship on the people living there and depending on them.</P>
    <P>The provision of wells and water supplies of a modern kind to suit the holders of these lands is also being undertaken and I hope that progress will be continued and that these amenities that are a feature of modern life will not be denied to these small holders by reason of financial difficulties.  Every encouragement should be given to the provision of shelter belts which would act both as a protection and as a scenic attraction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also spoke about free sale and at the same time suggested that the Land Commission should acquire land and enter into the open market for this purpose which is hardly compatible with free sale.  We cannot embark on a policy which will upset the traditional life of our community and deprive them of the opportunity of purchasing land that suits them when it becomes available.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission sometimes can acquire big holdings or holdings offered to them by the owners without upsetting that general principle and I think they are working on those lines. Very big holdings beyond the capacity of modern farmers to work and pay rates on, including very big, cumbersome houses and all the rest, are the types of holding the Land Commission should acquire for the local uneconomic holders.</P>
    <P>The last speaker also mentioned&mdash;and I think it should be borne in mind&mdash; that farmers' sons who have shown initiative in taking conacre demonstrated <Col N="1326" /> their capacity to work it and cottiers, who show a progressive spirit, should receive consideration.  Of course the Land Commission is tied by certain rules and regulations which often cause local anxiety and contention.  However, I am sure that the Land Commission will from year to year amend the regulations to meet the changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>Those who have been deprived of their employment on holdings acquired by the Land Commission should get consideration.  Sometimes they get a little portion of accommodation land.  They might have a few sheep or a poultry run on the land. When the land is taken over by the Land Commission they are deprived of it and while they are waiting to have that land divided the scheme of things is entirely altered for them. Those who have been deprived of their employment on this land should be the first to receive consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to cover all the points raised by the Minister.  His statement dealt adequately with every aspect of the land problem, the drainage of the land and its improvement, the planting of trees, the improvement of dwellings and so on.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the few points I have raised.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not present to hear the Minister's statement in connection with land division.  I am sure it was a reasonable statement and that the Estimate got full discussion because it bears on the lives and fortunes of many people. I have spoken here during the past 25 years about land division and I believe splendid work has been done by the Land Commission under all Governments.  The whole face of the country in many places has been changed, particularly in my own county.  I am satisfied that the work done will leave lasting benefits.  The one unfortunate thing about it was that in the earlier years the Land Commission thought fit to make the holdings too small and that is a problem which is left with us.  We made holdings of 22 or 23 acres of land on which a family cannot be reared. There was a time, perhaps, when that was good enough but you just cannot <Col N="1327" /> do that today.  I am glad that the Land Commission has changed its hand and is now bringing the holdings up to 27 or 30 acres.  I am satisfied that if a man gets 30 acres of land he is getting a foundation on which he can live and rear a family decently.</P>
      <P>Many people in this country hold that there should be no land division and that it is a terrible thing to divide up the big estates.  I hold that what we require is to plant as many people on the land as we possibly can.  That is the duty which devolves on the Land Commission and that is what they are doing.  We are quite satisfied that the benefits of that work will be found in later years when those people get properly established.  It is the duty of the large landowners in this country to realize that they have a duty to the underdog.  They have a bigger share of the wealth of the country and, when they find that people around them are in poor circumstances, it is their duty as Christians to look around them to see what they can do.  If they have too much land, it is not alone the duty of the Land Commission to take it from them but it is their duty to offer it to the Land Commission, to make restitution in many cases for the wrongs of other years.</P>
      <P>In arranging new holdings I find that many men get bad holdings, the tail end of estates, while the large man who may be brought in from the West of Ireland, because he had a big holding there, gets the cream of the land. He can almost come in and point out what he wants.  We get other men, perhaps from County Meath who get rushy, watery, sedgy wasteland.  That is unfair. I know some of the land that some men in my county got and it is a public disgrace to give them such land.  They would hardly be able to find one of their cows in the morning in fields of rushes and sedge.  They see right beside them a man who may come from Galway getting all the good land and perhaps all the water facilities that go with it.  Each man should get his fair share of good and bad land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard a few years ago, and we hear even still, that farmers' sons who had no hope under the present Land <Col N="1328" /> Act of getting land would come under some scheme, and that the Minister, the N.F.A. and other organisations were trying to work out a scheme. There is no use working out a scheme if it comes into operation only in their old age.  We should know where we stand&mdash;whether the farmers' sons are to get a chance or whether they have to emigrate.  I think it time that that scheme was formulated.  As far as my own county is concerned, there is no hope at present of a farmer's son getting land or no hope of a farmer's son being able to buy land because there are big men from other countries, and our own country, who can offer twice the amount.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Land Commission have changed their hand in recent years in connection with the type of houses being built.  There was a common pattern of house in this country for a number of years and we were sick and tired of it.  Over the last few years, however, a splendid type of house is being built.  I want to see in those houses water, sewerage and light.  There is no reason why those should not be put into them now.  In the past, and even up to the present, there is no such thing as worrying about sanitary arrangements.  The Land Commission do nothing about it. They do nothing about electric light. Those are things which should be part and parcel of a new home and people are entitled to get those things.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have now thought fit to consult with the county engineer in the different areas in connection with the making of new roads and I am satisfied that the Land Commission are making reasonably good roads now.  As far as my county is concerned, where a road serves 4 or 5 holdings we take it over and make it a public road&mdash;even if it is a cul-de-sac.  We have taken over practically all the culs-de-sac in the County Meath which serve 3 or more families and made them public roads. We have done it with the ratepayers' money but they are satisfied that it is money well spent.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal of talk about large tracts of land being purchased by foreigners.  I am one of those who have no narrow or mean view about those <Col N="1329" /> things but I am satisfied that in a country like Ireland, where we are only emerging from a revolution before which for hundreds of years our people were denied their rights, it is only right that we should have the necessary finance and control to see that any large holding that comes on the market is purchased by the Irish Government and re-allotted to Irish-men in the interests of our own people. I am not against outsiders; they are perhaps as good in their own country as we are in ours but at the same time, we should do what Nigeria and other young countries are doing. No foreigner is allowed to purchase one acre of land but land can be leased to foreigners on fair terms.  We should do likewise.  If we allow foreigners to come in they should be permitted to get a lease of land but should not be allowed to purchase land outright. There are too many Irish people who are forced to emigrate and who have no hope of settling down and rearing a family in their own country.</P>
    <P>Some people point to what foreigners do with their big money in this country.  I have no regard for their big money.  The Irish people must come first.  What did we fight for?  Was it to allow foreigners to come in and purchase the land which had been confiscated and which we would not have if we had not fought for it?</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's duty to purchase any holding that comes on the market. The market value should be paid for it but the Land Commission should get control of it and divide it amongst our own people.  That is good, sound, national work.  I hope the Minister will see to it that the Land Commission will purchase holdings that come on the market or even those that do not come on the market.  There is a hidden way of doing these things. Sales can be put through overnight by auctioneers who are able to contact persons in England or other countries, perhaps India, before the Irish people know that the land is on the market. Foreigners should not be allowed to purchase land without the consent of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There is a drift from the land.  I do not blame the Fianna Fáil Government or the Fine Gael Government for that. <Col N="1330" /> In all the countries of the world there is a movement away from the land because men will not live on small holdings which involve hard labour when they can earn much more money in the cities.  If I were a young man trying to live on 20 acres I might be attracted by the easier living and higher wages I could get in the city.</P>
    <P>It will take a long time before the rot is stopped.  We must do everything we possibly can to place as many people as possible on the land.  The first step is to acquire any land that becomes available and to parcel it out to decent men of the right type and give each one sufficient land so that he can rear a family in decency and comfort.  If that is not done the position will deteriorate to the stage where we will be back where we were 40 years ago and the rich will buy all the land and the system of keeping a herd and a dog will reappear.  This House has the right to prevent that happening and should prevent it.  The Land Commission are in the best position to prevent it.  They can purchase the land that comes on the open market, pay a decent price for it, give satisfaction to the owners, and parcel out the land to families.  I do not mind whether it is given to families in my county or in other counties if it means the relief of congestion.  The men who should get the land are men who will take off their coats and work hard, not fly-by-nights who come in here and purchase land and upset the whole balance of our farming economy and, after four or five years, having got all the grants and subventions they possibly can from the Government, leave the land in a worse state than it was before they came in.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Agriculture saying yesterday&mdash;I do not think he meant a word of it&mdash;that he would receive with open arms those who would come in and take over the big houses. Those old houses should be blown sky-high. They were built with slave labour and the blood of decent men.  Two or three of them were blown up by the Land Commission in County Meath and I was delighted.  When they were levelled, fine young families came in and took over the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister may suggest that we are <Col N="1331" /> talking too much about foreigners coming in here.  We are not.  Ours is a Christian civilization and we want to maintain that position.  If other types of people are allowed to come in and buy land, in 40 or 50 years the nation will be as materialistic as a country can be and the next stage is Communism and then the country will be in the melting pot.  We can safeguard against that.</P>
    <P>I am speaking as an individualist.  I am leaving this House.  This may be my last speech.  I am retiring from public life.  I believe that there will always be enough of the right type of people in this House on all sides to ensure that progress will be made on the right lines. I have been as critical as anybody else of the Land Commission.  I was critical of the policy of bringing migrants to County Meath, because I believed in looking after my own people first but I am not narrow, mean, or despicable.  I like to see people being taken from a congested area and placed on good land.  That is good work and I want to see that proceeding side by side with the distribution of land to persons living in my county.  I should like to see land being given to farmers' sons.</P>
    <P>There is the Montgomery Estate in Ballivore, County Meath which was on the list for sale for a number of months. I do not think it has been sold as yet. Were the Land Commission interested in that estate?  They should have been. That estate should belong to the Irish people.  I hope the Land Commission will take it over and that decent people will be planted on it and that the old house on it will be blown sky-high.</P>
    <P>The Minister has promised that he will bring in a Bill in the not too far distant future in relation to the game preservation laws.  I would ask him to go slow because he must remember that the small farmers were exploited for generations and had no shooting rights or game rights of their own or on their neighbour's land.  They were not allowed to go outside their own boundary. Things have changed now.  We hear a lot about tourism and all that it is doing for the country, but we should think of our own people first and the tourists second.  If we thought of our own people first tourism would <Col N="1332" /> fit itself in in a proper way.  We must think of the Irish people first.</P>
    <P>The Government must be very cagey and very wary about bringing in game protection laws.  I find throughout the country that the sons of the exploiters are forming game protection associations in many areas.  That should be curbed.  Today the simple Irishman owns his own holding of 30, 40 or 100 acres and he is the man we are really concerned with.  We should brush aside those people who try to exploit us as we were exploited in the past. If we bring in game preservation laws let them be decent Irish laws for simple people.</P>
    <P>We always try to ape the stranger. One of the weaknesses of the Irish people is that we ape the stranger. Whether it is a rajah from India or a prince or princess from Britain we bow and scrape and we sit and listen with our mouths open to what they say.  It is time that we stopped taking our hats off to them and bowing and scraping.  Our game laws should be in the hands of the Irish farmers and not under the control of the exploiter.  We should have a little better Irish back bone and with decent laws for the Irish people we could do good work.</P>
    <P>I should like to say in conclusion that the Land Commission have done splendid work over the years.  Even before we ever had a native Government land division was going ahead under the Congested District Boards, and good work was done.  Good work is being done today.  I would ask the Minister to see that that good work is not stopped until every large holding is divided, until Irish farmers are planted on any holding that is too large, where they can live in decency and comfort in a good house with a good entrance to the home.  A foundation will then have been laid of which we can all be proud.</P>
    <P>This is not the place for playing the party game of whether Deputy Blowick or Deputy Moran did more as Minister for Lands.  They are both the same to me.  Good work was done under the present Minister, the previous Minister and his predecessor.  Good work was done over the years and as Act succeeded Act better work was done. We have learned from our mistakes. <Col N="1333" /> We put them right and we now have decent Irish homesteads of 37 or 40 acres with a good house and a few good out offices.  That is glorious and splendid work.  God grant that it will continue until the Irish people are planted on the land which belonged to their ancestors in days gone by.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister has found it possible to introduce a new subhead in his Estimate this year.  I want to congratulate him for showing earnestness in providing a sum of £7,500 in connection with the game preservation problem.  The last speaker exhorted the Minister to be rather conservative and to go slow in regard to any legislation that might be necessary to bring the game laws up to date.  I do not propose to go into that aspect of the matter at the moment.</P>
      <P>I feel that the present game preservation laws, and particularly the 1930 Act, are sufficient to enable us to build a good structure.  The game potentialities of rural Ireland have been neglected for many years.  Fishing and other sporting activities have come into the limelight by the publicity which was given in recent times to the sporting attractions of the country which were left in the background for far too long.</P>
      <P>The sum, which is a modest sum but at least something to generate action, is in my opinion a good start. With regard to the suggestions that have been made in connection with the way the money is to be spent, I hope the Minister will not mind if I offer one or two suggestions for his consideration. I appreciate that the Minister has asked the regional game councils and other bodies connected with game rights and game development to make suggestions.  That was highly desirable, and I am sure there is very little need to impress on the Minister that the first thing we want is the general co-operation of the people who own the land to which game rights are attached.  As Deputy Giles said the landowners treasure very much the game rights on their holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion that attitude of mind is due to the fight which had to be waged for many years to get the landlords <Col N="1334" /> to pass over the game rights to the tenants.  We all know that prior to the Land Acts the landlord was the prime property owner and he reserved his game rights for himself and his friends.  That applied to fishing as well as to other types of game, and it was only after a very strenuous fight that the tenants won the battle and were awarded the game rights with the land they purchased.</P>
    <P>The position as I find it is that game rights have very valuable potential.  It should be brought home to the landowners that it has a cash dividend attached to it.  If that were done it would be quite easy to get their co-operation. By and large the game rights, particularly the shooting rights on moorland, were of little or no value and the landowners usually gave them free of charge to their friends.  The same applied to river fisheries.  Now the tide has turned the other way. These amenities are now on the market and can fetch good rents where there is a proper scheme of protection.  Once the Minister can deal with the property owners he will find that a general scheme of co-operation will be more readily forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Those voluntary game protection committees which were set up in recent times are to be highly commended for the work they have undertaken and the measure of success they have achieved in the course of a short few years.  The main difficulty in this country is to get that appreciation of the necessity of the preservation of game in all its forms.  A good deal of destruction of game has taken place, not so much by vermin but because of fires in moorlands and other types of mountain lands which lend themselves very readily to damage from that source at certain periods of the year.  I do not know if it is a serious offence at the moment to cause a fire in that type of land, but I take it that provision will be made for that abuse in any legislation that may be introduced.</P>
    <P>I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that in any scheme he is considering for game preservation an <Col N="1335" /> amount of money might be spent as a bonus to people who will discover fires and without reporting them to the authorities take the initiative and put them out by voluntary effort.  What is important in the case of a mountain fire is immediate action.  The usual procedure seems to be to report it to the local Gardaí or to the property owner, but I feel that our people should be educated to the necessity of taking immediate local action and controlling the extent of damage which might otherwise be very considerable.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the best way to run a voluntary game organisation would be on similar lines to the Board of Fishery Conservators at the moment and there is a lot to be said for the voluntary spirit which can still be got among sporting organisations.  Deputy Flanagan suggested to the Minister that this problem was one that could best be handled by a Government or a semi-Government board similar to the Inland Fisheries Trust.  I do not agree at all.  We want local co-operation, local initiative, and that could best be got from the type of organisation already set up in various parts of the country to take care of this problem.</P>
    <P>The division of land has been dealt with very fully this evening.  The Land Commission is generally charged with lack of foresight, lack of appreciation of the wants of our people.  I do not admit that is true at any time.  If it were true it would not be the fault of the Land Commission but of the legislators, of this House, who make the policy.  I think under the circumstances the Land Commission is doing a wonderful job.  I have some experience of its work in my constituency and in other parts of the country and any operation of theirs is well done.  It is done expeditiously and as cheaply as any other organisation would do it. There is not the slightest doubt that they are doing their work to a very high degree of perfection and at the most economic cost possible.  I feel, however, that a slight change is necessary in the general land settlement policy of the Government and some Government will have to initiate that <Col N="1336" /> change.  I would exhort the Minister to have this examined&mdash;if he has not already done so.</P>
    <P>The question of congestion and migration has been dealt with for years and we must be reaching saturation point in either one aspect or the other. I feel that the congestion problem has been eased to a very great extent by now.  We have been trying very actively to relieve congestion for the past 30 years and for that reason it is quite obvious that sooner or later we will get to the end of the road.  We have got quite a distance at the present moment. I would submit very respectfully to the Minister that in future years it should be practicable to make available to a certain type of allottee a small proportion&mdash;I will suggest ten per cent. for a start&mdash;of whatever land is acquired. Speakers have suggested that sons of small farmers should be lined up for parcels of land under the system of Division of the Land Commission as it is at the moment.  I agree with that suggestion and I am inclined to go further.</P>
    <P>There is a type of person who must get consideration in the matter of land division and that person is the agricultural worker.  With the deplorable flight from the land and the difficulty experienced by farmers and landowners in getting hired labour to remain on the land and work on it consistently for a fair period each year we have a position at the moment that is anything but satisfactory.  For large landowners and large farmers the provision of labour is a very serious problem.  Every inducement by way of cash-wage payments, and certain other perquisites have been introduced but nevertheless they do not seem to be enough to get over the difficulty.  This difficulty arises from the fact that agricultural workers have no incentive as they would have in industry and we must start at some stage to provide that incentive.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the answer to the problem is to consider the worker who has served for a number of years in continuous employment on a farm or in any agricultural activity for an allotment of land under some scheme or other.  I appreciate that it is difficult to do it.  At the same time I submit that <Col N="1337" /> people who have no land have a very real grievance when their application for a settlement cannot be considered. I know that it would be a rather drastic change of national policy but I feel it is a change which would find general acceptance.</P>
    <P>While the change might affect to some extent&mdash;maybe not to a very appreciable degree&mdash;the prospects of settlement of existing landowners, I feel, however, it is better to have some land, even bad land, than no land at all.  It would be good policy to make provision for the landless man who is working on the land for years and who would probably serve in his task much more effectively if he had some hope of getting out after a certain time.  I feel that the change I have just advocated will have to come sooner or later and it would be better if we did not allow that development to remain outstanding too long.  I am sure the pool of land for division could be increased now that the additional financial provision has been made to the Minister. A start should be made by giving small quotas, say ten per cent. of the total area acquired, to those people I have referred to and it would have a very satisfactory effect.</P>
    <P>Housing has been referred to in a general way.  Deputy Flanagan, I think, suggested that the Land Commission should provide houses for certain types of land holders whom he described as small farmers and medium farmers.  I feel that is not the function of the Land Commission and I am certainly opposed to the Department of Lands entering too extensively into that field.  Housing the people of the country is primarily the responsibility of the local authorities through the Department of Local Government. The Land Commission are already assisting in a very appreciable way and I am glad that the Minister has now indicated that the degree of assistance will be even greater.  Now through Land Commission borrowings, loans from local authorities and local government grants, any person who has any backbone at all can afford to build a house without too much difficulty.  Most local authorities have made provision for housing for small holders up to £5 or £6 valuation so I <Col N="1338" /> do not think there is any real problem there.</P>
    <P>I would like in conclusion to make one point in the time at my disposal on the size of holdings allocated by the Land Commission.  The policy of the Land Commission in that regard seems to be to step up the size of the holding from 18-20 acres to 35 or 40 acres.  As far as we can understand, the quality of land being acquired in recent years seems to be a better type. I feel that a holding of 35 or 40 acres is quite sufficient for the average family.  Nowadays with the labour problem, to which I referred earlier, I feel anything more would be a burden. If that area of land is worked successfully, and worked on the lines advocated by the Land Commission, it can give a very good living to the holder and he can live in comfort. After all, his holding generally has been developed.  He has got new fences and a new dwelling house and new outoffices handed over to him in apple-pie order and I see no reason why he cannot carry on.  In any event, the quantity of land available, related to the numbers, does not make it possible to give larger units.  Modern trend is to work the smaller units more scientifically and as the Minister stated, the experience appears to be that smaller farmers can show a greater return per acre for their work.</P>
    <P>By and large, I feel the Minister has reason to pat himself on the back, as Deputy Flanagan said, and at the same time pat the officials of the Department of Lands on the back for the very successful year that the Minister is now reporting.  I hope that trend will continue next year.  I hope the Minister will do something about the very important problem to which I have referred, the question of trying to settle certain types of landless people who have been associated with the work on the land for years and have no prospect of getting land any other way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help reflecting on the time when I was sitting where the Minister is and on the attitude then of Fianna Fáil whenever the debate on the Department of Lands came up.  I remember one occasion when 27 Fianna Fáil Deputies spoke, <Col N="1339" /> not that there was an ounce of sense in what they said, but they were all jumping up to speak and breaking their necks to get in.  To-day only three or four Fianna Fáil Deputies have contributed so far and there does not appear to be any more.  They are not even in the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a very tame speech.  It was just a repetition of what has happened over the last three or four years.  There is no improvement good, bad or indifferent, although he tries to give a gloss to the work of the Land Commission.  There is a slighly increased expenditure under a few heads but those increases are due to the increased costs for material and labour. The actual figure remains the same. There is an increase under Subhead I, the principal figure for expenditure for the Land Commission where improvements are carried out in regard to fencing, drainage or road making, but that increase is swallowed up by the increased costs for labour and materials. The figure remains unchanged since I was responsible for the Department if we look at it from that point of view.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there is nothing for the Minister to be ashamed of, because the Land Commission is one State body that has done a terriffic job of work since it was established.  It is continuing to do a good job but it should be borne in mind that as the years go by the hard core that is left is getting harder to solve.  In that way there should be a certain amount of sympathy for the officials of the Commission who are trying to break up that hard core.  According as the shell is being peeled off, the remaining core is getting harder.  The time has come to take a new look at the work of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work done in the past was excellent and it was very difficult work and not very spectacular work for the reason that changing the title of land is not something that can be seen. If the Forestry Department plant the side of a mountain, or plant a valley, then in a few years you can see their work and it provides a very pleasing sight.  The Commission, of course, is <Col N="1340" /> mostly changing titles on paper amongst the tenants.  There is not much to be seen by a stranger in a locality after the Commission has put in many years of good work in a particular area.  The work of course, is known to the local people.  They have new houses, better fences, drainage and so on, and the work is known and appreciated by these people.</P>
    <P>I myself, although I was used to the work, could not see what had been done in various places except in regard to the division of a big farm.  Since they were formed they have taken over 400,000 holdings from the various landlords who owned the country.  In a great number of cases they have improved the holdings out of all knowledge, compared with what they were in the landlords' time.  I feel the time has come to take a completely new look at the work of the Commission for this reason, that since the cost of living rose so steeply, as it did in the last few years, and the income from the land dropped so much, the old £10 valuation level is now a thing of the past.  The Minister knows that there are many people on much better holdings than those with a £10 valuation who are deserting them, locking up their homes and going away. In many villages in Mayo, holdings of from £15 to £18 valuation have been deserted.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, when the present Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, was Minister for Lands, he removed a ceiling on the valuation but that was just said here in the House and had no effect on the work of the Commission.  I think it was Deputy Flanagan who said that all the young people had gone in the country places, particularly from small holdings, and that there was nobody left except children and old people. That is perfectly true.  What is happening is to be deplored but it is something for which the Land Commission should not be blamed.  It is more the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and the Government for allowing it to happen than of the Minister for Lands or the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In regard to rearrangement, the rearranging holdings of £7, £10 or £12 valuation is just a joke and a waste of <Col N="1341" /> money at present.  None of the tenants of such holdings will be able to get their sons to carry on when they get too old to work them.  For that reason, the work the Commission is doing in rearranging is miles behind the times. The time has come when we must forget the £10 valuation and go up to £20 or £25 so that we will produce a holding that will induce a young man to stay on it.  Everyone knows that any country fellow who goes to England at present can quite easily get employment there at from £20 to £27 a week.  All my neighbours in County Mayo can get that in England.  It would be an injustice to ask them to stay on a holding at home without reasonable reward while they have these wages to get.  If we do not provide a fairly decent holding to attract them to stay at home we will lose the youth from the land and the land will go derelict or into big ranches.</P>
    <P>The time has come when reasonably substantial holdings should be purchased in large numbers and given to farmers' sons who have a good training on the land.  I think that is the way to go about it.  Otherwise we will lose the foundation stock of our small farming community.  The time has come to purchase holdings on a large scale, not purchasing an occasional one here and there.  At least up to 1,000 holdings of 40 acres or more of fairly good land should be purchased per year and given to farmers' sons.  That would maintain what I would describe as the foundation stock.  Over 100 years ago Oliver Goldsmith deplored conditions in a village with which he was familiar in his poem entitled &ldquo;The Deserted Village.&rdquo; Today, in the West, village after village is becoming deserted through the failure of the Government to provide a livelihood for our farmers there.  While an excellent job of work was done up to a few years ago in the rearrangement of townlands the position at present is pathetic.  It is a case of locking the stable door when the horse has gone.</P>
    <P>The Minister gives a figure of 10,500 holdings of tenanted and untenanted land to be vested yet.  Do the Land Commission consider it necessary to <Col N="1342" /> improve all of these holdings before vesting?  The Land Commission, in reducing the total number of vestings down to 10,500 all over the whole country, has done a magnificent job. As Deputy O.J. Flanagan pointed out, it is a most difficult job.  Straightening out title, rights of way and the hundreds of objections raised by tenants when about to be vested is a most difficult job for the section of the Department dealing with it.  I know something about that.  Last year, 1,583 tenants were vested.  Untenanted and tenanted total vestings came to 5,200.  I suspect that many of them were additions to holdings plus turbary rights.</P>
    <P>Although it does not come strictly within the work of the Land Commission I would point to the high valuation imposed on demesne lands under the Valuation Act, 1849.  At that time it did not affect the ordinary tenant farmers but since then a good deal of these demesnes have been taken up by the Land Commission and been allotted. In most cases the valuation per acre, regardless of the productivity of the land, is upwards of £1.5s.  There are not many such cases but, in the few that exist, the tenants who got them are absolutely unable to pay the annuity and the rates at present.  In connection with the allotment of demesne lands the Minister should take it up with his colleague the Minister for Finance under whose bailiwick the Valuation office comes.  I know that the question of valuation in any shape or form is a very touchy problem but my point does not affect many tenants.  The amount of dislocation or objection that could be raised to it would be very slight.  Otherwise tenants who either got additions or holdings of what was formerly demesne land are in a bad plight due to the disproportion of rates they have to pay compared with their neighbours who did not get such land.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about game and fishing rights.  I can never understand why the Land Commission, having purchased the game rights from the landlords in most cases, did not allot them to the tenants when they were vesting.  It might be argued that the tenants will not look after game, or <Col N="1343" /> will not preserve them and keep a stock of game going or improve them.  I do not think that is the case.  Many vested tenants at present are getting pretty sore, and rightly so, over the fact that people claim the right to walk their land in the pursuit of game.  They do not mind that so much, but they do mind the cutting of wire fences, the knocking of walls, the damaging of fences, the scaring of stock by dogs, and so on.  The game rights should be vested in the ordinary tenant farmers.</P>
    <P>I had a Question to the Minister on fishing rights on portion of the Palmer Estate in Beltra lately.  I think a co-operative, in a case like that, of the farmers who own the land under the waters of the lake or whose holdings adjoin it should be granted the fishing rights.  I think that, particularly when the streams that hold the spawning beds for the fish to keep the lake perpetually stocked run through their land, a co-operative should be formed and the fishing rights vested at least in such co-operative, if not in the individual farmers to ensure that the fish stocked to a particular lake or river would not be damaged or diminished or allowed to be reduced through carelessness or want of attention.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I should like to hear how much of the 36,000 acres allotted last year was recently acquired.  Figures can be very misleading.  I suspect a good deal of that 36,000 acres allotted last year was a long time on hands.  Some of it could be on hands stretching away back to the days of the Congested Districts Board before the passage of the 1923 Act.</P>
    <P>I come now to some purely local matters affecting my constituency. What progress has been made towards the finishing and rearrangement in the Sligo and Moore estates?  The Minister will probably be able to get that information from his officials before he replies.  I also want to know about the Kilmaine estate, portion of which is on the left-hand side between Castlebar and Balla.  In that case, two villages are perched on a mountain and not many of the tenants are now left.  I made a proposal&mdash;the Minister knows <Col N="1344" /> about it&mdash;that these people should be given holdings before they vanish altogether. There is not much arable land in the two townlands.  The greater portion of the land is suitable only for forestry.  In cases where lorries or cars cannot approach because of the elevation of the land and where it is impossible to make a road into the place the six or seven families in it should be taken out and new holdings purchased for them before they vanish.  The youngsters will certainly not continue to live in a place like that.  It is nothing short of a crime to lose those families.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister would tell us what exactly the position is in regard to the remnant of re-arrangement in Mayo.  In the course of his speech the Minister compared holdings in Ireland with the average holdings in Italy, Germany, and if I do not make a mistake, in Denmark.  There is no comparison between life on the land in this country and life on the land in the countries to which the Minister referred.  He might as well have quoted examples from Mars. The climate is completely different in those countries.  The productivity of the land in the three countries is completely different and the soil is richer.  In addition these are huge industrial countries with a market at their doorstep in their own cities and towns.  We have not such an internal market for our produce as the farmers in Italy with a population of 36 million or as the farmers in Western Germany with a population of over 40 million. The situation in Denmark is the same. There is no point in quoting examples such as these.  They are merely examples to mislead and have no other purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to refer to farming competence.  There was never a greater piece of codology than this. We take migrants and send them for a fortnight's course to some agricultural college but the conditions in an agricultural college in most instances will not compare at all with the conditions of the holdings these migrants will occupy if and when they get them.  Very often an almost illiterate farmer is the most progressive farmer.  If the Minister is going to <Col N="1345" /> test a farmer's ability because he spends a fortnight in an agricultural college, I should like to ask him how many holdings belonging to migrants transferred from the west to the midlands were sold or changed hands? I know of only one case.  These men brought up in those days on an 18 acre or 20 acre holding were not required to test their farming competence in a college.  That is an absolute waste of time and a piece of codology.  Any farmer who gets a reasonable sized holding will do a good job of making a living there and here is the proof.</P>
    <P>How many of those who got holdings in the past have sold their holdings or deserted the land?  It would be very interesting if the Minister could tell us that.  I made enquiries into that when I was Minister for Lands and all I could trace was one case.  In every other case they were happy and comfortable and were doing well until the past three or four years.</P>
    <P>There is a change in the type of house provided for migrants.  It has not been done in time.  The old Land Commission house was just a glorified outhouse&mdash;a bare stark naked building. You would know that it had the stamp of the Land Commission on it.  At the same time, in nearly every case they were good houses and all that was required was to spend a few extra pounds to give a finish to the outside.  I made an effort to change the position in my time.</P>
    <P>The time has now come to instal water and sanitation in each house that is being built.  Every house that I know of which was built by people on their own holdings with the aid of grants are provided with water and sanitation. That is a very necessary amenity.  It is certainly a big step forward since 1946.  When I asked that water and sanitation be installed in the Land Commission houses, the Minister for Lands of that time replied that the old method was quite good enough.  If there is difficulty between the Department of Local Government and the Land Commission, the matter could be quite easily resolved in relation to the few houses which the Land Commission <Col N="1346" /> would build.  The Department of Local Government could pay them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making great capital out of the benefits of the 1950 Act.  The 1950 Act was introduced in November of 1949 if I remember correctly.  The present Minister and all the Fianna Fáil Deputies opposed that tooth and nail. They have been in power twice&mdash;from 1951 to 1954 and from 1957 to the present day, and if that Act was such a horror, as was then pointed out, and such a danger there is no way to describe the action of Fianna Fáil but to describe it as criminal in not having it repealed.</P>
    <P>I remember that every single section of the Act was contested.  I remember bringing in an innovation&mdash;the purchase of land for cash for the purpose of rearrangement or migrants' holdings. Every trick in the bag was used by the legal men in the Fianna Fáil benches&mdash; they were then in Opposition&mdash;to delay and hold it up.  It was not until their own supporters began to complain at the hold-up of the Bill that they finally gave way to it.</P>
    <P>It is time to change Section 27 of the Act.  Under Section 27 of the Act the purchase of land for cash in the open market or by private treaty can only be used for re-arrangement and for migrants' holdings.  In many cases it suits in the course of a re-arrangement scheme to purchase a holding quickly from a person in a townland. I think that this section has got a fair test during its 11 years in operation. No abuses have resulted from the pasage of that section.  It is high time to put land purchase under that section on the same footing as land compulsorily acquired or resumed.  I know several townlands where the quick purchase of a holding or two would have expedited the rearrangement of the townland.  The Land Commission go through the cumbersome procedure of compulsory acquisition and in most cases do not succeed in acquiring the land, thus leaving the townland without rearrangement.  It is high time to change all that and it should be looked into.</P>
    <P>I can understand the caution with which it was handled up to this.  Every innovation, particularly legislation, requires <Col N="1347" /> careful handling.  But it is ten years at least since section 27 came into operation and, as far as I know, no abuses have come to light in regard to the purchase of holdings or the granting of powers to inspectors to fix the price and buy land at a public auction or by private treaty.  It would be a great benefit to inspectors rearranging holdings to be able to buy certain pieces of land on the spot.  The average small farmer is afraid, first, of the compulsory acquisition powers of the Land Commission and, secondly, he does not want to be paid in Land Bonds&mdash;he wants cash.  He is afraid he will not be able to cash the bonds or, if he does, that he will not get the full value of them.</P>
    <P>There is a townland named Tooreen in which I am interested.  I should like if the Minister would tell us briefly in his reply how that townland stands.  I want also to throw out this warning to him.  Land that has come into the hands of the Land Commission in a nearby townland should not be used for the rearrangement of that townland.  There are two or three of the 12 tenants in Tooreen quite willing to migrate.  Any land in the nearby locality is needed by those round about, unless we want further flight from the land.  There are two or three people willing to migrate and that should give reasonable scope for a fair rearrangement scheme.  We ought to be able to rearrange at £12 or £13 and the tenants would be satisfied.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was a bit down in the mouth.  He knew quite well he was just carrying on the policy laid down by me.  During his term as Minister for Lands he could have stirred himself and devised some new approach to the problem of trying to stop the flight from the land and to keep the young people at home.  I know of no young fellow, except a few who are married and cannot very well go, willing to stay on in a small sized holding.  Every place I go, the complaint of parents is that they have reared families and cannot get even one of them to stay on the land.  The reason is obvious.  The small farmers have been hopelessly neglected for the <Col N="1348" /> past three or four years.  Their incomes have been cut down for the past two years.  Up to last spring you could not sell cattle, sheep or lambs.  At the same time, the Government allowed the cost of living to creep up and up. One of the most important factors in that was their removal of the food subsidies shortly after their return to office.  That has helped to banish the young men from the land, increase the cost of living and make life on an average size holding impossible.  They were right to go, even though it is hard and cruel on the parents who reared them to think that they cannot hold even one.</P>
    <P>The time has come for bold action&mdash; to purchase a huge number of holdings and to allot the land without having any of this farming competence nonsense about it.  It would have been much more to the Minister's credit if he had purchased some of the 8,000 acres recently purchased by non-nationals in counties Kildare, Dublin, Meath and Westmeath&mdash;big farms of anything from 100 acres to 400 acres&mdash;and settled some of our young men on them.  It seems a bit ironical to think that our own people must fly from the country, be forced out by a native Government in a clearance worse than anything ever effected by the most brutal of the landlords, when at the same time foreigners can come in and buy up the land for which their fathers and forefathers fought so hard to get possession of from the landlords.</P>
    <P>That is the Fianna Fáil record for the last four years.  They forced out 200,000 youngsters from the country.  They could not give them employment or anything to supplement their living. They did not even go to the trouble of providing a market for their produce. The result is nothing but gloom and despair, particularly among the younger element.  The old people are in similar despair seeing the youngsters gone and looking at an empty hearth stone.  The old man and old woman have to sit at each side of the fire without having even one of their family to comfort them in their old age and carry on the family name.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned at the end of his speech that the action taken by <Col N="1349" /> the Minister for Finance in this year's Finance Bill to curb the purchase of land by foreigners was ample and that the Government were keeping an eye on the situation.  If the Minister thinks he is pulling the wool over the people's eyes in that, he is merely pulling it very successfully over his own.  The Minister for Agriculture told us yesterday that he would welcome foreigners with open arms, or words to that effect. That certainly is a most damning statement. Did he not make that statement? He said he would welcome foreigners into his own constituency with open arms.</P>

But, instead of that, they are being bundled off in train-load after train-load to England, America and the far ends of the earth.

      <P>Deputy Killilea is thinking about the good times of the last four years when a Fianna Fáil Minister was in power and he was fooling the people in his own constituency. It is no harm to describe Deputy Killilea's method of dividing the land.  He would get a crowd into the house he was visiting and divide the land with the tongs and ashes.  The Government should not allow foreign competition to drive up the price of land.  The land allotted has to be paid for by the taxpayer and the losses <Col N="1350" /> incurred would have to be paid by way of increased annuity by the tenant. Therefore, the time has come for us to do as Switzerland and several countries have done and prevent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was announced by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture that he, for one, would welcome foreigners with open arms.  At last the claws of Fianna Fáil have appeared in this respect.  The small farmers and their families are regarded by Fianna Fáil as blooming nuisances.  Their policy is that the sooner the country reverses to a few large ranches the better they will like it.  I do not think the Irish people will be fooled by that. I think they will give their answer in the General Election when we will see what they think of the Minister for Agriculture and his colleagues who are prepared to sell the land of Ireland to foreigners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at first to deal with the last statement made by Deputy Blowick in a speech from which the only elements missing were the sound of cattle hooves, the tinkle of pint glasses and possibly Deputy Donnellan's raucous voice in the background.  Deputy Blowick's speech is dishonest and disgraceful and is no credit to a person who occupied the post of Minister in two Governments in this country.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the matter of this meeting held in Castlebar and a report of the proceedings carried by the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the following day.  I did not notice the report in any other morning newspaper.  The report said that no Fianna Fáil member was present.  I do not know whether that is true or not.  I assume it is.  As far as I am concerned, I certainly was not there and I think it right that I should make a public statement as to what happened after I received a letter from the Secretary of the organisations convening the meeting and telling me its purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the meeting, I wrote to the Secretary at some length and told her I had read the reports of the previous meeting which had been <Col N="1351" /> addressed by Deputies Blowick, Donnellan and Lindsay.  I pointed out this was a matter of public interest in which I, as a Deputy, had a duty to take an interest.  I said I would be very interested to hear the views of the representatives of the various organisations she had mentioned in the course of her letter and that I took a disinterested view.  In case some people might not appreciate what I mean by &ldquo;disinterested&rdquo; I understand it to mean impartial or dispassionate.  In my letter I said I was not prepared to attend a meeting in Castlebar or elsewhere if its purpose was to provide a platform for Party political purposes for the Donnellans and the Blowicks and the Lindsays and that I had no intention whatsoever of attending unless I got the requisite assurances beforehand.</P>
    <P>I must place on record that I got no reply to that communication and I accordingly did not attend.  What the other Fianna Fáil representatives who may have been invited to that meeting did I do not know but I take it that they also would have required certain assurances before they would have attended that or any other meeting on a very important matter.  Deputy Blowick, to the accompaniment of the tinkle of pint glasses, chooses to deal with this as a Party political issue.  It is a shame for him particularly because it was not necessary and because the question is of sufficient importance to be discussed dispassionately by those who have the responsibility either as Deputies or as Members of the Government.</P>
    <P>I fail to see what is wrong with the acquisition of waste or derelict land along the seaboard by foreigners. Have we got to a stage in this country where we can be accused of xenophobia? Are we so precious about ourselves that we do not want to have a German, a Frenchman, an Italian, an Englishman or anyone else in here, and if so, why?  We are very glad to have them when they do their fishing here, when they spend money here on petrol or in our hotels but we do not want to have them purchase land which nobody has wanted for the past <Col N="1352" /> three hundred or four hundred years. God help us and God help the people who can be fooled by the nonsense Deputy Blowick came out with when he dealt with the flight from the land, with the fact that so many young people are leaving and that villages and townlands in the West of Ireland are becoming derelict.</P>
    <P>They are leaving, it is true, but if Deputy Blowick is right it is all the fault of Fianna Fáil and it all dates from 1957.  I think he will find that neither the people of Mayo nor of the country as a whole are prepared to accept that.  I have pointed out on one or two occasions that I thought there were certain social aspects to the problem that had not been given full consideration or attention and the principal social aspect of the flight from the land to-day, in my humble opinion, is that young girls are not prepared to live there.</P>
    <P>On an issue like this I should hate to exaggerate or to use any statement I could not stand over absolutely.  So, when I say that dozens of young men of my acquaintance have left Mayo because there was nobody whom they could marry, that is absolutely true. It would also be true, I think, if I said &ldquo;hundreds&rdquo; but I do not wish to put it that high nor do I wish to particularise about areas.  Even with rural electrification, with all the grants provided by the Minister for Agriculture for outbuildings, by the Minister for Local Government for houses and by the Minister for Lands for this and that, the fact is that the young women of rural Ireland no longer appear to be interested in marrying farmers.  If that is not true, I should like to hear somebody say so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a question purely about the West?  Would industries there not keep them there? The Deputy mentioned many things but would not the fact that industries existed there keep them at home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the industries that are there provide work only until such time as the girls are thinking of getting married and if the proposals they get come from farmers they are not interested.  They marry somebody <Col N="1353" /> in the factories or in the towns rather than go back to the country.  As soon as a girl gets a taste of industrial life she is even more weaned away from the idea of farming life.  I think these girls are greatly and gravely mistaken and I know that many of them in America, England and elsewhere would dearly like to come back but through some kind of inverted pride they would rather stay than come back and admit that they were wrong to go.</P>
      <P>I think that Deputy Blowick's speech is doing tremendous damage, that what he is saying is apt to drive people out, not to help them to stay here.  Of course it is true that the Land Commission should try to provide holdings that are as economic as possible but Deputy Blowick knows the Land Commission's problems and difficulties as well as anybody and it is not, and should not be, necessary for me to point out that the Land Commission can only achieve results by using the resources they have. They cannot manufacture land or economic holdings.  When I say sufficient attention has not been given to these social problems I do not mean given by the Government.  I believe that the Government, all governments &mdash;to give them due credit&mdash;have done from time to time in various ways everything possible to make the lot of the rural dweller better.  They were perfectly right but more attention should be given to this problem not by political Parties or bodies but by voluntary organisations and by the Church which surely must have a considerable stake in this aspect of the flight from the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own locality I know two or three areas that have become derelict not because the men&mdash;many of them close acquaintances of mine&mdash;do not wish to reside there.  They do, but because they have reached an age when they want to marry and settle down and they find nobody prepared to take that course with them, they move to Birmingham or New York.  No matter what Government is here if that trend continues it will pose a very grave problem for Church and State.  It is not true that Fianna Fáil have been driving the people out of Ireland for <Col N="1354" /> the past two or three years.  It was unnecessary and dishonest of Deputy Blowick to say that but as I said already he is thinking of Balla, Kiltimagh or Claremorris and the dropping of votes into the polling boxes. He is old enough now not to buy votes that way and he should be a man of sufficient integrity to be more honest with the people that he has the honour to represent.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the tourist is being squeezed out progressively in this country and finds greater and greater difficulty in getting a day's fishing. Attention should be given to the applications of those who state in their proposals that they are prepared to allow casual fishing by tourists on application. That would be a possible solution to a problem posed by the fact that many stretches of water are tied up for five years by one person or estate not prepared to share anything, with the tourist.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to compliment my colleague and friend, the Minister for Lands, on a job well done. In spite of the attack made upon him by his predecessor I think he deserves great credit for speeding up the acquisition and resumption of land and its division.  That is the essential purpose of the Commission.  He has been able to do that by persuading the Government to give him more money than his predecessor or anybody else ever got for the purpose.  He deserves the congratulations of the House.  This much should be added: that during his administration I have never heard a single complaint from my constituency of North Mayo or Galway that there was any semblance of personal bias or interference by the Minister. He deserves credit also for that.  Of course he is right in not interfering except where he has authority to do so. I am afraid the same could not have been said of his predecessor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>At this time we are all inclined to criticise the Minister and his Department in various ways but the type of criticism voiced this evening is, as a Deputy pointed out, in no way helpful.  There has been a lot of talk about emigration and Deputy Blowick dwelt on it at length. <Col N="1355" /> Deputy Blowick is no more a child than I am.  His memory goes back a long time.  My memory goes back, too.  I was a toddler when I saw my father and the only uncle I had on my father's side having to emigrate to England.  My memory goes back to the time when my mother's five brothers all went to England.  My memory goes back to a time when emigration from the West was on a much greater scale than it is today. The kind of emigration to which Deputy Blowick referred is nothing new in the West of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy O. Flanagan this evening talk about the eldest son being left the holding and a couple of brothers able to make provision for themselves on that holding also and going out and taking conacre. Surely the day arrives when each of those had to go and find somewhere else to live.  All of us know that that home could not support more than one family.  That applies in every home in rural Ireland, whether it be on the smallest holding in the West or on the largest farm in the Midlands.</P>
      <P>In days gone by large tracts were taken over from the landlords and divided amongst the congests of the West.  The small holding of from £3 to £4 valuation has to a large extent disappeared.  Nevertheless, there are still holdings in the West which cannot be brought up to the Land Commission standard of £12 or £12. 10s. poor law valuation.  The reason is not hard to find.  There are no longer estates to be acquired.  The only pool of land available are the little holdings of 12 or 14 acres.  One can appreciate how far 10 or 12 acres will go in making other holdings economic.  It is an impossibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we ought to stop the sort of tactics we had in this House this evening and forget the good propaganda they may be on the platforms in the near future.  As someone said a few moments ago, if we must discuss this, then let us discuss it at the crossroads. Obviously there is a campaign being initiated here.  This is the leading plank in the platform of the Clann na Talmhan Party.  I suppose a good <Col N="1356" /> many of the Fine Gael people will take it up too.</P>
    <P>There has been one small change in my constituency.  A migrant left there about a month ago.  He will have to try to acquire some new territory in South Galway.  He left because the ground had been slipping very fast from under him.  That poor man is not here today to cry over the congests in North Galway.  I refer to my colleague, Deputy Donnellan.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a welcome increase in the amount of money available for acquisition of land this year.  The only hope for the relief of congests in my constituency is migration.  However unpalatable that may be to some of the people in the Midlands, and elsewhere, a greater effort will have to be made to remedy the situation.  I am not saying a good effort is not being made at the moment.  The problem is not easy to solve.  The Land Commission try to move the largest tenant because, the more land they can acquire, the easier it will be to improve the other holdings.  Naturally the large tenant does not like moving out and he strikes a hard bargain.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made about the purchase of land by non-nationals. There may be non-nationals infiltrating into other counties.  I know of only one case in the west where a non-national got in.  The Pim Estate outside Newport in County Mayo was offered to the Land Commission when the Coalition Government were in office.  The Coalition Minister did not take the land.  Neither did he make any cry about land being bought by a non-national.  It was bought by a non-national. Deputy O. Flanagan asked Deputy Blowick when he finished speaking: &ldquo;How did I get on, Joe?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Joe&rdquo; said &ldquo;Smashing&rdquo;.  Everybody heard that just as well as I did. Now that estate was bought by a non-national in Deputy Blowick's time.  If Deputy Blowick were Minister again in the morning would he pay any attention to Deputy Flanagan's argument that you must have the right of private ownership and the right of free sale?  If Deputy Flanagan were holding an auction in the morning and a non-national bid higher than a <Col N="1357" /> national would Deputy Flanagan refuse to take his bid?  I do not think he would.  Deputy Blowick will have to recognise, whether he likes it or not, that every farmer in this country is entitled to the highest bid he can get.  While that is there I am not one of the people who would encourage any Government to interfere with that right.  That might be construed as indicating I am prepared to welcome any non-nationals.  I am not so prepared, but as a farmer I am prepared to have done for everybody else what I would like to have done for myself.  In other words if I have my holding up for sale to-morrow morning I am not too interested in who the purchaser will be any more than Deputy O. Flanagan would be as the auctioneer.  I am interested in who is going to pay the biggest price and I will say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; to the buyer whether he is from Spain, Germany, France or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>This is now being made a racket but the people will see through the racket.  They realise that the Land Commission is making a good effort to solve these problems.  I have had the experience of making an effort to be helpful to a number of my constituents in regard to the rearrangement of holdings.  People will say that the Land Commission for the past ten years have a holding of ten, 12 or 14 acres in a townland, that they acquired another holding five or six years afterwards and perhaps another holding a year or two later.  If I approach the Land Commission to inquire why they are not dividing these lands the reply is: &ldquo;We are making an effort to create satisfactory holdings.  If we divide the area of land we have in that locality at the moment there will be grievances because it will increase people's holdings by only £2 or £3 valuation and leave others out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan dwelt on the 1956 Land Act and I interjected that I was one of the people who had no confidence in that measure when it was going through this House.  Nor have I today, my reason being that I am convinced it was one of the greatest handicaps ever imposed on the Land Commission in the acquisition of land. <Col N="1358" /> One would be led to believe from Deputy O. Flanagan that were it not for the 1956 Land Act there would not be an acre of land purchased anywhere. However, the following extract from the Land Commission Report to the 31st March, 1960, which I think all of us received this morning shows we do not have to refer to recent Land Acts at all.  It says:</P>
    <P>Since the passing of the 1923 Act, 112,000 tenancies comprising over 3,000,000 acres have been purchased from landlords for about £21 million.</P>
    <P>That is an indication that we have been able to purchase land without any assistance from Deputy Blowick's Land Acts.  It was very hard to form any sort of picture of what Deputy O. Flanagan had in the back of his mind this evening.  Deputy O. Flanagan is a shrewd businessman and this is what is likely to happen when land goes up for sale.  A number of Land Commission inspectors may be sent out to Deputy Flanagan, or whoever is conducting the auction, to bid against somebody for this holding of land. The farmers are not as much asleep as many of us seem to think.  They would be very quick to realise there is a little game they can play.  Deputy Flanagan would say to me: &ldquo;Now, Killilea, you could be useful to me.  I am selling a holding of land tomorrow morning and a few Land Commission inspectors are coming to bid for it.  I want to get the highest possible price for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to know from Deputy Flanagan or from Deputy Blowick how many acres of land were purchased by the Land Commission at what is called the market price.  Market price in this context is the greatest joke of all time and it is only a joker like Deputy Blowick who would have thought of it. There is no such thing as a market price for land.  In other spheres if I want to buy a commodity I will look in the shop windows and see the different prices at which it is marked. At a fair it is the same.  When we talk about land one would think that every acre of land was being sold at a particular figure, say £50, £60 or £100 an acre, no matter where it was being sold.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1359" /> That is very far removed from the facts.  The market value of land is based on one thing only, the suitability of the land to a person in the locality who has the money to pay for it. Therefore, in one district a farm of land will be sold for £25 an acre and maybe only half a mile away a farm of land will be sold for £140 an acre. What we call market value is a figure calculated by the Land Commission. They have to make up their minds or should I say their minds are made up for them as to what that figure will be. If a holding is given to Paddy McGinty or somebody else at a certain price he may come along in 12 months or in five years' time and say: &ldquo;Here am I paying £5 an acre for land that is not one bit better than my neighbour's land who has it at 10/- an acre.&rdquo;  There will be a rebellion overnight.  Everyone knows that.</P>
    <P>These are a few of the reasons why I say here and will say from the platform and will say at all times that the greatest disaster ever brought upon the small farmer was the curse of the Land Act, 1956, introduced by Deputy Blowick.  Let him use that anywhere and in any way he likes but let him also use the arguments I have used against it.</P>

      <P>As regards rearrangement of holdings, the Report of the Irish Land Commissioners for the period ended 31st March, 1960 says:</P>
      <P>In some instances in Western districts, the land required for relief of congestion, for rearrangement of intermixed holdings and abolition of rundale and for the improvement of conditions generally, can be obtained only through the migration of a number of tenants to newly-created holdings on estates acquired by the Land Commission elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I have to agree entirely with every word of that.</P>
      <P>The report also states:</P>
      <P>Rearrangement schemes, i.e. the regrouping into compact workable units of the series of disconnected and intermixed plots which frequently constitute the poorer holdings in Western congested districts, are now a significant and, indeed, a very arduous feature of land settlement.  The success of these schemes and also of the migration programme which is inseparable from them, is wholly dependent on the voluntary co-operation of the participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the difficulties that <Col N="1361" /> the Land Commission have to overcome.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to agree that people have left holdings and have gone away.  I say they ought to be ashamed to have done so, for the reason that these holdings were considerably improved by the addition of land by the Land Commission.  The sooner the Land Commission takes steps to acquire these holdings compulsorily and to distribute them amongst people who are prepared to live on them and to work them, the better for the country.  It is a disgrace that any person who has got an addition of ten or 15 acres from the Land Commission, at the expense of the taxpayer who can ill afford to make presents to anybody, should leave that holding. The Land Commission and the Minister should not tolerate that and should step in immediately and take over these holdings and inform the people who have left the holdings that the land will be divided amongst people who are prepared to work it. There are many people who, if they get five or six additional acres of land, will not lock the door and go off.</P>
    <P>There is no use in Deputy Blowick or any member of his Party telling us that every second door in the country is closed.  That is not true and they know that it is very far from the truth but it appears that as far as they are concerned the truth is something they do not respect and, it would appear, do not not know too much about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>This racket will blow over.  The reason why Deputy Donnellan has left North Galway and gone to South Galway is that they called his bluff.  The same thing will happen to Deputy Blowick in Mayo if he is not careful.  The people in North Galway would not listen to Deputy Donnellan any longer.  Deputy Blowick has not done too badly for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> The Minister indicated his attitude to game preservation this evening and towards regional game councils, gun clubs and so on.  We must all appreciate the work that such associations have done by voluntary effort.  More co-operation is needed from the top. The formation of a national game council has been suggested.  I agree with that suggestion.  I would also suggest that where the Land Commission let land of which they have the game rights, first preference should be given to the local game council.</P>
    <P>I think it was a perfect disgrace&mdash; and I brought it to the Minister's attention at the time&mdash;that a couple of years ago a dozen Frenchmen came to the country around Loughrea and Ballygar for a week's snipe shooting&mdash; this is one of the best snipe shooting parts of the country&mdash;but one or two people from Dublin happened to have purchased the game rights for the time being from the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In little towns throughout my constituency like Ballygar, a dozen people coming and spending a week or a fortnight would mean a lot to the shopkeepers and to the people round about who would sell more vegetables, more potatoes and other things like that and it is a disgrace that those people could put their foot down and tell those people they could not shoot snipe.  Those fellows themselves would no more shoot a snipe than they would shoot a scarecrow because they would not waste the cartridge.</P>
    <P>They let the people around Ballygar and other parts around the country destroy the vermin and do everything to preserve the game, but when it comes to shooting the game they reserve it for themselves and there is no hope of tourists being interested in going to those places.  The fisheries have been well developed and a fairly good job has been done, but I think there is an even greater future for game and that it would be a greater attraction for tourists who are interested in the shotgun. The Minister should take steps as soon as possible to stop those lands being let go for a mere bid of 1/- or 2/-to people who serve no useful purpose by bringing an additional shilling into the locality in which those rights are <Col N="1363" /> preserved and if the Land Commission loses a few shillings the Minister should make that little sacrifice.  The amount they get would never make them up anyway.</P>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion that while we criticise the Land Commission and criticise it very severely at times, we have offices in Galway, Roscommon and the West of Ireland as a whole staffed with the finest officials one could ask for.  They are men who know their job, men who are capable, men who understand the position of the migrants and of the uneconomic landholders and who as a result are able to make progress where others would have failed.  It is only right that I should congratulate those people on the job of work they are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem from what we have heard from previous speakers that the only people interested in the Minister's Estimate come from counties such as Mayo or Galway, but I would like to remind the Minister that there is such a place also as Kerry and that we are specially interested in land division and in migration, particularly from South Kerry to the midlands.  There are various degrees of dissatisfaction at the delays in transferring applicants from uneconomic holdings in South Kerry to the midlands.  We have the greatest right because away in the past, if you look back into history, the people of the midlands were driven south west into Kerry and, therefore, we have the trouble about the uneconomic holdings.  The descendants of those people who were driven back under pressure have the right to be brought forward when any division of land takes place in the midlands or in the eastern part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very many applicants from my area who desire to get their portion of any estates that may be now available there.  I assure you I am not interested in any differences that may arise between the ex-Minister for Lands and his successor because I hold that neither one nor the other did what we wanted in connection with that sub-division of lands and give the <Col N="1364" /> uneconomic holders of South West Kerry a chance to keep their families in this country under proper conditions. Somebody should look into history, examine it and make a survey of these areas in the south-west of Ireland.  I am not going further north than the Shannon because I have heard so much discussion this evening on land division west of the Shannon, especially in Connacht and they can definitely look out for themselves.  They were very fortunate for a long time in having as Minister for Lands and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance two Deputies from that area and I am sure they availed very much of all the facilities possible while those people were in office.  We never had anyone for many years to facilitate the small farmers of south-west Kerry so that they could be brought forward and get transferred to areas in the Eastern counties or the Midlands or even in East Cork or elsewhere to rear their families under proper conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy will agree that small holders were transferred from Kerry to the Midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the Deputy from Connemara about that because I do not regard people from Connemara as small holders.  I would like to make it clear that I do not blame the present Minister nor the past Minister.  There have been Ministers since this State was set up.  These conditions existed in the constituency I represent, the constituency that someone also will represent in the near future, now that the Dingle Peninsula has been brought into the south Kerry area.  Nothing has ever been done by the Land Commission to help those people to get an economic holding. Holdings have been deserted and the owners have emigrated.  Whole families have died out in those areas and no one wants to take their place.  There are many derelict holdings there.  Why do the Land Commission not take the proper steps, which I think they have the authority to take, to make their holdings economic so that they can live there instead of having to emigrate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that on this Estimate we can deal only with the Land Commission. My view is&mdash;and it is the <Col N="1365" /> view of the people in those areas&mdash; that when a large holding is taken over by the Land Commission it should be divided in such a way as would enable the small farmers to get a certain portion which would eventually make their holdings economic.  I am not blaming the Minister for this, but when any farm is acquired by the Land Commission in the areas to which I have referred, either in south or west Kerry, or even in west Cork, there is always a political scramble to get some portion of the lands that have been acquired by the Land Commission for sub-division.  That should not be so.</P>
    <P>I have been in this House for 14 years and I have made representations on behalf of the people who live on land adjoining land that has been taken over, but I have never asked that it should be considered from the political point of view.  I assure the Minister that so far as I am concerned since he took office I do not blame him for the administration of the Land Commission but I advise him that when land is acquired by the Land Commission they should so far as possible arrange that sub-division should be carried out in such a way that the adjoining farmers would get the land and make use of it.  That is all I ask. That is the wish of the people concerned and no matter what Government are in office that should be the order of the day.</P>
    <P>I hold that my people in south and west Kerry are entitled at any time to make application for an exchange of holdings in the midlands, in east Cork or in the eastern counties.  They deserve the first consideration because no matter what my friend the Deputy from Connemara says the Kerry farmers who have transferred their holdings to the midlands or the eastern counties have proved themselves highly efficient in regard to agricultural advancement, unlike those from Connemara who would not know a plough from a harrow.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned the Minister and his officials did their best to carry out our wishes any time I approached them, as I am sure is the experience of any Deputy representing Kerry, south or north.  Of course, we <Col N="1366" /> have been told that they have no function in the matter but any time I approached the Land Commission or the Department of Lands I received the greatest courtesy not only from the Minister but from his officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMJohnston" hpid="Mr. Johnston Mr. Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is of particular interest to my constituency because for many years Meath has been the main source of relief for land congestion in other counties.  At the moment there is a very large migrant population in Meath which has fitted in very well to the economy of the county.  The migrants have proved to be very good citizens and there is no hostility whatever to them but some farmers who were living near those lands felt that they should have been given portion of those holdings&mdash;and who can blame them&mdash;because in many cases their forefathers had worked there and many of them had taken conacre.  Those who were raising livestock were told that by a certain date they must have their livestock off that land and that there was no alternative. They felt that was not fair and that there should have been some consideration for them.</P>
      <P>I do not say they should have got all the land but the people in Meath had shown that they were competent and able to work the land.  If 25 per cent. of the estates which were divided had been given to local people it would have been a much more satisfactory arrangement.  I discussed these matters with some migrants and they felt that the local people were not treated fairly. In some recent programmes of land division which I have seen that opinion has been borne out.  Fair treatment should be given to the local people. That is something for which I would be very thankful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard at times to understand the policy of the Land Commission. I know of a case where a young married man with a family, who was on an uneconomic holding, was in every way competent to work a farm and had machinery and capital, but when a farm at this man's back door was available he did not get any of the land.  He was consulted again about another farm that was being divided but still got no land.  That <Col N="1367" /> man was treated very unfairly.  In regard to congestion, strange as it may seem there is congestion in County Meath and in one portion it is badly congested.  The people in that area should get consideration.  I was amazed to hear that there was congestion in the West, having regard to the numbers who have abandoned their homes there and left the country. There should be ample land there if those statements are true.  I am glad to see that the Minister has increased the acreage of holdings.  It was a great mistake at the start that 20 or 21 acres were given.</P>

      <P>Even if the Deputy did that, he did a good job of work. I am glad to see that the five-acre plot scheme has been brought back. It was abused at first but people then were not in the happy position they are in today of being able to put stock on the land and working it as it should be.  I should like to pay tribute to the Minister and his staff for the job they are doing.  It is a difficult job and they are doing it as well as they can.  It is not easy to please everybody but, please God, in time a solution will be found for our present position.  In Meath we are a land hungry people and that is to be understood.  In the old days the people were dispossessed there and it is only right that we should turn a complete cycle and the people now should get their fair share.</P>

      <P>It is not for political purposes or merely for the sake of criticism that I stand up to speak but to voice the grievances of the people in my constituency.  Let there be no doubt about it, people are still very anxious to get land.  I am sure every Deputy has had the same experience as I have had since I was elected, of people appealing to me to make representations <Col N="1368" /> to the Land Commission so that they will get portion of a certain farm or be granted a holding on an estate which is going to be taken over or which has been taken over.  I was glad to hear Deputy Killilea saying that there were still many fine farms.  He was perfectly right.  There are plenty of people only too anxious to get an economic holding and make a good living out of it.  While it is very easy for us to say that the Land Commission's job is a difficult one I would appeal to them to do all in their power to get this land and divide it as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Another problem which we have in regard to the position of land is that the Forestry Department may purchase a good farm when a few active farmers are only too anxious to get that farm. Some arrangement should be come to between the Forestry Department and the Land Commission.  If there are a few farmers anxious to get a particular piece of land in the neighbourhood the Forestry Department should yield its right even though the necessary signature has been obtained.  We had an experience where people were anxious to get land and we were told if we made representations to the Minister or the Forestry Department something could be done.  We did make representations but the Forestry Department would not yield.  That is a matter that should be looked into because we have instances where such land would be a useful addition to the farmer instead of having it planted as a wood right up to his door.  I appeal to the Minister to look into that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drainage of land and of the rivers in my constituency is of vital importance at present.  We have sent deputations on several occasions and we were told that the arterial drainage scheme would commence shortly, but even today floods are causing a lot of destruction in Sligo-Leitrim.  On Saturday last farmers in Sligo told me that they had lost their whole harvest. Immediate attention should be given to that matter and something done to save those people who have had the grit to hold on to those farms for generations.  It has been the same sad tale down the years.  Things were all right if the year was good but they <Col N="1369" /> were all wrong if it was a bad year. I suppose it would be wrong for me at this stage to refer to the installation of electric light on those farms.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies spoke about game rights. These should be given to the local farmers.  Farmers in my constituency found that they had not got the game rights on their farms.  It is sad to think that in 1961 we should find ourselves in the position we were in years ago when some of our people took to the hills so that we should have the right to our own land and shoot what was on it.  The fishery rights are also reserved and in many cases that is what is causing flooding and the consequent destruction of farm produce, for the reason that in many rivers there are rocks and the fishery conservators have the right to prosecute anybody who goes in to blast out those rocks.</P>

Our population is of far greater value to the country than a few tourists coming in to fish for a few months every year.  I can prove beyond doubt that a number of people have had to leave their small holdings due to the fact that on two successive years they were flooded to such an extent that they had nothing left and they were not going to remain in that state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised to hear Deputy McLaughlin complain that in his constituency there was some difficulty between the Forestry Division and the Land Commission.  I want to assure him and the House that the ruling is that where the Forestry Division or the Land Commission take over land only that portion of it which is suitable for forestry goes to the Forestry Division.  It is in fact the rule on both sides of my Department that land suited for agriculture or <Col N="1370" /> what is classified as agricultural land is not used for forestry and is not devoted to forestry.  That is the official policy on this matter and indeed it is not alone the official policy here but is also the official policy with the British Forestry Commission on the other side.</P>
      <P>I have come across only a couple of isolated instances&mdash;a very insignificant portion of land was concerned&mdash;where I received a complaint of this kind.  I cannot remember receiving one from Deputy McLaughlin's constituency but I remember receiving one or two isolated complaints.  There may be doubts, of course, as to the value of the different types of land on occasion but they rarely arise.  I can assure the Deputy that, generally speaking, the policy to which I refer, that agricultural land should not be devoted to afforestation purposes, is invariably carried out by both Divisions of my Department concerned with this matter.</P>
      <P>I know, and every Deputy from rural Ireland knows, that there is a vast demand for land in this country. The picture that has been painted of thousands and thousands of people closing their doors and leaving the land is completely unrealistic and completely untrue.  There is not a Deputy in rural Ireland or any Land Commission official or certainly any Minister for Lands who is not fully aware, as Deputy McLaughlin has said, that there are thousands of people every day in the week looking for more land. The fact is that land is a very scarce commodity and that there is not enough of it to go around.  It is completely unrealistic to start talking about giving 60-acre or 70-acre holdings or £25 valuations in respect of land that may be in outer space but is certainly not in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred in my opening statement to the fundamental job of the Land Commission which is the relief of congestion in this country.  We estimate that there are between 60,000 and 80,000 uneconomic landowners in this country and these are the first charge on the land of Ireland that may be available for the relief of congestion. Every other category that you shove in on that limited pool will prolong the job of clearing up our land slums. <Col N="1371" /> Every other acre you make available by way of additions or going into higher valuations than, say, £15, which is the general rule in the west now, will lessen that limited land pool that is there available to do the job which we want to do.  With every new category like landless men, cottiers, farmers' sons, that you try to bring in, you simply not alone bring them in but you are diminishing a pool which is not sufficient for the purpose for which it is needed; you are postponing the day indefinitely when these land slums are cleared up.</P>
    <P>If we got the Six Counties in the morning, uninhabited, there would not be enough land to deal with the cleaning-up of our congestion problem. It is therefore not alone unrealistic but unfair to dangle a mythical carrot in front of classes of people who cannot in our circumstances ever hope to get land from the Land Commission, people such as landless men and farmers' sons who have been referred to here.  It may perhaps be good politics in the short term but in my view it is bad politics in the long term to hold out these seductive carrots in front of these men in the hope that they will get something from the State which we all know is not there.</P>
    <P>I do not think that that is honest policy.  It is completely unrealistic.  I am quite satisfied that those who are advocating that line of country in this House are perfectly well aware that it is unrealistic and are perfectly well aware that it is dishonest.  It is true that, with the new query we have put in the recent census, we shall be able to speak of this problem with practically mathematical accuracy.  However, I have no doubt that when we get these new statistics in this new form, in the way it is now being put, it will disclose a state of affairs somewhat similar to what I am telling the House now, and that the problem of the congested areas, of the people in the land slums, will not prove to be any less than I have indicated to the House here tonight.</P>
    <P>We have between 60,000 and 80,000 <Col N="1372" /> people living on uneconomic units and intermixed units, in many cases rundale. These are the people whom the Land Commission and its predecessor, the Congested Districts Board, were designed to relieve.  Until they are dealt with let me emphasise again that all others must come to the end of the queue.  In my view, they will be wasting their time at the end of the queue because, by the time the congestion problem as I know it and as I have studied it is dealt with in this country, there will not be and cannot be land to go around for all these other classes that have been spoken of here tonight by those people who seem to think that we have an unlimited amount of land in this country to deal with the problems with which we are faced.</P>
    <P>I should also make this clear, too, that the problem that is left, dealing with this question of congestion, is the hard core problem; I refer to 10,500 odd cases that have not yet been vested.  These cases in the main are the remnants of the worst congested estates in this land.  The estates that were easy to deal with have naturally been dealt with during the years.  What is left in the main is comprised of different intermixed rundale estates where you have possibly one man's farm comprised in eight or ten intermixed plots with those of his neighbours.  In these cases, not alone is it essential to have migration before we can have any progress in dealing with that land slum but it is also essential to get the co-operation of the people in connection with the rearrangement of what is left.</P>
