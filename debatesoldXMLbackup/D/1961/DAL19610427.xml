      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why the Minister decided to fix the number of Deputies at 144?  I know that is the maximum on the basis of the 1956 Census but, having regard to the fact that the Taoiseach recently in reply to a question, intimated that the estimated population at the latest date available is, subject to correction, 2,830,000 would it not be wise to reduce the figure of 144 by at least two seats?  My view is that even 142 Deputies are far too many.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures operative in this Bill are those of the 1956 Census. When the 1959 Bill was going through this House, various Parties suggested that the number should be the maximum and one of the most consistent arguments advanced was that, in order to get material for a Government, it was desirable to have the maximum number possible.  When one considers that Government has to be <Col N="1268" /> drawn out of approximately half the number in the Dáil, it would be unduly restricted in choice of personnel if numbers were reduced below the permissible maximum.  Because we are so closely tied to these figures now as a result of the decision of the High Court we would, if we were to reduce the numbers still further, restrict rural representation particularly in the more difficult constituencies which fall to the lot of some Deputies.  We propose, therefore, to adopt the maximum number permissible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree, in preserving the ratio between Government and the Deputies behind it, that increasing the number of Ministries does not ease the problem to which the Minister has referred?  If it was possible to operate Government for so long with fewer Ministers, surely the Minister can see the problem now in relation to the number of Deputies in the House?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> In subsection (2), to insert before paragraph (d) the following new paragraph:</P>
    <P> (d)  (i) Where a constituency consists of parts of two counties, the returning officer may appoint the county registrar for the second county (and shall appoint him if he so requires) to be assistant returning officer for the part of the constituency in that county.</P>
    <P>(ii)  In the foregoing subparagraph &ldquo;the second county&rdquo; refers to such one of the relevant two counties as is not that for which the returning officer is the county registrar.  </P>
    <P>In subsection (2) of Section 7, it is intended to provide for the appointment of assistant returning officers.  On examination of the Bill after it was printed and circulated, it was discovered that one eventuality which does arise under this Bill when it becomes law is that where parts of two counties form a constituency, the various methods whereby the assistant returning officer could be appointed are not included in the section.  This amendment was decided on to meet such an eventuality where parts of two counties form a constituency.  That is the intention of the section.  It was a shortcoming in the section that we did not foresee.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 7, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two questions I want to raise on this section. First of all, what is the necessity for this section at all?  Is there not a permanent law laying down the duties of returning officers and the general mechanics of holding an election or is it necessary to change it every time we have a Redistribution Bill?  The second point has to deal with something I came across in a recent by-election in which a presiding officer was appointed as a deputy returning officer.  The extremely odd procedure was adopted that the presiding officer <Col N="1270" /> came and opened the booth and then left the booth in charge of whatever deputy he had there and returned to the centre of the constituency to function as deputy returning officer.  Surely that procedure is not right.  A presiding officer ought to be present in the booth to which he is assigned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be no harm if the Minister issues a direction to returning officers not to appoint one individual as presiding officer and deputy returning officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree that this is not a practice that should be continued.  I am wondering whether a deputy returning officer would not have been empowered, even on the morning of the election, for whatever cause may have arisen, to appoint a presiding officer in the polling station to which he was assigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that it is not a desirable practice that a man who is appointed in charge of a booth should arrive there with all the ballot boxes and everything else, open the proceedings, then put on his hat, get into his car and leave the booth in question in charge of one who is a minor officer in the electoral machinery.  It is undesirable to appoint the same man as deputy returning officer and as presiding officer in a single booth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall look into the matter.  If it would be possible to have details of the booth in question, it might be possible to find out how it came about.  I agree that it is not a practice that should arise.  I shall look into the question of drawing the attention of returning officers to the matter.</P>

      <P>The question has also been raised as to why this section is <Col N="1271" /> inserted.  It is for the purpose of appointing assistant returning officers and it has been so done in each of the Acts in the past.  So far as I am aware, it is necessary that it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there no global principle laid down in the 1923 Act that where a constituency includes an area outside the global areas of the returning officer, he has the authority to appoint a deputy returning officer?</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the entry stand part of the Schedule.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first item in the Schedule and, by this amendment, the Minister has brought in an entirely rural area into the city of Cork and has extracted from the old city borough constituency an area that is virtually as city as it possibly could be.  I do not set myself up as an expert on Cork geography, but indeed one would not have to be an expert on Cork geography to know that Rathcooney is a rural area compared with Blackrock and Douglas, which are <Col N="1272" /> suburban.  They have been in the city constituency and they are absolutely on the border of the administrative county borough.  I believe there are at present proposals under consideration in fact to extend the administrative county borough to include the Blackrock area.</P>
      <P>When the Minister deliberately, in his framing of Cork city, has extracted Blackrock from the city and put it into an area which stretches right up to Millstreet, he must be prepared for complaints.  By this part of the Schedule, he has done the reverse in regard to Rathcooney, a strictly rural area.  He has put it into the city.  I think the onus is quite clearly on the Minister to justify this arrangement, to justify it in the light of his own alleged belief that certain areas should not merely be next to each other, but, in addition, that they should be, as far as possible, representative of the same type of people.  It seems to me that to frame legislation of this sort round a city area so that people, all of whose contacts belong to the city, should be extracted from it and that rural people, who might require the assistance and the help of those experienced in rural affairs are brought in, and who, in any event, would prefer to be with their own rural companions, is a very bad thing and one which will cause deep resentment among the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record, I should like it to be known that the extension of the borough boundary as indicated by the Deputy is being opposed by the Cork County Council and by a big number of residents in the area affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse entirely what Deputy Sweetman has said about the inclusion of these electoral divisions in the Cork borough constituency. As far as my information goes, the total population of these divisions equates fairly approximately the population of the Blackrock area which is taken out of the city constituency. Apart from the extension of the borough boundary altogether, it is a well-known fact that there is no extension whatever in the Rathcooney area of the borough as there has been in the <Col N="1273" /> Blackrock area over the past number of years.  Blackrock is a residential area for people who have businesses in Cork city and there has been a wonderful development in that housing area. They have all the amenities enjoyed by the city people.</P>
      <P>When one goes into Rathcooney, one has left the city and is in a completely rural area the residents of which have nothing in common with the residents of Cork city.  In the old days, the electric trams always ran into Blackrock, but on the way to Rathcooney, they always stopped at Dillon's Cross and did not go any further.  It puzzles me what the motive behind this was because, as far as I can find in the city of Cork, no reasonable argument can be adduced for the change.  It will only cause confusion, resentment and a great deal of expense because of the chopping up of the register.  Why not leave things as they were?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing to hear the question being asked why was this or that not done.  I dislike this portion of the Bill in its general outlay just as much as any Deputy.  In regard to Cork borough, it is all very well to say that the people of Rathcooney will resent it.  I resent it, the Cork Deputies resent it and I feel sure many other Deputies in the House who have no connection with Cork will resent it. However, the fact remains that the Cork borough constituency as we have known it now contains a population of 112,000 on the old boundary lines. Those 112,000 people are much too great to be left as a five-seat constituency and it then follows that changes have to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change made here is that Blackrock, with a population of 16,700, has been taken out and put into the county. After deducting those 16,700 from the 112,000 the figure remaining was too low for a five-seat constituency and the addition of the population of 25,000 approximately in Rathcooney to the balance of 94,000 odd in the city would remedy that position.  This proposal for the new constituency coincides with the terms of the judgement of the High Court in relation to the 1959 Act.  That <Col N="1274" /> is the real reason and the reason we should not forget, why this was done.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, it is quite true that for years past Blackrock has been in the borough constituency.  St. Mary's and Bishopstown have also been in it.  The addition we are making is Rathcooney and Blackrock is being taken out of the old city constituency.  While it may be true the area as a whole is a built-up area, let us not forget that all its interests are not tied to the Cork borough and to the borough only.  In fact it does not belong to the Cork borough for administrative purposes but comes under the Cork County Council.  We should be fair in this matter and we should realise that this is not what I want to do or what I had done but what I must now do or something similar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Seemingly the Minister would like to share our resentment in regard to the proposals for rearranging the Cork constituencies. What the Minister did not advert to was that Senator O'Donovan's action had one particular success; it restored the seat which the Minister wanted to take from Cork city and county.  Having secured the restoration of the seat why should he embark on the drastic and ridiculous rearrangement which the House is now asked to confirm? The Minister made a point that this part of Cork city which he proposes to have transferred to mid-Cork, the Blackrock area, is in the administrative county area of Cork rural but there are other parts which he has included which are also in the Cork rural administrative area.  If the argument he is making in support of the exclusion from the Cork borough of this particular region holds good, it should also hold good for other parts which he intends to include in the Cork borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would imply that he is solely actuated by mathematical considerations and that to a certain extent he is hamstrung by these mathematical considerations but is it more than coincidence that of the five out-going Deputies in Cork borough two are not supporters of the Government, <Col N="1275" /> and that both of those Deputies reside in that part of the city that he is transferring from Cork borough constituency to the new mid-Cork constituency? I suppose that consideration never entered into the mind of the Minister when he was drafting the confines of the new constituency.</P>
    <P>Of course, people residing within a few hundred yards of Cork City Hall have extremely little in common with the people residing in the villages between Newmarket and Millstreet; they have extremely little in common with the people on the northern side of Mushera or the people resident in the Blackwater valley, who, from here on, unless the Minister accepts the reasonable case that has been made, will find themselves in a constituency where extremely wide variations of normal life exist between the people in those areas.  It is entirely contrary to what the Minister advanced on another occasion.  By the introduction of a five-member and four-member constituency, in addition to an existing three-member one in the county of Cork, he is creating large constituencies. Is this a conversion to the arguments he heard advanced when this House listened for months to proposals to whittle down constituencies to single-member size?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister's creation of the five-member constituency where the Counties Kerry, Limerick and Cork meet, to the mouth of the Blackwater at Youghal, in accordance with the arguments we heard for months that the constituencies which existed were too big?  Here we have created a mammoth constituency straddling the whole area.  I want to join with Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Manley in referring to the injustice created for the people in this constituency of Cork city who will be compelled to disassociate themselves from the centre where they would naturally expect to be included for the Dáil constituency of Cork City.</P>

It is no use putting up any line of argument that will in <Col N="1276" /> itself convey the impression that all the suburbs must stay with the Cork borough area.  Where I differ with the Minister is this.  He may not know it, but Blackrock had always been with Cork borough, an area with a voting population of approximately 10,000 votes.  While it does come under the Cork County Council for local administration it had always been connected with the borough for general election purposes.  It is but fair to draw attention to the fact that up to 1947 the western part of the suburbs had always been part of the county for Dáil election purposes.  I should like to know why the Bishopstown area should come into the city and the Blackwater-Douglas Road area, which had been with the city all the time, should go out.  It is like changing horses in a big race.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister did find himself in difficulty when he was faced with including Rathcooney and that he had to bring up his figures.  The Minister, however, should not forget there was no need for the alterations he has suggested in relation to the Blackrock area.  Some months ago when we were discussing this matter I drew attention to the fact that it was quite sensible to suggest that the western suburbs, the Bishopstown area, would go with South Cork and they could relieve South Cork to go into another constituency, namely West Cork.  The Taoiseach intervened to suggest that would mean giving Cork another seat. Of course the answer has been given by the High Court decision, that Cork is entitled to another seat, the seat taken from it in the Bill presented by the Minister.  In view of the fact that, by the decision of the High Court, it is accepted that Cork is entitled to the additional seat why go chopping up to such an extent as bringing Rathcooney in?  Rathcooney could be left with South Cork, with the inclusion of Bishopstown in South Cork.  That would relieve the city of the heavier percentage that obtained there prior to the Bill that was introduced last year when the members of the Cork borough area represented 22,000 per member.  Is the Minister prepared to consider this point?  Is he prepared <Col N="1277" /> to admit, as he must in all fairness, that Bishopstown is more a rural area than the Ballinlough-Blackrock area? I would say against the argument that may be put up relating to the inclusion of Bishopstown and leaving out Blackrock, that while the Blackrock area certainly has claims for inclusion in the suburb, we have all the years back represented that area in the Cork County Council.</P>
    <P>The Minister can understand from me that we are not bargaining or putting up a case to suit members.  The history of Blackrock in the Cork County Council stands as well as that of any other part of the Cork rural area.  We have our friends there.  We are not looking for concessions that may help us politically.  Nobody can suggest that the people of the Blackrock area are complete strangers to us. They are not.  That must not be considered as against the general principle of interfering with an area which history had included in the city for Dáil purposes.  It is fantastic to suggest that such a place as Rockborough Avenue, ten or 15 yards from the South Infirmary in the heart of the city should now go into mid-Cork because of this change by the Minister. There is no sensible reason for it.  We can continue to serve these people in the county but why drag them into the county and associate them with outside areas for Dáil purposes when there is no need for it?  I suggest that the Minister reconsider the position of the Bishopstown area which in the past has been in the county, as against Blackrock, which has not.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy MacCarthy. In case anybody may make suggestions about the extension of the borough boundary, I would advise these people and the Minister to be very careful because as regards the extension, the Cork County Council and the people in the suburbs, Blackrock as well as Bishopstown, say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to it and we as public representatives, equally, say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us is happy about this redistribution.  The question of residence has been raised, <Col N="1278" /> that in the case of two Deputies opposed to the Government, the area in which they reside is now to be put into Mid-Cork.  I would have hoped for another division because I live within about a mile of the present city borough and I was hoping that the rearrangement would put me living in my constituency but it has not.  So, surely that kind of argument does not hold?  The Minister was tied up by the consideration that the figures had to fit in and that he could not divide electoral areas.  I sympathise with him in what he had to do and we all feel sorry about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>One may perhaps wonder why anyone who is not from Cork is so brave as to step into a Cork arena.  It is simply for the reason that, as the Taoiseach said when he was leaving the House, one sometimes is not able to see the wood for the trees, if one is in the area.</P>
      <P>There is another way by which, on the Minister's showing, he could have dealt with the matter.  As I understand his figures, the Blackrock area has a population of 16,705.  If he had not taken that population out of Cork city, he would have had to add very much fewer people to it to make a six seat constituency in Cork city within the ambit of the judgment and, although nobody wants to take people out of areas, one must consider where the balance of gain lies.  The Minister's only reason, as he says, is that he wants to make a mathematical calculation. To take 16,705 out of one place and to add 2,550 in another is balancing it in entirely the wrong way.  It has got to be done.  If the Minister is right in saying that he had to consider it from the mathematical angle, the appropriate argument is to concede to the 16,705 that their disturbance would be the greater misfortune.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister can come here and just say in this case that it is entirely a mathematical question.  It is not, because, on his own statement, he had another mathematical arrangement open to him, to make the borough a six seat constituency rather than take away 6,705 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> I would freely concede to the Minister that if you accept the situation in respect of certain parts of rural Ireland and then you come to a centre piece, so to speak, you have no room for manoeuvre.  That is not the case here at all.  The case here is that there is ample scope for manoeuvre within the tolerance provided by the court action and it would have been perfectly possible to provide a scheme here by which the suburban area of Blackrock would have been where it rightly belongs for Dáil purposes and where it has always belonged for Dáil purposes, in the county borough of Cork.  I accept that it would have meant some disturbance, some discomfort, if you like to use the word, in certain other areas but doing it in that way would have involved far less discomfort and the number of people who would have been affected would have been far fewer.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is quite clear that it was not entirely for the mathematical reason that the Minister dealt with the matter in this way.  If there were the mathematical reason, then he should follow his mathematics out to the bitter end and disturb only the smaller number of people.  He has not done that.  He has disturbed the larger number.</P>

      <P>The suggestion put forward by Deputy Sweetman is one that certainly appealed to me personally earlier on but since I am, like Deputy Manley, totally against taking seats from the rural areas and giving the boroughs more representation, even though it is against me personally, I felt, in principle, that we should oppose it.  Although the position now hardly pleases fully any representatives from Cork, at the same time, the other solution, that Cork should be a six seat constituency, would considerably strengthen the hands of those who want to enlarge the city boundaries.  At the same time, from a national Parliament point of view, it is a bad tendency to give representation to the boroughs at the expense of the rural districts.  That is my firm conviction.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister explain why, when he was dividing North-Dublin he did it in this way? As I understand it, he has not kept exclusively to ward areas.  Would it not have been a better proposition for him to leave as much of the existing constituencies as he could leave and take his tolerance by the additions going out from the city as they have been built up?  What he has done in taking away from North-East in one <Col N="1281" /> place, and adding to it another place, has had the result of disturbing more people than was necessary.  He has transferred 5,574 from Glasnevin to North-East, 2,602 from Glasnevin to North-West and at the same time he has put part of North-East into North Central.  He has not got the argument here that he is keeping to ward boundaries. If he were able to make, in relation to this, the same argument as he made in relation to Cork I might not agree with him but I could understand his arguing the point.  Here he has taken out certain areas and I do not know by what rule he has done it. If you are not going to keep to ward areas you should disturb from their old customs as few people as possible from the existing constituencies.  The Minister seems to have gone out of his way to take more out in order to put more in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The other matter which is relevant in this connection is that we have contained within the city boundary the boundaries of our new constituencies; in other words, north of the river and in the north of the county the city boundary is co-terminus with the constituency boundaries as set out in this Schedule. That was something we hoped we could do and tried to do as far as possible. There was something else we had to do&mdash;to contain the constituencies north of the River Liffey within the city boundary and at the same time add a new seat to that area.  In doing all that, I do not think we have in any way disturbed more of the electorate than was absolutely necessary. We were tied by the desirable aim that the city boundary should, as far as possible, not be reached and that we should not have a constituency on both sides of the River Liffey.  We have done that and we have kept to the city boundary.  We have added a new seat, and only one ward in addition to those wards split in the 1947 Act has been split in this Bill.  If I may say so, it is no mean achievement to have managed all that with so little disturbance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not met the point I have made.  I am not arguing about the seat groupings but it seems to me that in his seat groupings as they are, he has taken 27,315 people out of North-East and he has added 5,574 people to North-East. That is all within the confines of the city boundary.  Therefore he has unnecessarily disturbed 5,574 people from their customary habits. That is a bad thing.  I could understand it if he could not avoid doing that without going outside the city. He could, because it is all within the city confines.  Within the city confines, the situation is that he has taken out 27,000 and brought in 5,500.  The wards were already split and he has split another one.  I do not think it matters so much about the wards as it does about breaching the counties. People like to keep to the same habits <Col N="1283" /> and know they are in the same constituency, so far as possible just as people in the smaller areas like to have their polling districts kept the same and not altered unnecessarily.</P>
      <P>There is no argument in what the Minister has said which explains why 5,500 were unnecessarily transferred. From the mathematical point of view, it could have been done just as readily and just as easily.  By leaving Glasnevin out, by leaving it as it was, in the North Central constituency, and taking 5,500 from Mountjoy which is already split in part, they would have arrived at exactly the same mathematical arrangement.  That would have kept within the tolerance and would not have gone outside the city boundaries, and the maximum number of people would still be left in their old area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the Deputy does not fully appreciate the circumstances in which this had to be done.  Under the 1947 Act, there was an extension of the city boundary which brought in a considerable part of the county.  That part is now contained within the city boundary.  In that way, we have applied the pattern of the old 1947 constituency to that new area.  We have added a seat and, in fact, in this case, rather than have any complaints about splitting Mountjoy, in this provision we have brought together the split parts of the Mountjoy area, and all of Mountjoy is now in the North-Central constituency, instead of having two constituencies as was the case under the 1947 Act.  I think those features have not been fully appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still feel that the effort that has been made to disturb as few as possible has been a fairly good effort and I doubt if it could be very much improved.  It is only when one goes to apply the remedy to what people may see as an objectionable feature of the Bill&mdash;it is all very well to apply it to an isolated objection&mdash;that one understands the various repercussions it would have on the adjoining constituencies. I say again that, taking all <Col N="1284" /> these matters into consideration&mdash; north of the river and within the city boundary, adding a new seat, the ward boundries, the existing boundries and so on&mdash;we have struck a reasonably fair balance.  The scheme and the pattern of the new constituency north of the river is, in fact, a very good effort to meet the wishes of the greatest number possible.  The objection to it is likely to be less than it would be to practically any other scheme drawn up in the same circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept what the Minister has said in relation to the rural constituencies, it does not apply at all to the city.  I fully understand, and we as a Party fully understand, that it is virtually impossible to consider one constituency in isolation. We dislike this Bill.  We think the Bill is grossly unfair to many parts of rural Ireland, but in order to amend it, it would be necessary to replot the whole map of the rural constituencies.  It is quite clear that only a Government would have the facilities available to them to do that; it is quite clear that could not be done by any Opposition. Therefore, except in certain isolated cases, we think the Bill is most unfair to the rural areas.  We cannot say how we would keep it within this tolerance. Remapping would quite obviously be outside the scope of anyone except the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a borough area, that situation does not arise.  In a borough area where you have street A or street X in constituencies adjacent to each other, it does not matter in the same way.  What is essential in a borough area is to disturb it as little as possible.  I am not arguing about the allocation of the seats north of the river, four, five and three. I accept the Minister's view that it is better to have them all within the confines of the city boundary, north of the river, but having said that, it would have been quite simple to deal with it on the principle of the disturbance of the least.  The North-East and the North-Central constituencies are certainly not drawn up on that basis.  On the basis of the figures the Minister himself circulated, 5,500 people were <Col N="1285" /> unnecessarily removed: 27,000 have been moved out and 5,500 have been moved back.  That is not the principle of the disturbance of the least.</P>

      <P>These amendments are designed to provide constituencies for Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Dublin South-East on a pattern similar to that which was contained in the 1959 Act for these areas.  It seems to me that the areas which were proposed in that Act were better than those in the present Bill.  They are framed in such a way that in the case of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, it will contain a compact urban area and, in addition, include the adjacent rural areas.  In the case of Dublin South-East, it will cover the existing constituency with some minor changes and add to it the adjacent areas which were included in the 1959 Act.</P>
      <P>It is a difficult task for a Deputy to frame amendments which will take account of the population figures, in the absence of all the particulars available to the Minister and his Department, but I have endeavoured to frame these amendments making as little change as possible in the existing county boundaries except the one I mentioned&mdash;to frame Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown on the basis of the 1959 Act and, similarly, with Dublin South-East. That entailed slight changes in some of the boundaries.  I think it is correct to say that, in the main, they were minor changes from the population point of view, but were necessary to comply with the High Court decision concerning population.</P>
      <P>I should mention that, like many other Deputies, I have a personal attachment to one particular area which is being transferred from Dún Laoghaire under the proposed changes. I suppose most of us like to retain an attachment to the area in which we live or have lived for most of our lives. On the other hand, I recognise that certain changes were necessary because of the population changes that had taken place.  But it so happens that a very radical change was made in this area in 1947; again, as a result of the increase in population, in the present Bill, and to some extent also in the 1959 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one particular point, this proposal involves a breach of the city boundary.  While it is true that the Bill, with the exception of one particular <Col N="1288" /> area, does not breach the city boundary, that is only a reasonable development.  Under the 1947 Act, the city boundary was breached in a number of areas.  In certain cases, in fact, subsequent to that Act, the city boundary was extended into the administrative county of Dublin.  I have endeavoured to frame this amendment in such a way as not to disturb the existing areas except between two constituencies which were directly concerned.</P>
    <P>In the 1959 Act, any consequential changes were carried out merely on the basis of complying with the requirement that as far as possible the same ratio be kept between Deputies in each constituency.  The population ratio, therefore, had to be altered in certain cases.  In order to do that, there were consequential boundary changes at certain points, mainly in the Rathfarnham South wards, and other consequential changes in Stillorgan, where some townlands not included in the Dublin South-East constituency under the 1959 Act have been included on this occasion in order to comply with the requirements I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this amendment and have drawn up the population figures which would result from the suggested division.  I also had prepared a map of what the proposed constituencies would look like. Whether the House believes it or not, I have considered these amendments sympathetically, because I believe that, where it is possible to avoid it, there should be no more disturbance of population and sitting Deputies than is absolutely necessary.  Despite that approach, I could not find grounds which would justify me in accepting these amendments.  The resulting constituencies would be big and awkward in shape.  For example, Dublin South-East is proposed to be extended to such a degree that it would stretch from the Pigeon House down to the Grange Golf Club and across to Leopardstown.  That is not by any means an improvement on what is proposed in the Bill.  In addition, it would create a second breach in the city boundary.  We have tried <Col N="1289" /> to avoid this and have been successful, except in the case of Ballyfermot. As I say, this would in fact create a second breach in that boundary, which is not desirable if it can ordinarily be avoided.  Again, it breaches the borough of Dún Laoghaire and puts part of it in different constituencies which is being avoided in the present proposals.  Overall, the final yardstick by which you might measure the amendment against what is proposed is that neither in configuration nor in figures do the proposed amendments improve the pattern as outlined in the Bill.  I cannot suggest to the House that these amendments are an improvement. In fact, they are a disimprovement. Therefore, I do not feel we can accept them.</P>

      <P>There is one drawback the Minister has mentioned in connection with the proposal outlined in this amendment but it is equally true to say that it also applies to the Bill as drafted.  I refer to the proposal regarding the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. Though mainly urban, it is rather extended compared with other urban constituencies.  I agree that, on the proposal as drafted, Dublin South-East would be somewhat extended. Whether it would be possible between now and the Report Stage to draft an amendment which would provide for more compact areas might be considered.</P>
      <P>I am not wedded to the actual boundaries laid down in this except in so far as it is an effort to comply with the judgment and to make certain changes which seemed feasible and desirable.  It may be that a more suitable amendment might be drafted which would preserve Dún Laoghaire borough as far as possible as a compact entity and at the same time not spread a constituency which, by and large, is mainly urban though adjacent to a rural area.  If the Minister would consider an amendment between now and Report Stage I should be happy if possible to frame one to meet that viewpoint.</P>

The pattern of the numbers in the constituencies as outlined under these amendments was tried by us to find the best method.  Having tried all these patterns the proposal in the Bill has an advantage over all the others.  A further reconsideration of the pattern may possibly throw up something acceptable or less objectionable or that might even be an improvement.  I doubt if that is possible from our past work on this side of the city but I shall try again if the Deputy and the House so wish me to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister and accepted his statements until he gave the reasons for the change in North-Central.  I refrained from participating in that discussion, believing it better to keep to South-West, the constituency I represent and know so well.  It is embarrassing for me to speak on this matter because it can be said that I personally am losing so much.  I cannot blame the Minister for that: last year he endeavoured to leave it within the city boundary.  I believe the Minister was not actuated by any factor other than mathematics.  I am not a good mathematician. In relation to Dublin South-West, we might consider the city limits. I cannot conceive how any adviser to the Minister, assuming he had to lose figures, which we recognise he had to do, could retain Walkinstown in Bluebell and yet delete the portion of Ballyfermot that has always been in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ballyfermot is a vast area.  The wants of the people there are known to their representatives.  I could readily understand if the Minister had decided to create a constituency for South County Dublin and another for North <Col N="1291" /> County Dublin as we have tried to keep the Liffey in mind for the North and the South.</P>
    <P>I take it mathematical considerations governed the delineation of these constituences but, in relation to this constituency, the situation is somewhat illogical.  Apart from the south-eastern variation, at the other end of the constituency an area greater than that which obtained even in 1918 has been taken in.  In 1918 Rathmines Road was the dividing line.  Again, an area in the south west has been brought in.  I believe that the one thing we ought to do is to reduce the area.  Oddly enough, the Minister has taken one jump easterly and another jump westerly. No submission made by the Minister so far satisfies me that the south-west constituency has been dealt with either intelligently or mathematically from the point of view of the people and apart altogether from any question of consideration for Deputies.</P>
    <P>I have no personal axe to grind because I shall now be fighting for myself in an area in which I fought for others in 1918.  I am not motivated in my argument because of the loss of Ballyfermot.  I appeal to him to remove the dogs' legs and the pockets and not bypass such a densely populated area as Cherryfield and Kimmage West.  The proposed new area needs revision.  In the 1959 Act the clear intention was not to bring about a divorce in boundaries.  Under this Bill Ballyfermot is brought into the country. Anybody who walks from Emmet Bridge to Charlemont Street Bridge and then three-quarters of a mile in a southerly direction must appreciate that there is something lopsided in this new arrangement.  If one visualises an isosceles triangle, and one extends the two long sides of that triangle and contracts the shorter side, one has a picture immediately of the proposed new area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>For a time I was at somewhat of a loss to appreciate what the Deputy was really getting at, but it seems to me now that, having listened to the Deputy and others who <Col N="1292" /> have spoken here this morning, the advantages of the defunct 1959 Act are now being compared with the disadvantages in the present Bill.  Deputy Carroll spoke of the loss of Ballyfermot to Dublin south-west.  In all elections up to the present Ballyfermot belonged to County Dublin.  Had the 1959 Act continued in operation Ballyfermot would have been in the Dublin south-west constituency.  It was never part of that constituency in the past and it is, therefore, not lost to that constituency now.  The part now being added to the constituency is approximately one-third of Ballyfermot. Rather than suffering a loss of all Ballyfermot to the county, as has been suggested, the south-west constituency is actually gaining one-third of Ballyfermot.</P>
      <P>In relation to the south-east constituency, we have merely moved further eastwards.  The boundary is now the ward boundary.  We have brought in the full Rathmines West Ward into the south-west constituency. In doing so we have departed from the 1947 boundary, but only to a fractional degree and only for the purpose of bringing in the entire ward. These changes were made, among other reasons, because of a fixed pattern of configuration in relation to both city and country.  The constituencies are confined within certain ratios of population to seats, not departing very far upwards or downwards from the average.</P>
      <P>As well as that, we have kept the dividing line of the Liffey.  It is a clear line of demarcation.  If there were constituencies crossing the river they would not be anything like as clearly defined because houses and streets in built-up areas look very much alike. In the country where you have the various landmarks there are no such difficulties.  If we have to make accommodation lines across the river, as far as the city is concerned we are not being inconsistent by not doing that in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting back to Deputy Carroll's argument in regard to this matter I say to Deputy Carroll and to the House that the objections with regard <Col N="1293" /> to any constituency which has been changed are far too easy to enumerate, but the remedy is a different matter altogether.  We worked on this for a considerable time to get the pattern of the South City and the pattern we have now produced is one which, in my estimation, is the best that we can make within the considerations of population and other factors.  Anything else we could do would only create far greater and much more stringent objections in many cases.  I say that knowing the difficulties we had in drafting the pattern we now have and knowing the number of times we tried various other patterns.</P>
    <P>The others we found were worse and more objectionable and even I, who am not a resident of Dublin, could see far more objections to the other patterns we considered.  These patterns might remove Deputy Carroll's objection, but would create many more objectionable ones.  It is difficult and, indeed, impossible to satisfy everyone in this matter.  I am not saying that objections do not count.  I agree that there are and will be objections.  There are objectionable factors to various Deputies and to various areas of population, but we must have regard to the confines within which this matter had to be done.  I like it no more than any one of you in this House.</P>

The Deputy will agree that all the houses in Ballyfermot were not built since the last election.  It is not correct to say that the county Deputies cannot properly represent them.  I have brought back one-third of the population into the city so that the city Deputies can look after them.  If it were possible and feasible, having regard to the question of numbers, all of Ballyfermot would have been brought in. The Deputies for the County of Dublin, while they have been representing rural Dublin, would not, I am sure, lose themselves in the city.</P>

Can the Minister tell me what is the population which is in that part of Ballyfermot in the county borough of Dublin that is now being brought into Dublin South-West? What is left outside after that part of <Col N="1295" /> Ballyfermot is brought into the South-West and for which the Minister says the figure is 8,358?</P>

It does seem absurd that, with a five-member constituency, and suppose that we have two, two and one, a Deputy in the North end of the constituency or in the real South end of it would have to represent people who are very far away.

      <P>Deputy Corry was one of the people who was most vocal about laying down those rules 23 years ago when going around the country and coming into this House talking about bringing in legislation and about getting it enacted.  He should have known what he was doing.  As usual, he was talking entirely through his hat and did not know what he was asking the people to enact.  In view of what he said in those days, he should be coming in here now in sackcloth and ashes, excusing himself and asking the people to forgive him.

      <P>When the Minister changed the county boundaries at all, he should have gone further out into the country and brought in many more country Deputies to represent portions of the Dublin constituencies.  I think it would be a very good thing to have country Deputies representing Dublin, even though they might come from as far away as Mayo and West Cork. We are elected here to represent the people of Ireland and I think it would broaden the outlook of public representatives if city Deputies were given the opportunity to represent rural constituencies and <i>vice versa.</i>  Figures show that this year as few as ten people lived on hundred-acre areas in the country, whereas in Dublin there are over 4,000 to the hundred acres.

      <P>The Minister has correctly pointed out that in the 1957 election two-thirds of what is known as Ballyfermot was actually part of the county for voting purposes and approximately one-third of what we in the South-West area describe as Lower Ballyfermot, as distinct from Upper Ballyfermot, voted in South-West. The suggestion made seems to imply that because Lower Ballyfermot with Inchicore and Chapelizod, the Kilmainham ward practically, have been taken away from South-West, they are in the county.  They are not; they are in South-Central, so that they are still under the supervision, if you like, of city Deputies.</P>
      <P>The problem is this.  We had to surrender something like 13,000 to 18,000 of a population&mdash;I do not know the exact figure&mdash;and most of these were taken into South-Central.  Some of that area and portion of the Rathfarnham area was given to South-East, which is also a city area.  It does not matter to the citizens what particular area they are in, if they are city people and vote for city candidates.  There should not be a subsconscious approach to this amending legislation on the basis of how it will affect me as a candidate, but of how it will comply with the decision of the court and best serve the citizens when they face a general election.  None of us knows exactly how the change in the population&mdash;the reduction, if you like, in the population&mdash;of the South-West constituency will affect a particular candidate or how it will affect the return in the overall response for particular Parties.  When the election takes place, we will find out.  None of us can say who will benefit or lose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that where additional seats are created, there will be a better chance for sitting candidates.  Others who nearly made it will have a better chance in the next election.  I cannot understand all the worry and consideration that has been given to it.  If <Col N="1299" /> we in South-West have lost a certain population, it means we have also lost a certain number of voters.  If the voters, as I assess it, will be fewer in South-West by approximately 5,000, then, in my opinion, the quota will be down by about 1,000.  Therefore, the candidates will not have any great problem, unless a particular candidate got his votes exclusively in one pocket and not from the overall constituency.</P>
    <P>I have not studied the map very carefully.  I shall wait until the matter is through the Dáil and is accepted as being the new basis on which the elections will be held, but I am not at all worried about these small items.  I believe the city people of the Ballyfermot area who previously voted in South-West will now be voting in South-Central.  Other areas taken from South-West will either be voting in South-Central or possibly in South-East and I do not think there is any great problem.</P>

      <P>The point is that Ballyfermot is an area which has grown up and whether the people in it previously voted in County Dublin or not is not the point.  They are all people who have gone out from the centre of the city and Ballyfermot is now exclusively a city area.  It is, for municipal purposes, in the Dublin Corporation area and it has its representatives who look after them for municipal purposes and they would like to look after them for Dáil purposes as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I suspected, there has been a misunderstanding.  What is the official ward boundary of Ballyfermot is not what has been locally <Col N="1300" /> known as Ballyfermot over the years. Kilmainham and Inchicore have been mentioned.  So far as my determinations are concerned, no part of them belongs to Ballyfermot.  There is the Kilmainham ward which was in South-West and is now in South-Central.  The figures for Kilmainham are 18,189, who have gone into South-Central.  West of that Kilmainham ward and west South-West is the area of Ballyfermot which we have had to look on as the ward of Ballyfermot.  That ward has been split, 21,000 going to county Dublin and 8,000 odd to the South-West constituency of Dublin city.</P>
      <P>People may wonder how we came to get the dividing line for that and the answer is that it is the railway embankment to the north of that, and, within the remainder of the boundary of Ballyfermot is the Ballyfermot ward which in fact is in County Dublin.  I knew there must be a misunderstanding and the misunderstanding was that I am talking on the basis of the officially designated boundary but I think the people dealing locally with this area, who may live there or have represented it, have another idea as to what Ballyfermot was or is, as distinct from the official delineation of boundaries.  That is where we appear to differ but really we do not differ.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us call it what you like.  Adjoining it, there are South-West and South-East, practically surrounding it, and on the other side is County Dublin.  There are five seats in South-West and five seats in South-Central. There are supposed to be five seats in Dublin County.  If we leave the 21,000 in the city, we obviously must add it to either the existing South-Central or South-West areas, which would mean one of two things, both of which are undesirable: the creation of a six-seat area in the city or the shoving across of the whole and knocking everything we have there already&mdash;a complete upheaval in the constituencies, a complete departure from the pattern that has been there for some time and to which we have tried to adhere as far as possible in this matter.  I agree that we have had to make changes that are not liked, that are resented, that will create confusion, but any change made in the city will create confusion more than is the case in the country.  If we were to leave this in, we would have to create a six-seat constituency, a proposal with which, in fact, I would not come to the House.</P>

There would be even fewer satisfied Deputies and voters when it came to this further upheaval. Do not forget we are leaving this disputed territory of Ballyfermot in the constituency in which it has grown up. <Col N="1303" /> That is the one feature about it.  It is not something that was in a city constituency and is being taken out.

      <P>In page 6, in the second column of the entry relating to North-East Cork, to delete &ldquo;Blarney,&rdquo;&ldquo;Greenfort&rdquo; and &ldquo;Whitechurch&rdquo; in the reference to the former Rural District of Cork, and to insert &ldquo;Bally-hoolahan,&rdquo;&ldquo;Boherboy,&rdquo;&ldquo;Coolclogh,&rdquo;&ldquo;Kilmeen,&rdquo;&ldquo;Meens&rdquo; and &ldquo;Williamstown&rdquo; in the reference to the former Rural District of Kanturk. </P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider how undesirable it is to divide wards, as far as the city is concerned? In this amendment, we are asking, in respect of three divisions, to include in the constituency of North-East Cork the greater portion of the Kanturk rural district, which is bounded on one side by the Blackwater River and on the other by the main road leading to Williamstown.  The arrangement suggested in the Bill will eventually lead to considerable confusion in relation to the rearrangement of polling booths.</P>
      <P>I happen to have very good knowledge of the position there and I find that at present as far as the county council is concerned people have to travel very far distances in three or four different areas to polling stations. As far as the north-western portion of the area is concerned, extending to the Limerick-Kerry border, that is a very narrow strip of territory and if the remaining portion of the Kanturk rural district were included in that angle, it would make the work far easier for representatives and would make it easier for the electorate to get to the polling station.  The rearrangement of polling stations will be extremely difficult and I am asking the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

The area that it is being sought to take over now is portion of the old constituency that sent me into this House first 35 years ago and I have a very definite objection to losing any of it, whereas <Col N="1305" /> the area Deputy McAuliffe suggested should be handed over to us is an area which I have not represented before and surely you would not send an old lad like me out there now?</P>

      <P>I would have a further objection in giving him the first canter over the ground.  When you undertake operations and clear up a bit of country, it should not be transferred to someone else.  We have had enough of that dodging for the past four or five months.  We know where we are now.  The constituency is too big for a Deputy to take over an area and then discover that it does not belong to him at all.  That upsets calculations altogether.  I have examined the map and I cannot find any justification whatever for the proposed change. Another sentimental reason I have is in relation to my dearly-beloved friend, Deputy O'Sullivan.

      <P>When I heard there were to be amendments to this Bill, I expected these amendments would not interfere with the old boundaries of Cork.  We visualised that South-Cork as we knew it would be one entity and North-Cork another.  I did not expect this frivolous amendment, and I can call it nothing else, by which four townlands are taken from one constituency and transferred to another in order to benefit the two Labour men concerned.  I have travelled sufficient ground and I do not want to have any more travelling inflicted on me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious the Minister has no cogent reasons for refusing to accept the amendment.  The ignorance of Deputy Corry in this <Col N="1306" /> connection far exceeds anything displayed by him here before.  We know Deputy Corry has already been up around Mallow and Millstreet where he has two loyal colleagues although he suggests it would be unfair to extend his travels.  He has also been around Blarney.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give the people their rights and not to consider the convenience of Deputies, even of Deputy Corry.  He was surprised at the spirit of this amendment.  He expected something else but he did not get his way.  All we seek is justice for the people.  If the Minister refuses to recognise the rights of the people, it is our duty to expose to the House the frivolous expressions of Deputy Corry and the reticence of the Minister in refusing to justify his opposition to the amendment.</P>
      <P>The combined population of the three electoral divisions of Blarney, Greenfort and Whitechurch, each within seven to ten miles of Cork city, is 3,376, according to the 1956 census. On the other hand, the combined population of the other six electoral areas in the north-west&mdash;Ballyhoolahan, Boherboy, Coolclogh, Kilmeen, Meens and Williamstown&mdash;is 3,388. Therefore, if the 1956 census is not questioned now by the Minister, the difference in population is 12.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry knows that for local authority purposes the electoral areas of Blarney, Whitechurch and Greenfort are and always have been under the South Cork Board of Health and Board of Assistance.  The activities of the members on those boards affect the everyday lives of the people in those areas.  Deputy Corry happens to be just one who finds himself very closely situated to Blarney, Whitechurch and Greenfort and, of course, the other areas are out of his reach, or almost; he would reach them, I know. He has no right, any more than I have, to demand that because it suits him, a certain electoral area should be his for representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He knows his colleague, Deputy MacCarthy, has as much support in these electoral areas as I have.  He <Col N="1307" /> knows that Deputy Manley, a member of the Fine Gael Party, has as much support in these electoral areas as a Labour man.  Nobody can say the amendment is based on any presupposed advantage given to any member who may be a candidate.  It is based on the fact that the members in mid-Cork area who may be elected and who may live in a southern area cannot serve Blarney, Whitechurch or Greenfort.  He may get, and it is his duty to consider, complaints from people who are now included in the north-west area, according to the Bill as presented by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If Deputy MacCarthy or I get complaints from people in the north-west about cottage repairs, the condition of roads, lack of water supplies, and so on, we cannot make personal representation. We must write to the North Cork Board of Health in Mallow asking them to consider representations on behalf of people who are far removed from us for local authority purposes.  The same situation applies to Deputy Corry.  There are many parts of the North-East constituency of which he cannot claim to be a direct representative on the local authority in respect of housing and sanitary services for these people. Apparently he is not concerned with them.</P>
    <P>Again, any figure or any basis can be worked out to substantiate this amendment.  According to this huge memorandum submitted to us this morning&mdash;after all, we got it only at 10.30 a.m.&mdash;the average population, per district electoral area, or ward, in mid-Cork as it stands at present, is 820 and the average in North-East Cork is 810.  Our proposal, as I said already, means a variation in population of 12&mdash;only 12&mdash;in favour of North-East Cork because of the fact that North-East Cork has, per member, an average population of 80 less than mid-Cork. Surely no Minister and no person&mdash;except perhaps Deputy Corry&mdash; would attempt to refute the principle involved: equal distribution and fair play for the people concerned?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> This memorandum also states that the number of electoral divisions or wards&mdash;naturally we are not interested in wards; in the rural areas they are electoral divisions&mdash;in the proposed mid-Cork area is 99, and in North-East Cork it is 122.  What does the change there mean?  The addition to mid-Cork of three electoral areas or divisions and the substitution for them of six others means that, per member, in the mid-Cork area, the number would be 24, and, in the North-East area, 25 electoral divisions.</P>
    <P>These are the figures.  The Minister has stated here already, and on different occasions, that he does not wish to disturb any pocket of the population to such an extent that their interests will be affected.  The interests of the people in the six electoral areas in north-west Cork are concerned in this amendment.  Their interests are connected solely in local authority work, with the activities of the members in the North Cork area.  The interests of the people in the Blarney, Whitechurch and Greenfort areas are tied with the activities of the members of the South Cork Board of Health area because of the fact that they are component parts of the county council areas for those purposes.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if this amendment is opposed by the Minister, there is, in my opinion, no solid concrete ground on which he can base his opposition. I am sorry to say that if the Minister is determined to oppose the amendment, it is certainly not because he is thinking of the interests of the people in the areas concerned.</P>

      <P>I do not know what Deputy Desmond is aiming at.  He mentioned the South Cork Board of Health, housing and sanitary services. I have been chairman of the South Cork Board of Health for the past 15 or 16 years, and I had the honour of proposing and carrying through the first non-municipal scheme of housing in Bantry.  I cannot see why Deputy Desmond wants now to add to our organisation by having it attached to south Cork or removing it into the constituency of North-East Cork.  Does he want the representatives from the <Col N="1309" /> South Cork area to go to the North Cork Board of Health area to look after them?  Is that what he wants?</P>

If you have the population, it should not matter where the slice is put, but evidently it matters a lot to some people.  So far as I am concerned, I am not worried.  There is no portion of that constituency, with the exception of the area Deputy Desmond and Deputy McAuliffe wish to will to me now, that I have not represented.</P>

      <P>I would far prefer if the whole of the South Cork area remained together.  It would have suited the people and it would have suited everyone far better than this change, but since there is evidently no objection by Deputy Desmond and Deputy McAuliffe, except this objection, I certainly think this amendment is frivolous, on the face of it.  Deputy Desmond did not refer to the fact that in the area I represent the county council is portion of the south Cork area, for housing and sanitary schemes. I am the chairman of the South Cork Board of Health and he is the vice-chairman.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond opened the discussion on this amendment by saying practically nothing and I said very little more because I expected there would be more to come. I had hoped that in the contributions by the Deputies whose names are to the amendment we would have had the case outlined for changing the present proposals.  Instead, I am being asked to justify what is in the Bill.  Surely it is for the proposers of the amendment to justify the change?  No such justification has been forthcoming.  In fact, I do not think you would get agreement between any six Corkmen on one course or the other.  It is obvious there will be objections, no matter what you do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> The point has been made&mdash;I think it is a weak one, though perhaps it may not have been fully dealt with&mdash;that a rearrangement of polling districts and polling stations would be very difficult. I believe a polling scheme should be made to facilitate the people rather than that the people should be made facilitate it.  The polling stations are not fixed entities.  They can be changed and should be changed to suit the convenience of the people.  Under the present system, the people would appear to have come a long distance.  It is obvious, then, that the polling stations should be placed so as to convenience the people.  There need be no difficulty about that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond also made the point that it was proposed to take 3,376 people out of one constituency and put 3,388 in.  It was pointed out that there was a difference of only 12 and that was a good reason why it should be done, but more than that is necessary to convince me that the change is desirable.  I should like to know what advantage it confers or what objectionable feature it removes, as compared with the proposed scheme.</P>
    <P>I am being challenged to justify what is in the Bill by the proposers of the amendment.  I say it is for them to put the case for the proposed changes and to prove that case.  So far, no proof has been put before the House.</P>

He said he spoke with some authority as chairman of the Southern Committee of Cork County Council.  I want to point out that he was unanimously elected for the good reason that we felt we would never get any business done if Deputy Corry were anywhere else except in the chair.  It was one matter on which there was complete unanimity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have stood a lot, but I wonder whether we could <Col N="1312" /> stand that.  I am not in agreement with the amendment.  It refers to the position of the old North Cork constituency, now incorporated as part of the four-seat Mid-Cork constituency.  Any further whittling down of the population of that area would reduce the possibility of adequate representation in the new area.  The more that area is reduced, the lesser chance it has of becoming an integrated part of the new Mid-Cork constituency.</P>
      <P>The areas proposed to be transferred to North-East Cork will be adequately served in the new constituency.  I do not think Deputy Desmond need have any qualms about the services that will be afforded to people in those districts in relation to local authority matters.  We have members elected for various electoral areas straddling constituencies. They are obliged to look after local authority matters quite distinct from their parliamentary duties.  Deputy McAuliffe is resident in the area.  He knows everybody and he will continue to serve that region in his capacity as a member of Cork County Council and the Northern Committee.</P>
      <P>I want to say to Deputy Desmond that for many years I was a member of this House and not a member of a local authority.  I had to rely on the methods Deputies have to rely on when they are not members of a local authority and have not contact with the officials in the local authority offices.  I must say I met with nothing but courtesy and I was completely satisfied.  Now I represent an electoral area in the county council other than my own electoral area, but in my frequent contacts with the county council office in Mallow I am satisfied I receive as much attention in that office as I do in the Cork Courthouse in relation to matters concerning my own electoral area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, however, we are not dealing with local authority areas but with Dáil constituencies.  In my opinion, the greatest anomaly of the entire rehash of Cork County was the exclusion of the Mid-Cork capital from the constituency. Deputy Desmond referred to this on the Second Stage, but I had <Col N="1313" /> not an opportunity of doing so.  The capital of Mid-Cork was transferred from that constituency into South-West Cork.  That was a ridiculous thing to do.  It leaves the rural areas around the town of Macroom in the Mid-Cork constituency, while the town itself belongs to an area in the other constituency.</P>
    <P>It is a kind of Danzig, sitting between the main Mid-Cork constituency and its northern confines.  It represents a very attenuated offshoot of the South-West constituency and it has extremely little contact with the constituency to which it has been transferred.  That is a far greater error to have made than to have defined the northern boundaries, as the Minister has in this Bill.  It is because I want to preserve representation for that part of North Cork county now incorporated in the new Mid-Cork constituency that I feel we should at least retain the population proposed in the Mid-Cork constituency as it exists in the Bill.  For that reason, I am not in agreement with the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy O'Sullivan did not intend to convey that I in any way gave the impression that the staffs of Cork County Council are always anything but courteous to us.  I differ from Deputy O'Sullivan on this point.  There are three members here&mdash;two of the Government Party, Deputies Donegan and Moher, and Deputy McAuliffe.  They live in North Cork, as we know it now.  I am honest enough to say here publicly that should I be elected for Mid-Cork, I could not hope to give as good a service to the people in these six electoral areas in relation to local authority problems as any of those three members.  They are members of the North Cork Board. Deputy O'Sullivan is a member of the South Cork area of the County Council. Try as they may, Deputies Moher, Donegan and McAuliffe could not hope to give as good a service to the people of Whitechurch, Blarney or Greenfort as Deputy MacCarthy, Deputy O'Sullivan or myself.  They are not members of the southern area of the Cork County Council while we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My sole approach is to give service <Col N="1314" /> to the people.  It is quite clear that the Minister and I are completely at loggerheads on this matter.  I stand by my point of view.  However, to expedite business, I suppose the best thing I can do is to ignore Deputy Corry's remarks.  I am sorry I was drawn out to the extent of taking any notice of him.</P>
    <P>I had expected the Minister to explain the position in relation to the amendment.  I am convinced that the system of representation, for local authority purposes, is such that these three members could give far better service to the people in the electoral areas in the north-west as Deputy MacCarthy, Deputy O'Sullivan and myself could give to the people in the Blarney, Whitechurch and Greenfort areas.  Because of the population figures; because for all the years back, Blarney, Whitechurch and Greenfort have been part of the south Cork area of the county council and because the six electoral areas in the north-west have ever and always been part of the North Cork Board of Health area, we ask that in order to give better service to the people concerned the amendment be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather amazed at Deputy Corry's attitude.  Surely he is now admitting an air of defeat as far as the forthcoming election is concerned? Within the past few days he told me he would be getting 13,000 votes from North-East Cork.  He now objects to all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he had no argument for the amendment.  He also said, in another context, he is not prepared to divide city wards or that he did not like the idea.  It will be most expensive to rearrange polling stations.  At the moment, in one particular area, the townland of Drumcummer, the polling booth for Drumcummer is Banteer Village.  The same applies to North Ballydesmond village. The people from Glounthane and Ballymacelligott will have to travel to Kiskeam or Ballydesmond.  Heretofore, they voted in the constituency of North Cork.  The same will apply to many booths along the border.  The line is pretty well defined between the <Col N="1315" /> rural district of Millstreet and the rural district of Kanturk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is seeking power in this section to enable the Corporation to divide its ordinary stock into different classes.  There are two ways in which that can be done. One is to divide it into ordinary preference stock and the other into deferred stock.  In relation to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, deferred stock will have no meaning at all and therefore I think it is not visualised.  The attraction that used to exist in relation to preference stocks is one that has gone completely by the board unless, perhaps, one exempts from that statement the type of redeemable preference stock that can be made under the last Companies Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it more likely that this phrase is intended to cover voting and non-voting shares.  I do not think that in relation to a company set up by this House and that will be financed by public moneys, whether they are direct or by way of guarantee, it is proper in any circumstances that there should be a division between voting and non-voting shares unless the State holds the voting shares.  As far as I understand the situation, this is giving the Corporation itself power to deal with this matter.  The decision of the Corporation in relation thereto is not subject to the consent of the Minister in the same way as the consent of the Minister is necessary to increase the capital.  I am not happy that I have read the Section properly and I should like some guidance from the Minister with regard to it.  It says that it shall be lawful for the Corporation, subject to the consent of the Minister, to increase its capital and it goes on to say: &ldquo;and, if it so thinks fit, to <Col N="1319" /> divide ...&rdquo; If the consent of the Minister is to cover both acts that are intended, it seems to me that the consent of the Minister should be expressed in a much clearer way.</P>
    <P>I know from my own experience that there is always consultation about these things but it is far better, when one can, to avoid, in the initial stage, any possible misunderstanding at a later stage.  It seems that the division of stock into different classes at the option of the Corporation would, in this particular case, be at the option of the directors.  I suggest that there might be some better clarification of this phrase although I accept that, in the case of the ordinary commercial company, it is a normal phrase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the legal position in this matter, as to whether they can do it at an ordinary meeting or not.  I imagine that it might have to come before some other meeting for confirmation.  I shall have that matter looked into.  I should like to agree with the Deputy that no big change such as that should be made without the Minister's consent, so long as the Minister has the majority of the shares. We are bringing in the idea of stock as well as shares here.  That is a matter of convenience because most big companies who have transactions on the Stock Exchange find that stock is more convenient than shares in the way of transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea I had was to cover certain contingencies.  We are anxious to get farmers to invest in this company.  At the same time I have been telling the company that they must take some chances and some risks but I do not want them to put up the interest rate to cover that risk. What I really mean by that is that when they have made up their accounts and discovered their profit and loss, we shall then consider what interest we will take.  We may be prepared to take less than the four and a half per cent. if circumstances force us to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be too much to expect farmers to invest their money in that <Col N="1320" /> sort of an undertaking that might pay a very small dividend, perhaps for some years or perhaps for a long time. I thought the best way to get over that was to have ordinary shares, ordinary shares A and ordinary shares B.  The ordinary shares A provide a guaranteed dividend.  I do not want to say to the farmers: &ldquo;Put your money in preference shares,&rdquo; because then they would have no control.  The A shares would have a guaranteed dividend and farmers would be quite safe in investing in them.  For the B shares, being held by the Minister for Finance, the circumstances would determine the dividend.  In regard to whatever change might be made, I shall look into the suggestion made by the Deputy that the Minister for Finance should be in a position to take part in the discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is correct in what he says if he is anxious only to provide that farmers will have a guaranteed dividend and that he will have control. You can give preference shareholders control the same as ordinary shareholders. You can give them power to vote and elect directors.  The power to provide for the division of the capital into stock, as apart from the units, exists in all modern companies now.  The only purpose and reason for it is that it cuts out a lot of very unnecessary administrative clerical work.  If you keep your ordinary capital in shares, every time you transfer a share you have to keep and express on the transfer and on all the books of the company the number of the share so transferred.  If you do them in stock, you can run them on consecutively.  You can merely write it down as £1 10s. worth of stock.  I think that is what is being done here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Some difficulty has been raised in certain places as to the definition of a person in occupation of land.  It arises in subsection 12 (b) of this section.  What exactly is visualised there as between the rated occupier and the person in actual occupation of the land?  I am not very clear, if a person is described as being in occupation of the land, whether that means the person to whom the land is let in conacre can be included as a person who may ask the Agricultural Credit Corporation to operate a charging order. That does not seem to me at all the situation that would normally work. The charging order is intended to cover the case of the ordinary person who is in occupation of the land but whose title may not perhaps have been brought up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person to whom land is let under a conacre agreement is an entirely different person.  The person to whom the licence is granted in the case of a letting is the person whom I thought we intended to cover.  The paragraph is a bit complicated.  I think it covers all right the point that is raised, but I want to be absolutely certain.  There are three ways in which <Col N="1322" /> land can be utilised by persons other than the owner.  One is by leasing it. Under a lease, the occupation in law and for the purposes of Schedule B Income Tax, passes to the lessee. There is also a letting in conacre for tillage purposes and there is still another letting under a grazing agreement for pasturage purposes.</P>
    <P>What I want to know clearly is whether, in those three cases, it is the person who pays the rent who is the only person who can consent to the charging order or whether it is the person who receives the rent who is the only person who can consent to the charging order.  I think the intention is that it should be only the person who is receiving the lease rent, the conacre rent or the grazing agreement rent, but it is not clear because the last line refers to the person by whom the land is so let.  It does not mention at any stage the question of the lease by letting.  Up to this, that has not mattered very much because the restrictions on sub-letting and subdivision imposed by the Land Acts have previously been in respect of 95 per cent. of our agricultural land, but in the earlier Land Acts, there is prohibition against letting merely so long as the annuity remains.</P>
    <P>Many of these Ashbourne Act annuities are coming to the point now at which they will be paid off and the statutory prohibition against sub-letting will be gone.  There are not many cases but there are a few where it is desirable to make a temporary letting of land.  It applies particularly in a case where a man dies and leaves a widow and children, of whom the eldest may be 10 or 12 years of age. The widow may want to keep the farm but is not able to manage it until the young lads grow up.  I want to be sure beyond question that if she makes a letting to someone for a period of two or three years until the eldest boy comes to an age at which he will be able to take an active part in the management of the farm, she does not give the lessee the right to put on a charging order.  I think under the Act she is clearly not giving the conacre tenant, or the grazing agreement tenant, the right, but I want to have the <Col N="1323" /> other case covered, too, and to be certain beyond question in relation to the grazing and conacre tenant.</P>

      <P>In connection with Section 9, does it cover the case of an applicant for a loan who is in occupation of a farm of land but has not yet got the title up to date? The title might be in the name of his father or his grandfather who might have been dead for years.  I have seen a number of such cases, involving applicants for loans where the title was not in order.  Would this section cover that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my understanding of the purpose of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is right.  As to the case raised by Deputy Sweetman, a good deal of thought was given to this subsection with regard to the occupier. If you take the rated occupier or the person who is paying the annuity, it was pointed out, that man might have gone to England, America, or somewhere else, and left his brother in possession.  His name might still be down for paying the annuity or the rates.  In two cases already, I understand, in the case of the Gaeltacht Housing Act and the Land Project legislation, the question of occupier was left open and it has worked very well so far.  I believe it is almost impossible to find who the occupier is and the Agricultural Credit Corporation will have to exercise care and discretion in dealing with an occupier, but that is all one can say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain exceptions like agistment or conacre where the land is land for crops or grazing.  I am not sure whether the Deputy would be satisfied that in the case of a widow, which he mentioned, where the land is let for three years, she would be covered by these exceptions as laid down but I think it might be taken that if there is any care exercised at all, she would be protected.  How to protect her in words is a very difficult matter.  The drafting would be extremely difficult if you depart from <Col N="1324" /> the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; at all, except to put in certain specified exceptions as are put in here, if land is land for tillage or grazing.  That is all you can do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if a person who is in possession of lands through intestacy, perhaps because he cannot take out administration because one of the beneficiaries is in a mental home, does that section apply and would he be in a position to apply for a loan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For a permanent loan, but I am not so sure for a current loan.  There is a difference in regard to the power of the Corporation under this Act to give a current loan, where it would have to be the owner in that case, and a permanent loan which they can give to the occupier.  In the case mentioned by Deputy Davern, I am afraid the person could be regarded only as the occupier and only get a permanent loan until steps were taken to become the owner of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite proper that the Minister should restrict this pretty far-fetching power to something that was going to be of use to the holding in the future.  Otherwise, if a person were in occupation and got a loan allegedly, shall we say, for buying stock and did not use it for that purpose, the man who really owned the holding when he came back would have a &ldquo;blister&rdquo; on his holding and nothing to show for it, but in this case there will be a permanent improvement on the holding when he comes back.  I am talking now of the case mentioned by Deputy Davern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it is frightfully difficult to draft something which covers every case.  You could not produce a form of words in relation to occupation which would cover everything.  I do not think it would be much hardship on the Corporation to have a provision like this, that before they issue a charging order, they would give notice to anybody who, they were aware, had an interest in the land, not anybody who had an interest in the land because that would be just as bad <Col N="1325" /> as providing for the title to be properly modernised and brought up to date, but that they would give notice to anybody who, they were aware, had an interest in the land.  It would enable, for example, a person not covered by the existing form of words to cover themselves by giving notice to the Corporation that they were making this unusual arrangement and that they had an interest.  The Corporation in the course of their inquiries will become aware of people who have an interest in the land and are not actually occupiers at the moment.  If they had to give notice of some sort like that, then the people who are going to be prejudicially affected could come along and make their case by some form of procedure. It would add a little but I do not think it would add very much and I can see it preventing injustices in one or two cases.  It is not the sort of thing I would expect the Minister to answer offhand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to consider it but naturally I would have to consult the Corporation who might see very big objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What is going to happen in relation to a chargeable order where a loan is already in existence? Is the Corporation restricted here to giving a charging order where they would obviously be first mortgagees on the title?  Are they entitled to make a charging order subsequent to a bank mortgage?  If the land certificate is already extracted from the Land Registry, must the land certificate be handed back to the Land Registry before the charging order is made?  If not, I can see that this power is going to create complete chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not averse, when discussing political matters, from taking advantage of the Minister, but this is not a political matter and I do not want to take advantage of the Minister because I have some legal experience of it. The land certificate in respect of a holding is the only document of title that matters.  If anybody takes out a land certificate for a holding, subject to a land purchase annuity, that is his Government-guaranteed document of title according to what is written in <Col N="1326" /> that land certificate.  Farmer &ldquo;A,&rdquo; shall we say, takes out that land certificate. He then proceeds to take that land certificate to somebody else and, with that as security, borrows from a bank, or from a business&mdash;it does not matter.</P>
    <P>He goes on paying the interest on that loan for a number of years.  Then he dies and a brother, or perhaps his son, goes on in occupation and does not bother to extract the necessary administration to put the title in proper order.  The brother goes to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and offers himself as a guarantor.  The Corporation say: &ldquo;All right.  You are a good guarantor.  This is a good holding of which you are in occupation and we will secure ourselves by means of a charging order.&rdquo;  There is already in existence a perfectly valid legal equitable deposit of the land certificate. It would be most unfair that that valid mortgage already in existence would be jumped, so to speak, by this charging order.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to assure me that there is provision by which that cannot happen because, unless there is clear provision that that cannot happen, the remedy will be far worse than the disease because no one will give any loan on the equitable deposits of land certificates.  The same thing would happen in relation to freehold land.  I have taken the land certificate because that is a simpler case.</P>
    <P>In relation to certain freehold lands there may be some difficulty in that there may not be deeds at all available, perhaps because it may have originated as a squatter's title years and years ago, but these cases are few and far between.  But, in relation to registered land, the numbers of loans that are made on the security of a deposit of the land certificate alone are legion and unless those loans are protected, then this power, which is a good power otherwise, will make complete chaos of the existing system.  That is the first point I want to raise.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear whether I should have raised this second point earlier but, while not strictly relevant, it might be convenient to take it here. Are the Agricultural Credit Corporation <Col N="1327" /> themselves going to be entitled in future to take security by way of an equitable deposit as apart from a charging order or a written legal mortgage?  The Minister, I imagine, knows what an equitable deposit is, or does he want me to explain it to him?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it clear that the Corporation can in future adopt that method?  Up to this I have certainly never seen a case in which they did. They may have had the power but I have never seen a case in which they did and it would be highly desirable that they should have that power, particularly in relation to temporary loans for stock purposes which are going to be paid off within a matter of two or three years.</P>
      <P>The third question that perhaps arises here in another way is related to my first question, that is, that the existence of a charge on the land certificate should not prevent the Corporation securing their guarantee by way of charging order but it should provide that when the Corporation do guarantee by charging order it will operate exactly the same as any ordinary second mortgage operates.  If that is not the case, then it is going to mean that there will be an unnecessary clog in the machine because all the first mortgages would have to be paid off first.</P>
      <P>I think at the present time there is a restriction on the Agricultural Credit Corporation making a mortgage in certain circumstances, certainly in respect to a revised land purchase annuity.  It is not quite as stringent as the restriction that exists in the Small Dwellings Acts but it is there and it should be clear that they can make a charging order operating, not to defeat the first mortgage, but just as a second mortgage would operate under the more costly and cumbersome procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, as far as this power is concerned, it is giving the Corporation additional powers to <Col N="1328" /> charge and it does not take from the power they already have to look for a mortgage or to look for what the Deputy refers to as an equitable deposit of the deeds.  They are already open to them.  I have never known the Corporation to ask for a deposit of the deeds.  I have known them, of course, to ask for a mortgage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they power to lend on deposit of deeds at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at the moment anyway, no, they have not.  Whatever powers they have at the moment are not taken from them.  This is additional.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy mentioned that he did not expect that I would know as much about the legal part of this as he does which, indeed, I do not but, as far as I understand it, if the Corporation want to register a charge they will have to get the land certificate and, if the charge is already there, it is open to them to take a second charge if they like or to ask the applicant to discharge the charge already there and give them a first charge.  As Deputies know, the Agricultural Credit Corporation very often give enough of a loan to a person to pay off a small debt to a bank and to give them the whole charge on the place or whatever it may be, and I am sure they will operate like that in future also.  There is no question of their jumping in before a charge already made.  They cannot do that.  They must take second place or ask for the charge already there to be removed and for them to be given a first charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I misunderstood the position, then.  I thought the charging order for the Agricultural Credit Corporation would operate in the same way as a charging order for the Board of Works.  A charging order for the Board of Works affects registered land without registration because of the exception that is provided in Section 47 of the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act, 1891.  I understood on Second Reading of the Bill that it <Col N="1329" /> was indicated that this was going to work in the same way as a Board of Works charging order.  If the situation is merely going to be that the charging order is the positive act by the Corporation in substitution for the positive act signed by the owner in the shape of a mortgage in the ordinary way, then, of course, the Minister is perfectly correct when he refers to the question of registration in the Land Registry and that the land certificate would be required.  It depends entirely on whether this is going to be in fact the land reclamation procedure or whether it is going to be the Board of Works procedure.</P>
      <P>I think that under the Land Reclamation Act the procedure is that before the Minister's loan is secured, the land certificate has to be brought into the Land Registry and marked.  That is not, of course, the situation in relation to the Board of Works at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when replying a second ago, confirmed my belief that the Corporation have no power at present to make a loan on equitable deposit of deeds.  At least, I have not ever examined whether they have the power or not but I have never known it to happen.  I am trying to help the Minister but I think he feels they have no power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to urge very strongly on the Minister&mdash;I do not know whether this is the right section on which to do it&mdash;that they should have that power.  I cannot see why if a person is registered as the owner of land with all the appropriate documents to prove title, including his land certificate which he gets from the Land Registry for a fee of £1 or 30/-, he cannot go into the Corporation and that the Corporation cannot accept that deposit from him for a short loan the same as the bank accepts it. I suppose in relation to the commercial banks, at least 50 per cent. of the advances to farmers on the security of their land are carried through by way of equitable deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1330" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably I am putting it too low but for the sake of argument let us say 50 per cent.  It is much handier and much cheaper.  It means, particularly in relation to a short-term loan, that when he has borrowed money for stock and paid it off at the end of three years, he gets back his land certificate and there are not further liabilities and no costs involved.</P>
      <P>If we want the Agricultural Credit Corporation to be of assistance in developing agricultural production by providing useful agricultural credit why can we not let the Agricultural Credit Corporation adopt the cheapest method possible?  I believe that in a very great number of cases where a charging order would be made there would be no necessity for a charging order at all if the power of equitable deposit were available.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there are perhaps three methods of pledging land.  There is the written mortgage. Deputy de Valera would immediately criticise me for so calling it; we could call it the mortgage in writing covering the legal estate but for the sake of simplicity let us call it the written mortgage. That is the most expensive method.</P>
      <P>It is also the most secure method because certain extra powers can be put in it and, when the loan is going to be for a very long time, very often the lender insists on that written mortgage. When that written mortgage is paid off, not merely has the owner of the land incurred pretty substantial costs in having the mortgage attached to his loan but when it comes to be paid off he has to bear the cost of paying it off and the cost of discharging it.  The cost of discharging it is not very heavy but it is something.</P>
      <P>The second form is the charging order.  The charging order is going to be made by the Corporation itself and at considerably less cost to the registered owner than the written mortgage in the initial instance, but when it is paid off again there is the cost of discharging it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third type of security available to a lender is the equitable deposit of <Col N="1331" /> the deeds.  There is no expense involved on the owner, if his title is in order, in giving his land certificate to the Corporation and saying: &ldquo;I am depositing this as security for my obligation to the Corporation.&rdquo;  When he has paid it off, there is no expense involved because all the Corporation has to do is to send him the land certificate by registered post or write him a letter asking him to come and collect it.</P>
    <P>Why should we impose on borrowers unnecessary costs particularly in relation to short-term loans?  I am not making the case to the Minister that the Corporation must lend in every case on equitable deposit.  That would not be right either, but there are cases where equitable deposits are good enough for the banks.  If there are cases where equitable deposits are good enough for the banks, why can they not be good enough for the Corporation?</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the system of equitable deposit was omitted from the 1927 Act except perhaps at that time there was a certain amount of jealousy between the Corporation and the banks for reasons of which the Minister is aware.  I know a little bit about what happened in relation to the Corporation in 1927.  I do not know why this system has not been used.  It is a simple method of borrowing money on the security of land.  It is inexpensive both in relation to borrowing and in relation to the redemption at the end of the repayment of borrowing.  I would therefore urge the Minister very strongly to introduce it here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this discussion but I do think the point made by Deputy Sweetman might perhaps be usefully pursued by the Minister.  What he said in relation to what he called written mortgages had not occurred to me in that way.  There will be cases where that procedure is desirable, whether it be for a private lender, a bank or a State Corporation such as this.  In regard to the charging order, my memory is very vague.  Perhaps <Col N="1332" /> Deputy Sweetman could help me.  Am I right in thinking the charging order originated in attempts to simplify mortgage proceedings in regard to registered land?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be natural that all State bodies and State-sponsored bodies would tend towards that and that the charging order would be preferred to the old mortgage procedures which were found cumbrous.  Side by side with this, the procedure in regard to the equitable deposit grew up and has been found to be a very convenient method for raising loans.  The question I would like to ask&mdash;perhaps Deputy Sweetman could answer it&mdash;is whether there is any objection to such a procedure in regard to State companies, because if there is not I would recommend to the Minister that all approved legal methods should be available to the Corporation.  I see no reason why machinery under the very heads Deputy Sweetman has mentioned should not be made available to the Corporation in this case unless there is some specific reason why any of them should be excluded.  That is how I should like to recommend it to the Minister's consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other point which Deputy Sweetman raised about priorities of mortgages.  I am sure that matter cannot have been overlooked by the Minister or his advisers.  It is fairly obvious that if priorities are not observed, the effect will be to restrict procedure to the procedure which has a priority.  I should imagine that unless there is some specific <Col N="1333" /> enabling power giving specific priority on any procedure in relation to this Act, the normal rules in regard to the priorities of mortgages should hold. The Minister might consider those points if he has not already dealt with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one question I asked.  The Deputy made a very good case for the convenience and so on of the equitable deposit of deeds. There is no cost on charging.  That is specifically provided for.  The Corporation will not charge the applicant anything by way of costs to register his charge and the Registry of Deeds also makes no charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>When it is paid off, the Corporation un-charge it, so to speak, without cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right&mdash;there is no cost.  I am told there is a peculiar legal point which I find hard to understand. If you have correspondence in the case of an equitable deposit, it is illegal.  It must be handed in without correspondence, so that if a person starts off by making an application in writing to the Corporation for a loan, it would appear that it would <Col N="1334" /> be illegal to make the deposit.  It is a legal point which I cannot understand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain decisions on the benefits that accrue from equitable deposits of deeds arose from the fact that when the deeds are deposited there is no memorandum in writing. If there is a memorandum in writing you are caught up in legal consequences which have, from a practical point of view, certain objections.  It is perfectly true that if there is a memorandum in writing accompanying or related to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a nice point whether preliminary negotiating correspondence can be related to a deposit of deeds.  I think that would be pressing it too far.  Supposing I want to borrow some money from a commercial bank and I have some property.  It is perfectly obvious that I might have some correspondence with the bank manager in advance, if I approached him for a loan or an overdraft without security and he might write back to me and say I could not have the advance.  There would be that correspondence between us, and then I would call to see him and we would have a conversation about the deposit.  Would there then have been correspondence between us in relation to the deposit?  Would there be a memorandum &ldquo;accompanying&rdquo; it, to use Deputy Sweetman's word?  I do not know what the deposit law would be on that point.  It is obviously a matter for the lawyers. There could be objection to it without doubt.</P>

      <P>I am not quite clear what exactly is the purpose of the change in this section from the original Section 13 of the 1947 Act.  I made an effort to understand the comparison between the two, and really I do not see that the Minister is making such a difference in his actual powers.  He has set out, as I understand it, the powers in the original subsection of Section 13 of the 1947 Act, and he has taken them out of one paragraph and sub-divided them into two paragraphs. That does not seem to me to be a very epoch-making reason for this section. There must be some other reason.  I should like the Minister to give me some explanation as to why it has been done in this way at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Book of Estimates covers only services classified as capital services in that Book.  Apart from that, moneys have been issued to the Agricultural Credit Corporation over the years that were never included in the Book of Estimates at all.  They are below-the-line issues.  That is what a below-the-line issue is, surely&mdash;an issue made directly out of the Central Fund on the direction of the Minister for Finance without the necessity of coming to this House, a standing direction included in a particular Act? In this case, I think the parent Act is the Agricultural Credit Act, 1931, although I am not positive of that.  I do not see where voted money comes into this at all.  I thought this was a provision&mdash;I was not sure and I wanted the Minister to clarify it&mdash;to enable moneys to be issued from the Central Fund to the Agricultural Credit Corporation either for stock or for loans&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;and that in fact what it is doing is repeating again exactly the same procedure as was there previously, but for a new total advance figure.  If that is the reason, I do not understand why it was broken down into three paragraphs here, whereas it always has worked perfectly adequately before in subsection (1) of Section 13 of the Agricultural Act, 1947.  When something like that has worked perfectly adequately over the years in a particular form and one wants to extend the limit, one brings in an amendment extending the limit. We have done something else here.  I have a suspicious mind, and when I see a particular section of a Bill brought in in a form other than the normal way, I start to scratch my head and wonder what is the purpose of it. I am afraid, therefore, I must ask the Minister to explain the purpose of the section.  I do not think the explanation the Minister gave off the cuff a few minutes ago was the correct explanation. It has nothing to do with voted moneys; it never had anything to do with them.  It was always a below-the-line issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister hope it may be extended by this section?  As far as I can understand it, the purpose of the section is solely to make the chattel mortgage procedure available to a person other than a farmer&mdash;to, perhaps, a merchant or a cooperative society.  Would a cooperative society be an eligible person to whom the Corporation can lend under the chattel mortgage procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, as the Deputy has pointed out, we have taken out the word &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; and substituted &ldquo;a person.&rdquo;  This means a chattel mortgage can be applied to a cooperative society.  They are not confined to a direct chattel mortgage, but they can secure a guarantee to a merchant covering payment for agricultural supplies or credit to a farmer.  They can secure a cooperative society in supplying <Col N="1339" /> goods to its members.  This clause not only applies to the Agricultural Credit Corporation but to all banks, and it gives them the same power.  It probably will be used a bit more generally, although I do not know if it will be used to any significant extent. These were the complaints made against it in the past&mdash;that it was impossible to get a chattel mortgage from the Corporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which gives the prior right to the Corporation to advance money, formerly up to £400 and now up to £1,000, without examination of title.  Is there any stipulation in relation to these priority advances as to the purposes for which they can be used?  Can they be used for any purpose whatever or are they restricted in somewhat the same manner as Section 9 restricts advances for the purpose of improvement of the land?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little uneasy about this provision.  In relation to most farms, a sum of £1,000 is a pretty substantial sum.  This means, in effect, that the Corporation can advance £1,000 without any investigation whatever in relation to the title and that their security for that £1,000 will <Col N="1340" /> jump in ahead of everybody else who has any claim against the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not against the registered claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. However, it will jump in ahead of everybody else who has any claim under the note that is normally on folios that the registration is subject to equities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a pretty big priority jump.  I should not mind it in respect of cases where the registration under the Local Registration of Title Act, 1891, had been there for a very long time.  Over the passage of years, the equities tend to get merged in the registered ownership but the Corporation will make the case, and correctly make the case, that very often people do not bother to discharge the equities over the years because of the expense involved.  I can fully realise that.</P>
      <P>There is another type of case, a case where the holding has only very recently been vested in the applicant, where it has been vested perhaps within the past ten years.  There, the position in relation to equities is entirely different.  There, the position is that there may well be some really live equities outstanding, not like the old case.  I should imagine it would be a better proposition for the Minister, if he so desired, to make two bites of the cherry&mdash;to provide one limit for the old case where the equities are virtually gone and a much smaller limit for the new case where there would be a live equity, but where the amount being collected or charged would be substantial perhaps in relation to the equity outstanding but not substantial by relation to the value of the holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there are some people who go completely and absolutely hot under the collar at the possible injustice there might be under this provision.  I should have thought that where you have registered land and a definite anxiety to make it easier for people to get loans by this method, <Col N="1341" /> without the very great expense that often may arise in discharging the equities of a very long and involved title, it would operate on some sort of insurance scheme basis, provided, if you like, the Corporation have power to put a charge for £1,000 in priority to the other equities of the title and provided, at the same time, that where the Corporation have done that and it can subsequently be proved that, by so doing, someone who has a genuine interest in the land has been damnified the insurance fund would meet that damnification and the person who has done nothing wrong, who has his interest held there subject to equities, whose only non-feasance is that he did not force the registered owner to incur the costs of discharging the equities and registering his claim on the folio, will be protected to that extent.</P>
    <P>The cases, I admit, in which it would happen would be infinitesimal compared with the cases in which this procedure could be used to save cost to borrow from the Corporation&mdash;and we are all anxious to do that.  It is not fair to create an injustice for one man, a real injustice, so as to make it easier for the other 99 to get what they want cheaper.  Our object in framing this legislation should be to make it cheaper for the 99 and to provide a method by which the one per cent. could, when they were able to prove they had been damnified by an Act it was necessary in the public interest to introduce, get compensation because they had been passed over in pursuance of the statutory powers given by us in this section.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister got any figures of the cases which have come to the knowledge of the Corporation in which use of this section has meant that the Corporation have gone in ahead of another person with a prior right and have caused that person to lose his prior right?  I doubt if the Minister would have, because the Corporation would be concerned only with the recovery of their advances and would not be able to cope with the registration particulars of others.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to know, if one could get the information somewhere, <Col N="1342" /> how this has acted in relation to the one per cent. who may have been affected.  We all agree that it is a useful provision in respect of the other 99 per cent. but we should not, with our eyes open, do something that might very well make it extremely difficult for a person with a genuine right to recover it, notwithstanding that he had done nothing to prejudice that right himself, that all he had done was to save the registered owner the costs of clearing his title over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that, in 1928, this provision was made granting power to the Corporation to issue a loan on registered land.  In 1929, provision was made for unregistered lands, when certain difficulties were dealt with.  The Corporation tell me they have not had any complaint whatever since then from any person who might have felt he had a grievance with regard to a loan being made subject to equities under that section. They know of no case of hardship. A sum of £400 in 1929 would correspond somewhat closely, I suppose, with £1,000 now.  Therefore, I think the sum mentioned here is fairly reasonable.</P>

      <P>The periodic heavy flooding of the River Dodder is mainly due to the relatively steep gradients of the catchment area, which in periods of prolonged rain precipitates water to the river channel in volumes that it cannot contain.  In the last 30 years, the position has been aggravated by housing <Col N="1346" /> development.  Works undertaken in recent years have improved the flow in the river channel, but further remedial works may be necessary to prevent the recurrence of heavy flooding on occasions of exceptional rainfall. I understand that a detailed investigation is being made at present by the Dublin Corporation with a view to ascertaining what action might be taken to obviate such flooding as far as practicable.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the entry stand part of the Schedule.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I believed, rather foolishly now it appears, that democratic principles would govern the activities of the Minister in the proposals he would put before us.  It is obvious now that those principles do not apply. There is one difference between the Minister and his colleague, Deputy Corry.  The latter did explain why he was opposed to the amendment and why he preferred to have this proposal relating to North-East Cork stand.  He admitted he had travelled over a good part of that area and that he had &ldquo;poached&rdquo; into a good deal of it but it would not be possible for him to cover another little area we would wish to have included in this constituency. We were anxious that one small portion should go back to North-East Cork, a portion over which Deputy Corry might not have an opportunity of poaching.</P>
      <P>We at least know where we stand with Deputy Corry.  We do not know where we stand with the Minister.  He made it quite clear that the onus was on us to give the relevant facts when dealing with an amendment calling for the deletion of certain areas from North-East Cork.  We accepted that onus.  The Minister says he has put proposals before us.  He has refused to commit himself in any way as to the reason he puts this proposal before us as against a proposal which would be fairer and more just to all directly concerned.  From that point of view, I must couple Deputy Corry as the Minister's twin: his sole object seems to be something that will suit the Minister, on the one hand, and himself on the other, irrespective of the needs and wishes of others directly concerned in both North-East and South Cork.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister explain why he has decided to annex the town of Macroom and present it as a Danzig, sitting in mid-Cork but no longer the capital of mid-Cork, and transferred to the South-West?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, in the latter part of his contribution, has given the reason why Macroom and other parts of mid-Cork had to go. About 7,500 of a population was required to bring up the numbers in the old West-Cork constituency to a point where it would be regarded in law as justifying three members.  That is the reason it comes about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister appreciate that whoever the Deputies are for that constituency, they will have to pass through Macroom, unless Macroom can, by some miracle, succeed in electing someone from the town.  It will, therefore, be on very rare occasions that a Deputy elected for the constituency will have any associations with the out-flung portions <Col N="1351" /> of the constituency.  Has the Minister examined any other possibilities in trying to increase the population of that constituency, other than taking over what was known as the capital of mid-Cork and putting it into the South-West Cork constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course in regard to any changes now before the House, many alternatives other than those put to the House have been considered. It was my duty to do so.  You cannot merely deal with this as if it were squares on graph paper.  Populations in various villages and townlands are not the same in any two such entities. The result is you have to move them around.  This has been done in order to conform with the requirements of the law in this respect.  Each and every division that has been made was made after many alternatives had come under review.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to this suggestion about the capital of mid-Cork. We have heard at some length about the other three entities outside the borough of Cork.  We have almost three autonomous local authorities, amounting to nearly three county councils.  Now it is being conveyed to us that we have two capitals in County Cork.  I deplore these changes more than anyone else in this House.  I dislike them and disagree with them, but I am conforming to the dictates of the High Court and all I can say to the Deputies who complain about it is that it is a pity they did not lend their weight in the courts when this matter was under consideration there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Minister and the Deputies behind him that they are so loath to refer to the existence of a Constitution in this country.  We hear from them of the court's decision but they would like us to forget that there is a Constitution and that the court was interpreting the Constitution.  We did not draw up the rules of the game but, as an Opposition Party, when we see a foul being committed, we shall blow the whistle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy from West Cork, I am with the Minister <Col N="1352" /> in this.  Heretofore, I had to go through the town of Macroom to get to the extreme end of my constituency in Ballyvourney, Timoleague and Courtmacsherry.  Now, as a result of the change, Macroom and the area around it is in my constituency and it looks quite a natural decision.  I welcome it and I welcome Macroom into West Cork area where it was before. I can tell the people of Macroom that they will be well looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason for Deputy Wycherley to get mixed up in his geography.  We can forgive the Minister but I am surprised at Deputy Wycherley, who never loses his way around West Cork or on the road to Dublin, saying that he cannot get into Ballyvourney or Timoleague or Courtmacsherry without going through Macroom.  Deputy Wycherley must know the onus is on him to attend to the requirements of Courtmacsherry and the other areas in the West Cork Board of Health area and should the rest of us in the West Cork area attempt to look after the welfare of the people in the Timoleague area, the Deputy would very soon tell us to keep out.  Why he should wish to spread his wings towards Macroom, I do not know.  Deputy Corry has probably done a little poaching there already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the natural line of demarcatation in West Cork, any change should be eastwards.  That is an area within the confines of the West Cork Board of Health area.  There is no excuse for the Minister or his new colleague, Deputy Wycherly, to move off in a north-easterly direction and call the new constituency South-West Cork.  Why they called it &ldquo;south,&rdquo; I do not know.  The facts are plain for the Minister to see.  The figures are there to support our case.  He has brought Bengour into the Bandon area and he has proceeded north-east to Macroom but he made sure, for some reason or another, that he has left Courtmacsherry in the Mid-Cork area. There is no reason for it.  The Minister cannot now say that the onus is on us to show where he is wrong because it is quite obvious to us that, whatever onus is imposed on the Minister, he <Col N="1353" /> has no intention of changing the mood he is in today in order to give fair play to the people of West-Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wycherley may not have examined the delineation of the new constituencies closely because he seems to be under the impression that the rural area around Macroom was in the north constituency. The situation is that Clondrohid, which lies midway between Macroom and Ballyvourney will be in Mid-Cork but both Ballyvourney and Macroom will be in South-West Cork.  The fall of the country, as we say, into Macroom, to the north and to the east, will be in Mid-Cork, but the town will be in South-West Cork.  We know of an occasion when a colleague of Deputy Corry became a bit mixed up about the confines of his constituency and we would not like Deputy Wycherley to have that experience.</P>

Cork is a very big county and, after all, the Minister has given way to the appeals made here when the question of single constituencies was before the House and when Deputies were appealing for large constituencies.

We have this argument about why not take them off this corner or that corner but, after all, each Party can have candidates in each of those constituencies and, if it is not good for one candidate in one Party, it is good for another candidate.

      <P>To be fair to everybody I cannot see where the 6,000 votes would be got more conveniently than in Macroom.  I know the minds of the Macroom people and I am sure they will welcome Deputy Wycherley. They will be delighted to see him there.  I cannot see where the line would otherwise come in.  As far as Deputy O'Sullivan is concerned, he realised the difference very quickly and became a member of a local authority as fast as he could.  But I do not see where that big difference comes in. A Deputy is elected to do a particular job in this House.  As far as Macroom is concerned, although it was in North <Col N="1355" /> Cork, up to now it was in South Cork for local authority business so I cannot see any difference from its being shifted.  When it was wholly represented by the North Cork Deputies it still had to do its work through Father Mathew Quay in Cork City, as far as local authority work was concerned. Therefore I cannot see that it makes any difference.  I am sure Deputy Wycherley will make a good representative.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the records accept it.  The Minister's difficulties have been passed on to us here and the Minister's tears.  Whatever toil he has been forced to, he may have some satisfaction in seeing the way Deputies <Col N="1356" /> have to knock their heads together to try to get rid of some of their difficulties.</P>
      <P>We are not here talking principally of constituencies.  We are talking of Parliamentary representation.  The work we are doing here in relation to the Electoral Bill is for the purpose of ensuring that we have a representative Parliament here.  The difficulties that Deputies in Cork and elsewhere have, and the labour and toil of Ministers, arise out of the fact that the spirit in which our people wanted to set up a Parliament has been deliberately departed from and has been thwarted in every possible way.  What we wanted was a Parliament in which the various sections of the people, geographically and in relation to their classes, vocations and interests, would be fairly represented by their fair, free and equal vote and the Constitution that it planned for itself.  It was the idea of a Party moving to get a Party machine here as Parliament rather than a representative Assembly that gave us the position in which the basis of proportional representation was wiped out, when the scheme was devised of imagining proportional representation as reduced to 3-member constituencies, 4-member constituencies and so on. We are just simply trying to build a representative Parliament on a basis that has been very radically interfered with by electoral legislation dealing with constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the position of difficulty here and that is the difficulty that we are in in finding an Electoral Bill put down as a patchwork quilt that might to some extent bring our minds back to West Cork when, in our wanderings in the Gaeltacht and elsewhere, we saw the patchwork quilts that were made, not necessarily with patches of equal size, but of big patches and small patches.  We are discussing this matter because the groundwork upon which the idea of Parliamentary representation was based has been radically interfered with, first, by making four-member and three-member constituencies as the basis of electoral law and then proceeding to try even to wipe out any kind of proportional representation by coming down to single <Col N="1357" /> member constituencies with a vote in them that would practically wipe out the majority will of our people by having a situation like you have in some of the British by-elections taking place at the present time where a man getting 15,000 votes can get a seat as against 25,000 votes cast for two other candidates in the constituency. That is where the Minister's tears and toil come from.  The Minister is, in fact, a victim, a victim of a policy that has been pursued by a Party in this country to wipe out the representative basis of our Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>After hearing fully explained to me just what is the matter with me, I might leave it at that but I am afraid I do not quite agree with the dissertation that has been given as to what is the matter with all of us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy says that fair representation is the idea in the Constitution, with which I fully agree. Equal votes is a principle which, as I have indicated, as now dictated by the interpretation of the law, which we fully accept as an interpretation of the Constitutional requirement, I do not think is possible down to the last degree which Deputy Mulcahy appears to feel should be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The margin is left in the Constitution as between 20,000 and 30,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what we have been talking about, in any sense of the word.  The 20,000 and 30,000 as referred to in the Constitution does not refer to equal votes or fixed seat; it refers to population heads.  It is on that basis that I say that no matter how you equate the population figures, it does not follow from that equation that the strength of the vote in any one area is absolutely equal and identical to the strength of the vote in another area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complaint also is made that P.R. is being defeated in that the constituencies have been reduced to small sizes of three and four seats.  Has Deputy Mulcahy considered that in this Bill the number of these small number constituencies to which he takes severe objection has in fact been <Col N="1358" /> quite drastically reduced and that this Bill will, in fact, go a long way to meet his argument that the small-number constituencies are defeating P. R.? This Bill should be quite a consolation to him because we are, in fact, reducing the number of small-number constituencies very considerably.  I trust the Deputy will appreciate that his anxiety in this regard is in fact relieved to some considerable degree for the future, by this Bill, if it goes through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might extend his operations in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think even the Deputy will agree that we have done a fair bit in this regard to meet his point of view as now expressed in that we have reduced the number of three-seaters, as in the 1947 Act, from 22 to 17.  That is not a bad start.  If we were to progress in that direction, no doubt we would find ourselves after two or three enactments such as this over the years that lie ahead, having five or six counties bunched together and 13 or 14 seats being competed for by maybe 100 candidates at a general election, which I take it is the logical conclusion to the idea of fair representation as intended by proportional representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have some reflection on the economic progress we foresee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in line with the argument advanced here that if small number constituencies are being created and perpetuated, it is defeating P.R. in that the minority elements in various regions are not getting an opportunity of getting themselves elected. The logical sequence to that is that we create regional constituencies, provincial constituencies, and that we all compete for 20 or 30 seats and that every sort of small minority, no matter how much of the crank element it may contain, will in fact get an opportunity, at the expense of the convenience of all the rest of the people, to get themselves elected here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask members of the <Col N="1359" /> House, since the matter is now raised, what do they foresee, if that were the type of Parliament that ultimately came to be elected here?  If we merely had that type of mixed element, where there were no two having the same view about anything, we would never have a Parliament; we would not have a Government for more than a month at a time.  I do not think even Deputy Mulcahy wants that situation to develop.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, no matter what sort of Bill is introduced here, no matter by which Minister or under what Government, dealing with the revision of constituency boundaries, it will not be unanimously accepted in all its details.  My predecessor in the last Government, Deputy O'Donnell, on a Stage of the 1959 Bill made a similar statement from the Opposition Benches, and I make it now from the Government Benches, that it is just not possible to get unanimity on a matter such as this where personalities and their constituencies are being affected.</P>
    <P>We hear talk about boundaries being broken.  There are district and board of health boundaries.  There are provincial boundaries, county boundaries, town boundaries, borough boundaries, electoral area boundaries, rural district boundaries, district electoral division boundaries, townland boundaries and, if you go into the cities, you are likely to get even street boundaries.  There are parish boundaries and barony boundaries.  I cannot see anyone being able to introduce legislation here without being charged with violating one or other of those known boundaries. There are so many boundaries that are not coterminous that, no matter what constituency boundaries are drawn, the charge can be made and well-founded that some other boundary has been broken.</P>
    <P>The learned judge, in his judgment on this case, made it clear that these matters were not of real importance, that they were to be ignored if they interfered with the Constitution as he saw it outlined.  County boundaries were not even to be considered.  It was a good idea if it was possible to <Col N="1360" /> use them, but county boundaries could be changed by the Minister or the Government, changed to suit the constituencies rather than the constituencies changed to suit the boundaries. I do not agree with all that, but the fact is I accept it fully because it is the interpretation of the requirements of the Constitution which I also accept and respect.</P>
    <P>That situation makes things awkward and there is nobody for whom they have been made more awkward than for myself who, as Minister for Local Government, had to return to the House with another Bill as expeditiously as possible having had the 1959 Bill passed, which although it did not suit everybody could not be said to be objectionable and which in my estimation, was the most acceptable Bill that any Minister could put before the House on a matter such as this. Whether I agree personally with the interpretation of the Constitution is immaterial.  I am putting these matters to the House against that background. We must realise that it would be humanly impossible to produce a Bill on this subject which would be unanimously accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Minister to state that city boundaries or county boundaries do not matter, that he is governed by mathematical factors regardless of everything else? It is hard to reconcile that with his statement this morning that he gave every consideration to city boundaries or borough boundaries.  Apart from the electoral factors concerned, how in future will the G.A.A. be able to pick a team to represent a county, not to mind a province, if we are to accept the Minister's statement that all these boundary considerations must be swept away and that this question must be put on a mathematical basis?  I would ask the Minister to consult his advisers and instead of taking 20,000 from one section and putting it into another, to get a more satisfactory unit of representation for the people we are supposed to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concede that the Minister acted properly in regard to his last Bill which I understand had the approval <Col N="1361" /> of the Opposition and to which he acquiesced on the direct representation of the Opposition.  However, if a certain thing happened to upset that I only want to be satisfied so that I can keep the Minister in the high esteem in which he would wish me to keep him, and so that I can tell the people who are affected that it was done because he had to sweep all boundary considerations aside and not because as has been suggested, it is a good thing to reduce the number of three-seat constituencies. It has been suggested by Deputy Corry that even an atheist could get in in a five-seat constituency. I do not know whether that would have any effect on the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact it is not and if what I have said has given that impression I would like to correct it. What I have just said in regard to the sweeping away of boundary considerations and everything else must be taken against the background of the requirements of the Constitution as outlined by the judgment in the court. If that is necessary all these things can and must be swept away.  Where it is desirable and possible to maintain certain boundaries and still keep within the strict terms of that judgment, I have tried to do that.  The over-riding factor is the interpretation of the constitutional requirement in these matters.  Where there were variations, the consideration I have mentioned had to predominate.  Where it was possible to give some credence to the other considerations and to maintain those boundaries, I endeavoured to do so, always remembering that the <Col N="1362" /> Constitutional requirements as per the judgment in the court must predominate and that anything that interfered with it must go.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene at this stage, but two remarks uttered in the past twenty minutes provoked me to speak.  Deputy Carroll suggested that the Opposition gave their blessing to the 1959 Electoral Bill.  The fact is that on at least two occasions the Fine Gael Party voted against the Government.  The only reason there was not a third division was that on Second Stage the Taoiseach gave a specific undertaking that he would examine the possibilities with regard to the two spare seats and it was hoped, at that stage, that something might be done about the disparity between Dublin and the eastern seaboard.  On Fifth Stage, the Fine Gael Party voted solidly against the Government.</P>

      <P>I know.  The Minister has justified his proposals in this Bill on the decision of one man in the High Court, when he knows that it was the decision of the Irish people who voted under the Constitution over a period of 40 years.  That is what confines us to the principle of equality of voting power.  That is what the Minister is endeavouring to achieve.  He has done so within the law on this occasion, but he has, of course, arranged the borders to suit his own interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As representation in South-West Cork is the subject of debate at the moment, I should like to make it clear to Deputy Carroll that <Col N="1363" /> far from the Fine Gael Party voting with the Government this morning, the Government in fact were voting with the Fine Gael Party.  Let me qualify that.  When the 1959 Bill was before the House, the Fine Gael Party moved that a seat be not taken from Cork. The Whips were applied by the Government in support of the removal of one seat from Cork County, and with their majority they carried the day.  It was a Constitutional provision that gave an opportunity for a second look at that matter, and they found they had to restore the seat to Cork. For that reason, we thought it proper that we should support the Government at least in their intention.  They should never have attempted to remove one of the seats to which Cork was entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be quite a bit of divergence as to what actually happened at the time.  The record shows that the division on the overall acceptability of the 1959 Bill was taken on Fifth Stake.  The other two divisions were on the internal matter of where the two floating seats were to go.  As Minister, I put down three amendments: that one seat should go to South-East Dublin, one to Wexford and one to Cork.  The catch was that there were only two seats.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan is wrong in saying that he voted against a seat being taken from Cork.  The fact is that when it came to the amendment on the Order Paper relating to Cork, he failed to get support in this House to carry that amendment.  It is not quite true so to say that fine Gael opposed the seat being taken from Cork.  They did not divide on that issue; they did not vote on that issue.  In fact, the general vote was taken on the Fifth Stage of the 1959 Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach intervened on Second Stage and he tried&mdash; I do not use the word offensively; I use it for want of a better word&mdash;to buy off opposition to the Second Stage by making a specific promise that he would consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to buying off opposition, the House should not forget that there were still two seats to be allocated.  They were claimed respectively by Cork, Wexford and Dublin and in deference to the opinion expressed by the Opposition, I put down three official amendments on Committee Stage, suggesting that a seat would be added to each of the three.  The first two amendments were taken and carried.  The third amendment was not moved&mdash;it could not be moved because there was no seat left &mdash;and a vote was taken on Fifth Stage on the whole Bill.</P>
      <P>In the Seanad, from which emanated the action taken and of which the man who was ultimately the instrument whereby the matter came before the courts is a member&mdash;I do not intend to reflect on him in any way&mdash;no vote was taken.  No vote was challenged in the Seanad.  I believe that that Bill was as near to an acceptable Bill as it would be possible to get on a matter such as this.  That does not mean that Fine Gael had not views or that individuals had not views, but by and large, it was fairly well accepted.</P>
      <P>It is true, too, that during the passing of the Bill through the House, the Leader of the Opposition, while he had reservations, said that he agreed with the intention of the Bill.  I cannot imagine why the belief is now growing up and being perpetuated that Fine Gael opposed the 1959 Bill tooth and nail, and that it was objectionable to them from the first kick-off.  The records do not show that.  Fine Gael should stop trying to perpetuate the myth that they were, in fact, totally opposed to that measure all along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I should like to suggest also that the 1937 constitutional provision in relation to this matter was very nearly&mdash;and, in fact, in its interpretation was held to be&mdash;the same as <Col N="1365" /> the provision in the 1922 Constitution. For anyone to say now that a short few years ago people did this, that or the other thing in regard to this Constitution, and also having regard to the fact that the same mistake, which is said to have been contained in the 1959 Act, was also in the 1947 Act, the 1935 Act and the 1923 Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The matters which are now objected to as having been drawn up under the 1922 Constitution would have been misleading to the people in 1937, they not knowing the real legal interpretation of the Constitution under which they had operated previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk here about the Third Amendment of the Constitution and trying to get small constituencies.  It was sought to show that we were inconsistent in trying to get the people to accept the idea of small constituencies and then proposing large constituencies.  That is a misleading argument.  We believed in the other matter.  I still believe in it.  That is not the point.  The people did not accept it.  Therefore, we accepted their verdict and reverted to what we have had for many years.  We proceeded along those lines rather than try to defeat the people's wishes by insisting <Col N="1366" /> on our own beliefs.  There is nothing inconsistent about that.  We are adhering to the law of the land as enacted by the people through their Constitution and interpreted by the Courts of Justice set up under that Constitution. If that seems to diverge from the opinions we expressed when we went to the country on the Third Amendment of the Constitution, it is because we are abiding by the law of our own people interpreted through our courts.</P>

I am amazed that the Minister should lead the House in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall obey the Chair and come back to the matter before the House. It strikes me as strange that the Minister has completely deviated from what is before us.  Is that merely to suit his own case?  I tried to put my case as well as I could and deal with the South-West Cork constituency. The Minister quoted the views expressed by a learned judge.  I am glad the Minister corrected himself.  As far as I am aware, that was a case of going beyond certain boundaries where that was necessary.  The Minister has not made any attempt whatever to justify his going outside the set boundaries in West Cork.  Over the centuries, those boundaries have been known to all of us, and they bring into West Cork the areas I mentioned previously.  That area, coupled with Enniskean, would give the Minister the population figures in West Cork required by the Constitution.  The Minister recited for us certain actions in the past.  Will he now explain why <Col N="1367" /> he found it necessary to extend the constituency beyond the natural boundaries when there was no justification for doing so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That was answered at the outset, but perhaps it was clouded by what took place afterwards.  We broke that boundary in order to add 7,000 or 8,000 to the population, as required by the Constitution and by the court in their interpretation of it. The Deputy wants to know where was the amendment in regard to Cork in the 1959 Act.  It was on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>I deeply regret all this, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but surely we must protect ourselves against these statements?  The Minister knows that at one stage the Taoiseach made it clear he was prepared to have a free vote within the Fianna Fáil Party.  But he then decided not to allow a free vote of his own members.  The Minister, in <Col N="1368" /> moving the amendment for Wexford, knew that the majority in this House would have to answer the Whip of the Taoiseach's Party.  However, I am not interested in the past.  The Minister still evades my question.  He states that, because of certain factors which had to be taken into account, he had to go outside the boundaries of West Cork.  Will the Minister answer one fair question?  What are the population figures for the electoral areas of Enniskean, Timoleague, Court-macsherry and Barryroe?  They are within the confines of the constituency we know now as Mid-Cork.  Mid-Cork could have carried on without them as I pointed out here last year.  In view of the fact that the population of those electoral areas would give West Cork the necessary numbers, why does the Minister say he was compelled to go outside the boundaries of West Cork?  He is refusing to admit that he has left out of his calculations an area actually within the boundary of West Cork.</P>

      <P>On a number of occasions, the Minister mentioned that the courts had decided the previous Bill was unconstitutional.  The courts did not decide any such thing.  One court and one judge decided it, not the courts.  The Minister implied that we had gone through the entire legal process.  We did not.  In fact, the judge stated that he expected and hoped the case would be appealed.  It does not follow, therefore, that the old Bill was unconstitutional.  That has never been proved.</P>

As some Deputies may have noticed, it was indicated in the memorandum circulated that these areas were in fact covered in the Bill.  I am asking the House now to rectify the departure from what was intended and to incorporate these areas in North Kerry. The reason we are doing that is that, in taking the Dingle peninsula and a few other electoral divisions from North Kerry, we had taken more population from North Kerry than <Col N="1371" /> was necessary.  It is desirable to redress that imbalance by taking a little bit out of South Kerry to compensate for the excess taken from North Kerry, in the first instance.</P>

      <P>On several occasions, the Minister stated he was in favour of as little disturbance as possible of existing boundaries.  In the case of East and West Limerick, his anxiety in that regard would be met if he left the constituency boundaries as set out in the 1959 Act.  They conformed with the provisions of the Constitution. Over-representation in West Limerick, according to the 1959 Act, was only <Col N="1372" /> five per cent. and under-representation in East Limerick was only .2 per cent. The Minister has now decided to transfer three additional electoral divisions from East Limerick to West Limerick and for some reason&mdash;perhaps I can guess what the reason is&mdash;he has decided to transfer two electoral divisions from West Limerick into East Limerick.  Would it not be simpler to leave the 1959 arrangement stand?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is we could not leave the 1959 arrangement stand. West Limerick's ratio per Deputy was too low.

We have now a better ratio and one which comes within the general national tolerance of divergence.</P>

There have been three votes on supposedly inviolable boundaries in Cork county, and I am beginning to wonder if there are such boundaries in every county and if they must be adhered to.  I have improved the ratio from 19,062 under the 1959 Act to 19,415 under the 1961 proposal.  That is within the term of the ratios throughout the rest of the country.

      <P>It is important to note that the register that has now been issued is intended to include an extra number of persons who have reached the age of 21 since September last.  It would have been thought that the numbers on the register would show some increase.  If we take the part of South Tipperary that it is proposed to transfer to North Tipperary, on the figures issued by the Minister, it is suggested that the estimated electorate that would thus be transferred would be 1,531.  Actually, when we look at the register that has now been issued, the number of persons on that register who are Dáil electors will be 1,459.  When we compare the register for 1959-60, which is the only one which I have conveniently at hand, we find that so far from there being an increase in the number of Dáil electors on the new register in the area that is now being transferred there is an actual decrease.</P>
      <P>In fact, the register in respect of the area now being transferred from South Tipperary to North Tipperary will show a fall of about three per cent. in the number of electors in spite of the fact that it ought to show an increase.  That is important to comment on, in so far as it reflects the position as regards the electorate. I hope that is not a foreshadow of a shadow that seems to have been on the Minister's mind when he was painting the picture of what might happen.  I do not know what the overall position is likely to be as that is only a small area.</P>

      <P>and in the third column to delete &ldquo;Four&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Three&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 are consequential. <Col N="1376" /> The object of both is to get the Minister to consider the existing position in both constituencies.  The Bill proposes to give South Tipperary four seats and Waterford three, the reverse of the present position.  My amendment is not put down through any ill-will towards South Tipperary but because of the fact that the Minister is held within the confines of a High Court ruling which directs him to allocate a certain number of seats on population figures.  As I see it, the Minister, when forced to face this problem of dealing with South Tipperary, North Tipperary and Waterford, found himself in the position that he had to give North Tipperary three seats and that it became imperative to transfer different areas as between South Tipperary and Waterford.  Had he dealt with the whole of the county of Tipperary alone, I would have no quarrel with him.  That would have been the natural way to deal with the problem with which he was faced.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with Tipperary, he then had to decide as between South Tipperary and Waterford and to consider how many seats should be allocated to each area.  He had also to conform with the ruling of the High Court. Looking at it from that point of view, according to the 1956 census on which this Bill is based we find that Waterford had a population of 74,031 as compared with South Tipperary's 73,780&mdash; a difference in Waterford's favour of over 300.  Anybody contesting a Dáil constituency will know how vital such a majority can be sometimes.</P>
    <P>Why, faced with these figures which he admitted here on April 29th, 1960, should the Minister ignore them and give South Tipperary the extra seat? Deputy Mulcahy has told us that, in the transfer of part of South Tipperary to North Tipperary, 1,531 voters were affected.  I am quite sure that represents a population of 3,500.  Therefore, in looking at South Tipperary in comparison with Waterford, the Minister will see immediately that the population of South Tipperary would then be not more than 70,000 people as against Waterford's 74,000.  That brought up the majority in Waterford's favour to <Col N="1377" /> 4,000.  Still the Minister, in his wisdom, ignored that fact also.</P>
    <P>Then we come to another factor in Waterford's favour.  The extension of the Waterford borough boundary added to the Waterford population a further 1,000 people, giving Waterford a population of 75,000 as against, as I said before, South Tipperary's 70,000.  This new figure will take a lot of explaining, no matter how the Minister looks on it.</P>
    <P>There is still another point which must be considered.  Notwithstanding the High Court's decision, there entered into this matter the question of the majority of voters.  In this case also, Waterford is far above South Tipperary.  My belief is that Waterford has practically 2,000 more voters than has South Tipperary and if you add the 1,500 people mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy, you find that <Col N="1378" /> Waterford has 3,500 more voters than South Tipperary.  Through the Waterford borough boundary extension, the official figures say Waterford benefited by an additional 398 voters. That would give Waterford nearly 4,000 more voters than South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Considering all these factors, I should be very grateful to the Minister if he would explain to me how he arrived at his rearrangement of these two constituencies.  He spoke about the violation of natural boundaries. If that were the answer, I could understand it because one third of Waterford County was chopped off&mdash;earlier, I called it the rape of a county.</P>
