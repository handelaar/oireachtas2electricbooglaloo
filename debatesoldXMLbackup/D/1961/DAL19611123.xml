      <P>It is proposed to take business as set out on the Order Paper in the following order: No. 1 and No. 2.  It is proposed to take Private Members' Motion No. 1 on the Order Paper in conjunction with No. 2. Questions will be taken at 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>Before going on to that, Sir, on the Order of Business, last night at 10.20 p.m. my motion on the differential rents and associated subjects concluded, and normally my motion on the abolition of ground rents should have been taken at that point.  I was informed by the Chair that there were two Private Bills that had to take precedence.  Apparently these Bills were not moved and in my absence&mdash;I was just outside the door&mdash; my motion was relegated to the bottom of the Order Paper.  I should like to inquire if there is any redress, or if there are any steps I can take, whereby this very important motion dealing with the abolition of ground rents will be restored to its proper place, that is, as the current motion for discussion in Private Members' time.</P>

I understand that Motion No. 1 in the name of Deputy Dr. Browne and myself is to be considered in the course of this debate. Is it possible that that motion could be included in a formal way, embodied in a formal way for discussion?</P>

      <P>Motion No. 1 dealing with proper health services.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My opinion is that it would be desirable that a decision should be reached to-day.  Of course there is no power in the Government to insist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that my understanding was that some Government time would be provided for a discussion of Deputy O'Higgins's motion and the amendments set down thereto.  So far as we are concerned, we are prepared to dispose of this motion and amendments to it under an arrangement which would provide all day for its discussion, subject to Questions, and a limited time for the proposer to reply to the motion, the decision to be taken today.  Our view is that that would be a sensible and satisfactory arrangement in order to dispose of this business.  That ought to be settled today or else we are liable to arrive at the end of the day with the motion hanging in the air and no decision taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If agreement could be reached to conclude at any fixed time, giving the proposer of the motion an opportunity of replying, it would certainly be acceptable to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any possibility that we could sit tomorrow to dispose of this?  I think the members, and especially the Taoiseach, must appreciate the issues which are involved in this amendment.  As a Party, we do <Col N="718" /> not believe there could be adequate discussion in approximately five hours. We are glad that the health motions are being discussed today.  Might I say, incidentally, that yesterday I may have done the Parliamentary Secretary a wrong in that I may have appeared to give the House the impression that we were not informed that this motion was to be discussed.  We were informed; I was informed and the Whip was informed that the motion would be discussed but there was no intimation that the Government or anybody else wanted a decision within a day. I would urge upon the Taoiseach to consider giving more Government time, if not next week, the week after. With respect, might I suggest that a discussion on this amendment is as important as, if not much more important than, some of the minor Bills we are discussing.  They are necessary Bills, I agree, but the Taoiseach would do well to consider giving some extra Private Members' time next week or the week after so that this motion can be disposed of.  We are as anxious as anybody to have it disposed of and to have the Committee which the Minister proposes set up as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We put a motion on the Order Paper and the Government have provided time for its discussion. We have agreed that the time provided is sufficient for discussion of the motion we set down.  There are amendments to our motion but we are still of opinion that the motion could be satisfactorily disposed of in the time made available for it.  If anybody else wants to put down another motion on this subject, he is quite free to do so, but surely if a motion is put down by <Col N="719" /> this Party and the Government provide time which we agree is adequate for its discussion, that ought to settle the matter.  We have made arrangements which we think are adequate to meet this situation and we want this motion disposed of today because we believe it can be and should be disposed of today.  Anybody who wants to discuss another motion is quite free to do so.</P>
      <P>We cannot carry on the business of the House at all if, having made arrangements through the ordinary channels, everything is to be turned upside down and our arrangements shattered when they come to be confirmed on the floor of the House.  I am satisfied this motion can be disposed of today.  I would not object to a proposal to go on until 6 o'clock, if that helps anybody, and leave half an hour for the proposer to conclude the debate.  However, we ought to finish today and we ought not to sit until midnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that existing health services have been proved to be inadequate, and that in their place there should be provided a comprehensive health service based on the principles of insurance <Col N="721" /> which will extend to 85 per cent. of the population, and which will provide without charge an adequate medical service with free choice of doctor, free hospital, specialist and diagnostic services and which will remove the necessity for medical cards for all those within the scheme.</P>
    <P>This motion, while standing in my name, has been tabled by the Fine Gael Party.  It is put down in a responsible way to direct public attention to a very definite social problem.  During the recent general election, the Fine Gael Party announced their health policy, which advocated the introduction of a health insurance scheme extending to 85 per cent. of the population. We were met in our campaign by the Minister for Health representing the Fianna Fáil Party who fought the election on the basis that the Fianna Fáil Health Act, and the Fianna Fáil health policy as enshrined in that Act, were adequate for the needs of our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on the radio on 22nd September and said that the health services were being provided under the Fianna Fáil Health Act in the most economical and equitable way possible.  A few days later, at Donnybrook on 27th September, he declared that the Fianna Fáil Health Act, 1953, was the most economical and fair way of providing a comprehensive health service for our people. In that sense and in that way, the issue was therefore knit.  The Fianna Fáil Party declared in the last election that the Fianna Fáil Health Act was a good Act, providing economically a fair and equitable health service for our people, we on our part contending that it was not an equitable measure and that in fact it did not provide for our people the health services they required.  I am not going to discuss the results of the general election but I assert that the majority of the people are dissatisfied with the services at present administered under the Health Act and that the Fianna Fáil Party and the Minister have failed to satisfy the people that this urgent problem of providing adequate health services can be solved under the present health policy.</P>
    <P>Our motion is based on the initial <Col N="722" /> premise that present health services have been proved to be inadequate and I want to mention a few things to vouch that expression of opinion. I would list as defects in the present services a number of things.  First, under the Fianna Fáil Health Act of 1953, there is provided a general medical service for poor people.  This is a general practitioner service available for the sick poor under general practitioners outside hospitals.  This service is known as the dispensary system of medicine.  It is enshrined in Section 14 of the Health Act but that section is merely a re-enactment of similar provisions contained in the public assistance statutes of 1939 and amendments thereto.</P>
    <P>The dispensary system of medicine was first introduced into this country 110 years ago under an Act known as the Medical Charities Act, 1851.  It was a famine relief measure introduced at a time when plague and starvation and famine were the lot of our people, when thousands and thousands of them were being buried in common graves and when disease and plague were decimating our population. At that time, in the middle of the last century, a purse-proud imperial Government in England, actuated by the notions of public charity that then existed&mdash;and the bite of charities in those days was very sharp and cold indeed&mdash;decided to provide an emergency medical service for the pauper dying Irish and so the dispensary system of medicine was born.</P>
    <P>Dispensaries were set up; doctors were paid to go out among the poor Irish and stay there, supervised by dispensary committees, to dole out bandages and medicine bottles and provide an emergency service if a person was sick and dying, provided the person who sought the assistance could prove himself to be a pauper.  A person had to establish to the satisfaction of a committee designated by the ratepayers of the area that he was unable, by his own industry or other lawful means, to provide for himself.  If he could prove that, the doctor attended him and he got a spoonful out of the medicine bottle.  That is the dispensary system of medicine.</P>
    <P>Are Deputies on the opposite side <Col N="723" /> concerned to know that that system of medicine, unchanged in any particular, in the slightest way, is the system of medicine which we today provide for the poor people of this country? It is re-enacted in Section 14 of the Health Act unchanged in the slightest and today one of our citizens who may be underprivileged, who may not have the means available to the majority and who requires medical attention, if he is to get it under the Fianna Fáil Health Act, must first prove himself to be a pauper.  He must establish to the satisfaction of a local authority, acting through its officials, that he is unable&mdash;it does not mean partially able or not well able, but totally unable&mdash;by his own industry or other lawful means, to provide for himself.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that our people find it difficult to prove themselves to be paupers?  Is it any wonder that that there is concern about medical cards and registration when in the year 1961 we are trying to operate the outmoded principles of public charity of the last century?  That is one result of the dispensary system. Involved in it, of course, in establishing the condition of poverty necessary to enable it to act, is a strict investigation as to means.  An unfortunate poor person must subject himself and his family, his sons and daughters, his in-laws, his uncles and aunts, every connection, near or distant, associated with him or his family, to investigation as to their means, what money they earn, what land they own, what chattels they may have available to them.  He must disclose all that in order to get on the medical register and be attended by the dispensary doctor.  The Minister for Health declared at the last general election: &ldquo;This is fine; this is providing the most economical and equitable health service that it is possible for us to provide.&rdquo;  Having done all this, under the present system, what does the poor person get?  He gets the services of one doctor.  There is no choice of doctor available.  He must avail himself of the services of the dispensary doctor&mdash;a man who is appointed to a particular dispensary post, who, I am sure, does his best in <Col N="724" /> a very dedicated way to work a system which is outmoded and out of date.  There is no choice of doctor.</P>
    <P>It may be understandable in the remote areas in the country, in the places where there are not centres of population, that a multiplicity of doctors would be out of the question and a choice of doctor might be difficult, but, in the centres of population, in this city, in the city of Cork and in other centres throughout the country where brass plates jostle brass plates, along through Drimnagh and elsewhere in this city, is it not astounding that a poor person to whom the State says: &ldquo;Yes, we owe a duty to provide for you a free medical service&rdquo; when he wants to get a doctor, must pass doctor after doctor right down one street and another street and must go to the one man designated as the dispensary doctor in the area?</P>
    <P>Of course, this leads to a poor medical service, which is not the fault of the doctor.  In many cases, such a dispensary doctor has perhaps 2,000 people on his list.  He is working hard from morning until night.  If a person on his register is in fact ill and requires a number of visits throughout the day, the doctor has not the time to do it. The result is that an ambulance is sent for and the person is sent into hospital. Therefore, the dispensary system leads to a poor medical service and to a high hospitalisation rate.</P>
    <P>The fact is that up and down the country a poor person who is sick, to the extent that he is not just upset temporarily but genuinely sick, is never treated at home.  He is sent to hospital.  It follows from that that under the dispensary system of medicine, there is not provided what should be provided: there is no system of caring for sick people in their homes.  The dispensary doctor in most cases acts merely as a conduit pipe from the home to the hospital.  He is merely the referring agent of the local authority, referring the person concerned to hospital.</P>
    <P>That is the system.  What does it cost?  The Minister for Health said during the general election: &ldquo;These services are provided in the most economical way.&rdquo;  Perhaps he had the <Col N="725" /> cost of the dispensary service in mind when he said that.  It extends at the moment to 800,000 people, 30 per cent. of our population.  The total cost at the moment is £1.3 million. Consider the cost of running this State &mdash;£140 million.  We spend on the sick poor of this country a trifle more than £1 million a year.  Had the Minister for Health that in mind when he said: &ldquo;This is the most economical system&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>A trifle more than £1 million a year is provided by this State for the care and treatment of unfortunate sick people.  That £1,300,000 includes the doctors' salaries, the upkeep of dispensary buildings, all the administration involved in the dispensary system. All that is in the £1,300,000.  How much of it goes in medicines to the unfortunate person who is ill?  I do not know what the present figures are but last year the actual sum provided for medicines for sick people worked out at something around 4/- per head per year.  Perhaps it is a little more now.  Maybe it is 6/- per head per year.  That is what this State provides for giving medicines and drugs to sick poor people.</P>
    <P>There it is, and that is the dispensary system of medicine.  I say that defect No. 1, standing out clearly in the present health services, is the fact that medical care for poor people is provided under the dispensary system of medicine.  There are other defects in the present system and the next one I shall deal with is perhaps just as grave: certainly its effect on the general public has been very severe and very intense.  I refer to the fact that, under our present health services, no medical care whatsoever is provided for persons who do not qualify for medical cards, that is, the vast majority of persons with limited means.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether people will recollect that when the Fianna Fáil Health Act was paraded before the voters in the 1954 general election, many people formed the opinion, at least&mdash;whether it was actually said to them or not, I do not know&mdash;that under this scheme there was to be a free medical service for everybody whose income did not exceed £800, for all farmers up to £50 valuation and <Col N="726" /> for all insured persons.  Indeed, perhaps enthusiastic and zealous, Fianna Fáil supporters made speeches to that effect not understanding what, in fact, was involved in the Health Act of 1953.  We know now that, under this fair and equitable policy that the Minister for Health stands over, there is no health service for a person who cannot prove himself to be a pauper, who cannot get on the medical register. There is no medical service outside hospital for such a person.  That person must pay for a doctor.  He must go to the chemist's shop and buy whatever drugs or medicines are necessary to cope with an illness in the family.  Without any assistance whatsoever from the State, that person has got to face up to the hazards, the dangers, and the problems associated with illness in the family.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is wrong to say that is a defect in the present health service. It would be more correct, perhaps, to say that it is a glaring omission and one which renders the entire service absurd.  The result is that for many, many people illness in the family tends to be neglected.  I do not believe there is a Deputy in this House who does not know of a case where perhaps the breadwinner, the father, knows that he should see a doctor, that one of his children should see a doctor, or that his wife is in need of medical care.  He is carrying on on his wage&mdash;even if it is a large wage it is still a limited wage&mdash;and he is deterred from calling in the doctor, not so much because of the doctor's fee as by the fact that the doctor will write a prescription, which must be brought to the nearest chemist, directing the provision of some highly expensive drug or medicine.  More often than not, because of that, people unfortunately put off calling in the doctor.  They hope the illness will disappear, that everything will be all right in the morning, and neglect of illness frequently takes place.</P>
    <P>The result is a very high hospitalisation rate.  Illness neglected leads inevitably to admission into hospital.  The hospitalisation rate in this country is very high indeed.  In relation to working days, it has been estimated that the labour pool in this country suffers <Col N="727" /> a loss of 14,000,000 working days&mdash;that is equal to seven per cent. of the days worked by the total labour force&mdash; due to hospitalisation as a result of workers not getting the necessary medical attention.  Such workers inevitably find themselves in hospital eventually. That is a gap, a very definite gap.  That is clearly a grave defect in our present health services.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention another defect.  When a person who is supposed to benefit by the present health services, but who has no medical card, goes to hospital, it is then, and only then, that he is required to pay.  If he or one of his dependants needs hospitalisation, it is then he must pay. When a man is ill and not earning because of illness, it is then under our present Health Act that charges fall upon him.  Each such person in hospital who has no medical card is required to pay 10/- per day for his hospital treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not misinformed and I shall give the Minister some figures later which will show that I know quite clearly what I am talking about.  In any event, it is when a person is sick in hospital that these <Col N="728" /> charges are imposed.  The Minister seems to think they are imposed but not collected.  If that is the advice available to the Minister, then he should get out of the Custom House, go down the country, and find out for himself.</P>
      <P>Whether or not they are collected, certain it is that they are imposed. Certain it is that a sick person, deprived of his earning capacity, frequently leaving his wife and family at home insecure and uncertain as to what will happen, has these charges imposed upon him.  In my view that is wrong and we ought to provide another type of health service.  It is wrong when a person is sick, when a person is unable to earn, that he should be required to contribute to a service which is supposed to benefit him.  That is a wrong approach.  It is a wrong way of doing things.  It is a wrong policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last year from these charges, about which apparently the Minister does not know anything, £583,000 was collected&mdash;from hospital bills that the Minister apparently thinks nobody ever pays.  That is a defect in the present service.  I think most people would regard it as a serious and grave defect.  But there are others. Another defect is that under the present services a disproportionate amount of money is devoted to hospitals and institutions, and services associated with them, instead of to preventive measures.  Out of our total health bill of £18,000,000 we are providing at the moment&mdash;I am speaking from recollection&mdash;something in the region of £10,000,000 a year in maintaining our hospitals and institutions. We have no nursing service worth speaking about for the sick in their own homes.  We have no service providing for the care of the aged in their own homes.  All these must go into the county home, or elsewhere. We have no proper psychiatric visiting service.  Again, into the hospital with them.  As I have already mentioned, we have no domiciliary or general practitioner medical service for people outside hospital.  We do not spend money on trying to prevent sickness, in dealing with sickness in the home. <Col N="729" /> We spend money and vast sums of money&mdash;I am sure, well-spent money &mdash;in dealing with the eventual results of sickness.</P>
    <P>We provide first rate hospitals, well staffed, and a first rate service associated with these hospitals.  That is all to the good but if the emphasis were placed the other way and if we tried to develop, in association with the doctor in general practice, adequate nursing and other services, indeed, the need for hospitals might be very much less.</P>
    <P>Another defect, of course, of the present policy is&mdash;and it only needs to be said and passed from&mdash;that many thousands of our people pay for the health services and are debarred from benefiting under them.  That is socially unjust.  It is socially wrong that citizens, members of the community, should be asked to pay for what the Minister for Health has described as a comprehensive health service and yet be debarred from benefiting under it.  Obviously, that is a defect and I doubt if it can be stood over.</P>
    <P>This health service, this comprehensive health scheme the Minister talks about, has, I think, in fact, proved itself to be unworkable.  I do not think there is any Deputy, not even the Minister, who did as much as I did to make the Health Act of 1953 work.  When I became Minister for Health, my immediate predecessor had just signed an order bringing the Health Act into operation on whatever day it was&mdash;1st August, 1954.  He threw it at the country just as somebody would throw out a bucket of mash.  He made no efforts, good, bad or indifferent, to make it work.</P>
    <P>For close on three years of hard, painstaking work, I did my utmost to bring the services envisaged in that Act into operation.  I do not believe that anyone else did as much.  I assert now that the Act was unworkable and has proved to be unworkable.  In regard to these comprehensive health services the Minister talks about, do Deputies appreciate that in the Health Act of 1953, there is provision for a dental service not merely for the pauper and the poor but for every insured person, every farmer up to £50 and every person having a limited income? <Col N="730" /> That dental service is provided for under the Health Act and put in as a section in an Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is to be provided an ophthalmic service, an aural service and a variety of other services. Where are they?  What has happened to them?  The people have never seen them.  The dental service that was supposed to be available to every person whose income did not exceed £800, to every farmer up to £50 and to all insured workers in the State and their dependants&mdash;has that ever come about? Is it not true to say that today every Deputy knows there are unfortunate poor people in his constituency who get their teeth taken out one decade and hope to have the dentures put in the next, if they are fortunate?  That is part of this fair and equitable comprehensive health service for which the Minister for Health took time on the radio to assure the people was well worth voting&mdash;the dental service, with thousands, I suppose&mdash;I am sure that is not an exaggeration&mdash;of our people developing stomach ulcers and gastric upsets because they cannot get teeth, if they are extracted, replaced. They must suffer on.</P>
    <P>In regard to the ophthalmic service, anyone who gets glasses today is made wear the badge of poverty.  That is supposed to be an ophthalmic service which the Minister regards as sound economically and fair.  We spend on our dental&mdash;I have no doubt the Minister has this in mind&mdash;our ophthalmic and aural services&mdash;these essential services&mdash;a total sum of £200,000.  Is it not about time we stopped codding ourselves and had the courage to say, as I used to say when I was Minister for Health, that it is not possible to provide an adequate dental service under the policy enshrined in the Health Act?  You cannot do it because this country is not large enough to do it.  We have not the means whereby it can be done.  The State cannot provide these things and we are only codding ourselves and the people if we try to suggest that the State can.  These things cannot be provided except on the basis of a common, communal effort&mdash;on the basis of everyone, according to his means, contributing to the cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> I assert that the present services have been proved to be inadequate.  I want, in passing from the Health Act&mdash;I hope in interring it&mdash;to say this as its epitaph.  There used to be a lot of talk in this House about the mother and child health scheme, the free for all mother and child service.  That used to ring round this House.  After that, the Health Act came into being.  The Health Act was born of political intrigue.  It was put forward hastily in 1953 as a political stunt with a dubious parentage.  It had a premature birth and a very unhappy childhood.</P>

      <P>This unhappy offspring of a temporary political union between Deputy Dr. Browne and the Fianna Fáil Party is now a problem which has to be dealt with.  It does not measure up to the social requirements of the people and the sooner we get rid of it the better.  We believe the time has come for such a change.</P>
      <P>We put forward in this motion our views, views that have been considered carefully over a number of years in a responsible way.  We believe that this country, the same as any other country that knows its mind and is concerned for its citizens, must provide a comprehensive health service and by &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; I mean comprehensive. Such a service could be provided by the State bearing the entire cost. We reject that.  We have no two minds about it.  We reject it.  We think it is the wrong way to do it.  Deputy Dr. Browne thinks it is the right way but we do not, nor do we believe our people want it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>State paternalism, in my view, does not appeal to our people.  Most of our people far prefer to pay their own way in so far as they can.  They like to feel that the doctor who attends them is their doctor, not the doctor of anybody else.  They like to feel that an essential service being provided for <Col N="732" /> their children is being provided by them.  I do not believe our people will ever accept the notion that used to be bandied about at one time, where you had a sort of wonderful uncle, the State, that looked after you from the cradle to the grave.  That is foreign to our temperament and certainly it is wrong on many grounds.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive health scheme being necessary, we reject the idea of its being provided free by the State. In effect, that means that you tax the few to provide a service for the majority.  But, our proposals are based on the principles of insurance.  We propose that a comprehensive health scheme based on the principle of insurance should be introduced and made available.</P>

      <P>Our scheme will apply to 2.4 million or roughly 85 per cent. of the population.  The mentioning of 85 per cent. of the population is not essential to the scheme but, generally speaking, it is accepted in this country that there are a fortunate 15 per cent. who, generally, at the moment, can provide for themselves. In relation to hospital and specialist hazards they have available the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme and, if they are not covered by this scheme, frequently it is their own fault that that is so or perhaps they may not need the particular cover. But, there are close on 2½ million for whom the hazards of illness, sickness and hospitalisation represent a very real danger and it is to these that a comprehensive scheme should apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering our scheme we have had regard to certain facts.  First of all, we have had regard to the fact <Col N="733" /> that in our population there are on the records 406,416 people registered as farmers or associated with farmers but of these 241,942 have a valuation less than £15.  If they are farmers, they are obviously amongst the very poor. We have had regard to that and we have also had regard to the fact that amongst the poor people in the country we have 161,000 old age pensioners; we have some 44,503 persons in receipt of home assistance, 47,503 persons in receipt of widows' pensions and a pretty constant unemployment figure, taken on an average, of roughly 42,000.  So that there are a total of 295,000 people who in one way or another get monetary assistance from the State.</P>
    <P>These people, and a variety of others that it is not convenient to designate into categories, comprise the main body of poor people in this country. It is clear that all of these must be included in any health insurance scheme without payment of any contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>In relation to the Minister's question, those land holders of less than £15 valuation, if they are farmers, if that is their way of life, should be regarded as amongst the very poor.  As I say, in addition to these, there are a number of other cases of hardship and difficulty that it is not convenient or possible to designate into categories.</P>

      <P>They are in addition.  I would regard the full figure as perhaps around 700,000 and 800,000 poor people.  They would be in addition to these two figures, but not designated.</P>
      <P>The balance of the population would represent those in a position to contribute and we have regarded those as being divided again into three categories: first of all, employed persons and their dependants&mdash;they are quite clear and there is not much difficulty in ascertaining who they are&mdash;secondly, farmers and their dependants; and, thirdly, other self-employed.  With regard to these three categories, we have borne in mind that some of them will have already been regarded as amongst those who would be excused contributions, and so on, but we have taken a figure for the employed persons as being something around 650,000. We have taken as a figure for farmers the figure of 103,000.  That is based on the fact that the number of farmers with a valuation of between £15 and £50 is 103,000.  In relation to other self-employed persons, we have taken a figure of 50,000, which covers a variety of independent contractors of one kind or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to work on the figure we actually took.  Taking the figure to be actually that, we have considered what the scheme should cover and this is our proposal.  First of all, a general practitioner service should be provided.  That is the service of a family doctor, and the doctor of choice, and that should be available without direct charge to everyone within the scheme.  There should be a general practitioner service available for all the people covered by the scheme.  Secondly, the hospital and specialist service charges which operate at present should be abolished.  There should be free hospital and free specialist services, X-ray and all the in-hospital services, available to all persons within the scheme.  In addition, there should of course be available, as there is at the moment, a free mother and child service and there should be an adequate dental service and other associated services, ophthalmic and aural.  There should be developed a nursing service in the home, particularly for aged and sick people.  Drugs and medicines are a very serious problem at the moment.  In fact, much of the agitation about medical cards arises from the cost of drugs and medicines. It is the fact that medicines are so dear that creates in the mind of many people the desire to secure medical registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would propose to provide drugs and medicines for all persons excused payments of contributions because they are in receipt of State assistance under one heading or another.  They should be provided with all drugs and medicines without any charge and the balance of the people under the scheme should be provided with drugs and medicines at half price.  That would involve the preparation of a national <Col N="736" /> list.  It would involve an assessment of prices of different drugs and medicines.  It is not impossible; it can be done without much difficulty. The insurance scheme would cover half the cost involved.  In other words, the person getting a prescription at a chemist shop will pay half the cost and the chemist will get the other half from the insurance fund.  We worked out the cost of this carefully.  The Minister in the election campaign asserted that we had not considered the cost.  That was a fair comment but we have considered it very carefully.</P>
    <P>We believe the general practitioner service will cost no more&mdash;when I say no more, I am not belittling the sums involved; I am referring to a ceiling&mdash; than £3 million a year.  The cost of the hospital and specialist service in the scheme is represented merely by the remission of present charges.  In other words, the scheme is based on the existing hospital and specialist facilities which unfortunately could not be covered by insurance because the cost was far too great.  They would have to be continued as they are at the moment.  They would cost £583,000.</P>

It is based on the existing hospital and specialist services which are provided.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister take down his little notes and <Col N="737" /> we will test his totting afterwards.  Has the Minister got the first two figures: £3 million for the general practitioner service and £583,000 for the hospital and specialist service?  The cost of the mother and child service is known, £700,000.  These exclude maternity cash payments and matters of that kind.  The cost of providing drugs and medicines in the way I have mentioned &mdash;and this has been very carefully considered&mdash;will be £2 million per year. That is the provision of free drugs and medicines for persons in receipt of social assistance and at half price for the balance.  We have taken a costing of the dental services&mdash;and this is difficult to be certain about&mdash;but we have taken a cost of £1 million per year for this service.</P>
      <P>At the moment we provide less than £200,000 for dental and other services. We believe a proper ophthalmic and aural service will cost £500,000 a year. We believe other services which will need developing will cost £500,000 a year.  The total cost of the scheme will be £8,283,000.  That will be the cost of these different services in relation to the provision of health services for the individual.</P>

      <P>No.  The Minister is a very old campaigner.  He believes that if you say a thing once and keep on saying it, eventually you will convince yourself you are right. It is in place of the present individual health service.  Does the Minister understand that?  You do not provide the dispensary service; you abolish it.  You do not provide the services which are there at the moment; you abolish them.  In place of that you provide these services financed in the way I have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Deputy correctly that his proposal is to abolish the hospital services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not. Will the Minister contain himself and perhaps we may make some progress? The total cost will be £8,283,000.  I mentioned that the scheme will be financed on the recognised principles <Col N="738" /> of insurance, insurance in relation to our social welfare legislation.  That is on the basis of thirds.  The State will contribute at the start of this scheme one-third of the cost, which will be £2,761,000.  That will leave a total to be financed by contributions of £5½ millions. There will be a contribution of 1/6d. per week from each employed person, plus a contribution of a like amount from each employer.  Taking employed persons at the low figure of 650,000&mdash;I think the figure in fact will be higher, in which event the contribution would be less&mdash;the contribution of 1/6d. per week from each of 650,000 employed persons, plus a contribution of a like amount from the employers, will amount to £5,070,000.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that we have taken the figure for farmers as 103,000.  But amongst those between £15 and £20 valuation there are 33,000 farmers.  We propose to bring those 33,000 farmers into the scheme at 1/- per week.  A contribution of 1/- per week from those 33,000 farmers will yield £85,000. For the balance of the farmers we propose a contribution of 2/- per week.  This will apply to 70,000 farmers. It should be possible to scale that 2/- in a variety of ways.  Perhaps the farmer with £50 valuation might be asked to pay a little bit more than 2/- and the man nearer £20 valuation somewhat less.  A total contribution of 2/- per week from 70,000 farmers will yield £364,000 and a contribution of a like amount from 50,000 other self-employed will yield £260,000.  The total income from these contributions to the scheme will be £5,779,000 and some odd hundreds to meet a required sum of £5½ millions.  That will leave a very generous provision for administrative expenses and for matters which had not been foreseen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The collection of contributions is a matter that will have to be considered.  In my view the collection of the contribution from employed persons should be on a special health stamp.  It should not be merged in the other stamps, because I think it is important that the cost of health schemes should be at all times kept under review.  In a contributory scheme particularly if the costs went up, so would the stamp.  It is <Col N="739" /> important that the persons who are contributing should be kept at all times in touch with how the scheme is progressing.  My own view would be that there should be a special and separate health stamp.  The weekly stamp could also be applied to the 50,000 self-employed persons.  In regard to the farmers' contribution, it is only a personal suggestion but I believe that it could be collected conveniently with the half-yearly rate demand.  But I am sure there are many other views on that and many other ways in which it could be collected.</P>
    <P>That, in broad outline, is the scheme which we propose.  It has been considered carefully, fully and responsibly. It is a scheme well within our means and well within the means of the people.  For less than the cost of ten cigarettes per week the average father of the average family can provide for himself and his dependants medical care in the home, necessary drugs and medicines at a cost he can afford, hospital and specialist services without charge and a variety of other allied services.</P>
    <P>It may be said that employers would resent such an increase in the stamps. I do not believe they would.  At the moment employers appreciate the dislocation which is frequently caused by sickness of one kind or another and by the fact that so many days are lost to production by hospitalisation.  What is the effect of the scheme going to be? First, this scheme will slightly increase the present State expenditure.  State expenditure will go up under these figures by about £900,000 per year.</P>

      <P>At the moment the State provides these services I have been outlining.  When I say &ldquo;at the moment&rdquo;, I mean the figures for the present year.  The figures I am reading are dated March, 1961. They may have changed somewhat since then.  At the moment, expenditure by the State on the present services, under the headings I have outlined, excluding hospitals and other services, which for reasons I have mentioned are not included, amounts to £1.8 million, that is, half the total cost. The contribution expected from the State under this proposal is £2.7 million and a figure, therefore, of the order of £900,000 is involved.  I think the State could bear that.  I do not imagine it would bankrupt us if we were asked to provide another £1 million of the taxpayer's money for health services.  That is a figure which can be stood over.</P>
      <P>That is the effect of the scheme on the State.  The proposals would also have an effect on the ratepayer.  At the moment the cost of the services I have mentioned, that is, the general practitioner service for the poor, the mother and child service, the dental, ophthalmic and other services, is borne half by the State and half by the local authority.  At the moment, the ratepayer must provide £1.8 million as a contribution towards the cost of those services.  Under our proposals, that will cease and the ratepayer will no longer be expected to contribute through the rates to the cost of these services.  They will all be borne by the insurance fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy particularise?  That means he will not have to bear the cost of the general practitioner service.  He will not have to bear the cost of remitting the amount of 10/- which the insured person may now have to pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would only contain himself, this would become very clear.  He should take up his little pen in his hand again.  The total cost to the rates of these services is £1.8 million, but under this scheme that £1.8 million, less £583,000 which represents the present income from <Col N="741" /> hospital charges and specialist fees, will be removed from the rates, that is, a total saving to the ratepayer of something around £1.3 million or £1.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have to explain my difficulty later because I think the Deputy is getting confused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The total revenue from the rates this year is something around £20 million, £21 million or £22 million, so that involved in this is a saving of roughly 10 per cent. to the ratepayer, which represents 2/- in the £.  There can be little doubt that under this scheme the ratepayers who do not contribute to the cost of these individual health services will find their rates bill reduced by roughly 2/- in the £.</P>
      <P>Fears were expressed that under these proposals the voluntary health insurance scheme might be affected.  I do not believe that would be so.  The voluntary health insurance scheme is designed to deal with hospital expenses, particularly in private and semi-private rooms, and that is the cover upon which the scheme is based.  I believe that even though our proposals would apply to many people who are covered at the moment by the scheme, in all probability, they would continue to avail of that scheme of voluntary health insurance.</P>
      <P>I remember some years ago being very interested to learn that in England the Nuffield scheme of health insurance really only began to expand and grow after the introduction of a national health service scheme.  It was when the National Health Act in England provided complete blanket coverage for all the people for health services that health insurance began to expand, because so many people preferred to provide just a little bit more for themselves than was being provided for their neighbour.  I have little doubt that voluntary health insurance will not be affected in the slightest degree by this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> Very generally those are the proposals which we have in mind.  We ask the House, by supporting this motion, to express their agreement with us that the present services are inadequate and bad, that they must be replaced, not piecemeal, not by amendment, not by trying to put a new coat of paint on the Health Act, but by something entirely different.  They must be replaced by a new policy, a policy which does not expect a man to pay for his hospital bed when he is sick and not earning, but which encourages people, as a community, to pay for the day when they will be ill when they are well, a policy which encourages different people throughout the country to realise that sickness and accident are a fearful hazard to any individual, but that if the cost is shared by those in good health, the burden is very much less for all.</P>
    <P>We believe the health policy should be changed in that way and we say that this new scheme should recognise that everyone who contributes to it is entitled to benefit from it, that we should not continue with a policy which says: &ldquo;You pay, but you benefit and you cannot benefit.&rdquo;  We also believe that the change of policy should envisage uniformity of the quality of the service, that we should not have what we now have, inequality in the type of service provided in different parts of the country.  We believe that there should be the same service that could be got if doctors in general practice were encouraged, if you like, to compete with one another in providing for the patients who go to them the best possible service.</P>
    <P>These are our proposals.  They are put forward responsibly, having been considered carefully.  I have little doubt that it is only a question of time before a scheme such as this, roughly along these lines, will come into operation.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, may I say a word in regard to the manner in which our motion has been received by the Minister and the Government.  Would I be putting it too far if I said that if the four Deputies sitting behind Deputy Corish happened to have been elected to this House as Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of the fact that the Taoiseach and the Minister are now sitting on a see-saw that we are at last beginning to get someone to listen to what we have been saying about health for a number of years.  That is the reason this debate is taking place.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was fighting the election, do you think he gave a fiddle-de-dee about what critics were saying about the Health Act?  Do you think he gave a tinker's curse about criticism of the dispensary system or anything like that?  Not at all.  His mellow voice was heard over Radio Éireann talking to the people at their firesides, if they had fires on that cold September night, assuring them how his heart bled for all the sick, the poor, the indigent and the underprivileged, that under the Fianna Fáil Health Act a fair and equitable service was being provided. He said: &ldquo;Do not listen to O'Higgins or Corish or Dillon or anybody else. Do not mind those fellows.  We are your friends and we are providing the services for you.&rdquo;  The Health Act was to go on providing this economical and equitable service for all the people until Fianna Fáil lost their overall majority and so we are having this debate here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is now prepared to listen to reason.  He puts down an amendment here asking this House to set up a Parliamentary Committee to consider all this.  I want the House to realise what is involved in this.  The Minister knows well that some years ago, when health insurance was first considered, when I was Minister for Health, with the permission of the Government, I set up an advisory body on health insurance.  I invited people to sit upon it and I must say very <Col N="744" /> eminent and worthwhile people went on that body.  They did useful work. They were asked to advise me as Minister for Health on the problem of insurance.</P>
    <P>I did not come into this House and ask for a Parliamentary Committee to sit down and thereby seek to gag the House in talking about health or the Health Act.  I set up an advisory body of experienced persons and they reported to me in a very short space of time and the report of that body on health insurance is a most valuable contribution to these matters and to health policy.  I was prepared as Minister to accept my own responsibilities, charged as I was by the Dáil to formulate, on behalf of the Government of which I was a member, the health policy that we would follow.</P>
    <P>What does this Minister do?  He is prepared now to shrug it off.  His Department is to be excused apparently from any work in this matter and a Parliamentary Committee is to be set up to tell the Minister what policy to follow.  That, in my view, is a reneging by the Minister of his responsibilities to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If he can say, as apparently he thinks, that he was wrong in the general election and that we were right, why has he not the courage now, through his Department, to work out a scheme of health insurance? Why should he ask this House to appoint 19 Deputies to disappear from this Chamber into the limbo of forgotten things and for the next two or three years to sit down discussing health in some back room?  Every time there is a motion here on health, we shall be told: &ldquo;That is being discussed by the Parliamentary Committee&rdquo; and every time an awkward question arises over the next two or three years: &ldquo;Can you not leave it so?  It is being discussed by the Parliamentary Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the Minister's proposal here and I sincerely hope the House does not fall for it.  What we are being asked to do is to take the Minister's work, to <Col N="745" /> devise for him a health policy which apparently he cannot devise for himself. We are being asked to advise him on how the Fianna Fáil Health Act should be amended.  We are being asked to do in that way the sort of work which any responsible Minister or member of a responsible Government would be doing himself.  I do not believe that this is sound.  I do not believe it is in accordance with the way in which this House should conduct its business.</P>
    <P>We have a policy.  I believe the Labour Party also have a policy on health.  We are clear in our minds as to what should be done.  The Minister does not know what to do.  He is in a quandary, not in relation to health policy because we know what he believes in but because of the Parliamentary situation inside this House. Deputy Sherwin, for instance, might be gravely embarrassed.  Had this amendment not been put down, Deputy Sherwin, who knows Dublin city well, who understands well and intimately his own constituents, would have to tell the Minister, as I am sure he will, that the Health Act is all a cod; he would have to tell him there is trouble about blue cards and that there is trouble about hospital charges and X-ray charges.  I am sure Deputy Sherwin would say so and Deputy Sherwin would find himself up at the top of the steps there voting &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; in the division, and Deputy Sherwin would be doing right.  There would have been pale faces in the &ldquo;Níl&rdquo; lobbies and so this amendment was put down, a political gimmick, a Parliamentary gimmick by the Minister to remove health out of this Chamber for the duration of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>I do not mind in what way the results we are concerned with are achieved but I am concerned sincerely to see that what we fought for in the election is achieved.  We fought this election on this issue; we are sent here to advocate a better and sounder health policy and we intend to do it.  I assert to the Minister that we will not end our efforts in this respect until there is in operation in this country a comprehensive health scheme available to all our people, <Col N="746" /> so that we at least in this country can shape up in a responsible way to our obligations in a Christian society to provide in a better way for more of our people to live in decent conditions here at home.</P>

      <P>Now I return, having corrected those two misstatements&mdash;there may be some others which will occur to me in the course of my speech and with which I shall deal.  Deputy O'Higgins, in opening the case for his motion, told us, quite correctly, that his motion asserts that the existing health services have proven to be inadequate and, proceeding from this premise, he asked that the existing system be replaced by a comprehensive system and that this comprehensive system be based on the principles of insurance, that it should extend&mdash;by which, I presume, the Deputy means &ldquo;cover&rdquo;&mdash;to 85 per cent. of the population, that it provide without charge an adequate medical service, that those to whom the scheme extends or covers be given a free choice of doctor, free hospital, specialist and diagnostic services and, finally, that the scheme be so drawn that it will remove the necessity for medical cards for all those people within it.  I think the Deputy will agree that I express his proposal as closely as possible in his own terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noted that the possible proposals are based on one premise&mdash; that the existing health services have proven to be inadequate.  The significant words here are &ldquo;proven&rdquo; and &ldquo;inadequate.&rdquo;  Therefore, one would think that a Deputy who really seriously intended to secure an improvement in the health services would set himself to justify the assertion that the <Col N="749" /> services have proven to be inadequate. One would expect him to produce definite evidence, not one or two isolated cases but a substantial number of concrete instances, which, on investigation, clearly demonstrate that the service is in some or in all respects inadequate.  The Deputy did not do that.  He has contented himself with repeating hackneyed <i>clichés</i> from his election platform.  He did not, as I have said, cite one instance in which the existing services have been proven to be inadequate, have been demonstrated to be inadequate.</P>
    <P>Vague generalities, even facts relating to one or two exceptional instances, do not constitute proof that the health services, as a whole or in any significant particular, are inadequate.  There must be a comprehensive and widespread generality of cases to support such a contention.  The extraordinary thing about it, if you listened to the Deputy's speech, is that he proposes to maintain the existing system of health services.  He proposes to maintain the existing system of health services without any real reorganisation of them, except one to which I shall come.  His major contribution towards providing a comprehensive system is to waive the obligation to pay, if he is capable of paying, which is imposed on a hospital patient under Section 15. All the rest of his proposals would merely represent minor extensions of the existing services, all of which are at the moment paid for by the State, but these minor extensions are to be borne and paid for by a very limited section of the community, not all of whom will be covered by the scheme.</P>
    <P>The existing services cover approximately 85 per cent. of the population. They provide medical and surgical care for virtually every pathological condition. If the services are in any general sense inadequate, it should not have been difficult for the Deputy to adduce ample exidence to that effect. My submission is that Deputy O'Higgins has failed to adduce such evidence in support of his motion because assertion is not evidence and <i>ex parte</i> statements such as we listened to are not evidence and hearsay is not evidence.  It was on hearsay that Deputy O'Higgins based his allegation that all <Col N="750" /> Section 15 patients in hospitals are called upon to pay 10/- a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nothing, I think, should or can be accepted as evidence in a matter of this kind, touching as it does an existing service upon which almost 2½ million rely&mdash;nothing should be adduced in support of the statement that the existing system has been proven to be inadequate&mdash;except facts, facts which can be established beyond denial or controversy.  That was not done here today and we may reasonably assume it will not be done in the course of this debate, because the headline has been set by the Deputy who moved the motion.</P>
      <P>The next assertion in the motion is that the services are inadequate. &ldquo;Inadequate&rdquo; is a word of several connotations.  It may imply insufficiency, inefficiency, unsuitability, unfitness in a special sense, imperfection or lack of skill.  For all or any one of these things it might be alleged that a service was inadequate.  I concede at once that the existing system of health services is not perfect.  Nothing of human devising can be perfect and, as they exist, the health services are a product, not of something that happened 120 years ago during the Famine years but the end result of a great deal of consideration, interest, attention, and dedicated devotion to the improvement of the health services and to developing them as they exist today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that if an investigation such as I am proposing should be undertaken is undertaken, it may disclose defects of detail, defects of organisation or administration, even of personnel.  But these, I want to submit, are not inherent in the system; they are not attributes of it and when their existence has been established, steps can be taken to rectify them. But are the services inadequate because they are insufficient and in what <Col N="751" /> respect are they insufficient?  Is it that they do not cover a sufficiently large fraction of the population? Deputy T.F. O'Higgins cannot think so, for his motion does not propose to cover a greater fraction; it does not propose that a greater fraction of the population be brought within the scheme.  Indeed, on the face of it, his motion could quite properly be construed as demanding the exclusion of 15 per cent. of the population from certain of the health services to which they are at present entitled.  Therefore, so far as the fraction of our people who are covered by the scheme are concerned, it might be charged that he thinks the existing services are more than sufficient for them.  I do not say he does, but that is one way in which this very loosely and slovenly drafted motion might be read.</P>
    <P>Are the services, however, insufficient in the sense that there is some essential category of treatment for which reasonable provision is not being made?  Here we must consider this question of inadequacy from the obverse side and ask ourselves whether the resources of the community are not inadequate&mdash;watch the double negative&mdash;to support a much larger expenditure on health services?  That, I think, is the essence of the whole matter.  We can have the most adequate and widely available health services provided people&mdash;that is, the ordinary people of the country&mdash;are prepared to divert from other uses, from their own private use, for instance, or from other public purposes, a greater share of their incomes and earnings.  Do Deputy O'Higgins and his Party ask the people to agree to do this?  I am glad that at last they have told the people that what they are in fact proposing is to increase expenditure on health services, even if the result of that expenditure is not to give the people any improvement in essential value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>To consider this question realistically, the issue of adequacy must be related to the resources available to the community. <Col N="752" /> There is little virtue in embarking on any undertaking, even on the expansion of the health services, if the resources to sustain it are not available. In the case of the health services, the only source from which we can draw necessary funds is our gross national product.  The value of that product determines what we are in a position to spend, not only on health services but on every other public service and even on every other commodity for our personal use.  The relationship, therefore, between it and what we spend on health services is a fair monetary measure of their adequacy, adequacy that is, having regard to the resources available to us for all purposes.</P>
      <P>Whatever other criticisms have been expressed in regard to the British health service, no one has said that it is niggardly or unduly restricted: indeed, all the criticism would appear to be the other way.  Yet the British expenditure from public funds on their health service represents no more than 3.8 per cent. of their gross national product.  Remember that figure, because it is very significant.  The British highly industrialised community, with all their huge resources and all their wealth, with overfull employment in their economy, working, as it were, at top pressure, spend only 3.8 per cent. of their gross national product on their health services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On their whole health services and, surprising to say, we almost equal that proportion, for our public expenditure on health services is 3.1 per cent. of our national product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A cold-hearted economist&mdash;which I am not&mdash;might say that having regard to our low level of saving and low rate of productive investment, it is questionable whether we are not spending too much on health services.  I do not say we are; it is a very sound investment that we are making, this expenditure on health services, but what I am suggesting is that the close correspondence between what we and our neighbours spend on health is a <Col N="753" /> fair indication that we are not unduly penurious in the provision which we are making.  Moreover, since ours is still preponderantly an agricultural economy and theirs a highly developed industrial one, 3.1 per cent. of our product represents a heavier burden on our people than 3.8 per cent. is on our neighbours.  Therefore, it is not on the basis that there is a lack of financial provision that the motion is made or, if it is so made, that it can be sustained.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo; could also imply inefficiency.  If that is the sense in which Deputy O'Higgins suggests that the services have been proven to be inadequate, it means that throughout the whole range of services the medical personnel or the administrative personnel or perhaps both are, in general, inefficient.  I could not accept that: I doubt if even the mover of the motion would accept it.  My experience is, in fact, to the contrary but I am not prepared to deny that there may be a few cases&mdash;and even a few is too many &mdash;where, unknown to my Department, grave and culpable inefficiency exists. We have done everything to eradicate inefficiency.</P>

Therefore, I must examine this word in all its connotations. That is what I am doing and in the context it may imply that the health services are inadequate, as I said, because they are inefficient.

      <P>I am not like Deputy O'Higgins.  I am prepared to submit myself to the judgment of other people.  Deputy O'Higgins does not want the Select Committee which I am asking the House to set up.  Not at all.  He might have to prove some of the assertions he made here today. Perhaps he may be on the Committee. One would expect so.  Perhaps that is why he does not want the Committee to be set up; he might have to answer some awkward questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last remaining aspect to be considered is whether the existing services are inadequate because they are unsuited to our circumstances.  I confess I do not see how they can be. The people are accustomed to them. They are familiar with every feature of them.  So are those who are engaged in them.  So are those who are providing and operating them. They are, I think, certainly suited to our way of life.  At least they are not alien to it, as they might well be if the system had followed the model of some more highly industrialised societies.  Moreover&mdash;this is <Col N="755" /> a point I want to make with some emphasis&mdash;Deputy O'Higgins himself, when he was Minister for Health, did not reject the health services on the ground of unsuitability.  He did not reject them on the ground that one particular branch of the services, and only one, had been initiated over one hundred years ago.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, it was Deputy O'Higgins who brought the existing system into full operation in 1956. Those of you who listened to Deputy O'Higgins this morning will be surprised to know that he did this after mature consideration.  Senior Deputies in this House&mdash;those who like myself were here in 1954&mdash;will recall that when Deputy O'Higgins became Minister for Health in that year, virtually his first&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Who saw that the Bill was signed by the President and was enacted as a statute? Deputy Tom O'Higgins.  It was he, therefore, who in 1954, as I said, suspended <Col N="756" /> the Health Act of 1953.  I do not want to criticise the Deputy for doing that, if he had any doubts as to the efficacy of the Act, if he had any doubts as to the advantages which the Act would confer upon the people.  On the contrary, if he had such doubts it was his duty, I think, to see that the Act would not come into operation until he had had an adequate opportunity to examine the Act, and I am glad to say that he did give himself that opportunity of considering the Act which we heard him condemn here, root and branch, this morning.</P>
      <P>After two years of mature consideration, with all the skilled advice of the Department at his disposal to produce alternatives to the Act, if they could be produced, and if they were suited to the general circumstances of our country, what did Deputy O'Higgins do?  In 1956 he brought the 1953 Act into full operation and, when I succeeded him in 1957, I found the existing system of health services operating as a going concern.  That was my position.</P>

Let any Deputy ask himself is Deputy O'Higgins the sort of man who would be likely to impose on the country a system of health services in which he did not believe and which he thought would be unsuited to the country?  I do not think so.  On the contrary, there is substantial reason, every reason indeed, to believe that Deputy O'Higgins was converted to the view that the 1953 Health Act was, after all, a good thing.  Indeed, when, as Minister for Health, he was introducing his Estimate for the year to 31st March, 1956, he had a great deal to say on this subject.  We have listened to him this morning condemning the Health Act, root and branch, and condemning our dispensary services and our hospital services, alleging there are <Col N="757" /> defects in our aural, dental and ophthalmic services, which there are, but they are defects over which we have no control.  They arise from one simple cause: we are unable to get in existing circumstances the necessary professional personnel to start these services.</P>

      <P>I have not a small mind and I am not over-awed by a bug-bear of stiff-necked consistency.  I was saying that Deputy O'Higgins produced a voluntary health insurance scheme for us and the early preliminary condition which he had adumbrated was fulfilled.  Deputy O'Higgins then went on to say:</P>
      <P>and if the services under the Health Act are developed on the lines which I have mentioned above&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and that has happened&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I think that the health services in this country will be of a scope and standard comparable to that of most others.</P>

      <P>Volume 151, columns 1226 and 1227 of the Official Report.  The existing health services represent a natural development and advance upon the services as they existed in 1956.  They are that much better.  I am not claiming any great credit for that because the seed of their improvement was in the Act.  It was merely a fulfilment of the general character of the services that they should have improved as time went on, as more and more money became available, as more facilities for treating the sick became available and as more and more hospitals were built.  I did not shut down the building of hospitals. I made it possible to resume the building of hospitals and made sure that, once a hospital structure was commenced, it would be enabled to be carried through to completion.  I suppose, however, that that is an irrelevancy at this particular stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, Deputy O'Higgins has proved to be right.  The health services in this country are &ldquo;of a scope and standard comparable to that of most others.&rdquo;  However, Deputy O'Higgins doubts that now, as I gather from the speech he made this morning. <Col N="760" /> Indeed, I think he goes further.  He roundly says that the health services which he brought into operation have been proved to be inadequate.  Yet the services, as I have said, have not changed, except for the better.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy O'Higgins initiated them in 1956 the only change has been in the relevant positions of my predecessor and myself.  Surely, it is impossible to believe that Deputy O'Higgins's judgment on such an important matter as health services could be influenced by the feel of the seat upon which he sits?  No matter under what head it is considered, the allegation that the existing health services are inadequate in any essential particular or to any significant extent is, in my view, not sustainable.</P>
    <P>In the opening passage of his speech, Deputy O'Higgins told us he was speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. The Fine Gael Party have committed themselves to the statement that the health services have been proved to be inadequate.  I do not think there is any substance in that statement.  Whether there is or is not is a question that cannot be proved or disproved by assertion or counter-assertion in this House.  However, since the contention relates to a service which exists to provide, when required, medical and surgical care for at least 85 per cent. of our people and it is a service which costs us over £18 million a year, I do not think it should be ignored.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should ignore the terms in which this motion has been phrased or that those who make it should be voted down in this House, without affording to them a fair opportunity to substantiate with evidence the allegations they have made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He will not and if the Deputy is patient, he will hear why I will not withdraw it.  There is another reason why I think we should accept the proposals outlined in the Government's amendment.  Again, I will quote Deputy Tom O'Higgins.  Again, Sir, the reference is to Volume 151, columns 1226 and 1227 of the Official Report. I wish, as he then wished&mdash;however his desires may have become warped and distorted ever since; I am quoting &mdash;that:</P>
      <P>the misunderstandings, disagreements and rancour which have characterised the discussion of health problems in this country will be forgotten and that in future the organisation of health services will be regarded purely as a technical problem and not in any way as a political one.</P>
      <P>I accept that position without any reservation whatever.  No Deputy&mdash; perhaps I cannot be quite so unqualified in what I am about to say&mdash;no Deputy, perhaps, with the exception of some members of Fine Gael, would wish, I think, to make the health services a matter of acute political controversy, or would wish our people to get all hot and bothered as to whether all the services will be available to everyone free of direct charge, whether they will be paid for by specific taxes or contributions, as they are commonly called, levied on all who are compelled to come within their scope, or as to whether they should be, as now, on the basis of the patient's capacity to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are cogent arguments, let me admit it, for and against each one of these courses; but we should refrain from making any one of them a Party dogma.  It is almost calamitous that the Fine Gael Party have said that no person who is ill, no person who is sick, in this country is going to receive adequate attention unless the bulk of the expense is borne by a section of the people who are compelled to be within what is called an <Col N="762" /> insurance scheme.  As I said, I think it is calamitous that such a proposition should be erected into a Party dogma.  I think we should have a more open approach, a more eclectic approach, to this problem, that we should take what is good in any of the existing systems and, if it is adaptable to our purposes and to our circumstances, adapt it.  But do not let us be tied up in a straitjacket of an insurance scheme or a free-for-all scheme or, even, if you like, of the existing scheme.</P>
    <P>Indeed, if we want to make progress with the health services, we must proceed empirically in organising and developing them.  That appeals to my temperament.  I trust that approach will also appeal to the House.</P>
    <P>It is just over five years since Deputy O'Higgins brought the 1953 Act into full operation.  That Act was never intended to be the last word in health legislation, nor was it intended that the services established under it should be given form and shape for all time. Let me say this.  I had indeed suggested to the Taoiseach before the last election that the time had come when a close examination of the services provided under the Act could be usefully made. I may say that I had in mind that the examination should be carried out by quite a different type of body from the one suggested in the amendment but a body armed with the same powers as those proposed in the amendment.  The proposal, however, in the amendment is an acceptance of the desire which was expressed when the Health Act, as a Bill, was before this House in 1952 and 1953.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins will remember, and so will the other members of his Party who were here then, that on the Second and Fifth Readings of the Health Bill, Fine Gael put down an amendment proposing that the Bill be reported on by a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad which was to have power to send for persons, papers and records.  The only difference between what was then proposed and what I am proposing today is that the proposed Select Committee will be able to report on the working of the Act, which is, surely, an important consideration, <Col N="763" /> instead of reporting on a mere proposal for an Act; and that, as the present Seanad is on the verge of dissolution, membership of the Select Committee is confined to Deputies.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, however, I think, to give the Committee some definition, some norm by which to measure the adequacy or otherwise of the health services to fulfil the purposes for which they are designed.  &ldquo;Adequacy&rdquo; and &ldquo;inadequacy&rdquo; are words which, as I have shown, may be interpreted variously.  They are relative terms and can only be thought of and evaluated within some frame of reference.  No such frame is indicated in the motion. We do not know by what standards the existing services have been tried and, in terms of the motion, condemned. I think it is essential, if we are going to set up this Committee, that we should define for its guidance the frame within which and in relation to which the question of adequacy is to be judged.  It is stated in the amendment in the following terms: &ldquo;having regard to the general structure of our society&rdquo;.  This, if the House agrees to set up this Committee, will naturally bind the Committee to have particular regard to our own circumstances, our own way of life, the particular form of our economy, our social organisations and the relationships within it and, of course, the scale of resources available to all our people.  All of these are salient factors of the structure of our society and make life here what it is.  Within this frame the Select Committee must proceed, then, to consider whether the existing system of health services is adequate or inadequate.</P>
    <P>This involves laying down a standard by which the adequacy or otherwise of the services is to be judged.  This we proceed to do in the amendment by prescribing in the terms of reference that the existing services are to meet in a reasonable way and at a reasonable cost the essential needs of the population for medical care and attention.  If the existing services fail to do this then, no doubt, the Select Committee will report that they are inadequate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> They are perfectly free to report in full and without reservation the results of their investigation.  What the Government want to know is the truth about the services; but it must be the truth and, therefore, the findings and the recommendations of the committee must be clearly based upon evidence if they are to be accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>As I have said, if the Dáil accepts my amendment and if there is any substance whatsoever in the Fine Gael motion to the effect that the existing health services have been proved to be inadequate, the Committee should not have any difficulty whatsoever in dealing expeditiously with that point and in disposing of it finally.  If, indeed, inadequacy has been proved by experience, as is alleged here in the motion, it should be simple to submit to the Select Committee the evidence on which this assertion was based.  It should then be possible for the Committee to ascertain, with, I think, equal facility, the extent and the nature of the inadequacy and to pinpoint the cause from which it arises.  This, of course, must be done as a preliminary.  The work of the Committee would be barren if this were not done because this is the first preliminary, this is the essential preliminary, to having that inadequacy rectified.  We must know the cause from which it arises.</P>
    <P>I think, sir, that it may be assumed that the Committee's attention will be directed to the proposals which have been very cursorily outlined in the motion but it may be well, however, to make some further reference to them.  It will be noted that the motion proposes that there should be provided, without charge for all those within the scheme, a comprehensive medical service with free choice of doctor, free hospital, specialist and diagnostic services.  The first noteworthy feature about this motion is the reiterated use of the word &ldquo;free&rdquo;.  It is a purely propagandist device intended to convey to the people that they are going to get all these additional benefits for nothing. It starts off by saying that everything is to be provided free of charge.  You <Col N="765" /> are to have free this and free that, without charge.  That is the phrase used in the motion.</P>
    <P>How can these things be provided without charge?  Somebody must pay for them.  Somebody must pay for the nurses, pay for the doctors, pay for the food, lighting and maintenance of the hospitals.  As I say, somebody must pay for all these and who will that somebody be?  Apparently not the patients, if one is to take the motion at its face value, for everything is to be provided for them without charge.  But that was not what we were told this morning.  Somebody is going to pay under the Fine Gael scheme.  Who, therefore, is going to pay?  One finds that one-third of the cost will come from the insured people, the persons who are compelled to be within this so-called insurance scheme, this scheme which, in essence, is merely a system for collecting a poll tax from every worker who is compelled to come within its ambit as a contributor.</P>
    <P>The next person who is called upon to pay immediately is the employer of the insured person.  I said, mark you, &ldquo;pay immediately&rdquo;, but of course the employer, as everybody knows, does not pay out of his own pocket.  The employer's contributions to any compulsory insurance scheme are allowable as a charge.  And of course what he does is to pass his share of the requisite sum on to the consumer in the price of the goods which are bought.</P>
    <P>The third party who is going to have to pay for everything that we were told during the election would be provided free of charge are the general body of taxpayers.  That is what we were told this morning by Deputy O'Higgins. The only difference I can see between that system and the existing system is this, that the consumers pay twice or three times over if they happen to be insured persons, because the insured person pays his own contribution, he pays his share of the employer's contribution, recompensing the employer's contribution in the price of the goods he buys from him, and then a third time as a taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It is worth while considering the <Col N="766" /> equities of this situation.  What in fact was proposed to us this morning was this: that these new benefits were to be financed in this way&mdash;one-third by the general taxpayer, one-third by a levy on the insured person's pay packet and one-third by a stamp on the employer's payroll.  That is what was solemnly trotted across the House as being a great social advance.  As I say, one of the things which the Select Committee would be called upon to report on is whether, having regard to all our circumstances, that scheme was fair and equitable to those who are compelled by law to be insured persons for the purposes of the health services. There is nothing voluntary about this scheme, either, remember that.  There is no use confusing the one type of scheme with the other.  Every person who is employed in accordance with the terms of the existing Social Insurance Act will be, judging by what Deputy O'Higgins said, compelled to contribute to the additional cost, to the fringe benefits and the frills which constitute the whole of the insurance scheme which has been described to us in such glowing terms by Deputy O'Higgins and particularly by his Leader, Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>For all this, what is the insured person going to have in return? Deputy O'Higgins told us he is going to have the privilege of seeing on his card a stamp of a different colour, a distinct and different stamp from that which he now puts on his card for national health purposes.  That is the only difference except that he will pay three times over, as I have said, for any tangible benefit he derives.  Apart from anything else, is there any social justice in transferring from the general body of ratepayers and taxpayers to a particular group in the community the cost of any particular section of the health services?  I mean, is there any justification for asking, say, the self-employed person to contribute at twice the rate?  If we are going to have the ordinary principle of social welfare insurance applied to this, is there any justification for compelling the self-employed person or the farmer with a valuation of from £15 to £50, to pay at twice the rate at which an employee <Col N="767" /> would be supposed to pay in order to cover the same degree of risk, and expecting him, in addition, to pay his share of the State contribution to the scheme?  I should like to hear Deputy Donegan, who is very concerned about the position of the farmers, explaining this&mdash;I should not like to hear it in this House but I probably will&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <P>There is one thing I regret, having listened to Deputy O'Higgins in the course of his speech this morning, and that was that I had not the privilege or advantage of listening to him making that speech during the election.  I can tell you I would have had a great deal more to say on the radio and elsewhere, if only the Fine Gael Party had disclosed to the public the pig in the poke they are trying to sell them.  Then we would have had something to say. However, Sir, let me go on.  There was some divergence there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall pass from this question of who is going to pay and take another proposal which is in the motion.  The motion is a composite one and of course there are many components, but I do not want to encroach too much on what the Select Committee will have to consider. The motion proposes &ldquo;to provide without charge a free choice of doctor&rdquo;&mdash;what is the significance of that word &ldquo;free&rdquo;?  Is it merely to give colour to the motion, to create the impression that everything is to be given without charge, as the motion says?  I do not know what it means. It cannot surely be that for want of <Col N="768" /> words to fill up the paper the people who drafted the motion, having said everything would be given without charge, repeated that it would be free and said again that it would be free. That everything would be given without charge, absolutely everything is what the phraseology of the motion is intended to convey, though everyone informed knows it is just nonsense.</P>
      <P>I think, however, that the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; is used in the sense of not being restricted, that there should be an unrestricted choice of doctor.  Is that a practical possibility?  If you are to have that, it means every person can go to whomsoever doctor he likes throughout the length and breadth of the country.  If he were so minded, he could travel from Cork to Dublin in order to consult a doctor.  I do not think he would, but that is the privilege this Fine Gael motion proposes to extend to all patients, to all those covered by this comprehensive health service.</P>
      <P>But what about the doctor?  Is he going to have the right to reject patients?  Nothing is said about the position of the doctors in the health service.  It seems to be assumed they can be dragooned and regimented and I do not think it would be right that they should.  Apparently, according to the terms of this motion on the Order Paper and which Deputy O'Higgins asks us so vehemently to accept, there is to be unrestricted choice of doctor. I do not think that is practicable or right, and it is certainly not right that the people should be duped into believing it is practicable.  I think all I can say is that they might be given a restricted choice of doctor, a choice of one out of two or three.  In most parts of the country, it would be almost impossible to give them more than the choice of two doctors.  However, even there it is just a little bit doubtful as to whether everybody could be given that free choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great objection which was believed to exist to this proposal when it was examined originally was that a great number of people would not be given a choice of doctor at all, even a limited one.  However, I should say that a detailed study of all facets of <Col N="769" /> this matter indicates that a restricted choice may be practicable for all but a very small fraction of the population. But it will be a restricted choice. There will not be a free or open choice.</P>
    <P>If we do afford that choice, what will be the position of the existing practitioners?  What, in particular, will be the position of the existing dispensary doctors?  They are now paid quite a reasonable salary for doing a certain amount of work and they are in pensionable posts.  If the number of patients they are called on to attend is considerably reduced, are we to start cutting their salaries and retiring them on short-service superannuation, and are we to break the long-term contracts we have entered into with them?  If not, are we to compensate them and, if so, who is to pay for the compensation?  That is an aspect of this matter which I do not think has been considered by any person who has made himself responsible for the drafting of this motion and the submission of this scheme to the country.  It is something which has to be considered.</P>
    <P>Then, again, upon what terms are we to ask other doctors to treat such patients as may transfer themselves from their existing dispensary doctors to private general practitioners? Deputy O'Higgins was very glib when I asked him what was to happen to the general practitioner service.  He said &ldquo;What you pay to the dispensary doctors virtually offsets that.&rdquo;  That is the way he brushed it aside.  It is quite clear that if we bring in this scheme, the position of the doctor is going to present a serious problem.  I am not saying we should not try to give this choice of doctor, but these are aspects of this which require careful consideration. This consideration is one of the things which I think this Select Committee could usefully concern itself with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not insurmountable aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing is insurmountable if you are prepared to pay for it; but when we bring along proposals here and ask people to pay for them, they are not received with acclamation on the other side.  We are <Col N="770" /> told then about the mounting cost of taxation and the cost of public services. We have to behave responsibly in this matter.  It is a serious matter.  While I agree the difficulty is not insurmountable&mdash;at a price&mdash;it is going to mean a very great upset to many dispensary doctors.  There are nearly 700 of them in this country.  That appears not to have been given any consideration at all.</P>
      <P>Again, if you read this motion, you find there are other aspects.  It implies an almost free choice of hospital. Because the manner in which it has been set out is so confusing, I doubt if it does mean a free choice of hospital. But the emphasis is on &ldquo;free&rdquo; and &ldquo;choice&rdquo;.  At least it is intended to convey, even if it is not meant, to the person that he will be able to enter a hospital of his choice.  As I say, I do not think that is really in the minds of the Fine Gael people responsible for this motion.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy O'Higgins speak this morning about the impression which had been created when the 1953 Act was being debated here&mdash;that everybody was to get everything free.  The sponsors of that Act had no responsibility for creating that impression.  It was created by the vehemence with which the Fine Gael Party emphasised and dwelt upon the immorality of giving any service or giving anything free.  They were out then on the hustings, on the public platforms at the crossroads, preaching that this Health Act was a degradation of the human personality, that it was intended to destroy the sense of responsibility which every honest citizen ought to have within his breast.  That is how this idea that the 1953 Health Act was intended to be a free-for-all service was propagated.  Of course, it never was to provide a free-for-all service. That was written into the Act.  No person who ever read the Act could ever believe that it was.  The motion I am discussing to-day certainly could convey&mdash;as at first glance it did convey to me, and I am an old hand at these things&mdash;that a free choice of hospital was intended.  I do not think that is so. Even if it were, it would be quite impracticable, as everybody knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard an exposé this morning of <Col N="771" /> the Fine Gael plan for this comprehensive health service.  What was it in fact?  It was a mere embellishment, if I may put it that way, of the existing system of health services with a few frills and furbelows.  Deputy O'Higgins said: &ldquo;Let us get rid of the Health Act.&rdquo;  He told me: &ldquo;Forget about the Health Act,&rdquo; when I pointed out that all the things which he was promising were being provided under the Health Act.  Then, when we began to analyse his figures, we were told that all the existing health services, the hospitals, general practitioners, and others, were to be continued.  They cannot be continued if we get rid of the Health Act, unless we pass another Act to take its place and that other Act would contain, I am prepared to bet, almost precisely the same provisions. This is not getting rid of the Health Act and substituting anything real for it but adding embellishments to the Health Act and asking people to pay for these embellishments in the most uneconomic way possible.</P>
    <P>At the present moment we have only one set of rate collectors; one rate collecting service administered by several authorities, and one tax collecting service administered by one authority and able to collect all the taxes.  What would be the cost of going every week to a man in County Louth, with a valuation of £15 5s. or £15 10s., to collect from him his tax contribution to this compulsory scheme?  What would be the cost of pursuing, harrying, chivvying and harassing every self-employed person in the State?  It is comparatively easy to collect from the employed person, or to compel his employer to pay on behalf of the person whom he employs, because then you have the same system. What would be the cost in relation to the £200,000 which was the figure roughly suggested by Deputy O'Higgins for the numbers of self-employed persons who would be in the scheme? It would not be easy to collect tax from them, and the mere fact that it would not be easy would add immensely to the cost of the scheme.  What will be done to those who evade the scheme?  What will be the position of the person who is compelled by law <Col N="772" /> to be within the scheme and does not pay his contribution, if he falls sick? Will he be denied the services which he has today?  What will happen in his case?</P>
    <P>The one fundamental principle&mdash;the principle of insurance, to use the phrase which is used in this motion&mdash; of insurance is that you are covered only for what you pay, and if you do not pay your premium on the due date, then your entitlement to your insurance falls.  There are certain exceptions but that is the situation in general.  What will be the position&mdash; let me repeat&mdash;of the person who being an insured person under the Act does not pay his contribution?  What will his position be if his employer does not pay?  Is he to be denied the advantages which he is supposed to receive under the scheme?  Of course he will not be denied them.  No one would be so inhuman.  His needs will be catered for in the same way as we cater for 30 per cent. of the population at the present time, the 30 per cent, at least, who are treated free of any charge.</P>
    <P>He will get these advantages but from whence will he get them?  He cannot get them except from the existing services&mdash;the services which Deputy O'Higgins has so criticised this morning.  He will not get them as a member of a comprehensive health service financed according to the principles of insurance.  He will get them from an existing system financed as it is at present by the ratepayers and taxpayers and, in the case of hospital patients, related to a limited extent to their capacity to pay.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment to the amendment:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the amendment the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee report before 30th June, 1962, and that pending the report by the Committee the Minister for Health request County Managers and Health Authorities to liberalise the administration of the Health Act, particularly in relation to the issue of medical cards and charges for hospital treatment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> The attitude of the Labour Party with regard to the limitation on this debate is fully justified when one remembers that two speakers have taken up three hours in a debate which Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael intended to last for five hours.  In view of the seriousness of the subject under discussion, I think it is only right and proper, in the public interest, that the Government should consider an extension of the time for this debate.  However, I shall not pursue that point at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party amendment is to the amendment by the Minister which, in effect, is a motion.  We are prepared to support the Minister's amendment, if our amendment is accepted.  However, I shall go on further to deal with that.  This debate, in any case, has demonstrated one thing.  It has demonstrated the fact that there is universal dissatisfaction with the health scheme. That dissatisfaction may vary in degree, but I think it would be very enlightening for the Minister to hear some of his colleagues on the administration of the Health Act.  I do not say that in any spirit of vindictiveness towards the Minister or his colleagues. I think it would be enlightening for him, because I appreciate that, as head of a Department, he cannot take the same detailed interest in the detailed administration of the Act as, say, would an ordinary Deputy or a Deputy who is a member of a local authority.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed at the Minister's approach to the whole problem in that he went into too much detailed criticism of the proposals put forward by a member of the Fine Gael Party. I think the Minister should be prepared to approach this whole business of an inquiry with a far more open mind.  It seems to me that on certain aspects of the administration of the health scheme, he has his mind made up and will not be shifted in certain respects, no matter what the report of a Select Committee might be. It is a good idea that he proposes that there will be a Select Committee of this House because I believe they are very well equipped to consider the administration of the health scheme, and to consider and make a report as to what improvements should be made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> I want to make my position in relation to the Health Act, 1953, quite clear.  I believe and my Party at the time believed that the old health system prior to 1954 smacked of pauperism and was inadequate.  We voted for the Health Act, 1953, because, in theory at any rate, it seemed to provide for a better health service.  I do not think that in a debate like this we should condemn the 1953 Act, lock, stock and barrel.  The biggest criticism of the Act rests on its administration, and particularly on the services that are provided&mdash;or should I say, not provided&mdash;for the lower income groups.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should disregard the fact that in certain aspects of the health scheme there have been improvements, particularly in respect of the maternity services.  That, for one thing&mdash;and other things such as the provision of certain medical appliances &mdash;is an improvement on the old system that we knew.  Therefore, let me say that, in theory, the Act in itself, in each line, each section and each part does not seem to me to be a bad Act, or an Act that should be condemned or dismissed out of hand.</P>
    <P>What we all complain about is the administration of the Act, and we also complain about the regulations made by various Ministers for Health in respect of the administration of the Act.  I think we should be honest with ourselves and say that the administration of the Health Act is limited, and has been limited since 1954, by reason of the fact that the Government and the Ministers are not prepared to spend more money on the health services.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine for members of local authorities and members of Dáil Éireann to talk about the Health Act and the inadequacy of it.  My experience has been, through reading reports in any case, that when the annual Estimates are being considered in the local health authorities very many of our public representatives are reluctant to provide sufficient moneys and the administration of the Health Act in many cases is limited because money is limited to those who are charged with its administration Theremountable&mdash;a <Col N="775" /> fore I would say to these people&mdash;and I can say that the Labour Party members of local authorities are not included in this&mdash;that they cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>The administration of the Health Act, I allege, is being governed by money.  In some cases it seems to be at the direction of the Department of Health through the Minister for Health.  One of the best examples of that is in the fluctuation in the number of medical cards throughout the years.  It seems that when a Minister considers there is too much being spent on health he sends the word down to the county managers: &ldquo;You had better go easy on the issue of medical service cards.&rdquo;  In March, 1959, 853,000 persons were covered by medical service cards.  In September, 1960, that figure had dropped to 781,000.  Can anyone explain to me why there was that drastic reduction ? The only conclusion I can come to is that county managers were instructed to withdraw a certain number of medical service cards so that in consequence the expense of the health services would be reduced.  The Minister for Health in a debate in this House in February of this year, on a motion by Deputy Dr. Browne, suggested that the people were better off and there was no necessity for the same number of medical service cards.  Some of them may be a little better off but a lot of them are not. That certainly cannot be related to the drastic reduction I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Might I say also that the proposals that were announced here in respect of a partial insurance scheme for health services by Deputy Tom O'Higgins are not brand new to this House.  The Minister, I am sure, is aware that in September, 1958, the Labour Party made public a scheme which embraced practically everything that Deputy Tom O'Higgins spoke of this morning, with, of course, certain modifications. I might also say they made their proposals in greater detail than I suppose it was possible for Deputy O'Higgins to make them here this morning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> I have said and I believe, and I am sure the Minister's colleagues believe, there is general dissatisfaction with the present scheme.  One of the biggest issues of the last general election was the question of health services.  I do not know whether the Fianna Fáil candidates found that.  However, I know that as far as our policy is concerned, one of the biggest issues among the majority of the people was the health services.  I was amused at the comment by the Minister for Health on his election in Dublin South-East when he seemed to suggest that his victory in Dublin South-East&mdash;and I suppose it was a good victory&mdash;was a vindication of the administration of the present Health Act.  I do not know whether he anticipated the final returns but I think he was foolish to assume that the people in the last election endorsed the administration of the Health Act of 1953 as it has been administered up to the present time.</P>
    <P>If there was one message more than another conveyed to the Government in the result of the last election it was to the effect that they would have to be more liberal in the provision of health services.  I am pleased to note by the Minister's amendment that he is prepared to consider practically all aspects of the health services.  As I said at the beginning of my speech, I hope he has not set a headline for any of us who may happen to be on this Committee and I hope such members will disregard anything he has said this morning in defence of many facets of the health services.  I know he had to make some speech.  I know he had to make a reply to some of the suggestions that were made from the Fine Gael side but I think he committed himself too much. Therefore I would ask him, when he is charging his colleagues who will be on this Committee considering this whole business, to allow them to approach it with an open mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to know certain things about the administration of the Health Act and to appreciate what the problem is.  This may appear to be a generalisation but I know of at least two people in my constituency who are scared to go to doctors and to hospitals for fear of the cost.  That may <Col N="777" /> sound fantastic.  The Minister and the Government Party may say they should not be afraid of the cost, that if their health is at stake they should go to these doctors and to these hospitals. However, there are many of what may be considered borderline cases in the lower income group.  They realise that if they pay one visit to a doctor it may cost them 15/-.  I know it varies from district to district but that is the average for each visit.  Every time you go to that doctor you must pay 15/- and if he sends you to hospital, if you have no medical service card and you are in the middle income group, the county council presents you with a bill for 10/- per day.</P>
    <P>I know managers have been pretty generous in the remission of these bills but there are many poor people who do not suspect that these bills can be reduced or remitted, but believe they must pay £3 10s. 0d. a week for hospitalisation. Another reflection on the health services is the undoubted fact that, in every constituency and in every town in Ireland, there are people who because of the fear of the cost of medical services have gone to Great Britain to have their operations done for nothing.  They go for various other reasons but, generally speaking, they go because they cannot afford the operations here.  I would not say it is because they believe they will get better medical or better specialist attention in Great Britain.  They go there because of the fear of the cost.  That is a situation which we all deplore and which we should try to prevent.</P>
    <P>The Minister alleged that Deputy O'Higgins generalised in his criticism of the health services.  I propose to particularise, but not to give names. I have cases here of hardship where medical cards were withdrawn or refused. This is not a matter for the Minister, but the significant thing about my constituency is that, whereas in other years the result of the general review was issued in the month of September, this year it issued on 9th October, a very significant thing. However, I do not blame the Minister for that; I blame the Wexford County Council.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider this case?  I do not mean the specific case <Col N="778" /> and I do not want him to do anything about it, but it is a real case.  An old age pensioner, with a wife and a school-going child, has one son, a carpenter, who earns £2 per week.  The medical card was withdrawn from that man.  The Minister for Finance, answering a question here for the Minister for Health one day, said that, in his opinion, every old age pensioner should automatically have a medical service card: he said he could not ensure he would get it.  He said there was no legal provision for the automatic granting of such a card, but that, in his opinion, he should get it.  There are many cases in the country of people who have had to undergo severe means tests for widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment assistance and old age pensions.  They find they are deprived of a medical service card, arising out of the stricter means test applied by the various local authorities.</P>
    <P>Here is the case of a man with £10 4s. per week, a wage that is above the average.  He pays rent, 18/-.  He has a wife and six children.  He is expected to pay a bill for maintenance at Our Lady's Hospital&mdash;I assume it is in Dublin.  Another child is in the County Hospital and he has another bill for that.  These are practical examples of what happens and these are the sort of things we should try to correct in any consideration of the health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that these things happen because the Health Act is not being properly administered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister. It is not today that I first said that.  I have said it every time I spoke in this House on the health services. Here is the case of a man on short time.  He works two weeks in three. He has a wife and four children.  His medical card was withdrawn on 9th October.  Here is another case of a man with a wife and one child: another child is expected.  The wages going into that household are £7 4s. per week.  The rent is £1 4s.  There is an important point about this case and it shows where the investigation is haphazard.  The wife is pregnant and <Col N="779" /> she is suffering from anaemia.  She was being supplied with tablets for the anaemia.  In the middle of her pregnancy, they took the tablets away from her.  Now she must pay for these tablets to cure her anaemia and to prepare her to have the baby.  I think it was callous.  I do not say it was deliberately callous but it was thoughtless on the part of those people who purported to hold the review of people holding medical service cards.</P>
      <P>I have particulars here of the case of a farm labourer who is living with his father and mother, who are invalids. They got a card three years ago but it was withdrawn after three months.  He had been sick six weeks previous to 3rd September.  I have dozens of these cases.  They were all mentioned in the local authority in my constituency.  The usual answer was: &ldquo;If I get particulars of these cases, I shall have them reviewed.&rdquo;  That is not good enough because the cases reviewed are those brought to the attention of the members of the local authority or of Dáil Éireann.  For every one, there are 20 other people who seem to me to have suffered an injustice.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also to have an investigation caused into income limits. That is one of the biggest bones of contention, as far as I can see, in the local authorities.  There was a discussion recently in one of the local authorities.  The members naturally asked, as we often asked in the past seven years, how one qualifies for a medical service card.  Very shamefacedly, all of us said we did not know. I always say: &ldquo;If you ask me if you are eligible for an old age pension, unemployment assistance, a widow's or orphan's non-contributory pension, I can tell you and, 99 times out of 100, I shall be right but I cannot tell anybody if he is entitled to a medical service card.&rdquo;  The managers of health authorities say each case is decided upon its merits.  There must be some standard they employ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suspect&mdash;I have no evidence to upport this&mdash;that the managers have got together and have set their own tandards&mdash;standards that maybe even he Minister does not know about.  If <Col N="780" /> the Minister has directed them to set a standard, I do not know.  One man said, in any case, that there was no fixed scale: he could not fix a scale and take on himself the translation of something the Oireachtas would not do.  The section was administered by investigating each individual case through the assistance officer.  The Oireachtas did not lay down a means test, I think rightly so, because there would, I think, be more hardships then.  What the Oireachtas did was to give the managers a certain discretion which I believe they are not using generously enough.  I do not think that was valid criticism.  There may be fair comment.  I do not say it was intended to be critical of Ministers or perhaps of Dáil Éireann, but it is a fair excuse for members of a local authority to say: &ldquo;Because Oireachtas Éireann did not lay down any means test, I am not going to lay down any means test.&rdquo;  They have discretion and the criticism of members of a local authority is that they do not use this discretion generously enough.</P>
    <P>We have to be realistic as far as the means test is concerned.  Here is the case of a labourer with, say, £7 a week.  He has a few children and maybe they are working.  When the local authority come to assess means, they include the means of every person in the household.  Under the Public Assistance Act, I suppose sons and daughters are supposed to contribute to the upkeep and welfare of their parents.  That may morally be pure, so to speak, but it does not happen. I do not think we expect it to happen. A chap with £4 or £5 a week has a certain standard to keep up in 1961. If he is going to live in society, if he is to have the same standard as other chaps or girls in his profession, he must be given or allowed to keep a liberal allowance during the week.  I think, therefore, that as far as the assessment of means in a household is concerned, there must be an overhaul of that machinery.  I certainly welcome any investigation the Minister intends to hold in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister also proposes to provide for an investigation into existing arrangements to determine whether a <Col N="781" /> person is or is not within an eligible category.  I think that ought to be done. I had occasion to question the Minister last week about the annual reviews that take place.  The Minister said&mdash;I know he said it with his tongue in his cheek&mdash;that every single medical card is investigated every year.  With the existing machinery, I think that would be impossible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I said the Minister spoke somewhat with his tongue in his cheek.  I do not believe it is done.  I think spot checks are done. I thought the method was that employed by investigation officers in the Department of Social Welfare who investigate a certain number a year.  However, if we are to have any sort of satisfaction amongst these medical service card holders or would-be medical service card holders, I think there has to be this review which the Minister says must be held by the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1958 the Government introduced a programme of economic expansion designed to remove the economic reasons for emigration. That programme continues to be developed with vigour as is evident from the record increases in the national income recently.  The success of the programme must show itself first in reduced unemployment and then in reduced emigration.  The reduction in <Col N="782" /> unemployment is apparent already from the Live Register statistics.  There are no short-term emigration statistics available, but the net outward passenger balance by sea and air in the current year give grounds for the expectation that there is a substantial reduction in net emigration.  These balances are at present running at about 14,000 below the figures for the corresponding period of 1960.</P>
      <P>In reply to previous Dáil Questions on 27th April, 1960, 2nd November, 1960, and 1st March, 1961, I gave details of a very extensive list of special measures which had been taken to promote greater economic progress and to open new opportunities of employment in the West of Ireland.  All these measures are proceeding with increasing benefits to these areas.</P>

Further schemes are being initiated both by the Departments concerned with economic affairs and, in the areas where it is concerned, by the Department of the Gaeltacht. Needless to remark, the Government will be prepared to consider any possibility that may be suggested for further extension of activities of that kind but I should like to express my view that, so far as the reduction of emigration is a national objective, it must be considered in relation to the situation of the country as a whole <Col N="783" /> rather than in relation to the particular problems of some areas.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Blowick, may I say that the Government are most concerned to keep under review the operation of social welfare arrangements particularly in those small farm areas and investigations are constantly proceeding as to methods of changing their administration so as to achieve the results we had in mind when we conceived them.  In regard to Deputy Dillon's supplementary question, it raises a very big problem.  While I know he would agree that the wiser or better course is to try to devise methods of increasing the productivity of the land comprised in these small farms, if that <Col N="784" /> cannot be done in sufficient degree or with sufficient speed, then alternative methods of providing income for these people must be considered but the practical difficulty of doing that on a scale which would be extensive enough and which would meet the hardship, wherever hardship lasts, is quite considerable.</P>

      <P>Extensions of existing institutions for the mentally handicapped are projected which will provide about 240 further beds, i.e., 120 beds at the Home and School of the Immaculate Conception, Cregg House, Sligo; 90 beds at St. Mary's, Delvin, County Westmeath and 30 beds at St. Vincent's, Lisnagry, County Limerick.  The work at Sligo is already in progress.  It is expected that work at Devlin will commence shortly.  The Lisnagry scheme is being planned.  In addition proposals for adaptation of buildings to provide 50 further beds at Stewart's Hospital, Palmerstown, Co. Dublin, are at present under consideration by the hospital authority.  It is estimated that the grants necessary to finance these works may total about £500,000.  When all these beds will have been provided the total accommodation available for the mentally handicapped will be about 3,000 beds or almost three times the number which was there in 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These developments should help to relieve pressure as an interim measure but for the reasons set out in the White Paper published in March, 1960, it is desirable that the whole problem of mental handicap should be examined comprehensively and a Commission of Inquiry has been set up for that purpose. <Col N="785" /> Further extensions of existing institutions for the mentally handicapped have been proposed but the question of providing more accommodation is linked with the issues which will be considered by the Commission of Inquiry, e.g., staffing of Institutions, training of staff, type of institution to be provided, development of day-training centres, etc.</P>

It might be the type of case which the Board of Works would consider as an intermediate river as, apart from the Bridgetown river, the Murnagh out-fall also takes the discharge from another branch, from Ballintra.  I shall undertake to have the matter investigated and see if it can be classified as an intermediate river.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the hardship caused to applicants for contributory old age pensions who have up to thirty years stamps on their insurance cards, but who do not qualify for pension because of the fact that they have become self-employed, or for some other reason have not stamped cards over the fifteen years before they reached seventy years of age; and if he will consider amending the Act in order to allow them to qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960, one of the contribution conditions for old age (contributory) pension is that the average per contribution year of the contributions paid or credited in respect of a claimant from his date of entry into insurance is not less than 48.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> Contributions for old age (contributory) pension purposes first commenced to be payable on 2nd January, 1961.  The Act, however, included provision for the making of regulations to enable previous insurance under the National Health Insurance Acts and the Social Welfare Acts to reckon for pension purposes, and to modify the contribution conditions in the case of persons who were insured under the National Health Insurance Acts.</P>
    <P>The necessity to modify the contribution conditions in the case of persons insured under the National Health Insurance Acts arose because, unlike the present scheme of comprehensive insurance under the Social Welfare Acts, which commenced on 5th January, 1953, national health insurance did not allow credits in respect of proved unemployment, and provision was made in those Acts for the cessation of insurance.  Under the regulations made, a man who reached the age of 60 before 5th January, 1953, or a woman who reached that age before 6th July, 1953, must satisfy the yearly average contribution condition over one or other of two alternative periods whichever is the more favourable to the claimant.  Having regard to the difficulties mentioned, the maximum period over which the average could be reckoned was considered to be the last fifteen contribution years before attainment of age 70.</P>
    <P>Persons who, by reasons of self-employment or otherwise, ceased to be insurably employed under the National Health Insurance Acts and who had not less than 104 contributions paid since entry into insurance, had the option of continuing their insurance by paying contributions voluntarily, and such voluntary contributions count equally with employment contributions in determining the yearly average of contributions for pension purposes.  As persons now contributing to old age (contributory) pension who become self-employed may maintain their pension position only by the payment of voluntary contributions, I do not accept that there is a case for providing special treatment for those persons <Col N="806" /> who fail to qualify for pension because they did not exercise their right to become voluntary contributors in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If people now are aware that there is such a thing as contributory old age pensions which can be qualified for by being a voluntary contributor, does the Minister not agree that it is inequitable that people who were not aware of that, because it did not exist, should be disqualified from drawing a contributory old age pension, even though they have had up to 30 years' stamps on their cards without a break?  Further, would the Minister not agree that it is also inequitable that a person who entered insurance at age 59 and intermittently stamped his card until age 70 will qualify for a contributory old age pension, while somebody who has been stamping cards all his life until for one reason or another he ceased doing so 15 years before age 70 is disqualified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Government went as far as it was reasonable to expect them to go in allowing people who had not, in fact, contributed to the contributory old age pension scheme at all to qualify.  They could not be expected to cover all people who might have decided to become voluntary contributors if they had known that this contributory old age pension scheme would be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the hardship caused to workers who have reached seventy years of age and who, because of their employment as officers by local authorities, have not had their insurance cards stamped, and do not qualify for contributory old age pensions; and if he will consider amending the Act in order to cater for this type of worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the position for many years that persons employed in a permanent and pensionable capacity in the civil service, under local and public authorities, in the teaching profession and certain other occupations, pay a reduced rate of insurance contribution which provides cover only for widows' and orphans' pensions.  When the new scheme of old age (contributory) pensions was being formulated it was decided that the existing framework of insurance should be maintained, and that persons in the employments referred to, who are eligible to receive pensions from public funds, should be excluded from the scope of the scheme.  Accordingly, these persons continue to be insurable only for widows' and orphans' pensions.  Where the employment is not permanent and pensionable full rate contributions are payable, and the employees are covered for old age (contributory) pension.</P>
      <P>In connection with the award of old age (contributory) pensions past contributions are taken into account, but the reduced rate contributions paid by the classes in question are excluded, because contributions paid by such classes in the future are expressly disregarded for pension purposes by Section 16 of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most unusual case and has arisen on only a few occasions.  The Land Commission are the owners of this property which was purchased under the 1903 Act and all the rights, including turbary rights, were vested in something like 57 dominant tenants and three servient tenants.  The result is when the Land Commission in a case like this go in and do any work they may find themselves liable for damage arising from any work they may do, including cattle falling into drains or people being injured.  There is no cure for that, in my view, except amending legislation.  Similar cases have arisen before, and were raised at the Public Accounts Committee, in which the Land Commission were decreed. Recently, some undertakings have <Col N="813" /> been received from some of the people involved and I hope to get over the matter in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem arises because of the very big expansion of scholarships brought about by the Local Authorities (Education Scholarships) (Amendment) Act passed by the previous Dáil.

Surely the parents of children are entitled to know the opportunities offered to their <Col N="830" /> children so that if the principal teacher does not put forward a child the parent can approach the principal teacher and urge him or her to put forward his or her child for the examination.

The man who was President of the Circuit Court in 1960 ceased to be President in October, 1961, and a new person was appointed.  Therefore, no question can arise of an extension. What was required in the second instance was a new Order for the release of a named person.  The Government failed to do so.  It appears that this man was abroad, only he had no leave to be there.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have been advised by the Garda Authorities that, notwithstanding the widespread public condemnation of the acts of violence on the Border and the emphatic repudiation of those who supported them at the recent General Election, confidential information and observations indicate that further acts of the same character may be perpetrated. The Government are determined to do everything in their power to bring this campaign of violence to an end and as existing measures have not yet succeeded in this purpose have decided that it is now necessary to strengthen them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> The Government regard the step of bringing persons for trial by a special Criminal Court instead of by the ordinary courts as justified only in grave circumstances.  It is their judgment however that these circumstances now exist.  The bringing of offenders of this character for trial before the District Court does not permit of sentences being imposed appropriate to the gravity of the offences and may have occasioned some misunderstanding amongst those concerned with them as to the seriousness with which the Government view the position and their determination to deal with it.  Because the persons concerned have constantly displayed their contempt for the fundamental principles of democracy, it would be undesirable to rely on trial by jury which might expose jurymen and witnesses to the danger of intimidation.</P>
    <P>The partition of our country is a grave injustice which is deeply resented by the great majority of Irishmen. One unhappy consequence is that a few of them are foolishly resorting to violence, a course which the Government have repeatedly condemned as conducive to the perpetuation instead of the abolition of the Border as indeed must now be obvious to everyone.</P>
    <P>The measures taken so far have reduced the number of these illegal activities but although only a small number of persons are engaged in them they necessitate keeping a large force of Gardaí constantly on the alert.  There are over 600 Gardaí engaged whole-time on duties in connection with these activities at a cost of the order of £400,000 per annum and there are over 250 on special duty in Border counties. Everything possible has been done up to now within the normal means to suppress this campaign of violence and it is because it is in the national interest to bring it speedily to an end that the Government have taken the step of filling the vacancies in the Special Criminal Court so that it may function again.</P>
    <P>The only cases which will be brought before the Court will be those arising from this armed conspiracy of violence.</P>
    <P>I hope that the special measures which the Government have now <Col N="840" /> authorised will be effective in dealing with the situation but if they do not prove to be so, the Government will not hesitate to take still further steps.</P>

      <P>May I be permitted to say in that connection that we note with satisfaction that the Taoiseach fully appreciates the gravity of the decision of suspending the operation of the ordinary civil Criminal Court but, if he informs the House that it is the judgment of the Government, in the light of confidential information available only to them, that this step is necessary to put an end to what I think he properly describes as an armed conspiracy of violence which gravely conflicts with the fundamental national interest, then we are not prepared to demur from that decision though we trust the Government will keep constantly in mind the desirability of restoring at the earliest possible opportunity the ordinary operation of the criminal law and will take the earliest opportunity of advising us of what procedures the Government now regard as essential in the operation of these courts.</P>

      <P>Is it a fact that the powers of the Special Criminal Court which the Taoiseach has reconstituted and which is composed of Army officers are greater than those of High Court judges, although these Army officers&mdash;and I say this in no sense of personal criticism&mdash;have little or no knowledge of the processes of the law? Does the Taoiseach, by his admission of having to reconstitute a Special Criminal Court, now suggest that he has no confidence in the sense of maturity and responsibility of the Irish people to see that justice is done irrespective of any type of intimidation which the Taoiseach may now allege will be used against members of a jury?</P>

Then there would be no reason for this legislation, simply because we Irish, whether north or south will, and can, get on together and it will not be necessary for one <Col N="841" /> section of the Irish people to introduce legislation of this kind against Irishmen.</P>

As regards Deputy Barren's point, I think it is necessary to emphasise that this campaign of violence on the Border is fundamentally a denial of the democratic right of the Irish people to determine national policy.  The people have in the most emphatic way expressed disapproval of this campaign and those who support it.  It is also a challenge to the authority of the Government as well as to the moral law.  Any Government that did not take measures to protect the people's democratic rights would not be worthy of the name.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister proposes in his amendment that there be a review of the existing arrangements to determine whether a person is eligible, I assume, for a medical service card. When this debate was adjourned, I was asking the Minister if he was absolutely certain that when a review is held, all those who hold medical service cards are subject to that review?  Is he satisfied that the existing personnel are adequately equipped to conduct this review?  Those who are now designated home assistance officers with local authorities have various duties to perform and I often wonder in respect of many of them, are they in turn adequately equipped to determine such important matters when there is a question of the provision of assistance or health services to very needy people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong, I suppose, to cast any aspersion on home assistance officers generally&mdash;I do not want or intend to do that, but allegations that have been made from time to time of prejudice, bias and favouritism in the ranks of these officers can be justified. I do not think they realise the extent of the harm they do in making reports on people's means, those who have applied for medical service cards, home assistance or other forms of assistance.  One of the most frequent complaints with regard to the issue of medical service cards is that people <Col N="843" /> whom applicants know in many cases as neighbours with the same income, the same weekly wage, the same number of dependants, have medical cards while the applicants, in similar circumstances, have not.  While many allegations of that kind cannot be substantiated, there are genuine cases and I think therefore the Minister should cause a detailed examination to be made of existing arrangements for the determination of eligibility for medical service cards in carrying out this annual review which, we believe, must be carried out by the local authority.</P>
    <P>It seems that many of them approach the problem with a view to trying to prove the case against the applicant rather than to assist these people, the majority of whom need this type of assistance in matters of health.  The Minister might also have a look at what I think is a defect either in the Act or the administration.  As it is, the county manager, the manager of the health authority, determines who is eligible to get a medical card. If he says a person is not entitled to have the medical card, there is no appeal.  There should be provision for an appeal but I do not suggest that the appeal should be made through the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think it is neither possible nor practicable for the manager to adjudicate on the eligibility of persons to hold medical cards, nor is he equipped to do so or to decide whether, on review, the medical card should be withdrawn.  It is too big a task for a man who has to deal with housing, water supplies, sewerage, collection of rates and dozens of items involved in managing a local authority.  I therefore suggest that there should be consideration of the secretary or staff officer&mdash;and all local authorities have staff officers of good standing&mdash;for this task.</P>
    <P>In the first place, he should determine eligibility to hold a medical service card and then have an appeal to the manager.  But the manager will always be reluctant to reverse this week a decision made last week refusing the issue of a medical card.  I think he believes he would be letting himself down.  Many of us have from <Col N="844" /> time to time approached him with regard to the eligibility of people for medical service cards and invariably we are turned down.  He is reluctant to change his decision.  If there were an appeal from him to someone else for the purpose of determining eligibility, there would be greater satisfaction and less discontent and frustration in the minds of those who are borderline cases and who are refused these cards.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about a free choice of doctor.  If I interpret him correctly, I do not think he is against such a choice.  I hope he is not.  He did mention the difficulties; at times he has, of course, to act the devil's advocate.  He did mention the responsibility of the local authority, the Government and this House towards existing dispensary doctors. That is, I suppose, a real problem. As Deputy Donegan said, however, it is not an insurmountable problem.  It is desirable there should be a choice of doctor.  As far as rural areas are concerned, there is not much choice, because in the dispensary districts as a whole there is room for only one doctor, and he is usually the dispensary doctor.  I do not think Deputy O'Higgins's suggestion implies the holder of a medical service card being able to travel from Wexford to Donegal to a favourite doctor.  I do not think the Minister was serious when he put that forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I did not think so, but it was a reasonable interpretation to put on the phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was an unreasonable interpretation.  However, Deputy O'Higgins is well able to take care of himself.  I think he meant in the functional area of the local authority.  In the towns, of course, a choice of doctor would be desirable and practicable because in any sizable town there are usually quite a few doctors.  One thing we must never forget in the administration of a health scheme&mdash;the Minister himself emphasised the point&mdash;is the special relationship that exists between the doctor and the patient.  There are at the moment holders of cards who deny themselves the necessaries of life in <Col N="845" /> order to go to a special doctor of their choice.  They may be hypochondriacs, but hypochondriacs are often sicker people than those with, perhaps, bad hearts.  From that point of view, the Minister should consider very seriously a scheme under which there would be a choice of doctor.  Such a scheme has worked out pretty well in the maternity and mother and child section.  I praised that scheme this morning.  I believe a similar scheme would work equally well in respect of ordinary ailments, though it will not be a simple matter to find a scheme.</P>
      <P>I referred this morning to a document we published in September, 1958. I do not know if the Minister got a copy of it.  I said that the scheme Deputy O'Higgins was adumbrating was almost a replica of the scheme the Labour Party issued in 1958.  What we contemplated then&mdash;it is what we contemplate today also&mdash;was not all health services being financed entirely from an insurance fund to which employers and employees would contribute. This fund would be over and above the present expenditure on health.  In 1958, it was estimated that fund would bring in about £5,500,000 on the basis of a contribution of 1/3d. per week from the employer and 1/3 per week from the employee, and a contribution from a self-employed person of approximately 1/6d. per week. They were the figures that seemed to be appropriate to such a scheme in September, 1958.  I do not propose to go into firm figures this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Committee would be wise to examine expenditure on the health services.  I cannot say if there is waste; I cannot say whether money could be saved.  It seems to many people&mdash;mainly those who are critics of all health schemes&mdash;that we spend far too much on health.  I saw a leading article last week in which it was stupidly suggested that we should devote a good deal of this money to productive enterprises.  I do not think one should waste time answering an argument of that sort.  It seems to me there are no greater productive agents in this country than ordinary men and women.  If we do not protect them and their children, production will suffer as a consequence. <Col N="846" /> Money invested in health schemes is money well spent.  We have not over-stepped ourselves in expenditure on health.  Indeed, in recent years, the tendency has been to spend less proportionately of our tax revenue on both health and social welfare. It is wrong for anyone to allege that there is an increase every year in expenditure on health services.  It may appear to be a little more, but, related to national income and tax revenue, it is a diminishing figure, by a very small amount, admittedly, each year.  I do not think we need be too conservative when there is such need to relieve our people of the burdens they now undoubtedly bear in relation to health services.</P>
    <P>One of the principal objections to the inclusion of the middle income group seems to be that, whilst medical attention would not entail any great increase in health expenditure, the high cost of admitting the middle income group would be represented by the high cost of drugs and medicines. The argument seems to be that the dispensary doctor is available to visit the patient or have the patient visit him at the dispensary or clinic.  If, however, prescriptions, drugs and appliances are included, that would entail a considerable increase in expenditure on the part of the local authority and the State.  Some time ago, we had a discussion here on the high cost of drugs.  I think we were all agreed that costs are too high. Whilst this is not really the responsibility of the Minister for Health, he should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to discover whether or not there is justification for the universal criticism of the high cost of drugs.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins complained this morning that many of these up-to-date drugs are not available in the dispensaries. That is true.  I know cases in which the holders of medical cards had to buy their own drugs and medicines. I wonder how long is it since the requisition lists for medicines and medical appliances were revised.  I should like to know whether or not dispensary doctors are empowered to order these drugs that are so beneficial in curing ailments in a very short time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> I do not think it is true to say, either, that holders of medical cards can have the same attention as those who can afford to pay for the best that money can buy in medicine and health cures.  The wonder drugs which can be purchased at the chemist's shop at very high prices can have a wonderful and very quick effect.  The same sort of drugs and medicines are not handed out in the dispensaries.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he did not like to generalise.  I have here a concrete example, which is the only kind of example he will consider.  I have evidence of a man, who is the holder of a medical service card, who went to see his doctor to get some tablets prescribed for him from a hospital in Dublin where he had been for a number of weeks.  The dispensary doctor said he did not have them.  These tablets were essential for the man's cure.  He had to go to the local chemist and buy these tablets at a total cost of £13 3s. 3d.  I assume this man was on sickness benefit.  I do not think it is fair, therefore, for the Minister to generalise and assume that all the dispensaries are well equipped.</P>
    <P>It is the function of the local authority to see that they are.  I remember many years ago being in several dispensaries throughout the country and I discovered that there was practically nothing in them.  That is the doctor's fault to a very great extent because I know that all he need do is to fill in on his requisition list anything he cares to order and within the confines of that list, it will be supplied to him.  It is something the Minister should check on to ensure, as he said this morning, that the situation will be such that all the modern drugs available will be available to those people who are at present catered for in the lower income group under the present health services.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the difficulty of collecting contributions under an insurance fund from various types of people, self-employed people, farmers and the like.  Again, I do not think that would be an insurmountable obstacle in the implementation of an <Col N="848" /> insurance scheme.  After all, there is no difficulty in collecting income tax from those who pay it; there is no difficulty in collecting the fee for the radio licence, the television licence or for any of these licences which people are required to buy from year to year. If the self-employed person wants to pay yearly, I do not think there will be any difficulty in collecting it.  There are many agents of local authorities employed all over the functional areas of these local authorities&mdash;rate collectors, rent collectors and home assistance officers.  I do not think it would be impossible to devise an administrative scheme whereby these funds would be collected by some of these people.</P>
    <P>We want to impress upon the Minister the importance of the amendment put down in the names of the members of the Labour Party.  We have had a lot of experience in this country.  Older men with much more experience than I, have experience of the establishment of committees of inquiry and commissions. The most famous one of all was the Emigration Commission which, I think, outlived three Governments. Far be it from me to suggest that the Minister wants to put this on the long finger.  The Taoiseach yesterday seemed to be anxious at least to establish the committee.  I should also like to see evidence of his anxiety to see that they will do their work within a limited time.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is an impossibility. We have asked in the amendment that this Committee should report by the 30th June, 1962.  Assuming that the Dáil accepts the Minister's amendment, I do not think it unreasonable that the Committee should report to the Minister or the Government within a period of seven months.  It is not the type of Committee the members of which are employed in other capacities.</P>
    <P>The personnel of the Commission on Workmen's Compensation and the Commission on Unemployment and Emigration was such that the members had other businesses.  They had many other functions to perform in their business and in their private lives. Here&mdash;quite rightly&mdash;the Minister suggests a Committee of 19 members <Col N="849" /> of this House.  I presume that the Committee of Inquiry will conduct its operations in this House or in some Government building adjacent to it.  I do not think that any of the Parties will take exception to their absence from the House while engaged on that important work.  It seems, therefore, that they can do their work expeditiously and bring in a report within the time stipulated in our amendment.</P>
    <P>A very good example of that is the manner in which the Electoral Law Reform Committee operated for the past one or two years.  They brought in three or four reports.  They showed themselves to be a very efficient body. Their reports seemed to have been very valuable to the Minister for Local Government.  As I say, these will be members who can be practically full time on the job when Dáil Éireann sits and on other occasions as well.</P>
    <P>They are not approaching the subject of the inquiry as people who do not know anything about the matter.  They are members of this House and I assume that many of them will be members of local authorities.  They will have practical experience of the working of the Health Act.  They will be able to give direct and concise evidence and will be able to requisition the witnesses referred to and who may be called.  They will be able to call for the necessary information and papers suggested in the amendment. We, therefore, ask the Minister, if this Committee is set up, to apply a time limit, if not, for its full report, at least for a preliminary report.  It was suggested this morning that six or seven months would be too short a time.  We believe that 30th June, 1962, will give the Committee adequate time to consider the whole administration of the Health Act and report.</P>
    <P>I think it is also important that the Minister should consult personally with those responsible for the administration of the Health Act in the country, to wit, the county managers.  They seem to be in some particular difficulty in applying the Health Act in their various areas.  Perhaps, the Minister could give them some help on that.  He could ease their minds.  Many of them seem <Col N="850" /> to be ultra-conservative, as far as the health services are concerned.  We therefore, suggest that in the meantime the local authorities, who in this case are the county managers, should be asked to apply the Act more generously than they seem to have been doing during the past four or five years.  The Health Act is important to many people, especially to those families who have been unfortunate enough to suffer illness and to have some member of their family at various times ill or in hospital or having to undergo an operation for which they have to pay very heavily.  It does not make any difference to the healthy family if they have not a medical card; they do not need it.  But I wonder has the Minister and the House an appreciation of what it means when a member of a family falls sick and the head of the household has not a medical service card.</P>

      <P>May I put this to the Minister?  All the Deputies are in town now.  Nevertheless, it is proposed that the House will not sit tomorrow, although, of course, Friday is a normal sitting day.  The House can sit on Friday of next week and dispose of this motion.  If the setting up of this Committee is as urgent as the Taoiseach said yesterday, is there any real difficulty in the House sitting on Friday of next week, providing in the interregnum adequate time for discussion of the motion, and on Friday of next week we can all go home feeling satisfied that a Committee can be set up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The real fact about this motion is that there is no urgency about is, as far as the Minister is concerned. His amendment to the responsible motion of Deputy O'Higgins was simply a device to save himself and his Government from embarrassment. They are in a delicate situation and if by indulging in a pageful of verbiage at which the Minister is so expert, he could get out of a tight corner, it was well worth doing and today's debate, if it never concluded, would be completely to the satisfaction of the Minister for Health in particular and of his Government in general because the longer the vital decisions are postponed, the easier it is for the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>There is one matter which I will get rid of in the first instance, not because I think it is more important but because it is very necessary to tidy our minds in order to tidy the debate. That is why I address my first remarks to the irresponsible amendment of the Minister for Health.  What does it amount to?  It asks 19 backbenchers of this House to sit down and do the work of the Minister for Health and his Department.  Never, I believe, in the history of parliamentary democracy, of democratic government, has any Minister had the cheek of the Minister for Health to abdicate his responsibilities while holding on to the crown and the throne and the profits of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> His Department, one would think, would try to keep itself advised of the operation of the health services; his Department, one would think, would be aware of the complaints voiced against the present health services; his Department, one would think, would know to the precise penny how much our existing services cost and should be capable of estimating what additional or alternative services would cost.  It is nothing but sheer rubbish and window-dressing, shameful conduct on the part of the Minister for Health, to ask 19 backbenchers of this House to direct the operations of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to carry out his duties of office, we will not ask him to stay one moment longer than the time he is prepared to hand in his seal.  The amendment is an indication that he is not prepared to consider the matter, that he is not prepared to receive grouses and complaints, that he is not prepared to carry out any improvement because his amendment, stripped of the verbiage, amounts to calling upon this Select Committee&mdash;useful word that, &ldquo;select&rdquo;&mdash;the selected 19 stooges, to say that all is well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>We will cross that bridge when this House decides that the bridge is to be there.  In any case, what is this Committee that the Minister wants?  It is a trap.  I am surprised at the Labour Party falling into it to the extent of putting down an amendment. It is a trap and no more.  It is an effort to get all Parties in this House represented on a Committee on which Fianna Fáil will have a majority which will issue a majority report saying all is well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an effort by a dyed-in-the-wool Tory, with no respect for the ordinary decencies of debate, who insists on interrupting people who are driving points home, particularly when they hurt him, to prevent this <Col N="855" /> country getting from any Party or any Government the health services which any decent democracy would long since have had.</P>
      <P>If the Committee is set up and if it were to function and bring in the type of report which the Minister would see that his Party hacks brought in, it will prevent all Parties from making any further criticism of health services. That is all the device the Minister is putting forward will achieve.  It will put a muzzle on those who are dissatisfied because it will be said that 19 wise men, representing all shades of thought, fresh from a general election, found that all was well, or at least that if all was not well, most of it was and only a few amendments were required.  That is why I hope Deputies will not fall into this trap. They should know that the gentleman who tabled this amendment is cleverer than most and he did not put this down because he was genuinely concerned about the health services, but simply because he wants to prevent any further criticism of himself or of his Department.</P>
      <P>I wonder, if this Committee were established, what would be the reaction of the Minister for Health, if in exercise of the power which the Minister seeks to have conferred on it, under paragraph 7&mdash;to look into &ldquo;such other matters related to the health services as the Committee think fit&rdquo;&mdash;it were to inquire into the shameful row between the Minister for Health and the Irish Medical Association. One can imagine how the Minister would bristle in the Custom House, if the Committee were to send for persons and papers involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who is the cause of that dispute is the Minister. Can you imagine the Minister coming before the committee of 19 to be questioned and queried, if the Minister were unlucky enough to find me a member of that Committee?  Can you imagine him civilly or helpfully <Col N="856" /> replying to a question from a Fine Gael back bencher like myself concerning this dispute between himself and the I.M.A.?</P>
      <P>Let us see how helpful could the work of that Committee be in the light of the condition of the Department of Health and the Minister in particular, since he assumed office in 1957.  All the indications are that if the Committee were to be set up, it would meet with nothing but obstruction and abuse from the Minister and those subject to his direction.  Until such time as there is a healthier atmosphere in the Department of Health&mdash;if I may use the phrase without seeming to make a pun&mdash;there is no point in 19 members of this House, be they stooges or wise men, trying to direct the Minister for Health on to the path he should be able to find for himself. On that account, I ask the House to reject the Minister's amendment.  Likewise, the Labour Party's amendment, while well-intentioned, is, for the fundamental reason that the Committee will be unable to work or make useful suggestions, rather pointless and not worthy of support, either.</P>
      <P>The health services have been discussed at some considerable length. Perhaps the most useful criticism of the health services, the most concise and objective criticism we have heard for some considerable time, has come today from the Fine Gael Front Benches, from Deputy O'Higgins.  He is a person intimately associated with an effort to operate the 1953 Health Act.  This House and the country will recall that there was only one political Party which was tooth and nail against the Fianna Fáil blue card Health Act of 1953 and that was the Fine Gael Party.  It gives us very little consolation to say in 1961: &ldquo;we told you so.&rdquo;  We told Fianna Fáil; we told the Labour Party; we told the Independents who supported it, that it was an Act which would collapse in the hands of those trying to administer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe you cannot graft on to a 19th century pauper relief system a modern health service required by the social conscience of the 20th century. Unless and until all Parties and all <Col N="857" /> individuals in this State accept that as a fundamental prerequisite of our new health services, there is no use setting up committees of 19 and sending for papers and persons to inquire into the shortcomings of the existing system. It has to be removed altogether because it is fundamentally wrong.  It appears that no Party except Fine Gael are prepared to do that and it seems to me that an effort will be made to patch, to make wind and water tight, a structure which needs to be completely demolished.  On that account, we cannot hope for any reform until we remove from the statute book the inadequate and wrongly-based health legislation we have.</P>
    <P>The most important deficiency in the health services is that very many people receive no assistance, or insufficient assistance, towards the cost of sickness.  In all ages and times, sickness has been a very expensive thing to cure, but there are many illnesses that can be cured in the course of time at a low financial cost.  There is, however, a considerable cost to the nation where a large number of people are ill.  It is extraordinary that the Minister accepts that fact in relation to dental caries but is not prepared to accept it in relation to any other aspect of health. He believes in slowly poisoning the people so that they will keep working until they die from fluorine poisoning, but otherwise does not try to keep them at work because he is not concerned if those outside the blue card bracket are unable to provide the necessary drugs to cure themselves quickly.</P>
    <P>Apparently it is of no concern to the State to bring about speedy cures at a time when medical science has advanced so much and when there are many speedy but costly drugs available. As Deputy Corish and Deputy O'Higgins emphasised, the cost of many of these drugs is prohibitive and their cost has increased since 1953 when the present Health Act was passed.  It is foolish in this day and age to be confining our assistance and our benefits to dispensary treatment and to hospitalisation when in fact you could considerably reduce the cost of hospitalisation if you cured people at home.  People could be cured at home if the State were to give assistance to <Col N="858" /> the people in the provision of necessary drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>Another great shortcoming of our health services is surely the fact that those who contribute most towards the scheme receive no benefit, or little benefit, from the services.  That appears to me to be fundamentally wrong.  Ill-health is something which people should be encouraged to insure against but those who provide the money to insure others against the cost of sickness are themselves deprived of any benefit under existing schemes.  It seems to me that if by an all round small increase we can bring a much greater number within the scheme, then it is socially and economically justifiable.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the dispensary service in cities.  It is wholly unnecessary to have such a person as a dispensary doctor in cities and large towns and large centres of population where an ample number of doctors are available.  Even more idiotic is the situation which exists in Dublin in which some dispensary doctors' districts in the centre of the city may have only two patients for every five or seven patients in neighbouring parishes.  That situation exists in Corporation housing estates where a house-holder must have at least three children before he gets a house and where, as the family expands over the years, you have plenty of households in which you have anything from five to 12 people entitled to benefit under a blue card.  But in the centre of the city, in the older parts, you may have in a similar area much fewer large families but several elderly people living on their own.  We have a farcical situation in which dispensary doctors receive the same salary and are supposed to be giving the same service, while in one place they are called upon to attend to 1,000 people and in another to attend to 3,000 or 4,000 people.</P>
    <P>Such a system is obviously very wrong.  It is no answer for the Minister for Health to say that these are matters for the local authority.  The whole structure is wrong.  It is not a distribution of responsibility; it is a <Col N="859" /> distribution of irresponsibility, with one group passing the buck to the other. It is the people who should be receiving the benefit who are suffering.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this matter, as I am sure many other Deputies have, with dispensary doctors and with doctors other than dispensary doctors. I have discussed it particularly with ordinary general practitioners who have acted as <i>locum</i> for dispensary doctors while the latter have been ill or on holidays.  Every <i>locum</i> to whom I have spoken has told me one could not possibly give even reasonable medical attention, not to speak of diagnostic attention, to persons in a dispensary.  Where a doctor has to get through anything from 60 to 200 patients in two hours, he cannot possibly give them the medical attention which any Christian society ought to give.  So long as we continue a dispensary system which was created in times of famine, without making much improvement on it, we will not give to the needy people the medical attention so important for them.</P>
    <P>Another drawback of dispensary service lies in the fact that there are plenty of working men who are ill or in need of medical attention but not unemployed because of ill health.  The only way they can get medical attention is to stay off work for the purpose of attending the dispensary in the morning.  If these men try to continue to work, we should encourage them to do so.  If they try to keep off the rates, to keep off making claims on social welfare, what is the result?  They have to go along to a general practitioner at night time.  Unless they pay, they are denied the attention which ought to be theirs because of their anxiety to continue working and not be malingering with a sore thumb or a sore finger.</P>
    <P>The Minister will answer that that can be answered by widening the dispensary service to include the night-time.  He is partly right.  But the Minister is facing this whole question of amending health legislation by starting off on the completely wrong premise that all that is needed to be done is to improve our existing health services. Quite clearly what is needed is the <Col N="860" /> abandonment of the basis upon which our present hopelessly inadequate health services are founded.  If we do that we will make progress along the right lines.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a wonderful man for telling us all how to behave ourselves. If we argue from the general to the particular, he says he is not going to consider policy according to a particular case.  If we recite our main grievances in regard to the Health Act, he says he is not prepared to listen to generalisations, but wants particular cases.  If Deputies go to him with particular cases and they are not couched in the extremely unctuous terms he considers necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he will reject them or he will refuse to consider them and refer the person to the appropriate health authority.  Again, speaking from what dispensary doctors have said and from the experience of people concerned with the matter, it is common knowledge that dispensaries do not stock many of the drugs prescribed by doctors and that many patients are given substitutes.  If they refuse to accept the substitutes, then there is a long rigmarole on paper while a message is transmitted to the Health Authority headquaters and then back to the dispensary, and by the time all that wire tapping, wire-pulling and message sending takes place, the poor patient could well have died.</P>
      <P>I have been informed in confidence by a medical doctor here that three cases have come to his knowledge within the past year in which an ordinary general practitioner, not a man in a dispensary, has been summoned out of his bed at night for three different cases of heart attack, and in each of those cases the collapse of the patient was due to the fact that the dispensary gave out the wrong drugs. That is a very serious thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an allegation of inefficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely hard to place the responsibility for the issue of <Col N="861" /> the proper drugs in those cases. Medical men, being medical men, are not always willing to complain about these things so long as the patient does not die; and if the patient dies, the mistake will probably be buried with him.  These things are happening and will continue to happen so long as you have such impersonal inefficiency as the present service permits.</P>
      <P>Another fundamental fault in relation to the health service is that it calls upon people to provide for their ill health, not when they are healthy and working but when they are sick, indisposed and not working.  The Minister, being a good Tory, might be expected to say that people ought to provide for themselves against a rainy day and that they ought to protect themselves against the contingency of ill health.  What is the situation at the moment?  Nobody knows whether or not he is going to be liable for the cost of medical attention.  How on earth can you insure yourself against a contingency when you do not know what that contingency may be, how much it will cost or whether it will arise or not?</P>
      <P>It is our common experience that people come to us to know whether they are entitled to the blue card and, if not, whether they are entitled to some assistance towards the cost of hospitalisation.  I have yet to find a Minister, any official of his Department, or any city or county manager who can say what is the income, ceiling or floor, as far as blue cards are concerned.  Yet the Minister is going to ask this unfortunate Committee of 19 to do what his Department and all the local authorities refuse to do, because they are unable to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being the case, I would ask that the House would reject the Minister's amendment and would accept the responsible and clearly justified proposition which Deputy T. F. O'Higgins has put before it and the country.  This is a scheme which he explained in the course of the general election campaign and which the Minister for Health tried to confuse in the course of that campaign.  He tried to confuse it here again today.  This is a matter which goes far beyond <Col N="862" /> Party loyalties and it is one for the country to decide.</P>
    <P>We believe that this Select Committee of 19 should not try to confuse the issue and try to give the impression to the Irish people that it will be impossible readily to amend the existing health services which we believe certainly could be done if we introduced a comprehensive insurance scheme which would cost only about another 1/6d. per week on each worker and each employer.</P>
    <P>Within this scheme, 85 per cent. of our people would be given a free choice of doctor, of general practitioner in their own homes, and they would have free hospitalisation without the necessity of the 10/- a day levy.  That would end the ludicrous position which now so frequently arises, and of which I have some intimate experience, in which a man seriously injured, and perhaps crippled, had to go down three flights of stairs in a hospital, and up a hill on crutches, for the purpose of getting a 2/6d. stamp, before he could get medical attention.  Let us make away with all this cod and unnecessary paper work and introduce the Fine Gael health scheme which is long overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we have here in this particular session of the Dáil a wonderful mad scramble by the Government and the main Opposition Parties to put down proposals and amendments towards the betterment of our health services.  That is a great achievement and one which I welcome.  I do not mind who improves our health services so long as someone does.</P>
      <P>I have had the opportunity of reading Deputy O'Higgins's contribution concerning the provision of an insurance scheme.  I may be wrong, but my feeling, from what I read of it, is that it does not substantially or appreciably advance the health services which we at present enjoy.  It strikes me as being an ill-thought out, scrappy patchwork of ill-digested social objectives, held together by the dictates of political expediency.  I think it is ill-thought out because if the proposer of the motion were anxious to give our people the same standards of health services, then without looking beyond the four corners of our own country, he would not find better examples than there are within our own service, that is, that our health services should be extended on the free, no means test principle on which our tuberculosis services, our fever hospital services, and our ante-natal services are founded.</P>
      <P>I do not think he made any case for the suggestion that we should abandon that principle.  He had no justification for the abandonment of that principle and, in fact, no matter what Minister is in office in the Department of Health, the wonderful achievements of those services cannot be clouded.  If they wanted to achieve what they profess they want to achieve, that is, an equitable standard of health services for everyone, they would have got rid, once and for all, of the two-tiered service we have had in the country since the late 19th century, with only minor ameliorations and changes here and there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why has no case been made on ethical grounds, on administrative grounds, on medical grounds, or on <Col N="866" /> any other plausible grounds, for the abandonment of a free, no-means test principle and the installation of this absurd proposal concerning the use of insurance?  Deputy O'Higgins gave voice to a number of the war cries which one hears from Tory and Conservative politicians, in this and every other country, concerning the attitude of our people to paternalism and the rejection of State interference with self-reliance and the dangers of undermining that self-reliance, if we give too much protection and too many social services.</P>
    <P>This is certainly an advance.  Even if it is step by step and taken at ten yearly intervals, it is still an advance on the war cries of about ten years ago when the proposition of free health services was anathematised in this House and outside it.  At least we have succeeded in dragging them so much further forward into the 20th century that they now accept that free medical general health services are essential in a properly organised modern society.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins strikes me as being a very confused man on this question of paternalism and State interference.  Deputy Ryan talked about the principle of people putting by for the rainy day, providing for ill-health when it turned up.  Every citizen in this State is putting by for the rainy day when he pays taxation; a very high percentage of our people pay direct taxation and every man, woman and child in the country pays indirect taxation.  Every man and woman in this State pays indirect taxation in respect of bread, butter, tea, sugar, intoxicating liquor, tobacco, cigarettes and in numerous other ways.</P>
    <P>An increasing amount of money in the form of indirect taxation is paid by the mass of the people.  They pay for the rainy day.  A very high percentage of the people also pay for the rainy day in the form of rates, for old age, for the education of their children for the time when they may fall ill. These are all insurance contributions, insurance payments.  They are taking no charity from anyone for any services.  Any services provided by any Minister, whether social welfare, health, education or any other, are <Col N="867" /> paid for out of money taken out of the ordinary people's pockets.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, you have this conservative approach, that we do not like State paternalism, that the people like to pay for these things.  When you say it is a free service, they say everybody pays, but then when they want to talk about State paternalism, they say there is no Father Christmas State which can provide money for everything. You know well the difference between the two and you know quite well that that is the type of insurance produced by conservative politicians at a time when they are under pressure to make some advance in the provision of social services to meet modern needs.  That is the only reason, a reason of political expediency, that has brought Fine Gael into this House to-day with this proposal because they know quite well, and the Minister knows, too, that probably the greatest issue in Irish public life at the present time is the improvement and betterment of our health services.</P>
    <P>When I hear this kind of confused mumbling by these politicians, I do not know whether to put it down to foolishness, ignorance or to a deliberate attempt to confuse the electorate on these points, telling them they do not like these free services.  All right. I have done this before and I shall now do it again.  Why did Fine Gael not fight the last election on the proposition that the free services we have here at the moment should be scrapped because the Irish people do not want these services?  Fine Gael believe the Irish people do not want a free tuberculosis service so we shall scrap that and establish it on an insurance basis.  Fine Gael do not believe in free children's allowances so we shall scrap those and establish an inane or idiotic form of insurance.  The Irish people do not like free primary education so in order to restore our self-respect from the advanced stage of erosion it has suffered because of these free services over the years, we shall introduce some kind of insurance contribution so that we can get that free primary education for our children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> In that way, we have put the stiff poker into the backs of the Irish people and made them stand up and hold their heads high.  What arrant rubbish is this!  Fine Gael know quite well that the Irish people are very proud of and pleased with their free services.  If anybody dared to lay their hands on them, he would not last for 24 hours in public life.  They know that our people here have free services, that our people in the Six Counties, who are also Irish men and women, have free services.  See how many of them opt out of the free health services in the North of Ireland because they are afraid it will undermine their independence, their individuality or their moral fibre. Show me a dozen people in the whole of the North of Ireland who are not availing of their health services because of an alleged threat to their independence, and I will certify them.</P>
    <P>Deputies know quite well that this applies to every one of our people in Great Britain enjoying the free national health services there.  How many of them opt out of the services? There is this extraordinary chauvinistic attitude that we are rather different from the English, the Scots, the Welsh, the Scandinavians, the Swiss, the New Zealanders and the Australians.  There is this idea that we are superior to these other people, that we are a kind of <i>herrenvolk</i> living here in Ireland who have nothing but contempt for these free services.</P>
    <P>Is it not time to stop foisting this absurd rubbish on the Irish people, trying to suggest to them that there is something noble about paying 1/9d. for penicillin or some other drug when it costs 3/6d., that in so doing, you have done a great job for Ireland, that you have established your manhood, your right to be the father of a family.  Our people are not as easily fooled as they used to be about these things.  They see their friends and relations coming back from Britain; they see the wonderful success of the free services here at home and in Great Britain and they will not thank the Fine Gael Brains Trust for sitting down and worrying itself.  The mountain laboured and brought forth a mouse.  If ever there was a mouse, it <Col N="869" /> is this scheme brought here today by Deputy O'Higgins and the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>We heard during the election of the anathematising of the means test, this vexatious means test.  If a means test is vexatious, get rid of it.  Why talk about the vexatious means test and then bring in a scheme in which there is still retained a means test for quite a proportion of the people?  I do not care whether it is 75 per cent. or 7 per cent. of the people who have to undergo the means test.  I do not think they should have to undergo it.  I am not concerned with a proportion of our people; I am concerned with social justice for all our people.  That is what has been wrong with our health services over the years.  They satisfied themselves that a minority were well cared for and the rest could fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>In spite of the condemnation of the dispensary principle by Deputy O'Higgins, in spite of his condemnation of all the admitted faults, serious faults, of the old poor law system, he made no serious or substantial attempt to ameliorate or improve or better the position.  I believe that the simplest form of insurance collection&mdash;and I am heartened by the thought that the Minister for Health subscribes to the same view and I hope it will help the Committee, if it is established, to know that they will have his goodwill on this particular point&mdash;is income tax, through the Revenue Commissioners or through the rates.  Because of that, it is the ideal way to base any of these services, particularly a health service.</P>
    <P>If you have an insurance scheme, you have the position where, first of all, you have to establish a separate bureaucracy in order to try to organise and run the scheme and see to the collection of the insurance contributions. The Minister dealt with the difficulty of collecting these contributions. No detailed attempt was made by Deputy O'Higgins to say how it was to be done, how many new rate collectors were to be provided to go around counting the chickens, the turkeys, the cocks of hay and the <Col N="870" /> cattle in the byre in order to decide whether a valuation was £15, £15 1s. 6d., £15 2s. 6d. or £15 5s.  Is that not the great difficulty of the present position and the means test?  Is that not the thing Fine Gael at the election promised to see to?</P>
    <P>I think the Minister was right.  If Fine Gael had given detailed information about this scheme at the time of the election, they would have been wiped out completely.  There is the thought that the country would be flooded with supernumerary rate collectors and investigations of one kind or another in order to try to make this scheme work, to decide who was a small farmer and who was not a small farmer.  I do not know what arrangements were to be made for the collection of the insurance contribution from the self-employed person.  I do not know how the village blacksmith, and so on, would go about making available his 6/6d. or his 5/6d. or whatever it might be a week that he would have to find for insurance.</P>
    <P>I think it is wrong and inequitable in an insurance scheme that the wealthiest person in the State pays 6/- or 7/- and the poor person pays the same.  Take the person in the upper income group.  I do not know what ceiling was mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins.  I did not see it referred to in his speech.  However, the person at the upper peak of the income level included in his compulsory insurance scheme pays the same contribution as the person at the lowest level.  I think that is wrong and inequitable.  I favour the taxation system because the individual pays only what he can afford to pay and that is assessed by detached individuals in the Revenue Commissioners' offices who have a certain code on which they act.  We all know about it and we are all reasonably sure it acts reasonably fairly.  That cannot be said for the insurance contribution.</P>
    <P>It seems absurd that a person with £1,000 a year should get a service for the same weekly contribution as a person, say, on £300 a year.  Again, it must be a scheme based on the parents and a family, with contributions in respect of each member of the family.  That would seem to mean <Col N="871" /> that the bigger the family, the greater the contribution and the greater the hardship on the big family.  That is wrong.  The big family should be helped and not penalised.  If you are to have an actuarially sound insurance scheme, it is very difficult to organise it so that the person who has a large family will be helped by the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The other point raised by the Minister is a valid point&mdash;the question of the number of stamps on a card.  At what stage is a person eligible for the service?  How is an individual to know when he joins a service like this that he will not have to get his appendix out or that he will not get an attack of pneumonia or something else, before he has a certain number of stamps on his card?  If he has not enough stamps, as many of us find in our dealings with our constituents concerning pensions, and so on, what will happen? Suppose the requisite number of stamps is 136, if he has only 135 stamps, he does not get the service.  If a person has two stamps less than the number laid down in the scheme, what will happen to him?  Does he get a less efficient service?  Does he get cheaper drugs?  Does he have a fifth-class surgeon?</P>
    <P>If there is not discrimination of that kind, then it does not matter a damn how many contributions he has paid or if he has none at all.  If you give him the same standard of service, out of mercy or human consideration or whatever it is, no matter how many stamps he has, then there is no virtue in having the optimum number of stamps.  How are you to decide it?</P>
    <P>One of the most sinister aspects of this scheme is the overnight acclamation from the I.M.A. for the propositions. They will back these schemes and these propositions for insurance schemes of one kind or another: of course, they will.  This proposition emanated from the I.M.A. many years ago.  Anybody who knows their record of obscurantist obstruction over the years against the efforts for an improvement in our health services must view with the greatest suspicion any approval by the Medical Association. <Col N="872" /> As soon as any such proposition is put forward by a Deputy he should look over his shoulder to see where he has gone wrong in his decision on how to operate the health services.</P>
    <P>The scheme has this wonderful quality from the point of view of the Medical Association.  It excludes the plutocrat&mdash;the &ldquo;bloody plutocrat&rdquo;, as Deputy O'Higgins curiously described him: I would not think that he would feel like that about him.  Fifteen per cent. of them are excluded from the scheme.  They are told they can have the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  I do not understand the mentality that divides our society into those who are compelled to insure themselves and those who are left to graze in the paddock by themselves without any dictation at all.  However, Deputy O'Higgins says the plutocrats can avail of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  The great virtue for the Medical Association in that proposition is that the 15 per cent. can buy their medicine.  I am not worried that they are not included in the compulsory scheme.  It is not a matter of principle with me at all.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the ordinary worker and the ordinary man in the street whom we are trying to help. What will happen when you leave out 15 per cent. of the plutocrats, as Deputy O'Higgins describes them, is that you will get, like honey bees around a hive, anybody whose work is sought at all in medicine and in surgery congregating around these 15 per cent., all spending all their time, technical skill and knowledge working on these people because they will be paid well to do it, because they will get fee for service.  The sky is the limit; they can ask anything they want.  I do not mind that.  They are welcome to what they can get out of these people. However, I mind the fact that they will be spending their time, energy and skill taking out an ingrowing toe-nail or some of these varicose ulcers, and so on, when they should be using their great skill and energy in working on our people who are in the insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>I believe that will be one of the side effects of leaving out even a <Col N="873" /> minority&mdash;but a wealthy minority&mdash;in any proposed scheme as suggested here by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The question to which I consider I received an unsatisfactory reply from the Minister for Local Government yesterday was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government if in view of the serious position in Dublin County where a very large number of families live with relatives in county council cottages he will give favourable consideration to the amendment of the existing regulations whereby the local authority could rehouse these families and at the same time qualify for the full rate of subsidy of 66? per cent.</P>
      <P>I put down that question because I was seriously concerned about a longstanding problem which exists in County Dublin, a problem which I see no effort being made to solve.  Recently, we made a survey in ten areas in which we proposed to build houses in the near future and, in those ten areas, no fewer than 83 families live under the conditions which I describe in this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's reply he states that it is a breach of housing regulations to have this type of sub-tenant and that these people should be encouraged to rehouse themselves.  I know it is a breach but I also know that it is the most natural thing in the world for a father to take in a married son or daughter with or without a family when they have no alternative accommodation. That is what has given rise to the deplorable position with which we are confronted in County Dublin.  I know the local authority can house these people by accepting from the Minister a one-third subsidy in place of a two-thirds subsidy, but I should like to explain to the Minister that in County Dublin we have an <Col N="874" /> enormous housing problem outside this special problem to which I have drawn his attention and we are doing what we can to solve it.  It will result in an enormous increase in County Dublin rates if we are to solve it within a reasonable time and meet the reasonable housing needs of the people.</P>
    <P>There are special circumstances here, as the Minister knows; we have a constant stream of people from the country into the Dublin area and it is my view that we shall always have a problem of housing the working class people in County Dublin.  In view of the fact that the housing problem has been largely solved in rural Ireland, where I think the position now is that there are more empty houses than tenants can be found for, the Minister's Department has been relieved of the problem of housing people in rural Ireland, and in those circumstances I think he should consider the special position which exists.</P>
    <P>I put it to him that a family living in over-crowded conditions in a council house as a sub-tenant is no less a housing need than a family living in similar conditions in a non-council house.  Quite frankly, I find it difficult to understand why there is this discrimination of one-third and two-thirds. At present in County Dublin the Manager refuses to consider these people when new houses are built and the vast majority of members of the council are reluctant to house these people because of the enormous increase in the rates which would ensue. The result is that these people are left as they have been for years past. I know families with five sub-tenants and when new houses are built they are not, or cannot, be considered.  We are told they cannot be considered as long as there are people living in other houses which are regarded as unfit.  I know many of the houses that are regarded as unfit and they are palatial compared to the conditions in which some of the sub-tenants live in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>If we say these people cannot be housed out of council houses and if we have not alternative accommodation for them, we are really telling them that they have no right to marry. There is not a week in the year that <Col N="875" /> I have not had priests and other people coming to me about housing cases. I want the Minister, in the course of his reply, to say if he has any solution or in what way he proposes we should deal with the problem.  Not only have we a very big housing problem apart from this in County Dublin but we have embarked on very expensive schemes of sanitary services and regional supplies and many other such services.  These problems are probably peculiar to people in County Dublin at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard Deputy Clinton, all I want to say is that Dublin Corporation had a very similar problem, identical with that which he has described in County Dublin, and Dublin Corporation decided by a very large majority of members to house these people where it could be shown that their needs were greater than that of people resident elsewhere.  If Dublin Corporation can do it, I cannot see why Dublin County Council cannot do it.  We have the same manager for city and county.  Sometimes the elected representatives are unwilling to face up to their responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that Dublin Corporation have gone into the county area to carry out work that, to my mind, should be properly carried out by the county council.  I do not see why the county council should be making a case when Dublin Corporation decided to deal itself with a similar case.  The Deputy is, I think, largely wasting the time of the House. Yesterday I spoke on Deputy Dunne's motion.  The Minister has accepted that motion.  He told us that the whole question of housing is under review.  Yesterday I referred to subsidies generally.  I am quite sure the Minister is fully aware of all the problems. I do not think the problem the Deputy mentions is the most serious one confronting the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Clinton has said is quite correct.  I should like to take this opportunity of complimenting <Col N="876" /> him on his maiden speech. Some time ago either the Minister, or his predecessor, stated that, where there was more than one family living in a house, that house could be considered as overcrowded and, if that were so, it would qualify for the two-thirds subsidy.  I should like the Minister to tell us now if that is correct because, if it is correct, it will remove a great many of the difficulties confronting Deputy Clinton and Deputy Lemass.</P>
      <P>The trouble is that managers have a nasty habit of interpreting orders to suit themselves.  It is not correct to say that the housing problem has been dealt with completely in the rural areas.  The position in some areas is almost as bad as that in County Dublin.  I should like the Minister to state clearly whether he considers a house in which more than one family is living&mdash;I refer particularly to council houses&mdash;is overcrowded and the tenants eligible for a two-thirds subsidy house.  Another problem to which I should like to refer is that of a tenant living in a good house where there is no security of tenure and where they are plagued by this one-third subsidy.  Perhaps the Minister would look into that matter also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Clinton outlined the situation as he knows it in County Dublin.  One very definite opening remark he made was that this is a long-standing problem in County Dublin.  Up to 1958 there was a 60 per cent. subsidy available, almost indiscriminately, to every county council, including Dublin County Council.  That 60 per cent. subsidy was introduced in 1932.  If from 1932 to 1958 that subsidy was available and the problem is today of the magnitude that Deputy Clinton would have us believe, candidly I cannot see how increasing the subsidy by one-third or two-thirds will make the slightest difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an enlargement of the definition of agricultural worker to the point where everyone who worked for hire in rural Ireland was brought within the scope of that 60 per cent. <Col N="877" /> subsidy.  So wide was the application that county councils in many cases built more houses than were necessary to meet the priority classes for which this 60 per cent. was first instituted. They gave those houses to people who were better off and who were, perhaps, in a position to house themselves.  It is only since this high rate of 60 per cent. subsidy ceased that we find this problem presenting itself.  If county councils failed to take advantage of that high subsidy from 1932 to 1958 I fail to see how it can be contended now that an increased subsidy will make all the difference.</P>
    <P>It has also been said that a survey was made in ten areas in County Dublin and 83 families were found to be overcrowded because of subtenancies. I should not like Deputy Clinton, or any other Deputy, to take anything that I say as a reflection on him, or anyone else.  I want to encourage him as a county councillor to do something that I have been trying to get done for the past 18 months.  I want Dublin County Council to complete the survey I have been seeking since the middle of 1960. Dublin County Council are not the only offenders in this regard.  We must have a complete picture of the situation so that we can assimilate the facts and assess the position with a view to finding a remedy.  We are anxious to get rid of all bad housing conditions in the country.  Legally every housing authority should keep the survey up-to-date annually.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a managerial responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure whether it is a reserved function. Despite what some allege, the manager is the servant of the county council. That is how I regard him.  If he is not doing the work that should be done, it is up to the county council to take steps to ensure that the work is done. The fact is this survey has not been done for years.  Eighteen months ago we asked for it.  We have not got it yet.  Some of the urban authorities have made the survey.  I admit the task is somewhat easier in their case. The worst offenders are the housing <Col N="878" /> authorities which appear to need some new departure in their housing programmes. I appeal to local authorities generally to give us this information. It is ludicrous to expect a solution to be arrived at until we know exactly what the problem is.  We can only know that when we get this survey.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned that it is a breach of regulations for council tenants to take in sub-tenants.  It was said that there is nothing more natural than for a father to take in a married son or daughter.  I do not disagree that that is a natural tendency.  It is also a flagrant breach of the letting regulations. The fact that this breach is permitted is a reflection on county councils and housing authorities.  They make the regulations.  If they do not ensure that the regulations are kept and, by their neglect, allow a problem to develop to the point at which it becomes a matter of public outcry, then the responsibility is on their shoulders.  The only remedy suggested is to turn to the Department of Local Government and say: &ldquo;Give us higher subsidies and we will do the job.&rdquo;  My natural answer to that would be that if you cannot do it with 60 per cent., what can we expect for 66? per cent.?</P>
      <P>The assertion has been made by many people, not only Deputy Clinton &mdash;I am glad that Deputy Tully does not agree&mdash;that the housing problem in rural Ireland is practically solved. Its back has been broken but it is far from being solved.  Because of my conviction that that is so I have sought&mdash;and I am still strenuously seeking&mdash;this detailed survey which has yet to come to hand.  We want to have a complete look at the entire picture to see whether our building policies are sufficient to meet the need or whether some new device of policy must be brought into being in order to solve the entire problem in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also remarked that a family living in a council house would seem to have no less a claim for a house of their own.  That is, a family living as sub-tenants in a council house would seem to have no less a claim for a new tenancy of a house for themselves than if they were living as sub-tenants <Col N="879" /> in a private house.  Private houses and their owners are controlled.  Unfortunately, the housing authorities are uncontrolled.  When I say that, this is what I mean.  If a private house is being let and sub-tenanted by a family or a number of families and is at the point where conditions are bad, then the families or family from that subtenancy may be rehoused in a council house on the higher rate of subsidy but there is this difference.  Action can then be taken and is taken by the local housing authority to ensure one of a number of things&mdash;either the house is no longer so let in future, it is closed up or is demolished.  Therefore, there is no continuation of the conditions which up to then existed in that private house but the local authorities themselves who operate these bye-laws and laws in respect of preventing overcrowding and bad housing conditions in private houses will not and have not&mdash;and quite rightly so&mdash;operated in the same manner in respect of their own houses.</P>
    <P>One should ask why that is so but it is a fact.  That is the difference between sub-tenants in private houses and sub-tenants in council houses. We can and we do control the private houses and the owners are amenable to control but, in so far as our own housing is concerned in our housing authorities, we do not control ourselves as housing authorities and local authority housing is not amenable to the laws we apply ourselves in respect of the owners of private houses.</P>
    <P>The last question which Deputy Clinton asked is the one which is really relevant.  He asked if I had any remedy for the situation.  I cannot say at this stage that I have but, when I have got from our housing authorities throughout the country the complete survey that we are so eagerly and earnestly seeking, then and not until then will anybody in my position be placed in a situation in which it will be possible to give a direct answer to that question.  I hope to be in that position in the not too distant future. With the co-operation of the Deputies who are on the local authorities and housing authorities, possibly that <Col N="880" /> survey can be completed more readily than it appears to be going to be completed at the moment.  When we have that survey, then and not until then can we get down to the matter at issue.</P>
    <P>Despite what I say in justification of some of the developments that have taken place, I am not unsympathetic at all to the situation as I know it to exist.  I have given some reasons as to why it came to exist as it does and I have placed some of the blame but, while I have done that, I would be very sympathetic to this whole question of completing our housing programme and being in the situation of having all of our people finally in the position when it can be said that they are all properly housed under proper humanitarian conditions.  That is the only thing I can say in answer to the final matter in the Deputy's mind, which is the only matter of real importance at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that in the case of Dún Laoghaire Borough a similar amendment was permitted in the past to meet a similar situation?</P>

      <P>I would not go so far as that with the Deputy.  In fact, I am not quite clear on the circumstances adverted to by the Deputy.  I am quite satisfied that they are not similar to the problem we are discussing at the moment.  We want this survey done. I think any reasonable person will agree that in the absence of the details of what that survey is, no real assessment of the position can be undertaken and no real worthwhile policy can be evolved.  I wish to have the facts.  I should be happy to be in the position, when I have got them, to come here and say: &ldquo;Here is the remedy.&rdquo;  I hope to be in that position and, when the time comes, I hope to have the co-operation of people like Deputies Tully and Clinton to bring a measure through the House, if necessary, to solve the problem.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister or the Department agree that, where there are two families in a council cottage or in any three-roomed house, it is overcroweded for the purpose of <Col N="881" /> assessing?  I think the Minister's predecessor said that that was so.</P>

      <P>The answer there would depend upon the number of the families.  I do not think that would get the Deputy the information he wants.  It is the consequential operation that would take place that is of <Col N="882" /> essence in this question.  To say whether or not the house would be overcrowded is immaterial.  That does not determine whether the higher or the lower subsidy is payable.</P>
