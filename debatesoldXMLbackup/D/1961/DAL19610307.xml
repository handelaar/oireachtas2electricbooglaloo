      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's question refers to the reorganisation of certain dispensary districts in County Kildare. A revised scheme for the reorganisation of dispensary districts in the southern half of the county, submitted by the Kildare County Council to my Department some time ago, has been under examination by the Department in consultation with the local authority.  Examination of the scheme is nearing completion and I expect to be in a position to convey my decision on it to the local authority soon.  Before the scheme can be implemented, however, it will be necessary for me to make an Order under Section 51 of the Health Act, 1953, giving legal effect to the revision of the dispensary districts concerned. The requisite preliminaries for the making of this Order will take some <Col N="3" /> little time but they will be completed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will transfer applicants for unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit in the Greffey, Ardara, Dowros and Maas areas, County Donegal, from Dungloe employment exchange to Killybegs exchange, to which there are more transport facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Applicants for Unemployment Assistance and Unemployment Benefit from the areas mentioned reside over six miles from Dungloe <Col N="4" /> Employment Exchange and, therefore, have their applications dealt with entirely through the post unless, of course, they call to the Exchange at their own wish.  As these persons are also over six miles from the local office at Killybegs the position would be exactly the same if they were to be transferred to that office.  In view of this I do not see how the question of transport facilities can arise in this matter.</P>

      <P>It might be convenient to clarify one matter.  Deputy Norton has referred to the Constitution with reference to the census.  I gather from the Taoiseach's reply that he is quite satisfied that even though the new Bill has been introduced and is under discussion here at the time the census is being taken, it will create no constitutional problem.  That is the Taoiseach's opinion.  Does he propose to take the precaution of clearing this matter with the Supreme Court in the event of our consideration of the Bill extending beyond the date on which the census is taken?</P>

Whatever the results of the census may be, nevertheless on the day following the completion of the census there will be a new population figure.  It may be difficult to get, but it is in existence because of the fact that we determined the population in the country the previous day.  Is there any danger that, after going to all the trouble of passing this Bill, we may find that somebody else will plead in the court that this Bill is <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution, because at the time this House was discussing it there was a new census taken, and while we may not know the figures nevertheless the population figures are there and could be established?</P>

    <Title>Mental Treatment (Detention in Approved Institutions) Bill, 1961&mdash; Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to regularise the continued detention of a number of patients who were received into mental institutions as temporary patients.</P>
      <P>Chapter III of Part XIV of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, provides for the reception of temporary patients into mental institutions.  The maximum period of detention of such patients is six months, in the first instance, but Section 189 of the Act provides that where the chief medical officer of the institution becomes of opinion that the patient will not have recovered on the expiration of that period, the person in charge may request the Minister to extend the period and where the Minister, by order, so extends the period the patient may be retained in detention in the institution. The Minister may not make an order extending the period of detention by more than six months but, on subsequent requests, he may make further orders, subject to the provision that the aggregate period of detention may not exceed two years.  In recent years, requests for extensions of periods of detention number almost 3,000 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will appreciate, an application for an extension of the period of detention of a temporary patient cannot be made until it is clear that the patient will not have recovered within the then current authorised period of detention and consequently the application normally does not reach my Department until towards the end of that time.  In fact, it was necessary some years ago to ask hospital authorities to make their applications a fortnight before the current expiry date; but, despite this, it frequently happens that applications are received only a few days before the then current period of detention is due to expire.  There is thus a deadline <Col N="20" /> to meet in regard to every one of the sixty or so applications, on average, received each week, but notwithstanding this no slip-up occurred until recently.</P>
    <P>When an application for an extension is received in my Department, the previous papers in relation to the patient concerned are extracted and associated with the application.  The file of documents is then passed to the Inspector, or Assistant Inspector, of Mental Hospitals.  He examines the application and the previous papers and, if he is satisfied, recommends the grant of the extension.  A draft of an order covering a number of extensions is then prepared.  The draft is examined by a senior officer who certifies that he has personally seen the applications for extensions and the necessary certificates from an appropriate medical officer of each of the institutions in which the patients are detained.  The draft order, accompanied by the certificate of the senior officer, then comes to me, as Minister, for signature.  When the order has been signed the institutions concerned are notified as to the extensions granted, a separate notification being sent in respect of each patient.  This procedure worked without hitch for many years.</P>
    <P>On 13th December last a young and junior officer absented himself on sick leave.  It had been part of his duties to deal with the initial part of the procedure which I have just described, &mdash;that is to say, the association of each application with the previous papers relating to the particular patient and their submission to the Inspector, or Assistant Inspector of Mental Hospitals. This is, of course, a simple routine task appropriate to junior staff.  The officer to whom I have referred had been carefully trained in the work and the vital importance of dealing with applications immediately had been very strongly impressed on him.  When he had been on sick leave for about a week it was found that he had suppressed a number of the applications received by him.  In all, a total of 280 applications received in the period October to mid-December were suppressed.  Further in an <Col N="21" /> attempt to prevent discovery of his actions, he issued to the mental institutions concerned in all but 22 of these cases notifications that the Minister had approved the proposed extensions. As I have already indicated the number of applications received is high. The number arriving in a particular period, however, can vary considerably and, as the officer suppressed only some of the applications there were enough passing through to prevent the development of suspicion in the Department that anything was wrong. The issue of the irregular notifications to institutions that extensions had been granted also contributed to the delay in the discovery of the misconduct.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps say at this stage that of the 280 patients in respect of whom the applications for extension were suppressed, the usual statutory notifications received in the Department indicate that 53 have since been discharged in the normal course.  This figure of 53 includes seven of the twenty-two mentioned earlier whose period of extension had not been authorised and in which cases notifications have not been issued to the authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>I should say also that the 22 cases in which notifications of the approval of the proposed extensions were not issued occurred in only eight of the mental hospitals.  In all the other mental hospitals, the medical superintendents and other staff could have had no information that anything was amiss.  In the case of the eight mental hospitals mentioned, inquiries were made by the staffs concerned in relation to the specific patients and they were told that the matter would be looked into but even up to now have not been told that the required orders have not been made.</P>
    <P>The officer whose misconduct gave rise to the present difficulties has only recently returned from sick leave and consequently has only recently been in a position to furnish his explanation. This is at the moment being considered.</P>
    <P>When these irregularities came to light, the time in which extensions could be granted had expired in <Col N="22" /> respect of most of the applications. This Bill seeks to rectify the position by providing, broadly, that where an application for an extension was duly made, the patient may be continued in detention as if an order had been made extending the period, notwithstanding the fact that no order was actually made.  Provision is also made that no damages shall be recoverable by or on behalf of a person in respect of his detention during the period in question.</P>
    <P>In asking the House to agree to this measure it is well that I should ask it to view in proper perspective what has happened in relation to the patients involved.  As I explained on the Second Reading of the Mental Treatment Bill, 1960, which is now before the House in Committee, in deciding whether or not to grant an extension of the period of detention of a temporary patient, the person who happens, for the time being, to be Minister for Health has to rely on his professional advisers.  In view of the number of extensions involved, now running, as I have mentioned, at close to 3,000 a year, they, in turn, have to rely to a very large extent on the recommendation of the senior medical officers of the institutions concerned; for it will be fortuitous that they will know the patient <i>qua</i> patient.  Even in the exceptional case where they may remember having seen the patient it will usually have been only once or twice and then for short periods.  Very, very rarely can they be in a position from their own knowledge of him to decide whether he should, or should not be detained.</P>
    <P>While in practice all applications are carefully considered, invariably the word of the chief medical officer of the institution has to be accepted and the extension granted.  So automatic is the procedure that in September last, three months before the events which led up to this Bill first came to light, I had decided that it served no useful purpose and that I should ask the Oireachtas to amend it.  I recommended accordingly to the Government in a general memorandum dealing with the amendment of the Mental Treatment Acts and the Government approved <Col N="23" /> the proposal on 18th October and the necessary provision was included, as Section 18, in the Mental Treatment Bill, 1960, which was circulated as the House may remember, to Deputies on 29th November, 1960, while I and my Department were still unaware of the irregularities which, in fact, were occurring at this time.  The Section mentioned provides for the transfer from the Minister to the chief medical officer of the institution concerned of the power to extend the period of detention of a temporary patient.</P>
    <P>All the suppressed applications have been examined with special care by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and he is fully satisfied that if the applications had come to him at the proper time he would have recommended the grant of the extensions sought.  There is no shadow of doubt, therefore, that the extensions would have been granted if the applications had been dealt with in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the grant of the extensions sought would have been virtually automatic if they had been dealt with in accordance with the usual procedure, I do not wish to minimise, in any way, the seriousness of the fact that the necessary Ministerial orders were not made.  I regard what has happened as most regrettable and most deplorable.</P>
    <P>After the initial discovery on 19th December it was necessary to make the fullest enquiry and search of records to ascertain which patients were, in fact, detained in accordance with law and which were being detained irregularly.  When that had been done and the facts established, the measures which might be taken to deal with the situation were considered.</P>
    <P>I may say that I first considered notifying all the institutions concerned that, through no fault of theirs, particular patients were being irregularly detained and that these should be released immediately without waiting to determine the form of any legislation which might be required.  I decided against that course.  The patients concerned had been certified <Col N="24" /> by the competent medical authority a short time previously to need further detention for their recovery.  In the interim, any who had recovered sufficiently to justify their discharge had, in fact, been discharged.  Of the remainder, some would have progressed to the stage where their discharge was imminent and the majority were in need of longer-term detention and treatment.  I submit that to have discharged those still undergoing treatment so that they could be readmitted and detained in accordance with law would have had a most disturbing effect on the patients and would have caused unnecessary worry and anxiety to the relatives.  I think it was the least humane course that I could have adopted.  I therefore rejected it.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the present Bill are, in my opinion, the most appropriate to meet the position as it exists.</P>
    <P>In asking the House to give the Bill a Second Reading and to allow it to pass through all its Stages today, I should like again to stress four points:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  The arrangements which were in force for dealing with applications for extensions were regarded for many years as reasonable by me, by my predecessors and by the senior officers of the Department. They are still regarded as reasonable, subject only to a minor modification, which has since been made.</P>
    <P>2.  No blame attaches to any medical superintendent or other officer of a mental institution in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>3.  No patient was detained whose detention was not justified.</P>
    <P>4.  No patient has been detained for a day longer than was justified by his condition, or will be so detained.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I ask the House to give me the Second Reading of the Bill and also the remaining Stages to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is asking the House to pass as an urgent measure what amounts to a Bill indemnifying persons concerned <Col N="25" /> with the unauthorised detention of 280 patients over the past six months.  The Minister has brought the matter to the notice of the House as an urgent measure and, of course, in the speech which he has just made, he recognises that there is a problem of some degree of gravity with which we have to deal. It is correct to say that under our administrative system, the Minister is the person responsible for the situation in law and the person responsible for the situation to this House.  Because this measure relates to the fundamental rights of citizens, the Minister, I hope, will understand it if we on this side of the House inquire very carefully into how this legislation became necessary.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be a good thing from the Parliamentary point of view if we quickly, hurriedly or lightly passed indemnifying legislation, because the effect of it is to prevent a person who has a legal right from exercising that right in a court of law. The effect of this legislation is to condone a legal wrong and it is a matter about which everybody should be fully satisfied before consenting to such legislation.</P>
      <P>Our Constitution provides, under Article 40, subsection (4), that no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty, save in accordance with law.  The mental treatment code is the legal provision whereby, in their own interests, from time to time and with due and proper safeguards, persons medically ill or afflicted are deprived of their liberty in accordance with law.  I appreciate what the Minister has said in relation to the manner in which the various restrictions and safeguards have to be administered. Under the code as it stands at the moment, a reception order in respect of a temporary patient expires at the end of six months.  If the patient's medical condition is such that he should be detained for a longer period, under the law as it stands at the moment, it is necessary that an extension order should be signed by the Minister.  For many years, the process whereby these extension orders came to be signed was an administrative process in the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> The applications for an extension order came from the hospital authorities detaining the person concerned and it was then examined and dealt with in the Department.</P>
    <P>The only reason one should be on guard in relation to that is that in the long period during which this code has existed, there is the fact that there has never been a slip-up and that may perhaps have led to some slight complacency with regard to the type of system which is in operation.  I should say that, when I was Minister, it never occurred to me to question the manner in which this system was working.  It probably did not occur to anyone to question the system until some initial slip-up or difficulty became apparent. When the difficulty does become apparent, it is quite easy then to be wise.</P>
    <P>Obviously, a more desirable system would be some sort of scheme of checking or safeguarding in the Department which would automatically bring up, at the end of six months, the name of every person being detained.  If a register were kept in the Department of Health and if, at the end of a six months period after the original detention order was made, the name of the person detained were brought forward for inquiry as to whether his detention should be continued or not, it would be a much better system.  Possibly at the moment there is no power in the Department of Health to register the initial reception orders.  Possibly at the moment, once the initial reception order is made, the person concerned becomes only a name in the Department file when an application is made for an extension.  A better system would be to keep a register of all persons detained once the reception order is made so that the Minister will be in a position, from time to time, to check that no person is left languishing in a hospital and detained without due process of law.</P>
    <P>I am speaking on these lines now because this problem has arisen and I do agree that certainly it had not occurred to me before that this kind of situation might develop.  The Minister has come here to deal with a problem which has led to the unlawful <Col N="27" /> detention of 280 people in the past six months.  I can understand that the Minister may feel some diffidence in this matter and may have some reluctance to disclose more than is necessary but the story he tells us is certainly rather a strange one.  He tells us that a junior officer of his Department became ill on 13th December last year and absented himself on sick leave.  Six days later it was discovered that this junior officer had suppressed 280 applications for these extension orders.  I do not know what the Minister intends to convey by the word &ldquo;suppressed&rdquo; which he used twice.  It seems to signify a deliberate selection of particular orders which were prevented from going to the Minister for signature.  That seems an extraordinary thing to have happened and if the Minister is in a position to give more information with regard to that I certainly think the House should have it.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know, if it was the duty of this officer to deal with these applications, to see that they were examined by the medical advisers of the Minister, how it was that a week elapsed after his absenting himself on sick leave before this suppression was found out?  In any event it appears that the Minister was aware of the problem on the 19th December.  Again, while there may be two views about this, to me it seems difficult to understand why a period of over two months should have elapsed before this legislation is brought to the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister apparently has been aware since before Chrismas that 280 people were being unlawfully detained in mental hospitals and he comes in to-day with a measure which he asks the House to pass this day dealing with these detentions and authorising them. I think the Minister could explain a little bit more fully why that delay should have taken place.  In his Second Reading speech he said that each of these applications had to be examined &mdash;he used the phrase rather unhappily, I thought&mdash;&ldquo;with special care&rdquo;.  I would have hoped that these applications got the same attention, the same careful examination as if they were <Col N="28" /> just one of the ordinary applications coming to the Minister for signature. After all, they relate to the constitutional right of a citizen of this country not to be detained except in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>The fact is that under the system as it operated up to this mental hospital authorities, we learned from the Minister, were asked to send in their applications within a fortnight of the expiration of the period of six months.  That would seem to indicate that up to this the Department was geared at least to give a careful and proper examination to 120 applications in a period of a fortnight.  Accordingly, I fail to see why this matter should not have been investigated within a shorter period than two-and-a-half months and a decision come to.</P>
    <P>I am happy to learn from the Minister that, after the careful and proper examination subsequently carried out, the recommendation in relation to each one of these persons would have been a recommendation for an extension order and that accordingly if this lapse had not taken place the extension orders would have been made and no one of the persons concerned would have been wrongly deprived of his liberty.  That is consoling and I am glad to hear it.  Nevertheless, I think we can all feel with the Minister that this is a grave and deplorable situation, that it is one that should not have happened.  It should teach us all a lesson; it should certainly teach me a lesson that in relation to administrative procedures of this kind which relate to the rights of poor, ignorant, uneducated people we should be far more careful and bend over backwards, even though there is tedium involved, even though there is far more administrative effort entailed, to ensure that each application and each case is examined as if it were the only case involved and very careful attention given to it.</P>
    <P>We can all learn a lesson from that.  While the Minister will get his Bill through the House to-day I hope he will realise he will not get it from a complacent House or a House that gives this to him lightly or irresponsibly. <Col N="29" /> Everybody in this House realises that this exceptional measure relates to a very grave problem and while the House recognises the problem as being a grave one, the House, nevertheless, in the special circumstances, does give the Minister this indemnifying legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that such a measure is so unusual could be taken as a tribute to the general efficiency of the Civil Service.  However, even though a Bill of this kind is unusual and very infrequent, I do not think, as Deputy O'Higgins said, we should approach the business with any sense of complacency nor do I believe the Minister himself has treated this matter in any complacent manner. However, it has demonstrated to us that, no matter how well greased the Civil Service machine may appear to be, it is liable to get grit into the works now and again.</P>
      <P>There are some questions I should like to put to the Minister in respect of the error which the Minister has described to us in his Second Reading speech.  It frightens me somewhat to think that documents may go to Departments of State and as in this case, an application for the detention of 280 patients, and that such applications may appear to be buried for two-and-a-half months.  These applications, I assume, are addressed either to the Minister for Health or to the Secretary to the Department of Health.  Neither I nor anybody else expects that a Minister of State, the Minister for Health or the Secretary of the Department should have to scrutinise every letter that is addressed to him at the Department of Health but the Minister in this case has described the officer who made the error as being a junior officer.  I do not want to make this appear any sort of an inquest or an inquisition in relation to the Civil Service or to civil servants in the Department of Health but surely there must be some person in a particular section assigned to ensure that applications of a serious nature, such as we have here, are dealt with and dealt with within a specified time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated in his speech <Col N="30" /> that no responsibility for this error rests on the shoulders of the resident medical superintendents in the mental hospitals.  I agree.  They did not err in any way, but I think they have a responsibility.  The procedure, as I see it, is such that it is the R.M.S. who makes application to the Minister for Health to extend the period during which a patient remains in a mental hospital. The eight R.M.S. in question surely at some stage between October and the middle of December must have made, or were bound to make, inquiries as to what happened to these applications. Suppose these R.M.S. made application in October for the extension of the detention of a patient from, say, 13th of October for another six months.  Surely, when that date arrived and they had no order from the Minister, it was their duty, their responsibility, to make inquiries from the Department of Health as to whether or not the Minister had made, or refused to make, the order?  It may will be that such correspondence went out to this particular quarter in a communication, was sent back to the R.M.S., to the effect that the order or permission had been granted.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to make it clear whether or not it was a simple letter from the Department to the mental hospitals, such as is usually sent, or a copy of a Ministerial order. Did the order have &ldquo;Seán MacEntee, Minister for Health,&rdquo; written on it? Was a copy of that sent to the R.M.S., or did the communication merely purport to speak in the name of the Department of Health with the usual phrasing, &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Health to state that the extension may be granted in the case of patient so and so?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However regrettable and deplorable it is that the Minister should have to introduce such legislation, I have no objection to giving him all Stages of this Bill today.  There has been a change, as announced, in the Mental Treatment Bill of 1960 whereby the Minister does not in future have to give permission for an extension of the detention of any patient.  I think it is a much more satisfactory arrangement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> Perhaps the Minister would give us some further details on this error.  At the same time, I do not think it desirable that we should appear to have an inquisition on civil servants generally or on the particular official who made the error.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two entirely different principles which must be considered in relation to this Bill. The first is in relation to mental patients who are concerned and all of us without exception are anxious to ensure that everything is done to safeguard their position and their return to full health and also to safeguard themselves in whatever institution they may be.  I do not accept at all that the consideration of whether a person should be detained for a further period under the Act of 1945 is a matter that is entirely routine, entirely automatic or should be considered in that way. Nor am I to be considered at all at this stage as accepting the position that the proposal in the Mental Treatment Bill, at present before the House, is a good change, but I do not propose to discuss that now.</P>
      <P>I think we must first consider this Bill from the point of view of what is best for the patients and I think it is best for the patients that the course suggested in this Bill should be adopted.  Therefore, I also am prepared to support that course.  But there is another principle involved in this case, a principle which the Minister for Health himself would be the very first person to bring to our attention, if we were on the opposite benches, that is, the principle of Parliamentary responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this Bill, the behaviour of the Minister in regard to the principle of Parliamentary responsibility can only be described as scandalous. The Minister has come into the House seeking an indemnifying Bill and there is not one word of regret on his part although it is he who is responsible for the Department.  In no Department of State are the civil servants servants of this House; they are servants of the Executive and it is the Minister who is responsible to the <Col N="32" /> House.  The civil servants concerned are not responsible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has described the occurrence as regrettable and deplorable. Of course it is, but the Minister has not uttered one word of apology for his part as the Parliamentary head of the Department, the person responsible to Parliament for the mess that has been created.  He is the person whose duty it is to see and to ensure that the Department is administered properly in accordance with the directions given to it by this House from time to time.  I have not the slightest doubt of what would have happened if, when I was Minister for Finance, I had to come into the House in similar circumstances and if I had not issued or given, as I should have given, a proper apology to the House in the case of the Department under my administration.  That did not happen. But the Minister now comes in and does not say one word of personal regret to the House for the fact that the Department over which he presides has suspended 280 applications.</P>
    <P>For far less than that, a Minister in another parliament had the honour and the sense of responsibility to resign his post when a mistake was made by somebody under his administration. It is accepted everywhere as a matter of parliamentary responsibility that it is the Minister who must stand over the actions of the civil servants under him because they are his and the Government's and are not servants of Parliament.  The Minister has always been pretty quick to point out to the House the doctrine of parliamentary responsibility.  In that case I have quoted, the Minister concerned took the honourable and dignified course of resigning as Minister because an appalling botch had been made by somebody under his administration.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, who can be the most charming person in the world socially, can be utterly impossible when he stands on his feet here as he has proved in this case by not tendering to the House any apology of any sort.  I shall describe the action of the Minister, in relation to Parliamentary responsibility, in deliberately trying to <Col N="33" /> throw away from himself the responsibility for these actions, in trying to pillory in the public estimation servants of his own Department, as a scandalous abuse.  This speech by the Minister can be described as nothing but an attempt by him to pillory an official in his own Department.  He should have got up and said that a mistake was made, that he accepted responsibility for it, that it was a matter for him to stand over and not try to seek refuge behind what had been done by the junior official.</P>
    <P>Of course we all know perfectly well why the Minister is not finding adequate time for the administration of his Department; he is much too busy going around the country trying to rake up the embers of the Civil War, trying to stir Sligo-Leitrim to go back to the Civil War atmosphere, but Sligo-Leitrim gave him his answer, just as Sligo and Griffith, with the help of MacEoin, gave the Bolshies their answer 40 years ago.  If the Minister had attended to the business of his Department in a proper way by trying to ease and oil the machinery to ensure that it was administered in accordance with the directions of this House and did not spend so much time trying to cause trouble outside with other associations, trying to avoid answering ordinary, courteous questions put to him in the House as were put last week on the Social Insurance Supplementary Estimate, then he would not have to come in here and ask us to give the indemnity which has to be given, and given, let me add, in the interests of the patients.</P>
    <P>It completely defeats me how any Minister could have the hardihood, the effrontery, to come in here and acknowledge that 280 applications had been suppressed in his Department, and not offer a word of apology for his maladministration and failure to administer the Department in accordance with the ordinary tenets of Parliamentary responsibility.</P>
    <P>We know now that the Minister is interested in Parliamentary responsibility only when it suits himself; we know now that he is interested in being meticulous only when it suits himself; we know now that he is <Col N="34" /> apparently prepared to throw it all overboard and shelter behind a junior officer of his own Department, instead of being man enough to stand up to say:  &ldquo;The fault is mine.  This is the best thing in the interests of the patients.  I accept that fault and apologise to the House for it.&rdquo;  If he had done that, he would be a better man and he would go out of office in October&mdash;rumour has it that he does not intend to stand again : he will go out of office, assuredly, we all know that&mdash;without having reneged on the very principles on which this House was founded, and which he has heretofore tried to cod the people he believed in, in relation to Parliamentary practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take advantage of the Second Reading of this Bill to refer to the question of the detention of patients.  I have, on other occasions, raised the question of persons who have been certified as well but who, because those who certified them will not take them out, cannot get out.  The Minister states that is incorrect, but, to a large extent, my allegations are correct.  Even where the R.M.S. can release a person in his own custody, he thinks twice before doing so, and in many cases he does not release the patient unless the person who certified him is prepared to accept him in custody.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to mention any names but I have with me a letter which I received, and which I now quote:</P>
      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>As I heard a statement from the Dáil today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;he probably heard it from Radio Éireann&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there are nineteen thousand patients in mental hospitals.  Referring to your statement you stated that some of these patients are in them because they have no home of their own.</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is so in many cases&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some young men and women signed in by their people who have no intention of ever taking them out which is not justice retaining anybody against their will when <Col N="35" /> the doctor has already discharged them.  I am one of those victims.</P>
    <P>I am willing to work and earn my living on the outside world and look after myself.  I am not married.</P>
    <P>I would be very grateful to you if you could get this brought up in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I wrote to that person and received an answer from him, and I am satisfied, from my information, that he has been certified as well, but, because his people will not take him out, he is virtually a prisoner.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that such cases occur.  About a week ago, it was reported in the Press that two sons tried to certify their &ldquo;old man.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I accept your direction, Sir; I was not aware of that. There are many such cases.  I know of a man who certified his wife.  He is living with another woman and has not the slightest intention of taking his wife out.  Such cases are fairly common for that reason, or for property reasons.  Where the Department are satisfied that a person has regained his health, notwithstanding the fact that those who certified him will not take him out, he should be able to get out in his own custody or in the custody of someone else.  I understand the position is that those who certify a patient must be prepared to accept him, There are numerous cases where that does not suit.  I am not satisfied with that position and I shall raise the matter again, if necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister indicated, this is a very unusual Bill, and it arises from very disquieting circumstances revealed by the Minister in the course of his introductory speech. The whole incident surrounding this irregularity throws a rather interesting sidelight on the administrative methods of the Civil Service and the apparent complacency on the part of people who should know better in regard to receiving an early reply when they write to a Department of the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>This case bears out the patience of People who write to a Civil Service Department and hope they will get a reply within a reasonable period.  Here is a case where eight resident medical superintendents in charge of large mental hospitals throughout the country, sent forms to the number of 280, approximately, to the Department of Health, which forms were delayed there for ten weeks or approximately two and half months.  No reply was received by the R.M.S. in a large number of these cases.  Although the resident medical superintendents must know that authority to detain persons for longer periods was not forthcoming from the Minister or the Department, nevertheless they accepted the situation in which those persons were detained in hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Notification was sent out to each mental hospital with the exception of 25 cases and in each of the 25 cases it was brought to light that inquiries were made from the Department.  I think the Deputy is not doing the hospitals justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The number does not matter; the principle is still there.  It was admitted there was very substantial delay on the part of the officer concerned in suppressing these applications for the Minister's authority.  The applications were discovered and the officer went sick.  They were then dealt with and, according to the <Col N="37" /> figures the Minister has just quoted, in about 25 cases, persons were detained when, in fact, there was no covering authority for their detention.</P>
      <P>It seems strange that persons of the standing of resident medical superintendents should meekly accept so much delay and also accept a situation in which a number of persons were detained against the law, in the absence of authority from the Minister. It is a serious situation that a person should have his liberty taken from him because the Minister for Health has not given his authority for the continued detention of persons.</P>
      <P>I take it the junior officer who initiated the misdemeanour in this instance was obliged to submit these forms to a more senior officer.  Was it not noticed at any stage that either the trickle of forms had dried up or that no forms were coming for a period?  Was it not observed that something must be wrong when, over a period of 2½ months, it was possible for the junior officer to have, as the Minister said, suppressed so many applications for an extension of power to detain mentally affected persons? It all shows that, dealing with a phase of the Department's activity, there ought to have been more adequate check in so far as applications for the continued detention of persons in mental homes are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Sweetman refer to the constitutional practice in cases like this where a first-class mistake is made in a Department and where the Minister, recognising he is the political head and responsible to the people for the official administration of the Department, comes in circumstances similar to this and confesses he is responsible as the political head and offers to tender his resignation.  If Deputy Sweetman has any notion that the present Minister for Health intends to resign I am surprised that, having sat in this House for so long with Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Sweetman should make the fundamental error of imagining that a tiny little thing like this&mdash; delaying 280 forms&mdash;would shake the Minister for Health into any such <Col N="38" /> righteous indignation as might, in a fevered moment, induce him to take out a fountain pen and write his resignation. Anybody who believes that kind of action would be taken by the Minister for Health would have to start off again and study the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>In his wildest moments, the Minister for Health would never commit himself to a righteous course of that kind which would have such serious consequences for the Minister. A matter of 280 forms would not trouble this Minister and goad him into resignation.  Two hundred and eighty Polaris submarines would not get him out of that seat, much less 280 forms. Anybody would think the Minister for Health is bothered about a frivolity such as 280 forms.  That is nothing to the Minister.  That is nothing to a old warrior like the Minister who has taken on the whole medical profession and is now waging war with them for four years.</P>

      <P>Thank God it is.  We ought to recognise frankly and gallantly that with so many things on his plate&mdash;so many wars to fight, so many fronts to defend, on the whole, the Minister is doing a fairly good job with only 280 forms delayed for ten weeks.</P>
      <P>I hope that, in the autumn of his political life, before the Minister leaves the Department of Health he will take steps to ensure that this serious administrative oversight will not only not be repeated but will not be capable of being repeated.  I understand that under the Mental Treatment Bill the Minister's authority will not be necessary for future detentions.  That brings me to a question I want to ask on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill is intended to deal only with the case to which the Minister made reference in his opening speech why is this Bill not being given a <Col N="39" /> limited life?  Am I right in thinking that the reason is that this Bill will lapse when the Mental Treatment Bill proper becomes law?  Otherwise it seems that this is a permanent Bill to deal with a temporary situation.  I am just assuming that maybe the reason is that the provision here enshrined will in fact be abolished by the provisions of the main Mental Treatment Bill which the House is discussing.  I should like some information from the Minister on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the two points raised by Deputy Sweetman in regard to this matter require careful consideration. If we get casual about such matters we shall jettison very precious elements in the system of parliamentary government that operates in this country I believe to the great advantage of us all.  I do not think any man has long been in Ministerial office in this country without being taught the lesson that, <i>vis-à-vis</i> Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and the country, he is responsible not only for the success but for the failure of the Department over which he presides.</P>
      <P>The Minister who comes in here with a comprehensive brief and scintillates in public by detailed knowledge of the subject which it is his duty to bring under the attention of Dáil Éireann does so very largely because civil servants of his Department have burned the midnight oil to ensure he will be armed against every inquiry that will be raised and that his brief will be adequate for the task he has been charged by the Government to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, the Minister is enjoying the credit and the work civil servants in his Department have undertaken.  Very occasionally the reverse can happen.  I can remember sitting in the Minister's position once when an old and trusted colleague happened to hand me the wrong figures.  I experienced some measure of embarrassment in trying to back-pedal out of the situation of having argued from the basis of those figures and doubtless lost some feathers in the encounter.  It would never have crossed my mind as an alibi to this House that somebody briefing me had <Col N="40" /> made the mistake of passing the wrong paper.  I would be indebted to that individual and his colleagues repeatedly for saving me from hundreds of such pitfalls in the past, all the credit for which I was very glad to accept from an admiring audience.</P>
    <P>That convention is founded on a perfectly sound principle&mdash;that the political head of a Department is responsible to the Oireachtas, that he answers for all that his Department does, that he takes the credit and he shares the blame, if blame be due. But it is going to be a shocking departure from the proper conduct of parliamentary business if the Minister on Tuesday is to present us with a Mental Treatment Bill, proceed to expound in great detail and bespeak the admiration of all for his command of the complicated measures before him; and then, on Wednesday, bring in a second Mental Treatment (Detention in Approved Institutions) Bill and say:</P>
    <P>This Bill is made necessary as the result of the action of a junior officer who absented himself on sick leave.  It had been part of his duties to deal with the initial part of the procedure which I have just outlined, that is to say, the association of each application with the previous papers relating to the particular patient and their submission to the inspector or assistant inspector of mental hospitals.  This is, of course, a simple routine task appropriate to junior staff.</P>
    <P>It is none of our business in this House to determine what is &ldquo;a simple routine task appropriate to junior staff.&rdquo;  That is something which the Minister, as head of the Department, should answer.  The net result of the Minister's decision that this is &ldquo;a simple routine task&rdquo; is that between 20 and 30 people have been illegally detained and this House is now required to pass indemnifying legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a simple routine task.  The Minister's responsibility for the personal liberty of an afflicted person in a mental hospital is, in my judgment, one of the greatest responsibilities  <Col N="41" /> he carries.  He cannot shift that responsibility off on to the shoulders of a junior member of his staff. It is his responsibility.  When we passed the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, in this House I remember on one occasion Deputy Sweetman and myself going down to the Minister's room to say we were prepared to exhaust parliamentary resources to resist a proposal that a patient could be committed to a mental hospital on the certificate of one medical person.  We insisted there must be two opinions before any person was so committed because we felt the urgent necessity in cases of this kind of having any opinion, medical or otherwise, however responsibly given, reviewed by a second mind so that the liberty of an afflicted person should not be lightly taken away at a time when the person himself was, by his very condition, disqualified from seeking the vindication of his own freedom by resort to the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings which are available to the humblest citizen of the land.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a minor matter that the extended detention of a person in a mental hospital should be approved or required.  The Minister seeks to say he has come to the conclusion that this is so routine a matter that when he brought the Mental Treatment Bill, 1960, before the Government he asked them to change the procedure because, he said, he felt it was unnecessarily cumbrous.  But when you look at the White Paper where he purports to describe the change that he pressed the Government to adopt, you will find he says that, even though he asked the Government to authorise him to seek responsibility for the waiving of the Minister's direct responsibility in signing every extension of six months, he also seeks to put in the Bill a proviso that when the Inspector of Mental Hospitals makes a visit and inspection of a mental institution, &ldquo;the Inspector of Mental Hospitals shall pay particular attention to patients whose period of detention has been extended since the occasion of his previous visit and inspection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> In drafting the 1960 Bill the Minister does not think this to be a simple routine task.  He says, even though primary responsibility has been relegated to the R.M.S. of the institution where the patient is confined, that where an R.M.S. has made an extension it shall be the duty of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals specially to inquire into the circumstances of each person in respect of whom an extension of a detention order has been made, and presumably, if he is given that obligation to make special inquiry, to report to the Minister on what his findings were.</P>
    <P>The first and vital point is this. Ministers answering to this House must and should not shelter under the alibi of blaming a junior officer of their Departments for matters most appropriately described by the Minister as &ldquo;regrettable and deplorable&rdquo;&mdash; those are his words, not mine.  I want to suggest it is a travesty of the Minister's responsibility to communicate to us developments in his Department which he describes as &ldquo;regrettable and deplorable&rdquo; as being the responsibility of a junior officer who was assigned &ldquo;a simple routine task.&rdquo;  I am astonished.</P>
    <P>In my judgement and experience, which go back for a considerable time in this House, I think this Bill, and the speech used to introduce it, mark a completely new departure.  I have never heard this kind of alibi presented to Dáil Éireann before in all my experience of it.  I am astonished that a person holding the position of the Tánaiste would not feel bound to come to the House and say: &ldquo;A very deplorable thing has happened.  Our first concern must be for the mental patients themselves.  Therefore, I am bringing in this indemnifying Bill.  But I am obliged to inform the House that I place my resignation in the hands of the Taoiseach to do with it as he thinks fit.&rdquo;  If he had done that it would be for the Taoiseach to determine whether or not, in all the circumstances, he would refuse the resignation, and ask him to retain the responsibility, or accept it.</P>
    <P>It is to be borne in mind that in circumstances very much less grievous, <Col N="43" /> in my opinion, because it simply dealt with the disposal of a parcel of land, a British Minister not only resigned but persisted in his resignation, and on being asked by the Prime Minister to withdraw it, said: &ldquo;No.  I think a scandalous thing has happened in the Department for which I am responsible&rdquo;&mdash;he admitted in his speech of resignation he had never heard what had happened&mdash;&ldquo;I do not think that exonerates me from the responsibility which I owe to the House of Commons. When the facts were brought to light, I considered them to be scandalous and disgraceful and I accept full responsibility for them.  I have resigned and I shall not reconsider it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I now bring to the attention of the Tánaiste this fact, to which I attach immense importance.  When committing to his care and to the care of any Minister for Health the safekeeping of the personal freedom of a number of persons who, we all knew at the time we were legislating for them, were utterly incapable of safeguarding themselves, we dwelt on aspects that certain afflicted persons would have the benefit of solicitors, relatives and friends and they would be perfectly safe.  We dwelt on the fact that we had the fullest confidence in the resident medical superintendent but we knew that, when people are in charge of patients for a long time, they may develop a solicitude which ordinary citizens would consider excessive.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with the doctor in the sanatorium or hospital who will not advise a patient to go because he thinks he ought to stay longer to make assurance doubly sure.  But these people in such institutions are in full possession of their faculties and can in the last analysis go.  If anybody tries to obstruct them, the courts can intervene although we were conscious of the fact that it was not impossible that a resident medical superintendent, acting in the fullest good faith, would feel that this person appears to be cured but thinks he ought to keep him on for a little longer.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances we were committing into the hands of the Minister <Col N="44" /> for Health the overriding view in such cases of saying to the resident medical superintendent: &ldquo;I am sure you are right but I should like to have a second or third opinion.  I want to be satisfied, as this patient's best friend, having been charged with that responsibility by Oireachtas Éireann, that competent consultants will agree with your view that a further period of detention is required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we were right to take that precaution.  Any of us who have sat in Government realise that cases of this kind come to Government from time to time in respect of persons detained in the mental hospital at Dundrum. I well remember cases of that kind coming to our attention in which we had before us the opinion of the resident medical superintendent, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and opinions tendered by representatives of the Department of Justice.  We insisted upon getting, as a Government, independent consultants' opinions from outside. It was not until all these were carefully weighed up that we took decisions from time to time as to the final disposition of persons who had been certified at one time as being of unsound mind prior to committal to Dundrum mental hospital.</P>
    <P>I remember the Government feeling their very exceptional burden of responsibility in determining what was right and proper to do in these individual cases.  There was not one of these cases which was a matter of graver responsibility than any of these cases.  What was available to the case I refer to was the anxious thought and supervision that was given to them by a body of laymen whose reaction, having heard the professional opinion, the resident medical superintendent, the Departmental doctors and so on, was that we seek further consultant opinion so that we might be certain, as certain as it is humanly possibly to be, that justice is done in these cases and that nobody's liberty is improperly restrained.</P>
    <P>All that graver responsibility in respect of categories of persons envisaged under this mental treatment code devolves not on the occupants of the Dundrum mental hospital but on the <Col N="45" /> Minister for Health.  It seems to me wholly wrong that he should shuffle off that responsibility and present to this House the alibi that a junior civil servant fails in his task.  It is wrong because <i>vis-á-vis</i> Oireachtas Éireann nobody failed but the Minister and, for whatever failure there has been, he is responsible and should face it and accept the consequential obligations flowing from that failure.</P>
    <P>I am quite shocked at some of the terms the Minister seemed fit to employ in his speech.  He says:</P>
    <P>While in practice all applications are carefully considered, invariably the word of the chief medical officer of the institution has to be accepted and the extension granted.  So automatic is the procedure that in September last, three months before the events which led up to this Bill first came to light, I had decided that it served no useful purpose and that I should ask the Oireachtas to amend it.</P>
    <P>It should not have been an automatic decision.  It was a procedure for which the Minister was responsible and he should have discharged it with a full sense of that responsibility.  The fact that very rarely there would emerge a case in which it would be necessary to overrule the decision of the resident medical superintendent does not in the least mitigate the duty of responsibility that the Minister bore.  The fact that 99 persons have their freedom unabridged is no consolation whatever to the hundredth person who might be improperly detained.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it appears to me that in the Minister's own statement there is a mass of contradictions.  On page 5 he says:</P>
    <P>All the suppressed applications have been examined with special care by the inspector of mental hospitals and he is fully satisfied that if the applications had come to him at the proper time he would have recommended the grant of extensions sought.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that there is an implication in that statement that if they had come at a proper time he would <Col N="46" /> not have given them his special care and examined them.  I assumed that all such applications had the special care of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  I submit it was the clear obligation of the Minister for Health to ensure that that special care was given.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House lest this notion be generally accepted that the determination of whether an extension should be granted or not is a routine matter, that that is not the view of the President of the High Court dealing with the property of persons of unsound mind.  They are regularly visited individually.  It used to be the Registrar to the Chief Justice. It is now the President of the High Court.  He is responsible for the property of persons of unsound mind and in the discharge of that duty he regularly visits them and inspects.  Surely if the administration of the property of these people requires vigilance of that character, the question of whether they are to be free or detained is infinitely more deserving of vigilance and care.</P>
    <P>We shall give this Bill to the Minister, lest patients who require continued treatment should suffer as a result of unintentional discharge before the proper period of treatment has been completed.  We assume that a very careful review will be made of all the cases.  I think the Minister has undertaken to do that.  I should like the further assurance that if the Minister is resolved to shuffle off the responsibility he has had, and failed to discharge under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, if he has resolved under Section 18 to shuffle it off on the R.M.S., we may rest assured that when the Inspector of Mental Hospitals pays particular attention to patients whose period of treatment has been expanded since his previous inspection, he will be required to report to the Minister his opinion on all these cases, stating either that he agrees with the R.M.S. or has any reservation, so that the Minister may call for a third or fourth opinion in order to ensure that the afflicted people are fully vindicated.</P>
    <P>I should like an assurance from the Minister now that, either directly or at <Col N="47" /> one remove, he will continue to regard himself as the public custodian of the freedom of persons confined to mental hospitals of any kind, to ensure they are kept there no longer than their own best interests require.  I should like the reassurance that he will accept that responsibility under this new Bill and that he will discharge it more faithfully than he appears to have done hitherto under existing legislation. Secondly, I want to ask him categorically, as a Deputy, as Tánaiste, as a past Minister for Finance himself, and as a Minister of an Irish Government, does he consider it becoming or proper that when something has transpired in the administration of his own Department which he feels constrained to say is most regrettable and most deplorable, he, as the political head of the Department, should come here and say: &ldquo;But it was due to the negligence of a minor civil servant&rdquo;?  I refuse to follow the implications of that statement into the intimate machinery of the Civil Service itself. It has wide and, in my judgement, evil implications.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I had better elaborate on that to make it clear.  A Department of State has its establishment and a head of that establishment.  In all my experience, I never remember the head of that establishment claiming that he was immune from blame because of malfeasance or non-feasance on the part of a junior member of the staff. He accepts responsibility and if he is reminiscent of the multitudinous assistance he received from him and his colleagues, he would face Parliament and accept responsibility, if that were necessary.  But it is a shocking principle for a political head of a Department to come in here and by implication say: &ldquo;The senior members of my establishment disown responsibility for this because it was the performance of a junior.&rdquo;  They have a responsibility to see that the juniors faithfully discharge the tasks assigned to them and it is no alibi to say it was a routine task.  I do not wish to pursue that because my function as a member of the Opposition is to deal with the Minister. I invite him to say if he knows of any <Col N="48" /> precedent in his Parliamentary experience, which is longer than my own, by which a Minister has come to meet Parliament with an alibi of the kind he has thought is proper for something he describes as deplorable?</P>
    <P>In the administration of his Department, I know of no precedent and I want to say with great emphasis to those who do not understand the significance of what is happening here to-day that I hope no other Minister of any Government we may ever have will accept what the Minister is doing today as a becoming precedent in the future.  If it were, parliamentary government would quickly become impossible. I am astonished that a man who holds the position of Tánaiste in an Irish Government should have sought assent to such ignoble a precedent.  I do not abandon hope that before this Bill finally passes he will see fit to mend his hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not the least of the reasons why the Minister for Health should do the decent thing and resign all the public and Parliamentary offices which he holds.  This House and the other House exist to protect the interests of the humblest person in the community against the Executive, the Executive being the whole administration of the Government.  Just as the head of a firm must take responsibility for the incompetence or deliberate neglect of duty of any person employed by him, so must a Minister personally and very seriously accept responsibility for neglect on the part of any officer in his Department.  The neglect of the most inferior member of the Civil Service is the neglect of the Minister and there is no way in which this House can compel the Civil Service to carry out the laws of this country, except by making the Minister responsible, if and when a civil servant fails in his duty.  It is only because of that great fear that their Minister might get into trouble and serious trouble, that some members of the Civil Service will live up to their responsibilities.  Let it be understood that I am not making an attack upon the Service in general. I am well aware, as all people <Col N="49" /> interested in public life must be aware, of the magnificent devotion to duty and the magnificent services far in excess of their duty which so many and the majority of civil servants show but one of the main spurs to efficiency, one of the things which compel public servants to do their duty is the possibility that their Minister may get into trouble if they neglect to do their duty.</P>
      <P>For that reason, the clear obligation on the Minister for Health now, for the sake of the future of the working of democracy in this country, is to resign. If he did so, he would not have attached to him the amount of blame and criticism which can be justifiably levelled at him so long as he digs his rather muddy heels further in.</P>
      <P>As other Deputies have mentioned, this is a very serious matter of principle, not one which can be lightly glossed over by blaming an inferior and an anonymous official, an official who is unknown to the members of this House.</P>
      <P>One thing which is highly objectionable about this Bill is the speed with which it was introduced, the lack of opportunity given to Deputies to consider the matter and the fact that there are many members of this House who even one and a quarter hours after the debate opened are still unaware of this very grievous matter.  It would appear that it is the Minister's intention to press that this Bill be given to him in all Stages with the least possible delay, when, in fact, it demands the most serious and impartial consideration by all members, no matter on what side of the House they may sit.</P>
      <P>It is objectionable that the Minister should come in at such very short notice and expect all to be forgiven him and his inferiors when this House has already imposed very serious duties upon the Minister and those duties have not been properly carried out.  We cannot lightly or rapidly forgive such a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of this Bill which I find objectionable is that it seeks to deny to people who have suffered by this neglect the right to recover damages.  If any person has suffered as a result of ministerial or departmental <Col N="50" /> neglect, if any person has suffered an injury or a loss of a right or privilege or treatment as a result of that neglect, or if any person has been unlawfully detained in custody as a result of that neglect, that person's right of action to recover damages should not be taken from him as we are being asked to do by this Bill.</P>
    <P>On those grounds, I feel that the Minister in his opening speech has shown that he does not consider the matter of any great importance.  We, on the other hand, feel that it is a matter of such grave importance that the only decent course open to the Minister is to offer his resignation.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that the Minister's heart was flowing over with contrition, that if there were only a drop of contrition in the bottom of his heart when the debate opened, more and more has flowed into it in the meantime, but, unfortunately, we know that the Minister has a heart which burns with such fire of indignation that it burns up the waters of contrition which ought to flow through it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister not to blow off the usual steam when replying to this debate but to have some regard for the vital principles of democracy, to have some regard for the duties which rest upon him as Minister and to have regard for the position and duty of this House not to forgive a serious sin on the part of the Executive.  The matter might, perhaps, be forgiven and remedial measures might be provided if the Minister would do the only thing he ought to do, that is, resign and leave it to another person to carry through this Bill, because we do appreciate that there is a necessity for it in order that a mighty wrong may be to some extent undone.</P>

      <P>I have not come to this House with any alibi.  As to what my future will be in relation to the Department of Health, I am in the hands of the House.  I have come to the House and I have made a full disclosure of the facts.  If I had not mentioned how this situation had come about, Deputy Sweetman, the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Ryan <Col N="51" /> would have accused me of concealing the facts.  I am not sheltering behind a junior officer but I have to tell the House how it came that a ministerial order, which it was in my discretion as Minister to make or not to make, happened not to be made though a request for such an order had been received in the Department.</P>
      <P>I wonder where the negligence on my part arises?  I have not detained these patients in mental hospitals.  The matter arises because they have been detained irregularly, so far as the law is concerned, but according to those who are competent to speak with authority, are being detained quite properly from a medical and therapeutic point of view.  All that we are concerned with here in the Bill is one thing, to regularise the detention of the patients and indemnify these psychiatric specialists who felt when they applied for a ministerial order that these patients should be for their own welfare detained for a further period, against the fact that they did detain them without a ministerial order having been duly made.</P>

      <P>Let me get back and I would hope that you, Sir, will ensure that the Deputy will allow me to refute the allegation which has been made, both by him and Deputy Dillon, as to my conduct.  I said I did not come here with any alibi.  I put all the facts before the House.  I am in the hands of the House.</P>
      <P>I wish to come back to the Bill and to show what a hollow sham the speeches we have listened to from Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon are.  In order to bolster up those shams, we have had the most shameful misrepresentations on the part of Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon alleged that in my speech I stated that I regarded the question as to whether an order should be made acceding to the request of the resident medical superintendent that a patient should be detained as a simple, routine task appropriate to a junior staff officer.  I said nothing of the sort, but by taking words out of their context, Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Opposition, and Deputy Sweetman endeavoured to create the impression that I did say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is what I said, referring to this junior officer: &ldquo;It has been part of his duties to deal with the initial part of the procedure which I have just described&mdash;the association of each application with the previous papers relating to the particular patient and <Col N="53" /> their submission to the Inspector or assistant Inspector of Mental Hospitals.&rdquo; I then added that this was a simple routine task appropriate to junior staff.  Here is what this particular officer had to do.  I have here a particular file.  Here is this pink paper which is an application for the detention of a person in an approved institution as a temporary patient. This one happens to have been received in my Department some time in September.  It is followed up by a report received about three weeks later.  That is this green paper, which is the report made by the chief medical officer of the institution in which the patient had then been for 21 days after his reception.  Those are these two papers.</P>
    <P>Within a period of six months after the date of the actual reception of the patient, an application is received on this form&mdash;this white paper here.  It is in this form: &ldquo;I wish to refer to the case of the above-named patient who was admitted on such and such a date and in accordance with the provisions of Section 89 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, I now apply to have the period of detention extended for a further six months.&rdquo;  Here is what the junior officer to whom I referred in my opening speech had to do.  When he received this paper, the white paper, from the registrar's office&mdash;and I hope Deputy Sweetman is listening to this &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When he receives that form from the registrar, he has to look up the relevant number, find the file, put that white paper in its proper place on it, attach another form to it and ensure that it goes to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals or to the Assistant Inspector.  Is that not a simple routine task appropriate to a junior staff officer?  Or is the Minister or the head of his Department supposed to do it?  That is the context in which I used the phrase &ldquo;simple, routine task.&rdquo;  Nobody listening to Deputy Sweetman or Deputy Dillon could gather anything from them other than that I had stated that I regarded the granting of a ministerial order <Col N="54" /> detaining a patient for a further six months as a simple, routine task.  Is that not what they would have concluded from the wild and whirling words of the Leader of the Opposition?</P>
      <P>I went on then to describe the procedure which had been followed in dealing with requests for these ministerial orders, not merely in the Department since I became Minister, but under my predecessors, including a colleague of Deputy Sweetman.  I said that when I began to consider what the true procedure was, I saw little value in it, it had become so automatic.  I said further that I decided that it was desirable to make some change there.  The Government accepted my point of view in that regard and gave me the authority to make the change.  The provision making that change is embodied in the Mental Treatment Act, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the procedure which has been followed for years, followed since 1950 in the Department of Health, the procedure which is to be changed by the other Bill, is not satisfactory. Therefore, I am asking the House to make the change.  And if I have described the procedure as automatic, so in truth it was.  But my immediate predecessor was no less prepared than I or other Ministers to act like an automaton in this matter. He did it, however, with the willingness and connivance of his colleagues the then Minister for Finance and the then Minister for Agriculture, who carried collective responsibility with Deputy Tom O'Higgins in that.  I am not censuring Deputy O'Higgins for the fact that he could not overhaul the whole departmental machinery in the period at his disposal.  I am not censuring him for the fact that he followed the line followed by every other Minister for Health since 1950. It is very difficult to devise any completely satisfactory alternative to that which was embodied in the 1945 Act. In Section 18 of the Bill before the House I have provided for what I think is a somewhat better procedure than that which has prevailed hitherto. Yet we heard Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Opposition, a little while ago criticising this alternative to the <Col N="55" /> automatic procedure which has been in force up to now.  No matter what procedure is devised there will be loopholes, loopholes because the human element may fail and, of course, if it does fail, then something has to be done to remedy and correct the situation just as has been done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about the practice followed in relation to the patients in the Dundrum Mental Hospital and apparently wanted it to be adopted.  The inmates of the Dundrum institution are a very highly selected group of patients.  They are by no means the normal type of patients one gets in a mental hospital. They are very limited in number&mdash;I forget exactly, something like 75, 77 or 78.  In the ordinary general mental hospitals we are dealing with 19,000 patients and 3,000 applications for orders authorising extended periods of detention in a year.</P>
    <P>Are we going to have two psychiatrists called in, to sit with the resident medical superintendent at every mental hospital in the country before a ministerial order can be granted? Where should we get to?  What would it cost?  How long would it be before two people brought in in a consultant capacity could determine whether or not the order should be granted?  When you are dealing with people who are mentally ill, you do not just go in and feel their pulse and take a cardiograph.  They must be kept under observation for extended periods.  Should we have two consultants brought in to live in the mental hospital, keeping under observation these patients in respect of whom the resident medical superintendent feels he ought to apply for an order extending their period of detention?  Is that the answer to this problem which Deputy Dillon would propound?  I think it is ridiculous.  By and large, for the welfare of the patients and in the general interests of the community, we must rely ultimately upon the medical advisers, the people who are treating these patients, and accept their advice as to what it is best to do for them.</P>
    <P>Let me come back to this question <Col N="56" /> of what exactly happened.  There has been some sort of suggestion here that we were two and a half months or more thinking of how we intended to deal with the situation which has arisen.  The position is quite simple. This junior officer went on sick leave. I am not trying to shelter behind the person when I describe him as a junior officer.  I am pointing out how even the best conceived machine can go astray when the most insignificant, but essential, cog gets out of place, or a person fails to discharge his allotted task.  This junior officer went on sick leave on the 13th December, 1960. Within less than a week those who are responsible for that section had some reason to feel that perhaps something had gone wrong.</P>
    <P>About the 20th December, in response to inquiries that had been received from resident medical superintendents who had not been notified that the ministerial orders had been made, they interrogated the officer; they searched and they found 25 files, such as I have shown here, in a cupboard. As a result of that, on the 20th or the 21st December, the officer told them that he had not submitted certain files to the medical inspector and that these, of course, had not come to the Minister. It was then necessary to ascertain what had happened and, as a result of the information which he gave them, it was found that there were about 280 cases.  These 280 cases had to be sifted.  Inquiries had to be made in the case of every one of the patients concerned. That took a fair amount of time and it was when these matters had been fully gone into and all the necessary information was available that I was made aware of the fact.  The Dáil was not sitting.  I had then to consider what I should do.</P>
    <P>My first inclination was to say: &ldquo;These patients are improperly detained and they ought to be allowed to go out.&rdquo;  Further consideration indicated that that would have been the least humane course to take, that it would certainly have caused needless worry and would have affected the health of many of these patients.  The question then arose as to how we should deal with the matter.  The Attorney's advice naturally had to be <Col N="57" /> taken as to what provision should be made in the Bill.  That took a little time.  As soon as the situation was clear I came to the House and I put before the House all the facts.  In doing so, I did not attempt to hide behind anyone.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that, as Minister for Health, I carry full responsibility to this House for the manner in which my Department is administered but in these matters there must be some realism.  It is all very well to say that constitutional theory requires that the Minister should accept full responsibility for everything the Department does.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to accept responsibility for the fact that an officer of my Department suffers a break-down in health?  Is that my responsibility?  Is it my responsibility when that officer suffering from ill-health fails to do his duty?  Is there anything I could possibly have done to ensure that this would not have occurred?</P>
      <P>It is all very well to try to create a political crisis out of this occurrence which was, as I say, deplorable, but it does not arise out of any ministerial misconduct or out of any lack of zeal or supervision on the part of the higher officers of my Department.  The mere fact that, within three or four days after the official went ill, the situation which I have described as lamentable and deplorable was discovered again indicates that there was no lack of zeal or care, no lack of supervision, no culpable lack of any one of these things on the part of officials in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come to the House and placed the full facts before the House; I am prepared to accept whatever responsibility properly attaches to me. But there cannot be any blanket responsibility.  The House is bound to look at these facts fairly despite the gloss put on them, the attempts to distort them and magnify them that Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman have been guilty of here to-day.  Look at them fairly.  Could any person, any Minister, have ensured that a <Col N="58" /> simple, routine task of that sort, of putting one paper with two preceding papers and submitting the file to the appropriate officer, would have been invariably done when one is dealing with ordinary, human persons and particularly when, as in this case, one was dealing with a sick man?  I say it would not have been possible.  I am sure every fair-minded Deputy will accept that point of view also but, in any event, I am in the hands of the House.</P>
    <P>As to the officials of the health authorities to whom this Bill applies particularly, I should like to assure Deputy Corish that not one of them has failed in any way.  I think 255&mdash;I am discussing round figures&mdash;notifications were sent out.  There may be a weakness there.  The notifications were sent to these people stating that the ministerial orders had applied.  In the case of the 25 patients in respect of whom such notifications were not sent out, the resident medical superintendents of the eight hospitals concerned were on to my Department within a very few days asking why it was that the orders had not been made in respect of those 25 patients with whom they were respectively concerned.  It was, as I have mentioned, because we received these inquiries that the whole thing came to light; but, again, I wish to assure Deputy Corish that the R.M.S. were quite zealous and immediately tried to have that situation cleared up to their satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The main point in this Bill is to ensure, first of all, that those persons whom they, acting in good faith, have continued to detain as temporary patients during the current period will be in legal detention and not irregularly detained.  That is the first purpose of the Bill and the second is to idemnify the R.M.S. and other members of the staff of the mental hospitals against any possible action for damages.  I am certain that the House will accept my explanation and refutation.  I am certain that the House will accept that the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman, that I said that the detention of these patients was regarded as a simple, routine procedure, is untrue. <Col N="59" /> I repeat that refutation.  Deputies will also realise that I am not offering any alibi to this House; whatever responsibility rests on me for the situation which has been created I am prepared to carry and I am in the hands of Dáil Éireann.</P>

In my recollection these were the only two occasions when the Minister ever came to me.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring the Minister down to the paragraph beginning &ldquo;the following provisions shall have effect.&rdquo;  The indemnity is continued in subparagraph (iii) and is to the effect that no damages shall be <Col N="60" /> recoverable by or on behalf of the person in respect of his detention during the said period ending on the passing of this Act.  The &ldquo;said period&rdquo; is the period beginning on a day less than six months before the passing of the Act and the intention is clear that in respect of his detention for the period ending in the passing of the Act a person shall not be entitled to recover damages.</P>
      <P>This being an indemnifying Bill I merely want to raise this question with the Minister.  We should not, and of course we do not, intend to go any further in that section than is absolutely necessary and it is only intended to deprive the person concerned of a right of action in respect of the period during which there was not a proper order made.  I want to pose the improbable just to test the section.  If, in fact, one of these 280 people was originally brought into a mental hospital under a reception order which, in fact, was defective or not properly obtained I want to be satisfied that such a person in respect of any detention following the reception of it and any following detention may have whatever rights of action he ordinarily would have.  I suggest that would be achieved by inserting the word &ldquo;merely&rdquo; in this subsection which would then be to the effect that no damages shall be recoverable by or on behalf of the person in respect merely of his detention during the said period ended on the passing of this Bill.</P>

For example, supposing a person received an injury during the period of detention, I want to ensure that he can have no action in respect of unlawful detention, but that he can have an action in respect of an injury while so detained.  Let us take a simple case that often arises: a patient slips because the floor is too slippy and is unsafe, and gets an injury as a result. The Minister does not want to take away whatever right he may have in such a case&mdash;if he has a right, which depends on circumstances.  The Minister does want to take away, and quite correctly, in our view, the right of a person to sue in respect only of his detention.  As the Bill stands, I think it would cover everything that happened.</P>

On Fifth Stage, I am constricted and I cannot roam in the same way he has roamed, but I can and will say that, far from improving the position by what he said, the Minister has made it infinitely worse.  He has taken up a far more disgraceful position in relation to parliamentary responsibility than that which he adopted in introducing the Bill.</P>

    <P>It is the Minister's responsibility to this House to ensure that the personnel in his Department carry out their tasks and, if they do not carry out their tasks, it is his duty to this House to come here and express his personal regret.  He has failed to do that.  He has muddled things in his Department, because he has been trying, as Deputy <Col N="63" /> Norton said, to carry on wars on every front, and has had people in his Department running hither and thither, trying to provide him with dud ammunition for the purpose of carrying on wars, as if he were not able, out of his own resources accumulated over the years, to cause enough trouble without getting people to look for more trouble for him.</P>

Yet there might be a person with a traditional interest or a person who would not be a close relative but a connection&mdash;a business associate, for example&mdash;with an interest in knowing how the person came to be detained.

      <P>The request for particulars or information may, in fact, be known to the mental hospital authority to be antagonistic to the authority inself.  It may be embarrassing, inconvenient and, possibly, potentially troublesome to the authority, to have to give the information.  In those circumstances, it seems to me undesirable to give the mental hospital authority, which is the country manager or whoever he appoints to act on his behalf, the right to refuse entirely on the grounds that the person asking is not a proper person, without saying who is or is not likely to be regarded as a proper person.</P>

      <Col N="70" />&lsquo;222A.  A mental hospital authority may, subject to the sanction of the Minister, arrange for the provision of preventive or after-care services for any chargeable patient ordinary resident in their mental hospital district.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  The original section imposed a limitation on after-care services to patients detained in a mental hospital.  It is considered essential that such after-care services should be available to all classes of chargeable patients.</P>

To some extent, we may have to await the report of the Commission, but I do not think we shall. I think we will start an after-care service as soon as we have the requisite personnel.  Patients released will be visited in their own homes to try to get them to avail of the rehabilitation services and generally to adjust themselves to ordinary civilian life.</P>

It may be the exceptional case but I can certainly imagine the type of person who, if subjected to after-care of an ill-considered kind, might find that that was the worst kind of treatment for him.  Having been discharged from hospital, anything that might bring back into his mind his period of hospitalisation might have a harmful effect on him.

I believe as much as anybody in regard to the autonomy which these authorities should have but I think there should be some attempt at co-ordination by the Minister or the Department in endeavouring to get a uniform scheme.  That is being done successfully in respect of general treatment and especially in the after-care treatment of T.B. patients.  In respect of T.B., a national campaign was initiated by the Minister for Health at one period.  If this business of mental health and after-care treatment were tackled in the same way and if standards could be laid down which could be adopted by every local authority, much more good could be done than by leaving it to the discretion of the local authorities. I trust that the Minister will try to have introduced and established some uniform scheme of after-care treatment. Has the Minister some views in relation to the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify who is responsible for the repayment to the Minister for Justice of expenses incurred by the Garda in re-taking a patient who escapes from an institution other than a mental institution, e.g., from a general hospital to which the patient had been transferred for treatment there.  Under the existing provisions of Section 229 of the 1945 Act, expenses incurred by the Garda in re-taking a patient who escapes from a mental institution are repaid to the Minister for Justice by the person <Col N="72" /> carrying on the institution&mdash;in the case of a district mental hospital, by the mental hospital authority.  There is, however, no provision for a case where a patient escapes from any other type of institution.  The amendment will make it clear that where a patient escapes from an institution other than a mental hospital expenses incurred by the Garda in re-taking him will be recoverable from the person carrying on the mental institution to which the patient belongs, in the case of a district mental hospital, from the mental hospital authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 11 and 12, to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(h)  enquire as to the staffing arrangements.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appropriate section in the 1945 Mental Treatment Act provides for an inquiry by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals into staffing arrangements. The White Paper says that the present duties of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals are set out in the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  The purpose of the new amendment is to specify in more detail the duties of the Inspector. Indeed, to a large extent that is done very well.  The reason this amendment is moved is to re-introduce what was in the 1945 Mental Treatment Act.  There was provision for an inquiry into the staffing arrangements. As far as Section 33 is concerned, the duties of the Inspector are specified in greater detail, but I am also concerned about the staffing arrangements, especially in respect of the staff itself.  The staff of mental hospitals were always pleased to know that one of the Inspector's duties was to inquire into staffing arrangements and consequently into their wellbeing as mental nurses.  Perhaps the Minister would begin by telling us why this particular subsection, providing for an inquiry as to the staffing <Col N="73" /> arrangements, has been deliberately deleted from this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the reason really is to be found in the phraseology of subparagraph 2 of paragraph (e) which says: &ldquo;ascertain whether or not the care and treatment provided for the patients is adequate.&rdquo;  That would seem to cover, among other things, the staffing of the institution.  Perhaps the Deputy might feel it would be more satisfactory if the amendment were accepted?  I do not think it is necessary but I am prepared to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if it were included.  While the Inspector of Mental Hospitals is primarily concerned with the care and treatment of the staff, it is rather important that the Inspector should be empowered to inquire as to the general staffing arrangements with emphasis on the staff.  If the subsection is phrased in that way, it would be very desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is carrying it a little bit further than I would be inclined to go.  He would be entitled to inquire as to the adequacy of the staffing arrangements but I do not think he should inquire as to the care and treatment of the staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were a question of satisfying himself that the staffing arrangements are adequate to provide proper care and treatment for the patients, I would be quite prepared to accept the amendment.  While I am accepting it, it must not be taken that an obligation is laid upon the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, when he visits a mental hospital, to investigate any grievances the staff may have.  That is a matter more properly to be dealt with by the staff organisation and the authority of the mental hospital.</P>

We think that it should be left to the discretion of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals what documents he should require to be produced.

The requirements provide that all correspondence or letters to or from an intern patient shall pass through the person in charge of the institution.  I would hope to provide in the revised regulations that in future this will operate only where a person in charge considers it essential, in relation to a particular patient, that they will be opened and that the majority of the letters will be sent out without scrutiny.

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  an allowance under Part VIII of the Principal Act is, on the commencement of this section, in course of payment in whole or in part,</P>
      <P>(b)  the person to whom the allowance was granted was granted it by reference to his having been an officer who ceased to hold office on reaching an age limit, and</P>
      <P>(c)  it was not a condition of his having been appointed to be such officer that he should so cease to hold office,</P>
      <P>the body paying the allowance may, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Health, grant&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> (i)  an increase of the allowance, the increase being of such amount as the body may consider proper subject to the restriction that it shall not exceed one-eighth of the salary by reference to which the allowance was computed and,</P>
    <P>(ii)  an increase of the lump sum granted with the allowance, being an increase of such amount as the body may consider proper subject to the restrictions that it shall not exceed one-third of the salary by reference to which the allowance was computed and that it shall be such that the lump sum as increased shall not exceed four-thirds of the said salary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make provision for the addition of years in a very limited number of cases where people had to retire without full pension and their retirement was due to an age limit order which was not in operation at the time of their recruitment. The amendment limits the addition to a number not exceeding ten to the number of years on which the pension is based.  There was no provision under the 1945 Act for the addition of years for any person who had to retire under an age limit order which was not in operation at the time of appointment. In that respect the 1945 Mental Treatment Act was more restricted than the 1948 and 1956 Local Government (Superannuation) Acts.  The lack of provision has created some hardship in a small number of cases and it is desirable to rectify the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It would suit me better this way because I have to make some general comments.  It has been impossible, as has been pointed out by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for any member of the House, apart from the Minister, to attempt to make any effective change.  Any change that might be proposed from this side would be in the form of an amendment that would impose a charge on the State or on the local authorities and for that reason would be ruled out of order. It should be said straight away that the Bill does make some improvements in superannuation for staffs of mental hospitals, while, on the other hand, there will be some disadvantages for future entrants.</P>
      <P>The Minister should recognise the special position of mental hospital staffs, mental nurses in particular, which was recognised 15 or 16 years ago when the 1945 Mental Treatment Bill was introduced.  I do not recall the discussion but the Minister, or it may have been a Parliamentary Secretary, on that occasion justified the superannuation provisions embodied in that Act on the ground of the difficult and trying type of occupation that mental hospital staffs have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been difficult for a layman to tease out the difference between the <Col N="80" /> superannuation provisions of the 1945 Act and those in this Bill but I think I am right in saying that any mental nurse who does not opt out will automatically come within the scope of this Bill and will be eligible for all the provisions in addition to continuing to contribute at the rate of three per cent. and being eligible for widows' and orphans' benefits, as in the 1945 Act. The Minister will probably tell us that it will be done by regulations, that there will be a specified time within which the existing members of mental hospital staffs will be allowed to opt out.</P>
    <P>I do know that there was quite an amount of confusion in the minds of officers and servants of local authorities in regard to the 1948 Local Government (Superannuation) Act.  I do not think that tight arrangements were made to ensure that what the officer or servant wanted to do was done and many of us have had cases where there was a loose method of notification to the officer or servant as to what his right was, as to whether or not he should remain under the 1925 superannuation code or whether or not he should opt for the provisions of the 1948 Local Government (Superannuation) Act.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would urge the Minister to try to provide that there will be proper arrangements and that these arrangements will be made known to the officers and servants of mental hospitals, that they will know what their rights are with regard to opting in or out,</P>
    <P>I gather&mdash;I regard this as an improvement also&mdash;that the allowance and lump sum at retirement will be calculated on remuneration at the date of retirement.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I had put down an amendment&mdash;I do not want to pursue it in any detail, Sir&mdash;in respect of the death of an officer or a servant in the employ of a mental hospital.  The present position seems to be that if, within seven years, a male nurse, for example, dies in the service of the mental hospital, an allowance may be paid to a widow and children.  That should be stressed. It does not mean that he dies as a <Col N="81" /> result of injury incurred in the service of the mental hospital.  If he dies from natural causes and has had a period of service of seven years or over, his widow and children are entitled to a gratuity or allowance.</P>
    <P>The present proposals mean that it is only in circumstances where after seven years' service a mental nurse is injured in the course of his employment with a mental hospital that a gratuity or an allowance can be paid. There is a difference in that whereas heretofore only a widow and children could receive a gratuity or allowance, under the present proposals, if the mental nurse dies as a result of injury in the service of the hospital and has had seven or more years of service, a gratuity or allowance may be paid to his widow or her widower, a dependent father, mother or children.</P>
    <P>My amendment was ruled out of order but I must confess that in that amendment I had attempted to get the best of the 1945 proposals and of the proposals in this Bill because I believe that in view of the special type of work and most trying work that is involved, any advantages that could be given with regard to superannuation should be given.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is an improvement that a short service gratuity will be payable after one year's service where retirement arises from illness in service, illness, I assume, contracted and proved to have been contracted in the service of the hospital.  In the 1945 Act the minimum period of service was five years and it was an improvement on the 1909 Act which provided for ten years.  We can also agree that it is a substantial improvement to see that the service after which a gratuity can be paid where illness is contracted has been brought down to one year.</P>
    <P>I assume the addition of the years of service&mdash;I forget in what particular section it is done&mdash;is generally in accordance with the ordinary provisions of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act of 1956.  I mention these as improvements and it might be said that they are not the entire list of improvements in the matter of <Col N="82" /> superannuation for mental hospital staffs.  There are also disadvantages, of course.  The existing salary contribution for the purpose of superannuation is three per cent.  In the new proposal, to come into operation on 1st April this year, it seems that there will be four and one-sixth per cent. for a servant and five per cent. for an officer.  I assume, and if I am wrong perhaps the Minister will correct me, that this four and one-sixth per cent. and this five per cent. are the contributions ordinarily paid by local government servants and officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  It applies only to new officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, new officers or those who do not take the option. I have dealt with the advantage in the matter of the death of a servant due to injury but may I mention it again as somewhat of a disadvantage that there will be no gratuity or allowance in the case of death from ordinary causes?  There are no such gratuities or allowances for a widow or children but there is a provision for the payment of a gratuity or allowance in certain circumstances to other people besides the immediate members of the family.</P>
      <P>The retirement provisions are such now that a mental hospital employee, a mental nurse, may retire at 55 years of age.  That is the age at which a member of a fire brigade may retire. It is ten years sooner than the retirement age for the ordinary civil servant or for any officer or servant of a local authority.  I wonder has the Minister considered reducing that retirement age in the case of mental nurses particularly? I believe that the age at which members of the Garda Síochána retire is 52.  They may, if they so desire, continue in the service until they are 55 and, in some cases, until they are 60.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister not consider that there is a special case to be made for mental nurses, those who go into the service at 18 or 19 years of age and who serve in that capacity for 34 years?  It is a rigorous type of employment and one that is very trying. There is no necessity for me to describe <Col N="83" /> in detail the nature of the duty of a mental nurse.  The Minister and his officials are well conversant with the nature of their duties.  It affects them physically and in many other ways.  I think the Minister would be doing a service to mental nursing and to nursing personnel if he decided that retirement was possible at the age of 52 years.  If a special case can be made for the Garda Síochána a much stronger case can be made for mental nurses.</P>
    <P>I would like, in conclusion, to refer to a particular problem.  The Minister may not be aware of it as of now but perhaps he would inquire into it.  There is a proposal in the Bill to the effect that it will come into operation on the 1st April this year.  On that day new entrants will be subject to new conditions.  I have in mind people holding temporary positions as trainee nurses.  They are not regarded as officers.  They have been in a temporary position for some time and will not be deemed to be officers till 1st April this year.  I would like to know if these temporary trainee nurses will be subjected to the new provisions in the Bill.  I am informed that in one particular mental hospital there are 19 such persons and perhaps special consideration could be given to them.  They might be given the option of electing to work under the 1960 Act or under the 1940 Act.</P>
    <P>By and large, I think it would be right to say that there has been some improvement in the superannuation codes for mental nurses.  There are some disadvantages.  It has not been possible to attempt even to amend the Schedule in any way for the reasons stated by the Ceann Comhairle. Perhaps the Minister would consider some of the things I have mentioned, especially those in regard to the early retirement age and also to the position of the temporary trainee nurses who will not be deemed to be officers by the time the Bill comes into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot concede what Deputy Corish has asked in respect of the mental nurses.  After all, <Col N="84" /> in the prison service and in the case of the Central Mental Hospital, the officers may retire at 55 but they may also serve up to 60 years if they so wish.  A Garda may retire at 50 if he has 30 years' service.  Anybody below the rank of superintendent can normally retire at 60.  That is running contrary to the direction in which Deputy Corish would like us to go in relation to mental hospital nurses.  I think, after all, that they are being fairly treated if they can retire, having the necessary service, with full pension at the age of 55.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the trainee nurses, I think there is a point there all right, that they should be regarded as having entered the service.  I will look into it and see what can be done on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The necessity for this Supplementary Estimate arises from modest additions to the staff of my Department, and to increased expenditure on Legal and Technical Assistance.  In both instances the increased expenditure is due to a small expansion of the staff engaged on the preparation of proposals for law reform.  As Deputies are aware a Parliamentary Secretary was appointed since the original Estimate was prepared, and his remuneration, together with that of his private Secretary, is borne on subhead A.1 of this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gross sum required is £1,600, that is, an increase of £1,000 in the <Col N="86" /> provision for Headquarters Staff plus an increase of £600 in the provision for Legal and Technical Assistance. This sum of £1,600 is reduced by savings of £250 which it is expected will materialise on other subheads, so that the net sum asked for is £1,350.</P>

      <P>What is being done in regard to law reform?  We have on the Order Paper of this House for nearly eighteen months a Civil Liability Bill which has not yet been circulated.  I introduced that Bill as a Private Member's Bill in a previous House and in this House.  The Minister's colleagues in the Government voted against the First Reading of that Bill, giving an undertaking to me that a measure designed to deal with the problem I and others had in mind would be introduced.</P>
      <P>All that has happened is that a First Reading was introduced here and no progress has been made so far.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to enter a protest with regard to it.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an aspect of this Vote which requires comment. The Minister informs us that this sum is required to cover an increase in the provision for Headquarters Staff including emoluments for the additional Parliamentary Secretary.  I think there is an obligation on the Minister to tell why, for the first time since the State was founded, it has proved necessary to appoint a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice. We have carried on now for close on 40 years through a good many stormy and tempestuous periods and the Minister for Justice has been able to handle <Col N="87" /> that Department without the cost of a Parliamentary Secretary.  In the old-fashioned days the fact that he was the Taoiseach's son-in-law would call for comment but in modern times when Prime Ministers appoint their nephews and even Presidents their brethren to exalted office I suppose we are in the fashion here in preserving the family character of the Executive. <i>Tempora mutantur</i> and I suppose every generation has its own standards. However, I remember a day when it was considered a disqualification for public preferment that one's father should occupy a responsible position in the Executive unless at an election by the people.</P>
      <P>We have a Parliamentary Secretary now and under our arrangements he receives the appropriate salary and enjoys the amenity which all Ministers do of a car and two drivers to carry him around the country.  I do not think in the appointment of our Executive we should be pinchbeck or unreasonable but I do think that when for the first time in 40 years it is proposed to appoint an additional Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice, the Minister has an obligation to come before the House and justify that course.</P>
      <P>I can remember when we decided to appoint a Minister for the Gaeltacht. I approved of that decision.  I was anxious to see special measures taken to build up the Gaeltacht economically, so that instead of treating the people who are the last repository of the national language as a kind of museum exhibit, we would deploy our resources to draw them into an economic tie with the country without displacing them from the Gaeltacht which they adorned and which was the citadel of the spoken language, a citadel without which there was very little prospect of the language surviving as a living tongue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we brought that proposal before Dáil Éireann, all these aspects of it were swept to one side&mdash;and from these benches by the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;who delivered a diatribe <Col N="88" /> attacking the creation of a post for the accommodation of one individual Deputy of this Party.  If Deputy Lindsay had been the son-in-law of the Prime Minister of the day, according to my old-fashioned standards, I should have felt some measure of <i>malaise</i> at having to justify his appointment as Minister for the Gaeltacht.  In fact we were appointing a native of Erris to look after the people of the Gaeltacht because he knew the people and was well versed in their problems and well equipped in any Government deliberation energetically to defend their rights.  I think the decision to appoint him and to create the Ministry was a far-seeing, even visionary, step on which I look back with pride.  It made me laugh to see the economically-minded Fianna Fáil Party when they took office faithfully fetching from their ranks a tried and trusted soldier and installing him as Minister for the Gaeltacht.</P>

I do not think there is.  The Minister is an old and practised hand. He has been in this House for 33 years and there are few of its proceedings which are not familiar to him.  He has been a Minister for 20 of those 33 years and cannot claim to be inexperienced or terrified by the responsibilities of office.  I think it is a job for the purpose of grooming the beneficiary for another job and I do not <Col N="89" /> think that transaction should pass without comment.  We have travelled a long road since we were told with derision from the benches opposite that no man in the country was worth more that £1,000 a year and all the Ministers' salaries were correspondingly reduced, to the day we start appointing a Parliamentary Secretary at £2,000 a year, plus a motor car, to do the work which the Ministers have done unaided for 40 years to date.</P>
    <P>I could go into elaborate description of the burden of work and responsibility that was carried by the Ministers for Justice in the past as compared with the relatively easy burden they now carry but I do not want to emulate the example of the Tánaiste who thought it expedient in the recent past in his public speeches to travel over the panorama of history.  Let us not forget that panorama but let us bestow on it the charity of our silence and thank God that whatever transpired in those long-past, unhappy days, the State is still standing and we are the lawful Opposition and the Government the recognised Government of a State, the validity of whose foundations they once held in the darkest doubt.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone in the House will argue that the responsibilities of the Minister for Justice today are not very much lighter than they were in the days long ago.  There is no obligation on the Minister now to preside over the setting up of all the institutions which constitute our stability as a State.  All that has been done; it is now a matter of administration and not so very much of that.  I look to the Minister to give a comprehensive explanation of why this help is needed and why this charge is on the Vote.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the matter mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins.  He mentioned only one matter of law reform in respect of which a great deal of preliminary work had already been done and it is a relatively small point and yet, with our Parliamentary Secretary, we have not managed to reach on it so far.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters relating to law reform which could, with advantage, be attended to.  I <Col N="90" /> should have thought it no excessive burden on the Ministry of Justice to consider establishing in this country a law reform committee similar to that which I believe has functioned in Great Britain for several years now, which would be charged with the responsibility of suggesting to the Minister for Justice draft Bills designed to bring our statue laws up to date.  Perhaps the Minister has something of that kind in mind.  If he has, we would be glad to hear it, because if it has not been done to date, it ought to be done now.</P>

      <P>I want to add my voice to the voices of the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy O'Higgins, in a plea for a continuation of the very excellent activities which once went on in the Department of Justice by way of law reform.  I need only point to a few of them to illustrate the excellence of the work done then: the Statute of Limitations, the Married Women's Status Act and measures of that kind. There is a considerable amount, not only of law reform, but of clarification, which would assist both the litigant and the legal practitioner.</P>
      <P>I entirely support the view expressed by the Leader of the Opposition with regard to the unnecessary creation of a new post.  I should hate to think of the amount of decision, contempt and propoganda that would be used up and down the country, by the Fianna Fáil Party if, at any time, a Fine Gael Prime Minister chose to appoint one close to himself to what is, to all intents and purposes, a sinecure, and one which is wholly unnecessary in the promotion of the work of that Department.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy O'Higgins, all I can say is that the Bill about which he has spoken will, I hope, be circulated some time around the period of Easter.  It is a complex Bill, as he well knows, and it has been examined, corrected and discussed over a considerable period of time. When I say <Col N="92" /> I hope it will be circulated this session, I am merely expressing the hope that we will not find still more complexities which may cause it to be still further corrected.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Dillon, and to his remarks with reference to the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice, all I can say is that he must not have the remotest idea of the work which has to be undertaken in that Department.  I may say that when my predecessor was in office, he had the aid of the Attorney General at his disposal in this House as well as in the Department.  He also had the aid of the Taoiseach.  Am I not entitled to get the aid of a young man who, I can say without being too modest, is a legal expert in his own right and can deal with measures which are brought into the House and discussed with legal authorities on the other side?</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the volume of legislation prepared in the past four years by the Department of Justice is a record for any period of office of a Minister for Justice since the establishment of the State.  I am not making an over-statement when I say that.  Many of these Bills are of a most complex character.  There are two Courts of Justice Bills which will be circulated to Deputies very shortly, and which I feel sure will be discussed over a considerable period of time when they are circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pay this tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary: he has been responsible, as Deputy Dillon must be fully aware, for bringing into this House and taking through the House and the Seanad, the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill which is now an Act, the Rent Restrictions Bill, which is also now an Act, the Charities Bill which is at Report Stage.  There are the two Courts of Justice Bills, the Civil Liability Bill and, at the present time, he is working on a White Paper on the general subject of law reform.  I can say definitely to the House, and to Deputy Dillon, that the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice can be fully justified.  I can say, however, that some of the questions Deputy Dillon asked in respect to the appointment of <Col N="93" /> the Parliamentary Secretary were answered by the Taoiseach in reply to a Parliamentary Question asked, I think, by Deputy Dillon.  I thought the reply full and ample.  I have no apologies to make on behalf of the Government or on behalf of Deputy Haughey for his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £437,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Garda Síochána including Pensions, etc. (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c. 68; No. 25 of 1924; No. 7 of 1925; No. 10 of 1926; No. 32 of 1933; No. 5 of 1937; No. 19 of 1941; Nos. 1 and 17 of 1945; No. 41 of 1947; No. 44 of 1956; and No. 43 of 1959) and for payments of compensation and other expenses arising out of service in the Local Security Force (No. 19 of 1946 and No. 15 of 1949).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional sum is required mainly to provide for additional expenditure resulting from increases in rates of Garda pay and allowances. A sum of £427,000 is needed to meet the cost of the pay award, granted with effect from 1st March, 1960 which followed the acceptance by the Government in full of the findings of the Garda Arbitration Board on a claim for pay increases.  A further net charge on Subhead A of £63,000 is due to the acceptance of a recommendation by the Garda Conciliation Council for the abolition of the non-pensionable rent allowance and the establishment in lieu of a consolidated rate of pay.  The implementation of other recommendations by the Council has meant additional expenditure of £4,860 in respect of increases in the allowances payable to members who use their own bicycles on duty and to Inspectors and Officers who are required to own and use their motor <Col N="94" /> cars; another £4,000 is needed to meet an increase of 50 per cent. granted during the year in the rates of allowances payable for cleaning of public offices in Garda stations.  Also the necessity to maintain and extend the services of a large number of Garda on the Border involved expenditure additional to estimated requirements on the purchase of wireless and technical equipment.</P>
    <P>The cost of those items as well as the preliminary expenses in connection with the introduction of the police dog service amounted to nearly £10,000. Altogether the total additional sum required is £508,850 but savings on other Subheads and a surplus in the receipts which are appropriated-in-aid of the Vote have contributed to reducing the total to a net sum of £437,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any of us would wish to discuss the whole question of the Garda Estimate on this Supplementary Estimate which is largely to implement an arbitration or a conciliation award.  I should like to renew a representation I made to the Minister recently in Supplementary Questions.</P>
      <P>Under the new award, the single Garda will in future pay £1 a week instead of a rent allowance where he avails of accomodation in the Garda station.  One could make a very strong case that the accomodation in certain Garda stations is primitive.  It will take some time to put that to rights.  I trust the Minister will move expeditiously to improve the amenities where Gardaí live.</P>
      <P>Where Gardaí are living in, they should have hot and cold water on tap.  It is not reasonable to take £1 a week from a young Garda coming out from the Depot when, if he wants to shave or wash his face, the only water available is from a cold water tap or the local stream.  Many people get along fine with drawing water from the well; that is their own business. They are living in their own homes.  If they do not want to avail of schemes to bring running water into their kitchens, that is their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have decided to turn some Gardaí into tenants of the State on <Col N="95" /> payment by them of £1 per week.  Where men are required by the terms of their employment to be tenants of the State, they are entitled to stipulate certain minimal requirements.  The first is that they may be enabled to keep themselves up to the standard of neatness and cleanliness of the Garda Síochána which has been the admiration of our own people and of strangers.  They should have reasonable facilities to maintain that standard. In 1961, that involves hot and cold water.  With universal electrification of rural Ireland, even if there are not facilities for tanks in the roof and such other amenities, electric geysers could quite easily be installed over the basin or the bath.  Water supplies for most Garda stations are already available. If they are not, they should be made available by appropriate pumping facilities such as are commonly purchased by country people under schemes operated by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>If Gardaí must sleep in beds provided by us, the beds should be of a size into which they can fit longitudinally. They should be of a quality which will enable them to lie on them without counting the slats.  That is not an unreasonable stipulation.  These minimal requirements cannot be made available without a 6½-foot bed and either an interior spring mattress or a Dunlopillo mattress.  I had to resolve this problem in connection with the establishment of short-term courses for agricultural students at Athenry.  There was a question of providing facilities which would induce country boys to spend a fortnight or a month at Athenry.  It was generally agreed that unless reasonable sleeping accommodation was provided, the boys would not come to stay.  We scrapped the existing antediluvian equipment and provided them with beds of adequate length and reasonable comfort which contributed very materially to the advantage of the college.</P>
    <P>I mention these two specific points not because I think they are the only matters requiring reform in connection <Col N="96" /> with Garda accomodation, but because I think they are matters that could be promptly attended to, which would be evidence on our part of our readiness to approach this problem, if not generously, at least justly.  I have no doubt there will be a view expressed in the Garda that the suggestion I make now is grotesquely inadequate. That may or may not be, but at least it is a specific proposal which it would be possible for the Minister to implement without delay.  It is for that reason I avail of the Supplementary Estimate to bring the matter to the Minister's attention again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to that of the Leader of the Opposition to ask the Minister to improve conditions generally in the barracks down the country.  I have been told&mdash;I cannot vouch for the truth of it&mdash;that the members of the Force are not even allowed to improve their conditions within the barracks.  I should like to know from the Minister if that is true, that they cannot provide beds of their own and other personal conveniences because they are prohibited from doing so by regulation.</P>
      <P>The other point I have is in connection with the rent allowance mentioned by the Minister.  I should like the Minister to let me know if it is true that a Garda retiring at present after, say, 30 years' service will get 30 per cent. more pension than a Garda who had 38 years' service and who had to retire on the age limit prior to the last occasion pensions and allowances were fixed?  If such is the case&mdash;perhaps it may not be appropriate to deal with it now, but I am just mentioning it&mdash;I would ask the Minister to look into it, as a glaring injustice seems to have been done to the older members of the Force.</P>

      <P>I know that conditions all round are reasonably good, so far as the Garda Síochána are concerned. I have no doubt that in parts of rural Ireland there are Garda stations where the conditions are, perhaps, no better than those in the ordinary residential farms round about. I feel that in cases of that kind Gardai stationed in such places can, <Col N="97" /> and in some cases do, make reasonable efforts to create for themselves the amenities to which Deputy Dillon referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why he should.  It must be remembered that the conditions which exist in Garda stations are not of yesterday's or today's making.  They are there for a considerable time.  There are regulations providing for the replacement of such things as bedding and utensils in use in the various stations.  I do not think any of the rural stations have anything like hot water circulation <Col N="98" /> systems, for instance.  In certain of the new stations being built, efforts are being made to instal that type of equipment.</P>
      <P>I have examined quite a number of Garda buildings.  I have not been completely satisfied and I have made myself clear to the authorities on the conditions I have found.  I have recommended certain improvements and I know that these improvements have been, in fact, carried out.  When the question of the rent allowance was being discussed at conciliation level the Garda Representative Body were 100 per cent. in favour of that scheme. It was described at the time as a &ldquo;package deal&rdquo; that would benefit the vast majority of the members of the Force.  I have no doubt, as I said in reply to a Question, that some members would suffer to some small extent as against the benefits which would be secured by others.  But that is something that operates in the case of nearly every bargain made.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, I can assure the House that the conditions of the Garda Síochána have not deteriorated in any respect.  There will be improvements in the future, especially in those places where we are erecting new buildings. Generally, the conditions in the main Garda stations are good; though in the smaller ones they are not, perhaps, up to the same standard.</P>

In the case of dairy products (Subhead P.), exports of creamery butter produced in the 1960-61 season are estimated at 13,000 tons, valued at almost £3,500,000, representing a considerable increase on the previous year, and exports of other milk products are estimated at approximately £6,500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year proved to be a very good year for milk production&mdash;in fact the best on record, with one exception. We had a lot of rain, but not, as in 1958, too much rain so far as milk is concerned.  The price of creamery milk was increased by 1s. 3d. per <Col N="101" /> gallon as from the 13th April, 1960, and this encouraged milk producers to keep in production.  Furthermore, the efficiency of milk production has increased in recent years, and milk yields are tending upwards.  The fertiliser subsidies also are helping farmers to get a better return from their grassland than in the past.</P>
    <P>While the price of milk involves considerable State expenditure in present circumstances, it is not a very high price generally, judged by European standards.  It is essential to give a reasonable degree of support to milk, as it is the key factor in our whole agricultural economy.  Unfortunately, international butter prices have followed an erratic course during the past year, fluctuating from about 410s. per cwt. at the beginning of 1960 to 250s. recently.  We have been doing everything possible to divert milk from butter into other milk products, and the outlook is now quite promising for increased production of milk powder and cheese in particular.</P>
    <P>The payment on wheat (Subhead M. 15) relates to the special arrangements made for the benefit of wheat growers in 1960/61.  The total mill intake of wheat from the 1960 crop, at 350,000 tons dried, came very near the figure on which the wheat levy had been based, and the proceeds of the levy would have been sufficient to finance the disposal of surplus wheat if all or most of the wheat crop had been of a high-grade millable quality. Unfortunately, because of the very unfavourable season, a considerable proportion of the crop was not suitable for inclusion in the flour grist at the normal level, and, in order to avoid the losses which farmers would have suffered if they had had to take the feed price for such wheat, the Government arranged that the millable wheat prices would be paid for all sound and sweet wheat.  The net cost of this arrangement to the Exchequer is estimated at well over £1,000,000, of which £800,000 is being met in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The increased provision under Subhead M.14 is due mainly to the substantial rise in the production of pigs, and the corresponding rise in <Col N="102" /> exports of pigmeat.  Assistance is given to the industry, not only out of this Subhead but also out of the proceeds of the levy collected by the Pigs and Bacon Commission on all pigs slaughtered for conversion into bacon. The number of pigs in the country at the last June census was higher than at any time during the past ten years, and the deliveries of pigs to bacon factories during the second half of 1960 were also higher than in any previous year.  Prices for bacon on the export market remain rather uncertain, and there are signs of increasing production in most of the important exporting countries.</P>
    <P>I may mention that the new Special A grade for bacon, which we introduced last May, has been successful in establishing better quality standards, and this bacon commands higher prices in Britain.  It is generally agreed that there has been an overall improvement in the quality of our bacon during the past year or two, and, if we can maintain and expand the present volume of exports, we should be able to provide the continity of supply which is so important if the best prices are to be secured in export markets.</P>
    <P>Subhead M. 11 includes a provision for the special export arrangements introduced last July, whereby a market was provided for uncertificated fat cattle which, otherwise, might have had to be sold at very uncertain prices and might have been retained in this country for an unduly long period, thus increasing the risk of the spread of bovine tuberculosis.  This scheme is not a scheme of subsidies on fat cattle; it is a T.B. scheme introduced to meet a serious problem, but a problem which will pass within a couple of years.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the increase in expenditure on eradication of bovine T.B., compared with the original estimate, is that the amount of testing done by veterinary surgeons and the amount of payments on reactors and for the clear herd bonus in the south have been substantially greater than was anticipated.  This, of course, means that the pace of our activities under the scheme was accelerated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> There is also an increase in the expenditure on the special water supply grants under the Bovine T.B. Eradication Scheme.  This is a reflection of the increasing awareness of farmers of the need for a high standard of hygiene if the disease is to be kept permanently at bay.</P>
    <P>In the period since last December, seven counties in the west and north-west&mdash;Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Clare, Galway, Leitrim and Roscommon, have been declared attested.  The number of cattle in these seven counties is 1,250,000, or approximately one-quarter of the total number of cattle in the whole country.  The attestation of these counties is a major step forward towards the goal of complete attestation of the entire country. I am very hopeful that Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Longford can be declared attested by the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>We have recently declared a new clearance area, covering Counties Meath, Westmeath, Louth, Offaly and Kildare.  A great deal has already been done in these counties and the disease position has improved considerably. How quickly they can be attested will, of course, depend mainly on the efforts of the farmers and veterinary surgeons concerned.</P>
    <P>We are hopeful that we can begin clearance measures in the south in about a year's time.  The problem in the south is more difficult than in other parts of the country, but it is encouraging to note that the incidence of the disease in the south, though still heavy among cows, is considerably better than it was five years ago, and that the incidence in store cattle in particular has shown a marked fall. Under the Special Southern Scheme, 120,000 cow reactors have been removed from the herds since the scheme was introduced on the 1st October, 1959, and over 5,500 herds have earned the Clear Herd Bonus. The compulsory pasteurisation of separated milk, which has now been in operation since April, 1959, has also proved of great benefit.</P>
    <P>As regards the other subheads in this <Col N="104" /> Supplementary Estimate, it will be observed that provision is made in Subhead M.8 for the subsidy on potash fertiliser which was announced last April and came into effect on the 1st September last.  The phosphate subsidy is, of course, being maintained at the same time.  As a result of the subsidies, potash and phosphates are now available to the farmers at particularly attractive prices, and nitrogen fertiliser also is relatively cheap.  This is, therefore, a specially suitable time in which to increase the use of fertilisers, particularly on grassland which is the country's most valuable natural resource and which could be raised to a much higher level of fertility by judicious use of fertilisers and good management.</P>
    <P>In Subhead E.3, provision is made for a contribution to the Freedom from Hunger Campaign of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.  When introducing my Estimate for 1960/61.  I mentioned this campaign and that the Government had made a payment of 10,000 dollars to the FAO in support of the campaign. The formal authority of the Dáil is now being sought for this payment. The campaign is not of a relief nature&mdash;that is to say, it is not concerned with sending supplies of foodstuffs to needy peoples; its fundamental purpose is to improve the standard of agricultural practices in the underdeveloped areas, for example by sending first-class experts to these areas to help the various Governments concerned to teach their farmers better methods of cultivation generally; in other words, the object of the campaign is to enable the underdeveloped countries to help themselves.  It is a very sound and well-conceived scheme which has aroused world-wide interest, and I am sure that the Dáil will agree that it is well worthy of our support.</P>

I am glad to see Deputy Gilbride recovered from influenza and the fact that he says &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; reassures me that he is restored to health.  He has been saying it for 30 years but the Deputy has got out of touch.  The modern phrase is to say that &ldquo;grassland is the country's most valuable natural resource&rdquo;.  Deputy Gilbride will want to be careful because if he goes off the line again in the next general election, they will not adopt him.  He might be turned out to grass and he would not like that.  But orthodoxy is very necessary in order to retain the patronage of the Fianna Fáil Party and the modern orthodoxy is&mdash;note it well; I would be very anxious about Deputy Gilbride&mdash;&ldquo;grassland is the country's most valuable natural resource&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I have a word to say about the wheat crop and a word about it from your own Minister for Agriculture:</P>
      <P>The payment on wheat (subhead M.15) relates to the special arrangements made for the benefit of wheat growers in 1960-61.  The total mill intake of wheat from the 1960 crop, at 350,000 tons dried, came very near the figure on which the wheat levy had been based, and the proceeds of the levy would have been sufficient to finance the disposal of surplus wheat if all or most of the wheat crop had been of a high grade millable quality.

The nett cost of this arrangement to the Exchequer is estimated at well over £1,000,000, of which £100,000 is being met in the current financial year.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Killilea would like to intervene at a later stage of this debate and give his estimate of the economics of that operation?  I hope the Minister will answer my query when he comes to reply as to what became of the wheat on which we lost £1,000,000.  Has the bulk of it been fed to British livestock or what?</P>

      <P>God forbid.  I would not wish to think the Deputy had been constrained to consume any of the wheat referred to by the Minister because he says that that was not suitable for incorporation in the grist. All I am asking him is to tell us, when he spent £1,000,000 of our money, and in my opinion, rightly spent it, what became of the wheat. I think the Minister did the right thing last year when the millers started kicking up their heels in the autumn to take them by the lug, bring them in and say: &ldquo;Take in the wheat.&rdquo; I did it myself.  It did not cost me £1,000,000.  They took it in and liked it.  Now, under this dispensation, we paid them £1,000,000 to do it.  I should like to know what became of the wheat.  I have a pretty shrewd idea why we paid them the £1,000,000. Perhaps, for the information of Deputies, I should tell them that in the recent by-election we got no subscription from the National Association of Irish Flourmillers.</P>

      <P>The debates on agriculture, I always expect and always find, entertain the Deputies.  I feel responsible for their education.  That is why I got the bells rung to bring them in.</P>
      <P>To turn to certain other details of this Estimate which I would not expect Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party to understand so well&mdash;I am glad to see the Minister's reference to the diversion of milk into other export products and I would be obliged to him if he could give us any information on the prospective development of Bordens enterprise in the Limerick area for the manufacture and export of dried milk.  I think that is a good development.  It is a most desirable thing to establish contact with an organisation like Bordens which has a great international marketing organisation into which our output could be poured and effectively marketed.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that in one of the many markets to which Bordens have abundant access our total milk potential could probably be easily absorbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two things I should like to know&mdash;one a matter of detail, one a matter of wider concern.  First, what is going to happen to the Tipperary plant which is operated by the Dairy Disposal Board?  I admit that I have a certain sentimental affection for it because I think it was the first spray process dried milk plant established in this country and was established by the Dairy Disposal organisation at my instance when existing dried milk processors preferred to adhere to the roller process.  I would <Col N="109" /> be sorry to see the Tipperary project abandoned.  I would hope that a place would be found in the general scheme of things to expand and develop it.</P>
    <P>The second thing I should like to ask the Minister is: can he give us any indication of the likely price that will be available for liquid milk from the new Bordens enterprise which I understand will be mainly concerned with the production of spray process dried milk for export?  I assume they will be using whole milk, with no return of skim to the farmers, so that their purchase price can be most appropriately compared with that available from the chocolate crumb factory.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a good deal to be said even for that.  I am delighted that Bordens are coming.  I think it is a good development.  My solicitude is that there should be no artificial restriction on their capacity to process and export milk but, even if they are not going to buy milk, they are going to buy powder.  What I want to know is, will the price Bordens are going to pay, when you follow it back to the supplier, allow the creameries dealing with Bordens to pay the supplier a sum equal at least to the price at present available for chocolate crumb or can we hope that it might be a better price?</P>
      <P>I am prepared to concede at once that, so long as the price is as good as or better than the price available for milk for conversion into butter, always remembering that the milk-for-butter price has to be looked on in the light of the farmer getting back his skim, then the arrival of Bordens is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall be disappointed if Bordens' marketing machinery does not enable <Col N="111" /> the milk supplier to get a price as good as is available to him for chocolate crumb and if he can get any margin over that, then I believe the arrival of Bordens is an unqualified blessing for it provides a better price and a better market and these are the things of which we are most urgently in need in regard to the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>I probably would be better advised from the political angle to make disparaging observations but the plain fact is when we are dealing with matters relating to agriculture, I cannot forbear from taking a very great deal of interest in the matter, which is perhaps not suitable in a member of the Opposition.  There is only one anxiety present to my mind in regard to the Borden development&mdash;I have such high hopes of its potentialities&mdash; and that is, that we might fail on the subject of supply.  I am somewhat reassured by the knowledge that the supply will be drawn from a very wide area but, even so, it would be doubly tragic if we had to limit people or starve them of chocolate crumb or cheese in order to fulfil our undertaking to Bordens.  It is a matter of outstanding urgency that we should take up at once the advisory services as a matter of first priority.</P>
    <P>There is not a country in the world which cannot face that necessity.  I believe that there are very few parts of this country in which the output of the land could not be very nearly doubled by prudent husbandry.  We have the Minister's assessment of the advantage from the increased use of fertiliser and the increased efficiency of the milk producing industry but we are only at the very threshold of its potentiality.  Heretofore it was hard to engender enthusiasm for expanding production while the nightmare hung over the heads of the farmers that expanding production meant lower prices.  If we have effectively escaped from that nighmare our great danger would be that in the production of cheese, butter, chocolate crumb and dried milk there might be a hiatus.  To my mind there could be no greater disaster than that an undertaking like Bordens should meet the same fate <Col N="112" /> as the fish meal factory in Killybegs. Bordens is an act of faith in our capacity to supply.  The fish meal factory at Killybegs was also an act of faith but we could not control, and nobody else could control, the departure and arrival of the herring shoals.  That is a mystery that nobody can control but we can control very greatly the supply of milk.</P>
    <P>The only way we can do that is to place adequate resources at the disposal of the farmers so that they may get the maximum yield from the land. There is no way of doing that except by giving them the assurance that increased output will not mean a reduction in price and also in making available to them effectively the knowhow to get from their grass land the return of which those lands are capable if worked to the maximum capacity.</P>
    <P>I shall return to that part of the matter before I conclude but, in the meantime, I want to ask this question of the Minister for Agriculture.  Of the 350,000 tons of dried wheat, which represent the total mill intake of the 1960 crop, what tonnage has been rejected by the millers as being unsuitable for incorporating into wheat? What is the proportion for which they are claiming £1 million to compensate them for their loss in marketing what they describe as unmillable?  I find that very hard to take.  I can remember the harvest of 1954 which, I believe, was worse than last year's harvest, and I remember that I succeeded in getting the millers to take every single barrel of wheat and I gradually cleared that wheat into the grist.</P>
    <P>It took 18 months to finish it and I do not believe that they disposed of a single barrel.  That may be an exaggeration. I think we did convert some into white pollard but the vast bulk of it was converted into flour.  It took a great deal of trouble and time and it involved the milling industry in very difficult problems.  I remember saying at the time that I was very appreciative of the trouble they took to handle the wheat crop of that year.  That was true.  They did a splendid job and a very difficult job and they showed that they had the ability to do it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> I should like to know what proportion of these 350,000 tons has been declared unfit for incorporating into the flour grist and what we are doing with it.  Where has it gone?  I cannot divorce from my mind the fact that we are importing pollard and some bran from countries all over the world, including Russia.  I should like to be reassured that it is costing us less to bring pollard from Russia than to reduce this unmillable wheat into pollard and to sell it to our own farmers at this subsidised price which requires an Exchequer subsidy of £1 million.</P>
    <P>Surely we could have extracted up to 20 per cent. of flour out of this rejected wheat?  I do not believe that if we had got 20 per cent. out of the usual 70 or 80 per cent., and sold the residue as white pollard to our own farmers, we would have suffered any great loss.  I find it hard to believe that pollard of such an extraction would not have represented better value for our farmers than any pollard we may bring from Iraq, Russia or Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to note an increase in the output of pigs.  It is long overdue and I hope it will continue but I am continually haunted by an aspect of this situation which has always militated against the continued expansion of pig production.  I came to the conclusion that we would never get a satisfactory expansion of pig output if we did not remove from the pig industry the horror of boom and slump which has characterised it for the last 50 years.  The old cycle was that everyone went into pig production and pig production went up.  Then the price collapsed. Then everybody went out of pigs and the price went up again.  If you get a graph of our pig production going back to 1920, you will find that pattern repeated again and again with the regularity of a clock.  Then we introduced a system of guaranteed prices for pigs which, I think it right to recall, was related to the guaranteed price for barley.</P>
    <P>I was determined to stand on a guaranteed price for grade A pigs.  Since that, the Minister has introduced a new grade A, grade A.1, but I think rightly we refused to guarantee a price for <Col N="114" /> lower grade pigs than grade A because if we are to get really expanding production, we must get expanding exports and the plain fact is there is virtually no scope for the export of bacon produced from a lower grade of pig than grade A or grade A.1.</P>
    <P>I am not certain there is not still a market in the midlands of England which would absorb a stouter pig but I cannot pretend authoritatively that there is.  I used to look for it.  I did not succeed in getting it because the price structure in Great Britain at that time made it impossible, but I still believe the matter might be pursued, particularly with the bacon curing interests in Great Britain, who from time to time suffer from a serious shortage of pigs both for conversion into bacon and into other products which are very much more widely used in Great Britain than they are here and which can be best manufactured from a stouter pig than is normally used for bacon production.</P>
    <P>All that was designed to restore confidence to the pig producer.  That was the key to expanding production: a reasonable margin of profit and a reasonable guarantee that expanded production would not burst the market with a consequential slump.  I think we carried conviction to the pig-producing element of the population and that we did achieve that purpose.  Now I am afraid there is creeping in&mdash;and it is well this House should take cognisance of it&mdash;a growing distrust on the part of the small producer in regard to the grading of his pigs.</P>
    <P>I deliberately say &ldquo;on the part of the small producer&rdquo;.  The man who is sending 100 pigs a week to a factory and who knows that factory partially depends on the maintenance of those supplies for its economic operation, feels that he has sufficient control over the factory to demand that, taking one week with another, he will get 70 per cent. grade A or over.  If it turns out that he does not, he will go to the manufacturer and say: &ldquo;If that is the way my pigs are being treated, I will take them elsewhere where there will be more respect for them&rdquo;, and as a general rule, he will find that the bacon manufacturer will <Col N="115" /> be prepared to meet him.  It is the man who brings two, four or six pigs to the factory and gets maybe one grade A, two grade B and one grade X&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it and if the Minister would have a little patience, he would find I do not intend to say it.  I do not think the law is badly administered in this country but that does not deter me from saying to the Minister for Justice or the Chief Justice himself, if it were necessary, that it is not enough to administer the law justly; the law must be shown to be administered justly.  It is not enough to grade pigs correctly; you must convince the small producer that they are being graded correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 100 pigs a week man does not require that assurance because he feels he has a screw in his own hand which he can twist in order to get satisfaction by threatening to withdraw his supply of pigs.  It is the small man with anything from two to six pigs who gets unsatisfactory grading who feels aggrieved.  There may be revolutionary persons who say: &ldquo;Let the small man go&rdquo;.  I do not believe in that.  I believe that the whole idea that we ought to undo the land settlement and adopt the methods of Lord Lucan, the great exterminator, and wipe out all the small farmers in Ireland is all cod and if persisted in will plunge this country into irrevocable disaster.  We will become a dirty little proletarian imitation of a <Col N="116" /> down-trodden and down-at-heel industrial back yard.</P>
    <P>The only hope for this country of a prosperous agricultural industry is a large property-owning farming population on the land as the foundation on which to build a decent and expanding industry in our towns and cities.  The cornerstone, as well as its foundation, is the property-owning farmer and the property-owning farmer is the man who is going to produce six or eight pigs at a time.  I want to ensure he will continue to produce them and that he will feel that he is fairly treated when he brings them to market.  So long as he has a right to sell them in the fair where he can see the competition operating, where he can see a pig jobber standing back because there is somebody in on his pigs and that he would drive away the man who is in on his pigs, if necessary hitting him on the head with his stick, so as to let the other man in, he is reassured.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher would say: &ldquo;They used to form a ring.&rdquo;  If they wanted pigs, the ring did not last very long and if there was a surplus, the man was just out of luck.  Competition operated there and the small man knew that if he could not get a fair price from A, B and C were in the fair, too, only waiting to get in to bid for his pigs.  If he now has to bring them into a factory and they are slaughtered and he gets a piece of paper: &ldquo;2 grade A, 1 grade B, 1 grade C&rdquo;, he has a big sense of grievance and he has that sense of grievance because although he is entitled to go into the factory and see his pigs graded, he knows he is not able to do it because he does not know how, and what is the use of asking?  I was Minister for Agriculture for six years and if I went into a bacon factory in the morning to get my pigs graded, I would not know, either.</P>
    <P>I do know of one specific case in which a small man's pigs were corruptly and falsely graded.  I want to tell the House how that came about because it is a thing phenomenally difficult to prove.  I know of a case where a man brought up a cart with <Col N="117" /> two pigs in it to the factory and left the cart of pigs with a neighbour.  The neighbour was in the factory, to see his own pigs graded and to see his neighbour's pigs graded, at the same time.  He saw the man who was grading the pigs under the supervision of the Department's vet grade two pigs as grade A.  He saw the docket being filled out: 1 grade A and 1 grade B and he asked: &ldquo;Why are you grading that grade B?&rdquo;  The man who was in charge of the factory said: &ldquo;What has that to do with you?  Those are so-and-so's pigs.  Mind your own pigs and you will have plenty to do.&rdquo;  Then this fellow said: &ldquo;I am minding those pigs; they were left to me to mind.&rdquo;  That is the only case that I have ever come across in which the factory changed the docket back.  That may be as rare an occurrence as a white blackbird&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be accidental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.  I admit it may be rare but people do not believe it is.  I think we should try to devise some scheme, and I do not understand the difficulty in getting some scheme, whereby there would be independent control of the grading of pigs at factories. I am not unaware of the practical difficulties of getting that effectively done but it ought to be possible to work out some plan to do it.  It may be that when it is in operation it will be found that very little change results therefrom in the actual grading but there will be this fundamental change, that the small farmers will not only get justice but they will know they are getting justice and that is of the very essence of the confidence they must have if we are to get the measure of expansion in pig production that we should aim at.</P>
      <P>I invite the House to look with special attention at subhead M. 11, Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme.  That calls for expenditure in the financial year now ending of £6,642,000.  I think the Minister should give us a break-down of that figure. I have been trying to make up what it is for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot help feeling that the expenditure of over £1,000,000 for testing is a formidable sum.  I shall not be unreasonable with the Minister. I know he has his difficulties and I know the urgency of getting this matter expeditiously deal with.  Knowing the high standards that must be maintained in regard to the administration of this scheme, perhaps it would be convenient for him, for the purposes of the record, to incorporate in his concluding observations the precise breakdown of the items which, taken together, constitute M.11., with a statement of the salvage realisation, so that for future reference, these figures will be available to Deputies concerned about them.</P>
      <P>I spoke of the high standard it was necessary to maintain in regard to this matter.  The Minister mentioned naturally, the special southern scheme, the removal of cow reactors.  The Minister may remember that, prior to the Christmas recess, he was asked about certain developments in the Limerick area, and he stated that the facts relating to the matter had been referred to the Attorney General and, in those circumstances, he did not propose to deal further with them.  Has anything happened since?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the savings referred to in the Supplementary Estimate in connection with M.8&mdash;Lime and Fertilisers Subsidies?  The sum now required is £200,000, and the saving on other parts of the subhead is £115,000.  Are we to assume that the saving is due to less use being made of phosphatic fertilisers, or is it a result of a reduction in <Col N="121" /> the use of lime, or a reduction in the subsidy payable to Irish superphosphate manufacturers?  I am looking forward, with eager anticipation, to the day when the Irish superphosphate manufacturers announce to the Minister that they have new factories, fully equipped, and that they no longer require a subsidy to complete with continental producers.</P>
    <P>I noted, with dismay, that when the Taoiseach was announcing the subsidies made available to agriculture and industry, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, he included the subsidy paid to the Irish fertiliser manufacturers as a subsidy to agriculture.  It never was that; it was a subsidy paid to enable them to meet competition from fertilisers imported from continental sources.  Our plants were relatively antediluvian but they now have a completely re-equipped industry&mdash;at least in Cork, Wicklow, and, I think, in Foynes.  I eagerly await their announcement that that kind of subsidy is no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>I said that before I concluded I would return to the matter of the national advisory service.  Is it not fantastic to hear the Minister say in his last paragraph that we are engaged in a Freedom from Hunger Campaign of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations which is not a campaign to send food to the hungry, but a scheme &ldquo;to improve the standard of agricultural practice in the underdeveloped areas, for example by sending first-class experts to these areas to help the various Governments concerned to teach their farmers better methods of cultivation generally&rdquo;?  And that is at a time when, if you travelled this country, you would find that certainly 85 per cent. of the land under grass could be made produce twice what it is at present producing, by better methods of husbandry.</P>
    <P>The vast bulk of that underproductive grassland is due to two causes: (1) emigration, in some cases of the family who own the land, and the setting of the land in conacre to neighbours now that the family have gone; and (2) the fact that the small farmer working at his best just has not <Col N="122" /> yet learned what the rest of us only learned in the past 20 years&mdash;how effective is the use of phosphatic lime and nitrogen on grassland.</P>
    <P>Many farmers knew a great deal about the effective use of fertilisers on tillage land.  Some knew by experience, and some picked it up by reading and study, but the practice in regard to tillage bore little or no resemblance to the practice of the same man, never mind his smaller neighbours, in the husbandry of grass.</P>
    <P>There is work tomorrow for 300 additional agricultural advisers in this country to help our farmers to expand their productive economy off their own land.  I am as certain as I am that I am standing in this House that, in respect of 85 per cent. of the small farmers, if we placed at their disposal adequate advice of the kind they trusted and were prepared to accept, we could increase the income of every farmer under 50 acres by anything from 50 to 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>I say, advisedly, &ldquo;advice of a character which they would accept and trust.&rdquo;  That is quite a considerable qualification because, in advising, knowledge and skill are not the only requisites.  The adviser must also have the capacity to impart it and the personality to persuade the farmer to accept it.  Instead of facing that urgent problem, we are appropriating 10,000 dollars to send experts abroad &ldquo;to help the various Governments concerned to teach their farmers better methods of cultivation generally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the object of the campaign is to enable underdeveloped countries to help themselves.  That is very admirable, but anyone who has seen as many rushes growing on the grasslands of Ireland as I have seen in my day, must marvel that we are equipping ourselves to send our best agricultural brains&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What astonishes me is that we have 10,000 dollars to help other Governments to do for their farmers what we do not think it necessary to do for our own.  Surely that is daft.  To tell the truth, I am afraid to mention it here because, as sure as there is an eye in a goat, before the general election, Fianna Fáil will perform another somersault: one of the first planks in their election platform will be to provide an adequate national agricultural advisory service.  I do not know whether my political <i>id</i> or my agricultural <i>ego</i> should prevail in this matter.  To get it done is what matters to me.  I cannot conceal that it would give me infinite satisfaction to have the opportunity of doing it myself.  However, if the Minister sees the light between now and next September, he is welcome.

      <P>It would be well if this £10,000 were devoted to supplying limestone for farmers.  The farmers of Westmeath cannot get ground limestone as the quarry at Lanesboro has gone out of production.  No limestone can be supplied within a radius of 30 miles of Moate.  The nearest limestone quarry is at Ballinasloe.  All they can send to the Moate district are 20 tons a day.  This is urgent as the time is short.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not able to supply it.  Furthermore, there are difficulties in getting lorries.  There <Col N="124" /> was delay in getting a lorry.  When, eventually, one was got, it fell asunder with the first load.  Then there was no lorry for another week. The Meath lime quarry can supply so many tons a day more than they are able to get out.  They will not be allowed to exceed the 30-mile radius.  The railway company have a monopoly.  The Meath limestone quarry could use 20 or 30 lorries a day at present.  All the railway company can supply are four lorries. Heretofore, private lorries were available. Unless the Minister withdraws the operation of the Order for a month or so and extends the subsidy, then all that area will have no lime for tillage.</P>
      <P>The lorry problem should be taken up immediately with the railway company.  A lime contractor rang up the company and complained about not getting lorries.  He was told: &ldquo;We have lorries on the shelf.&rdquo;  They should.  They knew the rush was coming.  All these lorries are in the south with the Sugar Company.  They get the first chance.  We seem to get no service whatsoever in the midlands. It is the duty of the Minister to ensure that the people in the Moate district will get lime immediately for their tillage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience is similar to that of Deputy Fagan.  Why have many ground limestone quarries gone out of production in the past year or year and a half?  This matter is serious.  The small farmers in the west are no longer able to purchase the lime they require, particularly since the subsidy was reduced by 5/-a ton.  Under Subhead M 14, the Minister is seeking £300,000 for the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  Why is that sum required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said it is essential to give reasonable support to milk production as it is the key factor in our agricultural economy.  We used not have creameries in County Mayo; we never went into milk production there. Recently, a group of farmers from the Castlebar district decided to establish a separating station there and applied to An Foras Tionscal for a grant. <Col N="125" /> More than 2,000 farmers were prepared to put up over £20,000 for that purpose because of a serious deterioration in their way of living.  The costs of essential commodities were going up while their income was going down. A similar set of circumstances occurred 12 months ago at Claremorris where a grant of £3,500 was made, out of a total of £10,000, towards the erection of such a station.  Why were the Castlebar farmers refused, point blank? They were given no reason.  We must assume that despite the Minister's pious aspirations the Government on his advice precluded An Foras Tionscal from giving a grant.  Is that true?  Did they prevent An Foras Tionscal from giving a grant to farmers who were faced with the alternative of emigration or embarking upon a branch of agriculture in which they thought they saw some future?  But the very moment they try to do that, they are turned down for the grant.  I would ask the Minister, when replying, to explain why they were refused the grant.</P>
    <P>I see the Minister is asking for a certain sum for the export of uncertified fat cattle which otherwise might have had to be sold at very uncertain prices and whose retention in this country for an unduly long period might have increased the risk of tuberculosis. If we are to save the remnants of our small farmers, there must be some form of subsidy or equalisation of prices for the three principal items on which they depend &mdash;cattle, sheep and pigs.  The subsidy we are discussing was not introduced until it became an absolute necessity because of the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme.  There is no other means of saving the small farmer.  The pure gamble that his living has become is the reason the small farmer is being forced off the land.  It is rather serious that there has been such a fall in the production of ground limestone, and I should like the Minister to deal fully with that matter when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite a big Supplementary Estimate coming at a very late stage in the financial year.  Anyone looking at it can get some indication of the policy of Government <Col N="126" /> in relation to agriculture.  We have on the back here a sum of £3,565 towards the United Nations Organisation for the relief of hunger.  On the same page we have a subsidy of £2,100,000 for butter.  It seems to me there is something abnormal about this Government's agricultural policy.  The farmers are told to produce as much as they can.  In the Minister's speech today they were told to use more fertilisers and secure greater production. With all this money being expended on the subsidisation of butter and with all the money we are paying to the millers, there was not one word about better and increased marketing of our agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>What is wrong with the policy of this Government?  Is it a normal policy to pay £2,000,000 to subsidise a product you are going to sell and then to budget for £3,000 to assist in some way to relieve half the world starving of hunger?  We have got a rich agricultural industry here, which, the Minister and the Leader of the Opposition agree, can be considerably expanded and increased.  Is it a sensible policy to produce a Supplementary Estimate such as this?  If the Minister and his advisers study the world position they must know, if they place any credence in the international organisations to which we belong, as other countries do, that there are certain shortages in the world today and that those shortages ought to be concentrated on.</P>
      <P>There is a growing shortage of meat and it is likely to continue in the foreseeable future.  Admittedly, meat is an expensive product and it is only possible for the richer nations to buy it. But there is also a shortage of protein products, particularly of the derivatives of milk, not only in the countries of Europe but in the vast areas of the world where the people are undernourished and, in some cases, have not sufficient to keep them alive.  There is nothing in this Supplementary Estimate to suggest there is any idea at the back of the Minister's mind to encourage the farmers to produce the things they will be able to sell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it good agricultural policy to come into the House looking for over <Col N="127" /> £2,000,000 to subsidise a product? Admittedly, that product has to be sold.  But the people who are encouraged to produce that product are entitled, when no market is available, to have the benefit of the assistance of the Government.  I want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that the policy of the Government is wrong. It is not the first time this has occurred. We have been subsidising butter for the past three or four years.  We have been subsidising wheat as well.  It may be that it is necessary to do these things.  It may be that it is necessary to grow a certain amount of wheat in this country.  I shudder when I think of the thousands of pounds the Fianna Fáil Government have spent encouraging people to grow wheat.  Yet.  they are the very Government who are now trying to restrict and control the growing of wheat.  When they are up against a difficult situation, as Deputy Dillon proved very conclusively this evening, the only resort they have is to come back to the House and look for a subsidy of £1,000,000 to get them out of their difficulties.</P>
    <P>That is the plain fact of the case. The millers said the wheat was unmillable, and the Government accepted that, hook, line and sinker.  They bought the wheat from the farmers because they were under pressure from rural Deputies to do so.  Even a Dublin-minded Government had to accept that and buy that wheat.  But they allowed themselves to be entirely dictated to by a combine, a vested interest, in this country that has complete control over the whole system. Very correctly, Deputy Dillon asked what has happened to all the wheat taken in this country.  What wheat are we using now?  Are we using for bread in Ireland wheat grown by the Irish people, or are we using imported wheat?  The Minister is silent on that point.  How much wheat was used in the grist?  When the millers could not use a ton of wheat did they get a permit to import from outside wheat at a cheaper price than that paid here? What did they do with the profit they got?  Did they plough that profit back into the fund again?  Those are <Col N="128" /> the things we want to know from the Minister.</P>
    <P>In his short statement the Minister referred to the fact that we have 350,000 tons of wheat.  In spite of the levy which this Government imposed on the farmers&mdash;4/6d. a barrel&mdash;they have not enough money to see them through.  The argument is that he stood by the farmers; that he bought their wheat.  It is quite obvious that he bought the wheat at the expense of the taxpayers.  The people who made the money in the final analysis were not the people who grew the wheat. Every Fianna Fáil Deputy sitting on the back benches knows it is true that the people who make money out of wheat are the millers.  The millers dictated to this Government exactly what they wanted them to do.  They did exactly what they wanted to do without any severe control by the Government at all.  That is where the Minister failed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, I asked the Minister on several occasions in this House whether he could explain how there was no difference in price between attested and unattested cattle.  I always got the same answer.  We always get statistics from the Department of Agriculture showing that there is a considerable variation in the price, that the attested beast is going to make £8 a cwt. and that the unattested beast will be unsaleable.  With all the money we spend on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, the difference in County Wexford in three different lots over the past month was 2/6d.  There was a difference of 2/6d. in the price between attested and unattested cattle.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is getting cross again, I shall not pursue the subject beyond saying that in spite of what the Minister states and in spite of the statistics, <Col N="130" /> cattle that are attested in Wexford are making 2/6d. more.  Does the Minister think that he will reap the reward for the money he is laying out?  Does he think he has got the store cattle market he had two or three years ago? If he clears the whole country&mdash;providing he remains Minister for Agriculture, which I doubt&mdash;does he think he will be able to market at a profit? If the Minister can assure me, the Irish farmers and the House on that point, the money is well spent.  There is a growing demand on the taxpayer in regard to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>In regard to this Supplementary Estimate, the whole set-up is a question of trying to get production.  There is talk of increased production.  There is not one single item in the Supplementary Estimate to ensure that for any single product we shall get an increased market.  Over the past two or three years, since the Minister became Minister for Agriculture, there were unrivalled opportunities for getting new markets in many parts of the world.  This Government and the Minister who directs the agricultural section of it have done nothing to get those markets.  This Supplementary Estimate for Agriculture of £4,500,000 is just a confession of a bankrupt agricultural policy on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Might I suggest that a Supplementary Estimate of £4,500,000 for one Department alone creates a suspicion in my mind that this Government are not even going to face the Budget?  They will run out before that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before either lime or fertilisers are applied to the soil, the soil should be tested so that the farmer will ensure that the money which he spends on lime and fertilisers is not wasted.  Farmers very often are not able to get their soil tested in time to get the know-how as to what their land requires.  I hold that it is not necessary for an inspector from the Department to take the sample and send it down to Johnstown Castle.  I think it should be within the scope of any practical farmer to do it himself Indeed, if we were to wait for the agricultural instructors to do the job that is necessary under that heading, not alone would we want 300 agricultural instructors, as Deputy Dillon said, but we would want 1,000 to do the job that is required in that sphere of activity.</P>
      <P>I feel that every farmer should be at liberty to send his soil samples to Johnstown Castle to be tested.  The information should be made available to him so that he will know exactly the amount of lime, phosphates, potash or nitrogen or various other manures essential for the soil.  That is the first essential in the application of lime and manures and it is a waste of time to apply those when they are not required in the soil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some years now we have had a pig progeny testing station in Cork.  We expected great results from it and that we would have more grade A pigs going to the bacon factories.  However, I have lost all confidence in bacon factories. The bacon factories and the millers are the greatest culprits in bringing down the level of existence of the small farmers&mdash;the millers in the price they are charging for their rations and their pig feeding, and the bacon factories in what they give to the farmer for his pigs when he sends them to the factory. I know that when he sells them in the house or in the fair he can often get £2 a pig more than he would get if he sent them to the factory.  That shows there is something radically wrong in the bacon factories.  It has not been <Col N="132" /> rectified or solved by either this Minister or the previous Minister and I do not know if the next Minister will solve it.  There is no doubt the greatest racket is going on within the bacon factories which will ruin the pig industry.  They will give Grade A all right, and give a good price when pigs are very scarce, but you can send in the same quality pig three months afterwards and get £3 or £4 less.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the farmers are losing confidence in the whole set-up as regards pig breeding and the bacon factories?  Possibly we shall have a long discussion on this tomorrow when we discuss the setting up of the new Pigs Board.  Whether that will rectify the position or not I cannot say, but it will take some doing to break down the barrier that has been built up by the bacon factories and the millers who are reaping the reward of the hard work and industry of our small farmers.</P>
    <P>The problem of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis is a very big one and one which although it is being tackled very energetically is not going on satisfactory lines.  The incidence of tuberculosis is not being reduced to any great extent in the cattle.  The pasteurisation of skim milk had a good effect in reducing the incidence in the calves and young store cattle but when those young cattle are put into bad houses and contaminated with the disease they succumb to it again. Bad cow byres also contribute largely to bovine tuberculosis and if the Minister would bring in another Supplementary Estimate to restore the double byre grant, it would be the wisest course he could adopt at present for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. Good housing for the stock, coupled with good feeding when young, feeding with pasteurised milk, are the all important factors in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Until such steps are taken I cannot see much hope of getting rid of it.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the double byre grant and good housing for store cattle.  If the Minister could see his way to bring in a Supplementary Estimate for that purpose he would be doing far better work for the farmers than spending <Col N="133" /> the money&mdash;I would say foolishly &mdash;in other ways.  We have here a sum of £1,095,000 for veterinary fees for testing cattle.  If the testing were stopped in the morning and if that £1,095,000 were given to the farmers for suitable housing for cattle&mdash;the &ldquo;vets&rdquo; will get enough to do&mdash;it would have a far better effect and there would be a quicker return from the efforts to get rid of bovine tuberculosis. We know enough about it now. We know what bovine tuberculosis is costing but it will never be done away with until the housing problem is fixed.</P>
    <P>In the six southern counties we often come up against delays in the payment of the £15 headage grant.  It is very hard to understand at times but I usually find the Department very helpful and reasonable.  I want to point out that when the farmer sells his reactor cow in good faith, let it be at the mart or the fair, and gives up his red card and sends in the necessary document there really should be very little delay afterwards.  I know we have cases where dealers are not playing the game.  They are not sending in the cows readily enough to qualify the farmers for the £15 headage grant. That is a serious position for the dealer; it should not be a serious position for the farmer who fulfils his obligations by selling the cow.  Any dealer who is carrying on a practice of that kind, who is not doing his duty in sending in the cows as they should be sent, to a recognised factory, should be immediately dispensed with by the Department and should no longer be recognised as a buyer of reactor cows.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are not many involved in this racket but there are sufficient to create a certain amount of discontent and suspicion within the whole scheme because when a few farmers in an area must wait for three, four, or perhaps six months for the £15 headage grant they feel there is something wrong.  I know what is wrong; the dealers have not done their duty either by the State or the farmer. It is high time the State took very strong action with these gentlemen who are not doing the duty expected from them.  When they got the commission from the Department to <Col N="134" /> buy these reactor cows, they should have acted up to that commission and, if they did not, their services should be dispensed with.  At least, the farmer who sold his cows in good faith should not be the victim of such circumstances. He who sold his cows in good faith should get the £15 headage grant to which he is entitled.  I hope that will be the case in future.  I know that some of them are held up but I expect the Department will honour their agreement and compensate all farmers who sold their reactor cows to recognised dealers.</P>
    <P>At the present time the price of calves is very bad.  There is a glut of calves on the market because farmers, having gone through a couple of lean years, cannot afford to give new milk to calves.  I wonder what the position will be?  Where are all these calves going?  The number of calves at fairs and marts is very much in excess of what it used to be and the price is shockingly low.  I wonder if anything can be done to induce farmers to rear the calves as they did in the past?  I believe the growing of excessive quantities of wheat is largely responsible. Too much of the good land has been wheat-ranched and the land is not then available to take the surplus cattle produced in the south.</P>
    <P>We are presented with a Supplementary Estimate for the wheatgrowers and the millers' combine.  We have gone almost too far in wheat-growing.  I should like this country to grow sufficient wheat for its own requirements but I do not approve of excessive production of wheat.  The Cork Committee of Agriculture were unanimous in recommending wheat-growing on contract so that there would not be too much wheat grown. It is a bad thing to grow large quantities of wheat, having regard to the fact that we must pass a Supplementary Estimate for almost £1,000,000.  It would be better business if there were less wheat-ranching carried on and if more land were available for the cattle produced in the south.</P>
    <P>When too much wheat is grown, the price of offals for pig-feeding is excessive. I mentioned earlier the excessive price of pig ration which is killing the pig industry.  If wheat-growing <Col N="135" /> raises the price of the pig ration, it means that the wheat is being grown at the expense of the pig industry, which is a very serious matter for the small farmer.  The pig industry was of more vital importance to the small holder than the wheat industry was to the large holder.</P>
    <P>Wheatgrowing also entails importation of a considerable amount of very valuable machinery for which we have to pay very dearly and which lasts only a few years and then has to be renewed. Expensive machinery for wheat production is imported at the expense of many small holdings in the poorer areas which depend on the pig, poultry and egg industries.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to wheatgrowing but I am opposed to excessive wheat-growing and wheat-ranching.  It is detrimental to the interests of the country generally because it is costing too much in men, machinery and money and the sooner it is stopped, the better for all concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a large Supplementary Estimate for dairy produce.  I can appreciate the Minister's anxiety in regard to such a large Supplementary Estimate but the dairying industry, being the foundation of our whole economy, must get the protection of the State. The people cannot exist without the dairying industry.  It goes hand in hand with the cattle industry.  I hope it will always get the protection necessary for development.  With the introduction of subsidiary lines such as chocolate crumb and dried milk, I expect there will be a better future for the industry and that as a result of the development of the subsidiary industries in Limerick, Mallow and other places, there will be a better price for milk in the poorer areas.</P>
    <P>In the past, the people of Limerick and Tipperary always got a better price for milk than was obtainable in West Cork.  I believe that the reason was that the overhead charges were not as great as the overhead charges in West Cork.  In fairness, the people in West Cork should get at least as much for milk as the farmers up-country whose overhead costs are smaller.  If overhead costs are high in West Cork, it automatically <Col N="136" /> follows that profits are lower. It is up to the creameries, especially the Dairy Disposal Board creamery, which is Government-sponsored to do their best to bring down the overhead costs and give a better return to the dairy farmers of the area and so induce them to stay in the business.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to speak on this Estimate but it would be wrong on my part to let it pass without making some protest.  There are losses on the disposal of wheat amounting to roughly £240,000.  The Government can be accused of not making an effort to dispose of this wheat by a proper method and so save the taxpayers such an amount of money.  The Government knew well last October that this unmillable wheat was on hands.  The Department knew it and their advisers knew it, but they made no effort whatever to handle that unmillable wheat.  For three months they left it to stagnate in the stores with the Government sitting down, as they have done for the last number of years, and making no attempt whatever to handle it.  I heard Deputy Wycherley's suggestion that wheat was causing an increase in the price of pig feeding. I do not think that is a good point because last year there was no wheat used in pig feeding.  It was all used in the production of flour.</P>

      <P>The bran and pollard of foreign wheat were similarly used. There was no surplus.  I do not think that there is much ranching in wheat in this country.  The people in my own area grow wheat as a cash crop and there is no big ranching in it.  I think that the Government have not done their duty to the wheat farmers, and to farmers in general, by not trying to dispose of that wheat in time.  The wheat was there since last October and the first attempt made to handle it was in January of this year.  In the meantime the stocks could have been reduced by one-third or one-half.  Then they come along and, to damn wheat-growing, they dump it on the market and export it to give cheap feeding to other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> It seems to me that the Minister is more anxious about the people in his own constituency of Cavan than he is about the agricultural industry in general.  For years past, successive Governments have fostered the growing of wheat for the purpose of producing an article which is required by our people here.  There are many industries in this country the raw materials for which we have to import and the Government have been giving subsidies to these industries over the past year to bolster up a case for increasing employment.  Here is a case where men get employment on the land in growing produce required for the feeding of our own people and they are not getting the subsidies and encouragement which they are entitled to expect from a native Government.</P>
    <P>They have been let down badly over the last three months and I must accuse the Minister of not doing his duty by the wheat growers and by the general farmers of the country. Nine million pounds a year is a lot to pay for imports.  Here we have an article which is produced from the land by the people and which gives local employment and the Government have failed to give that encouragement to these people which would have prevented a lot of the emigration from the country areas. We all welcome new industries but we would prefer to see the people maintained on the land at the industry at which they and their fathers have always worked in this country.</P>

      <P>Some early reference was made to the fact that in portion of my speech introducing this Supplementary Estimate I referred to the importance of grass and of the improvement of our grasslands.  I think that on a previous occasion in this House I not only demonstrated but proved home to the hilt that for me personally, or for the Government of which I am a member, this is not a new discovery at all.  We were subsidising the use of burned limestone as far back as 1933.  In 1935 and 1936 we gave a subsidy on the use of phosphates.  I admit that at that time it was a modest subsidy but if it was, <Col N="138" /> then the price of phosphates at that period was also modest.  In that period phosphates were delivered to myself at £2 10s. a ton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of conversion as far as the importance of the improvement of our grassland is concerned.  The fact that substantial progress has been made by this Government in recent times towards the use of phosphates, and later towards the use of potash, is a demonstration of our interest in that development.</P>
      <P>Some point was raised here, and I admit that it is a source of disappointment to me, that the use of ground limestone appears to have declined somewhat.  I believe I know the reason; perhaps there are two or three reasons. One of the reasons, not only in 1960 but also in 1958, was the wet season. Some of the saving effected under this subhead was brought about because our Estimate last year provided for a usage of ground limestone in excess of the amount produced in the previous year. We thought, and apparently thought wrongly, that the subsidy on phosphates and potash would result in a greater use of ground limestone.  What I suspect occurred, even apart from the fact that 1959/60 was a wet season, was that phosphates became so cheap that farmers were tempted to spend whatever money they could afford on phosphates rather than on phosphates and lime as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard some Deputy suggest here that it was because of the withdrawal of portion of the transport subsidy that the use of ground limestone declined.  I mentioned here before in the course of discussions on this subject that ground limestone can be procured and spread on a farmer's land in most places for well under £1 a ton, in some places for as low as 15/- a ton.  Most reasonable people will <Col N="139" /> accept that farmers could not expect to pay less than that price if they are to be asked to pay for it at all.</P>
    <P>In preparing our Estimate for last year we reckoned on a sale of somewhere around 900,000 tons of ground limestone, and that was almost 200,000 tons in excess of the figure for the previous year.  As I say, that has not been realised; in fact usage this year will be less than 700,000 tons and somewhat less than the figure for 1959. I am still hopeful that while phosphates and potash may be cheap and may give perhaps more spectacular results in the early stages, farmers will see the error of their ways and use ground limestone to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>A Deputy from Westmeath mentioned that one of the quarries there had closed down.  It must be accepted that the owners of these quarries would not close down if they saw a prospect of continuity of employment and continuity of sales.  I admit that the springtime of the year is the time when there is the greatest rush, but lime can be applied to the land all during the year and there is no objection, even in respect of a small farm, to using lime in the summertime when the producers want to sell it and when it can be spread with the greatest ease. To listen to the Deputy who addressed himself to the fact that one such place was closed in County Westmeath, one would think the owner of such a concern could afford to keep it open for the farmers during those four or five weeks starting around this time and ending when the crop was in the ground.  I am disappointed that more use is not being made of ground limestone which is so cheap and which is so vital if we are to make progress in improving the land and improving the quality of the grass.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies spoke about the recruiting of expert technical advice to drive home to all land owners the importance of using all these devices in order to bring farming up to a proper standard.  Some reasons were given as to why landowners were falling down on their task.  There are several reasons for it.  It is not all a matter of emigration or of the movement <Col N="140" /> of people from rural parts.  Some of the reasons for it do not appear to have been mentioned.  However, even when we know the reasons I do not think any of us can find a solution for that problem.</P>
    <P>Anyone who knows rural Ireland knows that much of the land in the fertile parts as well as that in the parts which are not so fertile is in the hands of people who are getting old, who are late in getting married, who may be too far advanced when they become owners of the family home and farmstead.  Unable to find the means of settling down they lose ambition.  They just carry on in that free and easy way, leaving the land to itself.  They carry a low stock.  I do not think anyone will deny that that is one of the largest contributing factors to so much of the land having that neglected and deserted appearance. When you travel along the road, whether it be in West Cork, Cavan or any other part of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Or Sligo-Leitrim or Kilkenny, Antrim, Tyrone, Fermanagh or any part of the country where a farmer is active and ambitious and has taken the essential early steps, you will see in most cases he will have been able to bring the condition of his land and the capacity of his land to produce and to provide a reasonable income to a higher standard. Where that effort is made and where the land is reasonably good, satisfactory results can be obtained.  There is no disagreement on this matter but I am not prepared to admit that the answer to the problem, as presented here, is the recruitment of agricultural advisers, unless the landowners are prepared to make full use of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked to give a break-down of the figure for bovine tuberculosis shown in the Estimate.  While I have given most of them already, I think I should give these figures again.  The first is for fees to veterinary surgeons, £1,301,000.  Comment has been made on the enormous size of that sum and I agree that it is tremendously large but these standards were set for me <Col N="141" /> long before I came into this office There is no use in complaining about them now.  It may be that they are on the generous side, but we can say with truth that the task which we undertook in facing the problem of the eradication of this disease was known to be&mdash;and was in fact&mdash;in every country an enormous one.  I am quite sure that those who arrived at the determination of what the veterinary surgeons&mdash;the private practitioners&mdash; should receive for this work took all these factors into consideration.  Perhaps if I had the responsibility they had for that decision, I should do the same thing.  In any case, it is essential that the goodwill of the veterinary surgeons should be secured and naturally the element of compensation has quite a lot to do with securing that objective.</P>
    <P>The next item here is compensation for reactors, £3,398,500.  That also is a substantial sum, but again it was, and is necessary still and will remain necessary. It was necessary in the first case to cultivate the understanding and, as a result, secure the cooperation, of the farmers.  When a herd has been tested &mdash;perhaps a herd of 10 cows&mdash;if two three or four of these animals fail, these are often the animals that are most useful from the farmer's point of view, the best milkers, perhaps not the best from the point of view of appearance but yet the most valuable to the owner. The basis of the compensation in that case would have to be generous and would have to have regard to the potential value of the cows and the valuer would have to disregard the fact that when the animals were slaughtered they might give a very poor return on a per 1b. basis.</P>
    <P>This is one of the things on which I have kept a very keen eye because I could see the margin of difference between the appropriation-in-aid and the amount of compensation paid for these animals.  Of course, there are a number of other tests one could apply in order to see if uniformity was being preserved to a reasonable degree.  Just as I said in the case of the veterinary surgeons, it was necessary to be generous in these cases.  Not only that but there is evidence that in fact we were <Col N="142" /> generous and even though it has proved to be excessive, I have no hesitation in saying it was the wisest course to pursue.</P>
    <P>The next item is the headage grant to southern counties.  That amounted to £1,193,000.  I think there was only slight reference in this discussion to the headage grant and it was referred to as if it were more vulnerable from the point of view of abuse than the system prevailing elsewhere, the purchase direct by buyers representing the Department.  There is no justification whatever for that claim.  In fact the whole scheme was vulnerable enough but it is not possible to design a scheme that will not be vulnerable and if there were certain allegations in regard to the headage grant scheme in the five Munster counties and one Leinster county, there were also deep suspicions in many other cases and there might even be prosecutions in other parts of the country where direct purchase of reactors had taken place. I do not want to refer further to this, except to emphasise that there was no greater element of weakness from the point of view of danger of abuse in this scheme than in the other method which prevailed in other parts.</P>
    <P>The next item is the clear herd bonus which amounts to £167,000.  I think the number of clear herds which 5,500 in the counties concerned.  The have emerged as a result of that is next heading is &ldquo;Water Supplies.&rdquo; That subhead has jumped considerably to £113,000 and there is every evidence of a tremendous extension in the provision of water by farmers.  It is a very desirable development and one that will certainly be encouraged and supported as much as possible.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the export subsidy on fat cattle and beef which amounts to £241,000 and, as Deputies are aware, it is given for export and provision is made also for local butchers.  The purpose of this was not to subsidise but to make the prices of animals about which there might be certain suspicions more secure and to make the market more stable. Travelling expenses amounted to £85,000, tuberculin tags and byre grants to £67,000 and miscellaneous <Col N="143" /> items to £76,000.  The appropriations-in-aid amounted to £1,830,000 and the nett loss was £4,812,000.</P>
    <P>I was asked about the development with regard to Bordens.  I myself feel that development is one of the most desirable things that has happened for quite a long time, so far as our dairy products are concerned.  It is not easy, however wise it may appear, to change over from reliance entirely on the production of butter to the production of chocolate crumb milk powder, chocolate crumb and a slow process.  This development, so far as I know, will not be very spectacular in the early stages.  Bordens are erecting a packing, sorting, processing and marketing centre at Mallow&mdash;I do not know how far they have advanced&mdash;and they will depend upon a contract with five centres in which the milk powder business has been in operation&mdash;Mallow, Mitchelstown, Dungarvan, Tipperary and Limerick.</P>
    <P>I do not know, as yet, what form their contract will take.  It may be a two, three or five year contract and I expect it will contain some quota provision to start off with.  That will be necessary because there are other purposes to which milk is being diverted in those areas, milk for chocolate crumb and milk for manufacture of cheese.  It will be necessary to have a planned programme.  Bordens are operating in other countries, I take it, and I suspect they are not philanthropists. No matter how big or how powerful they are, I suspect they know, and have regard, to the price at which milk for conversion into milk powder may be obtained elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We have to have regard to a number of other factors.  We are anxious to have milk converted into cheese, milk powder and cheese.  It is rather any other milk product for which there is a reasonable market, provided it is likely to reduce the amount and the extent of the burden being carried by the taxpayers in respect of the sale of butter or any other milk product. We are anxious, naturally, to divert milk to purposes which will relieve <Col N="144" /> the Exchequer and the taxpayers to the greatest possible extent.  For that reason, and believing that the firm of Bordens will make a contribution towards that end, I certainly welcome that development.</P>
    <P>On the matter of wheat and the provision being made for the disposal of unmillable wheat, I want to say that everyone in this House realises that the harvest of 1960 was even worse than it looked&mdash;and it looked bad enough.  As I said in my introductory remarks, the amount of dried wheat realised from the harvest of 1960 was 350,000 tons.  If it had been a normal year, the calculations we had made in order to determine the amount of the levy would have been very nearly accurate.  The weakness in the levy system, from the point of view of relieving the taxpayers in years like 1954, 1956, 1958 and 1960, is that it does not have regard to the fact that in our circumstances and with our climate, we can have a bad season such as we had in the years to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>While it is a simple matter to use 75 per cent. or 80 per cent.&mdash; or a higher figure for that matter, for all I know&mdash;of Irish wheat in the grist, when the quality of the wheat falls to a very low level, that is a different matter entirely.  I do not claim to be an expert on what a good loaf is, but those who consume bread, even though they are not experts, have a fair idea of the quality of a loaf.  The housewife will have a fair idea of the quality of the loaf, and the price of the loaf, and the price of everything else.  When the consumption of flour, say, has fallen for any reason, there is no sense in our talking about the provision of a loaf from the wheat of the 1960 harvest just as if the standard were as high as the wheat of the 1959 harvest.  As I say, the dried wheat intake amounted to 350,000 tons, and I think the usage percentage would be roughly about 100,000 tons.  We have not finally determined this question as we have submitted it as to millability and usability to a number of authorities. Assuming the amount should be around 100,000 tons, we have yet to dispose of 250,000 tons.  I am asked <Col N="145" /> where it is.  Most of it is here.  We are trying to sell it at home.  We are exporting some of it.  We are trying to dispose of it so as to face next season's harvest.</P>
    <P>We have a guaranteed price for barley, too.  That guaranteed price and the provision of feeding compounds at the lowest possible rate are important considerations for those engaged in pig production, the feeding of livestock, and so on.  We cannot deal, in isolation, with a problem such as our last harvest.  Rather, we must have regard to the whole picture and try to be fair and reasonable to everybody.</P>
    <P>On another occasion we shall have an opportunity of dealing with pig production and the marketing and grading of pigs.  There is no thought in my mind other than to encourage the small producer to remain in business. I should like to retain the small producer and to encourage him to become a little larger.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances and with conditions as they are everywhere, it is not reasonable to expect that a small farmer could get an income or secure a profit from three batches of four or five pigs, which would represent about eighteen pigs a year.  If the man who knows everything that is to be known in relation to pig production could be encouraged to produce, say, twenty at a time it would be a very good thing. The recent grants for piggeries are weighted in favour of the small man. There is a place for the fairly large producer but let us load the dice, as I <Col N="146" /> have tried to do, in favour of the smaller man.</P>
    <P>I shall have something to say, later, on the grading system.  I do not want to convey that business people are saints; none of us is.  I have no interest in protecting them.  However, I dislike charges, which I feel are false, as to dishonesty on the part of these concerns. There is no reason why the trader with whom I deal should not be a rogue any more than any other businessman.  I never question the weights he gives me.  Some people may do so but they are a very small percentage of our people.</P>
    <P>If I own a bacon factory and if I want to be a rogue it is not easy to see how I could successfully carry it off without the co-operation of my employees. I know the suspicions of the country man and the small man.  Sometimes he may not get it fairly; sometimes it may be entirely accidental; maybe, the odd time, the dishonest thing could happen.  I do not suggest we should defend what is wrong or unjust. However, it is better not to condemn as swiftly as we are prone to do in this House and as public men outside are prone to do.  We ought to be able to protect ourselves and the producer without doing that.</P>
    <P>Vote put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday 8th March, 1961.</P>
