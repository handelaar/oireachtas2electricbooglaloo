    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, Deputy Lynch represents a generation that is passing, a generation that was railway-minded.  At the time railways developed there was no other means of long distance travel.  They evolved in a period when the horse and the ass and cart were the main means of travelling.  I can understand people like Deputy Lynch regretting the passing of the railways, and particularly the branch lines.  I myself have very pleasant memories of train journeys in the old days, but those memories do not blind me to the fact that we cannot now go back to the ass or to the rails.  We must always keep in mind the fact that railways must pay if they are to survive.  No case was made by either Deputy Lynch or Deputy Wycherley that the railways can pay. I have another complaint against Deputy Lynch.  He travels to town in his motor car.  I do not blame him.  I think he is perfectly entitled to do that. <Col N="752" /> In his championship of the Waterford-Tramore railway he suggested that this was in the main a passenger service. He is, of course, right in that.  I remember listening to Deputy Lynch making a speech in Tramore last summer on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  If my memory serves me correctly, he arrived at his venue in a motor car.  He did not use the line about which he is now so perturbed because of its being closed down.  As I said last night, the bulk of the people who used the Waterford-Tramore line were people coming in from Tipperary, Kilkenny and Waterford, people who up to the present had to trek two miles across the city in order to get to the railway station for Tramore.  I have no doubt these people will welcome the fact that they can now step from the railway station in Waterford and get into a bus which will take them to Tramore without having to walk across the city.  I do not see why the railway line from Waterford to Tramore should be continued if it cannot be made pay.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wycherley did not make much of a case.  He was mainly complaining about Dr. Andrews and the Board of C.I.E.  He almost suggested to us that he himself could settle all the problems of the Cork-Bantry line if he had the opportunity.  He could tell us where they were all wrong.  He could abolish half the stations on the line.  He could do all kinds of queer things.  He pointed out to us, however, that he approached some board or other in west Cork which used a lot of road transport and asked them to transfer their goods to the railways. But the person in charge of that institution pointed out that if they were to use the railways, they would have to pay an extra 10/- per ton.  The railways do not pay at present; but if they had to cut their prices by a further 10/- per ton, the deficit would be very much heavier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that the mobile lorry cannot be beaten.  I do not think any business man would use the railways if lorries were available. Deputy Wycherley was worried about the number of people employed on <Col N="753" /> the railways.  I would think there are at least as many employed on road transport services as on the railways.  He suggested that half the stations on the line in which he is interested could be abolished, but he went on further to suggest that the line could be extended to Glengarriff.  In these days, at any rate, I think that is a fantastic suggestion. In 1959, the railways cost us over £1,000,000.  Undoubtedly, last year, because of savings made by closing lines, the cost by way of State subsidy was only £500,000.  But in the circumstances of these days it would seem strange that any sensible group of people would extend that railway as far as Glengarriff for the sake of whatever passengers might use it during the three or four months of the summer.</P>
    <P>The Deputy told us a fantastic story about the wife of the President of the United States.  We are happy to know she came from that part of the world. The Deputy said she would arrive in Cork and would be happy to get into a comfortable train hauled by a diesel engine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with what Deputy Wycherley said.  He told us we should remember what happened during the emergency and what would have happened if we did not have the railways.  If he had diesel engines in his mind, we would be in the same position we were in during the last emergency.  I remember having to spend six hours in a train to get from Dublin to Clonmel.  These trains were mostly without heating and were not to be recommended.  These suggestions are being made, apparently, so that we may have some means of transport during the emergency, but where is the use in compelling the taxpayer to meet the expenses of these services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing struck me very forcibly in this matter of rail transport.  Some years ago, I called on the higher officials at Kingsbridge with a group in connection with the closing down of a railway in my own county.  I refer to <Col N="754" /> the Cashel-Gooldscross line.  After arguing with the officials for some time, one of the officials asked the members of the deputation if petrol were available would they discard their vans and use this railway line.  Would they give up their motor cars and use it for passenger service?  The members of the deputation were honest enough to admit they would not do any such thing.  I heard, and I am perfectly certain it is true, that many of the people who attended these gatherings to protest against the closing of railway lines, drove to these meetings in their motor cars.  Further, several of the people attending at least one of these conferences were the owners of motor transport lorries.  I was told that if four or five of the people attending these protest meetings gave up the use of their own lorries and used the railway instead, the railway in question would not have to be closed because there would be sufficient traffic to keep it going.  Only foolish people would imagine that business men will use the railways if motor and lorry transport is available.</P>
    <P>The railway journey from Waterford to Tramore is non-stop.  Anybody in between stations would have to use some other form of transport.  If Deputy Wycherley's suggestion that we close down half the stations on the Cork-Bandon line were adopted, the people there would be in the same predicament.  Since we cannot go back to the horse and the ass of the old days, they would have to try to find a bus or some other transport.  In my own part of the country, on the journey from Clonmel to Cahir, a distance of 10 miles, there is no railway station. There is, however, a very good bus service.  People living three or four miles outside the town would take a very poor view if the bus service were taken off and they were brought back to the situation existing ten or twelve years ago when no buses were available.</P>
    <P>No matter how much we regret the passing of the railways, we must take into consideration that if they do not pay, and particularly if they do not give the service, they must go.  The important thing the State will have <Col N="755" /> to keep in mind is the convenience of the general public and the solvency of the railways.  These are the two items which should influence them.</P>
    <P>I very much regret the necessity for condemning these lines, but I do not see any alternative.  I did mention here on another occasion the first railway line that I remember being abolished.  It was the line from Clifden to Galway.  I remember the terrific protests that were made at that time about the closing of that line.  The fact that it would take £800,000 to make the line safe for people to travel on it did not influence the people who were protesting.  I am now informed that if it were suggested to the people living in the districts that were served by that railway that rail transport should be brought back and the mobile bus services and road transport services taken off, the protests would be very much more vehement and, in my opinion, very much more to the point.</P>
    <P>I remember the time when we had the tram system in this city.  If anyone were to suggest now that the trams should be brought back and that we should get rid of the buses or if anyone were to suggest that the buses are not giving a service equivalent to or better than the service given by the trams, nobody would take him seriously.</P>
    <P>I am compelled to feel that all the protests that we have listened to in connection with the closing down of these lines are purely artificial.  I, personally, do not believe that the people making these protests really have the interests of the people at heart.  The people must be provided with the service that they want, with the service which is most convenient for them and, of course, the State must keep in mind that the railways must pay their way.</P>
    <P>Dr. Andrews was condemned in this House by Deputy Wycherley and Deputy T. Lynch last night.  Dr. Andrews was set the task of making rail transport pay within a certain number of years.  It was a very difficult task and he had to do many things <Col N="756" /> which he would not wish to do, I am sure, if it were possible to avoid doing them.  He had to make the transport system pay.  When I hear people like Deputy Wycherley telling us that he could make the railways pay and knew how the railways in West Cork could be made to pay, and all that kind of stuff, it sounds rather odd, to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>Dr. Andrews has no particular reason to abolish any railway line.  His purpose would be to keep railway lines going if it were possible that these lines could pay and could give the service that the people want.  I am perfectly certain that he could not do either of these things and consequently he was faced with the necessity of abolishing the railway lines.</P>
    <P>There was one point of Deputy Wycherley's speech to which I take exception. A man making a case for the railways should not almost suggest that other branch lines should be condemned and abolished.  Deputy Wycherley last night gave a list of five railway lines and his suggestion was that they were less entitled to be kept running than the West Cork railway line.  The natural reaction to that suggestion on the part of people like Dr. Andrews would be, perhaps, to have the question examined and, if the suggestions of Deputy Wycherley were found to have any truth in them, to have the lines that he mentioned abolished. When a man is making a case he should have sufficient grounds to make the case without condemning lines serving other places.</P>
    <P>I do not see any useful purpose that this discussion can serve except to give a certain number of Deputies opportunities to make the shocking speeches that we listened to last night. We had a speech lasting three-quarters of an hour from Deputy T. Lynch. I venture to say there was not a solid argument made in that three-quarters of an hour.  We had a speech lasting one hour and ten minutes from Deputy Wycherley.  Yet, Deputy T. Lynch complained that there was a suggestion made by the Taoiseach that all that these deputations, speeches and agitations could do was to give certain <Col N="757" /> people an opportunity to make big speeches.  I certainly think the supporters of the motion should reconsider their attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to consider this matter from a slightly different angle.  I accept the view that the House cannot reasonably expect to run C.I.E. or any other State undertaking. Having said that, I believe that in this matter there is an obligation on C.I.E. where decisions are about to be taken which affect the services in a particular area to consult the interested parties before reaching a decision.</P>
      <P>When the Transport Act, 1958, was going through this House the impression was undoubtedly created from the remarks of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce that before C.I.E. would reach a decision on any matter such as the proposed closing of a railway line or a change of services in a locality, interested parties would be consulted.  Without attempting to read anything further into this statement than was contained in it, the implication was quite clear.</P>
      <P>Some few months ago C.I.E. decided to close certain stations on the Dublin-Dún Laoire-Greystones line and when that decision was announced various groups of people came together and convened a meeting for the purpose of making representations to the company on the matter.  I should say at the outset that the meeting was entirely non-political in character and all Deputies representing the constituencies served by the railway were invited to it.</P>
      <P>When the group appointed by the meeting sought a discussion with the directors of C.I.E. or the authorised representatives of the company they were informed that the company would be prepared to discuss arrangements for alternative services but not to discuss the proposed closing of particular stations.  Quite naturally, the people concerned felt aggrieved at that decision.  They felt there was an autocratic tendency manifested in a communication which said that the company were prepared to meet a deputation, not to discuss the proposed closing but only the question of alternative services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> As I said initially, I believe the ultimate responsibility for decisions of this nature must rest with the company but that does not give the company or its representatives the right to make such a reply to a deputation who seek an interview, persons who are interested and who in this particular case have no political interest whatever. There were supporters of different political Parties in the group and the elected representatives of all political Parties were invited to the meetings.</P>
    <P>It is natural that people should feel aggrieved and should feel that where the company lay down predetermined conditions for an interview there was not much point in it.  There is no obligation whatever on the company to accept the views expressed by a deputation but the public and groups of this sort feel that at least they are entitled to make their case to the company and that having made their case, then the company or the officials concerned could take their own decision.  Where a group are told before entering into discussion that the company are prepared to discuss a matter on the basis of terms laid down by the company people feel that there is running through that decision not merely a suggestion of autocratic tendency but an unwillingness to hear the people concerned because before the meeting is held the predetermined lines have been announced by the company.</P>
    <P>One of the disabilities under which statutory companies suffer is that on many occasions decisions are not properly understood.  The public relations system at a certain stage breaks down and if the full facts were known and understood people would have at least an appreciation of the other point of view.  Therefore, it is important for C.I.E. as well as other statutory bodies to ensure that as far as possible they would have public confidence.  In order to secure public confidence it is a good thing to take the views of groups into consideration and to consult with them where such consultation is requested.</P>
    <P>In the case with which I am familiar, the Dublin-Dún Laoghaire-Greystones line, the railway services were not being <Col N="759" /> discontinued.  Certain stations were being closed and certain services terminated, particular trains at particular hours.  The people naturally feel that if they have a view on a matter of this sort they are entitled to have it considered and that even if the company reach a decision ultimately to close a station or discontinue a service, at least they have had their viewpoint considered and that all aspects of the matter have been taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Statutory companies of this sort are there through express legislation passed by the House and are there in the case of this company to some extent, indeed to a considerable extent, through payment of subsidy which is subscribed by the taxpayers.  While nobody expects or could reasonably expect that this House or any group should attempt to run a statutory undertaking of this sort, nevertheless, the public have a two-fold interest; first, they are entitled, within reason, to what they consider are adequate and suitable services; and, secondly, as taxpayers they are entitled to have their position safeguarded to the full.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, out of line with modern consideration of these matters, where consultation and public confidence is concerned, that a statutory body should appear to act in an autocratic fashion.  If in this matter the company had interviewed the deputation and had then come to a decision, people would have felt that, at any rate, their views had received due consideration. When ultimately a deputation was received it was received quite courteously and the company officials listened carefully to the matters put before them.  However, even on that occasion, during the course of the meeting it became obvious that a statement had been prepared in advance of the meeting for issue.  There again the members of the deputation felt the question was predetermined.</P>
    <P>It is the right and responsibility of the company, under statute, to take decisions, but equally the public and interested parties are entitled to have their views considered.  Having heard those views the company is still free <Col N="760" /> to take whatever decisions it believes to be in the best interests of the company and the service.  From a communication which says the company is prepared only to discuss alternative services or from a statement which is prepared for issue before the meeting takes place, the only conclusion to be drawn is that the company was not really interested in getting the people's views but because of whatever undertaking was given to the House it was obliged to go through the forms.</P>
    <P>Nowadays people do not like the suggestion of an autocratic attitude, more especially when not merely are the taxpayers vitally concerned, but also the public interest insofar as the service provided is also affected.  I would be glad if the views expressed by interested parties received proper and due consideration in matters of this sort.  It is one aspect of the matter which if properly attended to would eliminate a good deal of unnecessary conflict and the suggestions that the company is not attentive to the interests of particular areas or to matters which affect or even appear to affect a certain group or section of the community.</P>
    <P>There are other questions, such as the manner in which the finances of a particular line are determined, how the costs are arrived at, how charges are assigned to certain lines or services, on all of which different groups may have different views and on all of which C.I.E. may have particular views.  These matters could and should be appropriate for discussion where a certain service is concerned. One of the matters with which the group I mentioned, in connection with suburban railways, was concerned was that some of the items which had been charged to their line were not appropriate.  In some cases these are technical questions and in other cases they are financial questions which should be quite appropriate for discussion at an interview such as local groups seek to have with the company.</P>
    <P>In all of these cases, a lot of the criticism expressed would be avoided if the company had received a deputation, without any agenda except in so far as the particular interest is concerned, <Col N="761" /> without pre-determining the lines of the discussion while having the ultimate right to take the decision that was thought correct.  If that were done, much of the criticism would have been avoided and a great deal of the public confidence in the operations of the company would have been maintained as well as a proper understanding of the various interests concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Every member of the House and the public outside, I feel sure, are interested in preserving our railway system as a vital artery of our national transport.  With that in view, I was among the first to urge the people of West Cork to marshal their resources to save their railway when it was threatened with extinction.  I am particularly interested in that railway because I lived beside it since my youth and half of its length of 60 miles passes through my constituency.</P>
      <P>Before that vital step was taken I was anxious, as indeed was everybody in that area, to examine every aspect of the matter and try to develop an attitude of mind which would bring to that railway further traffic and a better service.  There was a Committee of Inquiry which recommended that the experience of a number of years under new conditions would show the value of the service.  This railway, to my mind, did not get the opportunity of having its merits examined under new conditions.  The only thing new that happened was that a few diesel engines replaced the steam engines that had been there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years in debates in this House I have pointed out that train service and parallel bus services at the same hours were running through West Cork and that there should be a re-organisation of the services on more economic lines.  Very little notice was taken of that but if we turn to the other side of the river, to the line to Cobh, no buses were permitted to run parallel to that system beyond Cobh Junction.  That railway is flourishing.  I do not suggest that all the buses through West Cork should be cut off or limited but that they should be run at different hours, <Col N="762" /> starting from Cork, from those which operated in the case of the trains.</P>
    <P>There was no opportunity for the people of West Cork to avail of their week-end services in any reasonable way.  I know one or two people who worked in the new German factory in Bantry, others who worked in banks and two or three teachers, all of whom were anxious to come home to Cork to spend their week-ends with their relatives and friends.  But, in order to do that, they had to leave Bantry by rail, arriving at Cork at five o'clock on Saturday evening, and in order to get back to their work they had to leave by bus at 9 or ten o'clock the following morning.  There was not a service whatsoever to the important towns in the distant parts of West Cork during Sunday unless there was a match or something in the city when a special train might be available.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the railways got no chance as far as passenger traffic was concerned.  As far as goods were concerned, it is perfectly true that in many cases the number of wagons required were not available and that the people who intended to send beet and other commodities had to make some other provision and to take some alternative means of transport.  Loading banks could have been provided and if the wagons were available the beet could have been loaded off the banks, but no steps whatever were taken to provide such banks.</P>

      <P>I live among the people and I know well how the circumstances <Col N="763" /> worked out.  I know the railway had the cartage of the great bulk of the beet in the early stages and that ultimately they lost&mdash;41,000 tons travelling by road and 43,000 tons by railway.  The railway lost 50 per cent. of the traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would cease interrupting me I would appreciate it.  It was because the lorries sent out a loader and a helper to the farmers, and the railway did not provide the same service.  Furthermore, when the people around my area required a C.I.E. lorry that lorry had to travel from Cork empty, whereas if they had local lorries those lorries could take the farmers' produce to Cork or wherever the destination was and come back with a load.  That is the kind of position that existed there.  We saw yesterday morning a magnificent film on the bogs of Ireland and the production there and of the railways that were provided through those bogs.  Many of the railways in West Cork run through boggy land and it was a great service indeed to the people who had to provide money for the upkeep of roads that some of the traffic was off those roads and on the railway.  What was envisaged in West Cork was that every effort would be made to send traffic to the railway rather than have it closed down.  While that effort was not made in West Cork, we were told that they canvassed their customers but what was wanted was to canvass people who were not customers, but who were potential customers of the railway and to receive a deputation in open forum to discuss all these matters and to hear the railway side of the story.  To my mind that would have been a better approach but the whole matter was very badly bungled.</P>
      <P>On the 27th November, 1957, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, dealing with the internal transport position, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the financial problem that I should perhaps <Col N="764" /> deal with now.  There is, I know, a popular belief that the financial difficulties of C.I.E. are due mainly or entirely to the continued operation of branch lines.  All the information available to me would make it quite clear that the elimination of branch line operations would not make any appreciable difference to C.I.E.'s financial problem.  The C.I.E. Board tell me that there are 22 branch, link and secondary lines and that all these branch, link and secondary lines between them lose £100,000 per year.  That loss on these lines has to be related to the over-all loss of £2,000,000 on the operation of the whole system. Against that loss of £100,000 per year on branch line operation the Board claim that these branch lines contribute traffic to the system worth over £800,000 per year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made that statement which is on record and when the new Board were appointed it was easy for them, rather than try to reorganise the system, to close it down.  Then there would be no loss in that particular branch.  As a matter of fact there might be a temporary gain on the sale of railway lines and equipment.  We find in countries abroad that railways are being developed in development areas and here we are closing them in an area which we hope is now entering a more progressive stage and where railways are established and where we should be trying to improve the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole point is that if the Board had a strong case they could have met the people from the area.  The West Cork Development Association which has been trying for a number of years, and with some success, to establish industries <Col N="765" /> in the area were anxious to discuss the matter with the Board.  I have the greatest personal admiration for the chairman of the Board.  I do not wish to&mdash;and I think nobody in justice could&mdash;criticise him, because his record of achievement on the turf bogs is outstanding, but I would say the Board failed in not making a proper approach to the matter, in not receiving a deputation to discuss all aspects of the situation.</P>
    <P>The Board has been criticised for painting its system.  That is not a just criticism because they would surely want to preserve their property.  We know that the station at Kenmare has been sold to a firm who are establishing an industry.  Whether the railway closed or continued that was a necessary maintenance cost.  I do not criticise that at all but I say that the cost that will now come on the roads will be very heavy indeed as it has been in other places.  The engineers were criticised for their report.  I know the engineers in this case and the report was examined very closely. If I recall rightly it was on my motion that the report was presented. Straightening out these roads to remove dangerous bends and bridges and that sort of work would be very costly and apart from that, the upkeep of the roads through bog land will put a heavy impost on the local councils, an impost that could be avoided by maintaining the railway and giving it at least the chance which was envisaged and getting some experience of its working under the new conditions.  The Board did not give it that chance.  They had five years to do it and after one-and-a-half or two years they decided to close the railway rather than do anything to gain traffic for it to convenience the people and preserve the line which was a main line over the past 100 years&mdash;the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway. If not a main line, it was at least a secondary line, and the only contact with the main system was by a link system across the city with no regular services.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that more industries have come to West Cork since that announcement was made <Col N="766" /> than heretofore.  It is well known that the West Cork Development Association, for the past three or four years, have been active, visiting the Continent and trying to get people interested in that part of the country.  They have had some success.  If industries are coming at this particular time the question of the railway is not affecting the matter because they would come at any rate.</P>
    <P>One very big industry for Skibbereen was interested in a railway siding; another Canadian proposal for Bandon cropped up and I went out there myself with the promoter who seemed very pleased that a railway was so near at hand.  However, as the Minister said, alternatives may be provided but if the railways were allowed to remain, at least some of the traffic would definitely have come to them, particularly from the Skibbereen industry&mdash; the other has not gone ahead so far.</P>
    <P>Some 120,000 tons of traffic in goods and produce passing along the railway would be fed into the main system. Now the possibility is that that 120,000 tons will go elsewhere and that the railways will lose that traffic.  It was pointed out very definitely by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the quotation I mentioned that it was the feeding of the main line by the branch lines that helped in some measure to provide the business which gave the system a chance of paying.</P>
    <P>In regard to the 200 people or so working on the various parts of that system, some will be pensioned off, some transferred elsewhere, and it will require a major industry in West Cork to provide the employment that is being lost.  That is obvious to anybody and in accordance with the progressive policy of the Government that particular industry would have to be subsidised to be established.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that there have been no complaints after the closing down of lines in other places.  That is a bit unrealistic; the railway has been closed down and complaints are late.  What we tried to do was to establish beforehand that this railway would be a workable proposition.  It is complained that people use motor cars and lorries.  During the long railway strike eight or ten years ago, <Col N="767" /> which I made an effort to settle in my capacity at the time and which lasted a number of weeks, several firms in order to get their business done had to purchase lorries and establish private systems of transport which they are now slow to get rid of.  It would take some years, as mentioned by the committee of inquiry, under those conditions to bring about the necessary change.  All these things could have been considered if we had had a different approach to the matter.</P>
    <P>Other branch lines &ldquo;got the axe&rdquo; also but I have spoken about the one I know best.  I think it is a retrograde step that towns like Bandon, Courtmacsherry, Timoleague, Clonakilty and Skibbereen and such places should be left without a rail service.  Surely the main line passing through half the width of Ireland should not have been dealt with in this way without the people concerned in the area having been heard by the Board.  If the Board had an unanswerable case there was no reason why they should not have met these people and discussed the matter with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should like to congratulate my colleague Deputy MacCarthy.  I agree with every word he said.  He has spoken quite factually and honestly and I admire his forthright approach to this matter.  It should refute the contention that there was anything political in the agitation about the West Cork railway.  I think it is preposterous to think there was.  No political Party spoke to me about it.  I got the correspondence Deputy MacCarthy got and which I presume my other colleagues from the constituency also got and I was asked to intervene on behalf of West Cork.  I am doing that not because I was asked but out of sheer conviction.  I am a railway fan and I always use the railways and I have tried to give a good example in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion and the amendment accompanying it should focus attention for all time on the inadvisability and the danger of establishing boards <Col N="768" /> and giving them power independent of this Parliament.  If we want to maintain a flexible, democratic pattern in our Parliamentary system we should ensure that public boards of this kind should have their major decisions subject to the sanction of the Minister.  There is no doubt about the fact that this C.I.E. Board was set up under the Transport Act, 1958.  We all admit that and that very wide powers were given to the Board under the Act, but it was clearly, convincingly and conclusively demonstrated by Deputy McGilligan that it was implicit in the Bill then before the House that in any major decision two months' notice would be given.  That two months' notice would provide the opportunity for trade unions, employers, or parties having a grievance to put their point of view.</P>
    <P>Why was that opportunity denied in this instance?  What was C.I.E. afraid of?  What was the Minister afraid of? Even if that Board had these complete powers is it contended that the Minister had no influence at all with the Board of C.I.E.?  Is it not obvious that if the Minister gave a direction to the Board now, or at any time during the past two months, that they should receive that deputation, that the Board was wrong in its decision and that it would be better if a reprieve were given to the West Cork railway for two years, it would have been better in the long run?  If the Minister had given that direction is there anybody who can contend that C.I.E. would refuse it? After all, the Board was set up by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce and as he said himself he was getting the best brains in the country from the point of view of experience and qualifications to run that Board and having set up that Board the members must have felt privileged and proud to be called on to undertake such responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that they have done some magnificent work but they cannot be allowed to continue in such a ruthless fashion in order to approach their objective.  That is what is happening in this case.  If the Minister had the right to appoint the personnel has he not the right to detain or dismiss them?  Is it not in accordance with <Col N="769" /> human nature that any board appointed will always realise that no matter what powers they have he is the authority who gave them their powers and they should always be actuated with the desire to co-operate with the Minister concerned?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister endorse the action of C.I.E. or has he indicated to C.I.E. that he is prepared to accept their decision? Has the Taoiseach endorsed the action of C.I.E. in closing the West Cork line or would he not at this late day make a request to C.I.E. that in the national interest and in the interest of West Cork their decision should be deferred for two years to give the people of West Cork the opportunity to return traffic to the railway? I see the Minister shaking his head, indicating &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  He has already indicated in the course of the debate on the 16th February that he did not look upon the railway as being sacrosanct and the Taoiseach himself said that in a progressive modern State we cannot maintain systems that are out of date.</P>
    <P>Why did C.I.E. supply the West Cork Railway line with diesel engines? Why paint all the stations during the past 12 months?  Why spend public moneys, the taxpayers' money, on renovations of that kind and then come along after that and scrap the West Cork railway system?  I could characterise it in no other way than as national vandalism of the worst type. Surely the Minister can assume power enough at this moment to check that abuse.  The whole approach was entirely unsympathetic and entirely undemocratic. We pay lip service to the principle of democracy in our country. We say the people are the masters. Where are the people now?  Where is the mastery in the case of the people of West Cork?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>The two most important activities in the Minister's Department are transport and power.  If there are two boards in charge of these two activities, and if they have complete powers then why maintain a Ministry such as the Department of Transport and Power?  Why not scrap that Ministry and the Department concerned, and let the officials go back to other Departments and save the taxpayers' money to the tune of many thousands of pounds?</P>
      <P>None of us will criticise the personnel of the Board.  I take it that the Taoiseach is quite right when he says that he has got the best in the country to take this responsibility.  We have however the right to criticise their policy.  The Board got the function that they were to try to make C.I.E. meet its obligations by the revenue they would get on the services. Having failed to do that they picked out railways that have not paid.  It is most unfair to take out the loss on the railway service to West Cork and not give us the figure for the road transport service.  It is unrealistic to segregate these two figures.  They should have given us the net gain and the net loss and let us realise the actual position.</P>
      <P>Loading facilities were not provided for beet on the West Cork line.  Over and over again I heard farmers complain of that very thing.  The Minister may again shake his head.  Deputy MacCarthy was born in the area and knows that what I say is true.  I represent part of the area and I know it well and I should be in a position to voice the complaints I heard over and over again.  Not only is it true of West Cork but of many areas, as I shall try to point out later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not criticising in the least the personnel of the Board.  It is quite obvious that the Board faced <Col N="771" /> with the position as it is, by 1964 must have got C.I.E. to show a balanced account.  Here there is a ready opportunity of making approximately £500,000 on the sale of the rails that will be taken up on the West Cork line.  Is the Board attracted by that possibility so that they will have a nice nestegg there to safeguard against losses in the next three years, until they will be left to stand on their own feet?  It is only natural that they will try to build up a reserve fund.  That is all right from the business point of view but it is all wrong from the point of view of the people who had that service over the years.</P>
    <P>The Minister characterises the reasons as being sentimental.  I agree there are sentimental reasons.  Sentimental reasons are quite valid reasons in many respects.  If we had more sentiment for the things of value to us, we would be less likely to rush into changes and fall victims to the modern agitation for changes that grips our people.  This railway served the people over the years.  If they had become complacent about using the railway system it was because in the railway strike some years ago private transport was built up and there was no return then from the railways once that had been established as a local service.</P>
    <P>We are told there is a loss of £56,000 on the running of the West Cork railway line.  If the railway closed down in the morning there will still be a loss on the maintenance of the West Cork line irrespective of what will be made on the rails sold. The stations will have to be maintained. The bridges will have to be maintained.  All the time, there will be a recurring deadweight loss for C.I.E.  The railway stations will not be much use unless they are sold.  It will take years before the property is ceded to the original owners because it will be almost impossible to trace the owners after the lapse of 100 years.</P>
    <P>The loss of £56,000 will have to be borne by somebody.  It is now being thrown off on the local authority.  The <Col N="772" /> county engineer, whose efficiency is proverbial throughout Munster, has given an estimate for £75,000 for I think the next ten years.  A fortnight ago I heard the same gentleman say casually that if he went back to make the assessment now, in the light of other knowledge that has eventuated. he would double the sum of £75,000. Therefore, this is a diversion of responsibility on to the shoulders of the ratepayers of County Cork.  It represents a burden which they will resent deeply.</P>
    <P>It would be better if the State undertook liability rather than impose it on a section of the people who will now be saddled with this burden. Expenses were incurred in modernising the system and in dieselising it. All that is money thrown down the drain if the railway is to go.  That modernisation takes place largely at the expense of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy, Deputy Desmond, and Deputy Wycherley know the road from Cork to Bantry.  It has many dangerous corners.  Being on the County Council in Cork, they realise how costly it is to remove these corners and widen the road over a period of years.  They are well aware that on a certain stretch of the road leading towards Midleton work has been proceeding for the past five years and they are well aware of its cost.  It is only a matter of a few miles.  It is about 60 miles to Skibbereen and Courtmacsherry and the roads in other areas will be affected by the closing of the West Cork line if it is closed.  If the line is taken away, the whole area south of the Lee in County Cork, from the end of the Bere peninsula to the mouth of the River Lee at Cobh will be without a railway.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy mentioned the towns which supported the railways over the years.  All that stretch of country is larger than County Louth, County Carlow, County Dublin, County Leitrim and County Sligo and perhaps larger than some of the other medium-sized counties in the State. All that area now will be left without a railway.  Have we no regard at all for the people of West Cork and their <Col N="773" /> rights?  Did they not maintain that railway over the years?  Have they not paid for the services they got and paid for the railway over the years?  Have they not then a squatter's right to that railway?  Are they not justified in their agitation to try to hold the railway because of the money put into it?  Why should any authority set up by this House come along and deny them the railway which served them in the past?</P>
    <P>In days gone by the people put up the railway and the people of West Cork co-operated with them in those days.  It is a tribute to them.  Why should we in this fortieth year of our freedom with one stroke of the pen deny them the privilege they got?  I think that is a retrograde step as Deputy MacCarthy said.  It is a most retrograde step.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Baltimore, Courtmacsherry and Timoleague will be affected as well as the intermediate small villages.  A generation ago in Cork the one seaside resort for the people of Cork City was Courtmacsherry.  I have been told by people associated with railways in those days that every Sunday in the summer season excursion trains were run to Courtmacsherry. Are we going to take away that possibility again?  Of late years, through lack of enterprise by C.I.E., no excursions have gone to these traditional venues for the citizens of Cork and the other towns throughout Munster as Deputy MacCarthy, Deputy Desmond and the other Deputies from West Cork know quite well.</P>
    <P>And what of the people of West Cork?  You have there some of the best people in the country.  They are a progressive, thrifty and hard-working people who have contributed very much to this country over the years, particularly to the system of Government that we have today.  Is it not from West Cork that the man who presides over the deliberations of the United Nations came?  Is it not from West Cork that the first commander-in-chief of our National Army came?</P>

      <P>Yes, from West Cork came that iron-willed man.  From West Cork also came the secretary of the first Cabinet set up here.  From West Cork also came the brothers Hales, Tom Barry, Charlie Hurley, Diarmuid Hurley and hundreds of others&mdash;men who were divided through the lamentable civil war.  In every country in the world emigrants from West Cork have shown their worth apart from the contribution they made to the building up of this State.  If I were a Deputy from West Cork and this railway was closed in spite of my efforts as a simple Deputy, I would no longer enter this House.  I will not be any longer in it in any case.  I would say to the Minister with all the earnestness that I can command that he is taking a wrong step.  No matter what C.I.E. does the Minister and eventually the Government will have to take the responsibility and the blame.</P>
      <P>I want to be constructive.  I want to suggest certain economies that can be made and made tomorrow morning if there is a will to make them.  There is no use at all maintaining the stations adjacent to Cork City itself on the West Cork railway line.  I mention particularly Crossbarry, Upton and Waterfall. These could very well go.  It is true that last year a good deal of money was spent upon the renovation of the station in Cork.  My information is that the most luxurious furniture was put into the offices in this station.  At least one chair cost over £50.  It does not speak so well for a company which loses £56,000 on the West Cork railway that they can spend money in that way.</P>
      <P>I travel up by train every week.  We have superintendents or hostesses in the trains.  I cannot see, nor ninety-nine per cent, of the travelling public cannot see, any need whatever for the maintenance of these hostesses.  I make no reflection upon the hostesses themselves but on the policy of C.I.E.  They could make economies in various ways which would equate the loss they now say is due to the maintenance of the West Cork railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A while ago the Minister got quite indignant when Deputy MacCarthy <Col N="775" /> pointed out to him that there were no loading facilities for beet.  Deputy Fagan of Westmeath, who is unavoidably absent today, asked me last night to mention the problem they have in Westmeath.  There is a market in Mullingar today.  C.I.E. lorries will not take three or four cattle.  They want a full load.  There are no facilities for collecting these loads in the approach to the particular places where the markets are held.  Deputy Fagan suggests&mdash;and I am conveying his suggestion to the House&mdash;that if C.I.E. gave the sleepers, the farmers themselves would come along and at vantage points put up these pens for the cattle where they could be loaded.  If C.I.E. are progressive and enterprising enough they will do that.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to say that I got a letter on the 14th March before I left for the 9 o'clock train on Tuesday morning from a proprietary lime kiln owner in County Cork.  In fairness, I want to say that the matter has been rectified since this letter was received. I will show the letter to the Minister afterwards.  I have no permission to mention names and, without permission, I will not mention the names. Here is an extract from the letter:</P>
    <P>We were continually on the phone to C.I.E., and we could only get a few 8 ton trucks, crocks really, which were of no use to us, as we could not rely on them, they were breaking down so often.  This is really an appalling situation to be deprived of transport at our harvest time.  C.I.E. could at least let us have temporary plates for our own trucks, until such time as they can meet the needs of all.</P>
    <P>In spite of the insistent demands last week, only yesterday or the day before was permission sent out to this firm for two further temporary plates for their trucks in order to tide them over this peak period for the distribution of lime.  For the past four months the Minister should realise that tractors and lorries of all kinds for agricultural work were in houses and in garages in various places throughout the country.  There was no <Col N="776" /> hope of taking a tractor into a field and putting lime on the fields and there was much less hope of spreading it or putting out any fertiliser distributor.  It was only last week that the first relief came when the land was really fit.  It was hardly fit before last week.  They were deprived of the opportunity of working to full capacity last week because of the slowness, the incapacity or the inertia of C.I.E., I do not know which.  Here is the statement in this letter which I will show to the Minister in case he doubts what I say.</P>
    <P>I am not going to make a long dreary speech.  I am very emotional about this matter.  I love West Cork because of sentiment.  I love West Cork because of its history.  Whatever progress West Cork has had over the century has been associated with the railway line.  It served them in their hour of need.  For economic reasons I love West Cork.  For economic reasons they should not be deprived of that service which they have enjoyed for 100 years. It is most unfair.  I would appeal to the Minister finally, and these are my last words, to give a reprieve in the case of the West Cork railway.  We are not motivated here by anything other than a desire to serve the people.  We are at one in this&mdash;Independent, Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  All the Deputies representing West Cork support a reprieve for this railway, if not for two years, at least for one year and, during that period, let the people take up the challenge and show that they are earnestly prepared to utilise the railways once again.</P>

      <P>Nuair a chailltear duine go hobann tré thionóisc, dhúnmharú nó féin mharú is gnáthach go mbíonn coiste cróinéara agus corpscrúdú. Nílmse chun bheith im bhall de choiste cróinéara ar bith ar bhóthar iarainn iar-Cláir anso inniu, óir tuigtear dom nach bás obann a fuair an bóthar iarainn seo againne.  Caithfidh mé a admháil gur sinne, muintir an Chláir, ba thrúig bháis dó.  Cailleadh é amhail mar a cailltear duine le gorta.  Ní ceal bidh atá i dtreis agam <Col N="777" /> ach ceal earraí.  Do bhí go leor leor earraí ag na feirmeoirí agus ag lucht tionscail an Chláir chun an bóthair iarainn do bheathú ach níor cuireadh an biadh ar an mbóthar iarainn agus más daoine ionraic macánta sinn, beidh orainn admháil gur sinne féin a mharbh é.</P>
      <P>Ní rún liomsa tagairt dá laghad a dhéanamh do bhóthar iarainn iar-Chorcaí nó Phortláirge cé go ndearna an Teachta Ó Loingsigh agus an Teachta Wycherley a lán cainte i dtaobh bóthair iarainn iar-Chláir. Déanfad aithris ar an dTeachta Ó Máinlí nár luaigh bóthar iarainn ar bith ach an ceann ina Dháil-Cheantar féin.</P>
      <P>Ní mó is rún liom milleán a chur ar an Aire, ar an Dochtúir Mac Aindriú nó ar an mBord Stiúrtha.  Tá bóthar iarainn iar-Chláir imithe.  Is truagh liom é ach ní haon tairbhe dom leithéid bheith ag déanamh bhróin nuair a bhíonn an brón déanta.</P>
      <P>Níl ann anois ach scéal an Áirseara agus na muice tráth theastaigh ábhar culaith éadaigh uaidh.  Nuair do rug sé ar an muic thosnaigh an mhuc ag screadaíl agus d'éis feidhm a bhaint as an dias d'fhéach sé ar an dtalamh agus nuair do chonnaic sé gur beag toradh a bhí ar a shaothar labhair sé mar leanas: &ldquo;Níl ann ach glór mhór ar bheagán olna.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Do bhi glór mhor ar bheagán olna sa Teach so aréir ach ní airím glór mhor dá leithéid ó aicme ar bith de threabhca Chláir.  Dá bhrí sin ní cail domsa am na Dála do dhíomailt a thuilleadh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Already four Deputies from West and South Cork have contributed to this debate.  It would be well that the Minister should realise that those four Deputies represent all shades of political opinion in South and West Cork.  We had a speaker from Fianna Fáil, one from Fine Gael, a Farmer, and Labour.  Has the Minister and, apparently, the Taoiseach, too, the audacity now to persist in their claim that the approach to this matter is a political one?  All shades of political opinion have expressed themselves as being against <Col N="778" /> the closing down of this railway.  Surely, even at this late hour, the Minister and the Head of his Government could make some effort to mend their hand. Surely they ought to realise now that this opposition to the closing of this railway in West Cork is not motivated by politics.  This closing of railways is a matter of vital importance not only to the people of West Cork but to the people everywhere.</P>
      <P>It is our duty as public representatives to safeguard the interests of those whom we represent.  Many speakers in the course of this debate have referred to the Beddy Report.  Many speakers have praised it.  The Minister went out of his way to recommend it. Subsequently he told us about the wonderful people on the Board of C.I.E. who are putting into operation now so many of the recommendations contained in the Beddy Report.  Strange to say, nobody has so far referred to another report, a report presented to the Government by people who had at least as good a knowledge of the problems of rail and road transport as those who drew up the Beddy Report.  Is it because it suits the Minister that he ignores the Milne Report?  What was wrong with that report that he should so conveniently forget that such a report was ever made to the Government and presented to this House?  Perhaps the Minister will explain his attitude towards this report when he comes to conclude.</P>
      <P>At page 43 of the Milne Report it is stated:</P>
      <P>In the circumstances it is considered that any proposal to close branch lines solely on the grounds that they are at present unprofitable should be rejected.</P>
      <P>On the same page, the following appears:</P>
      <P>The growing considerations should be whether the retention of the branch as part of the country's highway system is necessary or desirable in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comparison between that statement and the suggestions contained in the Beddy Report might be worthy of <Col N="779" /> the Minister's consideration.  Why such a difference in such a short period of time?</P>
    <P>We know from experience that the Minister seems to delight in pontificating on the necessity for economies. We know his approach to subsidies. We realise his background and we know that he has no sympathy for the problems of the people of West Cork, Clare and Waterford.  We challenge him to produce the figures upon which C.I.E. claim that it is not possible to make the railway pay in West Cork. The Minister believes in economy.  Is it a coincidence that C.I.E. are passing on&mdash;this is a very important matter&mdash;the cost of maintenance to the roads by closing down the railways and saving the cost of maintenance on them so that, in time, their contribution towards maintenance will be reduced?</P>
    <P>According to the 1948 Report the maintenance cost per £1 of gross receipts on the railways was 4/-; on the buses, 2/3d.; and on lorries, 2/5d. Is the Minister endeavouring to make more money for C.I.E. at the expense of the people of County Cork as a whole, not alone West Cork?  In view of the cost per £1 of gross receipts, is it believed that by using the roads entirely at the expense of the railways, maintenance costs will be reduced to such an extent that at the end of five years not alone will C.I.E. be clear of debts but it will be making a profit?</P>
    <P>I should like to know why the Minister found it suitable to reprimand officials of Cork County Council because they presented non-political reports which were accepted by all 46 members of the council.  I noticed when Deputy Manley was presenting an honest case a while ago, the Minister found it suitable to interrupt him, to shake his head and make it clear to everybody he was in total disagreement with the Deputy's statement. Deputy Manley said that not alone were the figures given by the county engineer conservative but, had he been in a position to prepare a more up-to-date report, the situation would be worse still.  I know that is true, and <Col N="780" /> so does Deputy MacCarthy.  The report presented by the county engineer did not take into account the cost of conversion of 98 bridges and level crossings. I suppose even the Minister would admit that that would cost money.</P>
    <P>The Minister glibly told us that, even if C.I.E. continued using these railway lines, the roads would still cost us all this money.  Over the past 14 or 15 years Cork County Council, along with county councils all over the country, have carried out many improvements to our highways and brought them up to a good standard. But that took a considerable number of years.  Irrespective of who is in the Department of Local Government, no county council could expect to get more than its fair share for road improvements each year from the Road Fund.  Many of these county councils could have done much more work and employed more men on road improvement if the finance had been available. But they took the realistic view that the Road Fund advances were given out in accordance with the proportion of work to be done in each county, the volume of traffic, and, particularly, the amount of money available in the Fund itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister should realise that the work envisaged in the county engineer's report would not in normal circumstances be completed for a number of years.  The ratepayers could not be expected to provide all that money in one or two years.  When the railways were closed in Donegal the Minister realised that the people of that county could not shoulder the financial burden imposed on them for improving the roads.  Naturally, an extra grant was made available to them. But, strange to relate, the same procedure was not adopted in West Cork. Let me say at this stage that this is not a case of our asking for increased grants to meet the cost.  What we are asking is that the Minister should realise that those in public life in West Cork look with abhorrence on the likelihood of the ratepayers being asked to provide in the future so much extra money each year in order to make C.I.E. a paying proposition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> I should like to refer again to the Milne Report and make a comparison between what is stated in it and the powers of the present C.I.E. Board. One item stands out very clearly on page 25 of the 1948 Report.  That is where it is stated that unlimited power was in the hands of the chairman.  The chairman of the old Board was himself opposed to this unlimited power because it placed him in a most difficult position.  Those connected with the Milne Report believed that such power was bad for the individual, unfair to him and certainly unfair to the people depending on the decisions of such a person.  We know the present Minister is one who apparently likes unlimited power.  From the period prior to 1948 up to 1958 we have seen growing up a system which has given unlimited power to a Board comprised of a few persons and presided over by one person.</P>
    <P>If it were bad in 1958 that such unlimited power should be given, it is far worse now because those concerned are making use of their unlimited powers to deny public representatives and the representatives of various non-political organisations in County Cork, religious and otherwise, the right to discuss either with the Minister or C.I.E. whether or not the railways should continue.  We all know the curt replies sent to Cork County Council by C.I.E., a mere acknowledgment stating that they had received the county council's communication.  It was nice of them, I suppose, to answer us at all.  Apparently, the Minister agrees with that attitude.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that we must go back to 1958 even if it appears to be repetition. I shall not quote Dáil Debates.  The Minister may try but he cannot in all sincerity contradict the statement made by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Taoiseach.  Many of us at the time were anxious in regard to areas which are now affected, such as Courtmacsherry and other places.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce made it abundantly clear to us all that the period of two months allowed for discussion would provide a period wherein C.I.E. would not only be expected to meet but <Col N="782" /> would meet local representatives, whether they were men in public life or others, to discuss the problem of how the situation might be improved rather than eliminate a branch line. There was no question at that time of its being discussion in regard to alternative services.  It is true to say that nobody at that time thought that C.I.E.'s alternative would be three additional buses and 11 additional lorries in West Cork.  It takes some neck for anyone now, as the Minister has done, to suggest that under normal circumstances for long periods of the year three extra buses and 11 extra lorries would meet the requirements of West Cork.</P>
    <P>When praising the present Board of C.I.E. the Minister has drawn attention to the outstanding achievements particularly on the financial side.  Let it be understood that it was not since the present Board was set up that C.I.E. were endeavouring to mend their hand. In 1954 dieselisation was introduced.  I suppose in public life people get used to praising themselves for whatever good is done irrespective of who may have done it.  I noticed that the Minister did not mention the improvements carried out between 1954 and the introduction of his new system and new Board in 1958.  What was the problem in regard to C.I.E. up to 1948 and thereafter?  Is it not quite obvious that much of the loss that was being incurred by C.I.E. and passed over to the taxpayer was due to a large degree to obsolete equipment both on rail and road?  The 1948 Report clearly showed the appalling condition of many lorries owned by C.I.E.  While there may have been a fair break in returns on bus services, even at that time a large number of buses belonging to C.I.E. were old and becoming obsolete.</P>
    <P>Considering that that Report mentioned a period prior to 1948, the Minister must realise that there was large capital investment in C.I.E. between that time and 1958, the years of which the Minister is now apparently taking advantage in trying to make a case that terrible losses were incurred by C.I.E.  The capital investment by C.I.E. in the early 1950's and after 1954 and the dieselisation programme were bound to create prosperity <Col N="783" /> after a few years.  The Minister may not agree but we all know that if a private operator in transport buys six lorries today he cannot expect to meet the cost and depreciation and show a profit in the first, second or even third year on the operation of his lorries.  The same applies to C.I.E. After the investment of capital during those years it took some time to show a clear profit on the vehicles but certainly it was coming to the stage in 1958 when it was bound to show the returns that are now being shown by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is correct to say, of course, that C.I.E. were not without blame, but C.I.E. are still in the same position. On about the 10th January, I travelled by C.I.E. to Dublin.  There were a number of young people on the train returning to England.  The train was not overcrowded.  I went to the dining car where I found a large number of people waiting to get a cup of tea. The dining car has accommodation for 38 people.  The company that the Minister tells us is doing so wonderfully now under his new management made only 19 seats available in that dining car.  The other half was kept empty because it was near the bar and, apparently, C.I.E. believed they could make more profit out of selling drink in the bar and left hundreds of people standing on the journey between Cork and Dublin, hoping to get a cup of tea.  Many of the passengers left the train at Kingsbridge without having got a cup of tea. It may be more profitable to C.I.E. to sell drink on the trains than to provide meals or tea for travellers.</P>
    <P>There was no question, nor do I suggest, that the staff on the train were in any way responsible for the fact that the passengers could not get tea.  There was one unfortunate man on that journey, a waiter, in that half of the dining car, killing himself trying to cater for people and trying to help where people were trying to break the queue and rushing in for a cup of tea.  Of course, we hear nothing at all from the Minister about the possibility of improvement in this respect. It is not a matter that will affect his <Col N="784" /> view as to the economy of the railway system.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Wycherley was speaking here last night a certain member of this House found it suitable to interrupt.  When Deputy Wycherley made comparisons between the line in West Cork and lines in other counties this other Deputy found it suitable to try to detract from the position, to try not to have a comparison made, falsely assuming that Deputy Wycherley wanted branch lines in other places closed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, is it correct to say that a small branch line between Muinebeag in Carlow and Palace East in County Wexford is being reopened?  Is it right to say that this line was closed to passenger traffic in 1931?  Is it correct to say that in all the years back this line had been used roughly two months in the year for beet traffic?  We would wish to see it in operation as we would wish to see other branch lines in operation but we are entitled to question the Minister on some of these items.  It was reported in the Press a couple of weeks ago that this branch line is coming into full operation again, that 2,000 sleepers have been bought for this line.  Would the Minister tell us why C.I.E., as mentioned in the newspaper, found special business coming the way?  Would he tell us why it was that C.I.E. found it so suitable to reopen this line, after all these years, on a bigger scale?  It is well to see it done if possible.  The Minister may be wrong.  We are entitled to express our opinions at any rate and it is important to say what we believe.  I believe the Minister has a colleague in the Government who found it suitable to see that this branch line would be put in operation.  Of course, the Minister has no colleague strong enough from the South to insist that fair play be given to the West Cork line although it has been given in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In the County of Cork we are faced with the problem of increased rates. We have to deal with part of the local rate demand in respect of health services and other items.  We are at <Col N="785" /> present discussing the problem of roads.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill, like the recent dairy produce marketing legislation, derived from a report made by the Advisory Committee on the Marketing of Agricultural Produce; and the Bill is primarily directed towards the improvement of the export marketing arrangements for bacon and other pigmeat. Unlike the case of dairy produce, where there was no general control board already existing, a statutory body&mdash;the Pigs and Bacon Commission&mdash;has existed in this case since 1939; and, in fact, the Commission then established took over the functions of a Bacon Marketing Board and a Pigs Marketing Board which had been created by legislation in 1935.  In view of the existing corpus of legislation on the marketing of pigs and bacon, the present Bill is therefore in the form of amending legislation. There is undoubtedly some inconvenience in this but a codification of the pigs and bacon legislation would only have delayed matters.  In order to assist Deputies in following the provisions of the Bill, with particular reference to the earlier statutes, an explanatory memorandum has been circulated which I hope has been found useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recollect the White Paper issued in December, 1959, stating the Government's policy on the Reports of the Advisory Committee on the Marketing of Agricultural Produce, including the Committee's Report on the Export of Bacon and Other Pigmeat.  As indicated in the White Paper, the main recommendation of the Advisory Committee in relation to the export of bacon and other pigmeat was: that the export of bacon, in the form of Wiltshire sides and major cuts including the back, should be centralised in a re-organised Pigs and Bacon Commission which <Col N="786" /> would export a steady weekly quantity to a reduced number of agents in Britain.  The Government agreed that the centralisation of these bacon exports would have certain advantages in strengthening the organisation of sales in Britain; and stated that it was proposed to introduce legislation for that purpose and for re-organising the membership of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  These are the two central purposes of the Bill now before the House, which I would remind Deputies is concerned primarily with the export marketing aspects of the pigs and bacon industry.</P>
    <P>Before passing on to the particular provisions of the Bill itself, I should like to make some remarks on the situation generally regarding exports of bacon and pigmeat.  Since the ending of the bulk purchase of pigmeat imports by the British Ministry of Food in 1956&mdash;and, under our pork and bacon agreement with the Ministry from 1951 to 1956, we received fairly satisfactory average purchase prices&mdash; we have had in operation a system of guaranteed minimum prices to producers for good-quality bacon pigs known as Grade A and Grade B, and a corresponding guaranteed export price to curers for Grade A bacon. The market assurance thus provided for pig producers, and the incentive to improve quality, have proved valuable but of course there are other factors to be taken into account also. At the beginning of May last, a further price assurance and incentive to better quality was provided by the Government in the form of an appreciably higher guaranteed minimum price for Grade A Special pigs, and a correspondingly higher guaranteed export price for Extra Selected bacon.  In the ten months ended 28th February, 1957, 62 per cent. of the bacon pigs graded at factories reached Grade A standard as compared with 69 per cent. in the ten months ended 28th February, 1961, and of the latter 12 per cent. reached Grade A Special standard.  Other schemes such as pig progeny testing, boar performance testing, and pig herds accreditation, are now in operation to help in securing the necessary advances on the breeding side.  Piggery <Col N="787" /> grants have recently been increased also to encourage more efficient rearing and fattening methods.</P>
    <P>The present guaranteed minimum prices of 245/- per cwt. dead-weight for Grade A Special pigs, and 230/- per cwt. for Grade A pigs, are I think accepted as reasonably remunerative for producers who are interested in a serious way in pigs.  The actual prices paid of course exceed at times these minimum prices.  Pig production has been at a relatively high level during the past three or four years, and has increased substantially since the latter part of 1959.  In fact, the 1960 census figures of 967,200 total pigs, including 108,400 sows, were a record for the past 20 years.  In the last pre-war census, 1939, total pigs numbered 930,900, including 95,300 sows.  In 1950 the number was 644,900 total pigs, including 79,800 sows.  Pig deliveries to bacon factories in 1960 were 1,298,000 as compared with an average of 1,026,000 for the years 1937-1939.  Already in 1961 deliveries in the first ten weeks are up 17.3 per cent. on the corresponding period of 1960.  A noticeable feature now, however, is the decline in pig numbers in the western counties as compared with pre-war.</P>
    <P>Export market conditions for pigmeat (especially bacon) in Britain&mdash; by and large the only market&mdash;have at times been anything but satisfactory. Our bacon support arrangements have to be related to the prices fixed weekly by the London Provision Exchange; and, frankly, we often find it rather difficult to follow the relative pricing of Irish bacon on the Provision Exchange lists and the variations in this.  For example, on the 18th June last Irish Extra Selected and British bacon were both priced 263/- per cwt. and Danish bacon 7/- higher at 270/-. By 1st October the Irish price was down by 22/- to 241/- per cwt., the British price was up by 7/- to 270/- per cwt. and the Danish price was up by 20/- to 290/-.</P>
    <P>By 18th February, 1961, the Irish price was down by a further 7/- to 233/- per cwt., the British price was down by 30/- to 240/- per cwt. and <Col N="788" /> the Danish price was down by 40/- to 250/- per cwt.  No variations in the relative standards of the bacon could be detected to account for this.  Even at our increased level of bacon exports in 1960 our supply represented only 5.5% of British bacon imports and 3.8% of total British bacon supplies; and the fact that these exports were sent in widely varying amounts from 36 exporters to even more than that number of purchasers or agents in Britain, and were not all of uniform presentation and so on, did not help us.</P>
    <P>The Advisory Committee, which I specially asked to look at these pricing aspects, were not satisfied either in regard to the fluctuations of the price margins from time to time. Summing up, the Committee stated: &ldquo;The impression we have formed of Irish bacon marketing arrangements in Britain is that they are in no way organised and that this leads to lack of confidence in our methods and results in weak selling and the acceptance of unsatisfactory prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is only right to say, however, that, especially since the introduction of the A Special grade for pigs last May and the Extra Selected grade of bacon (all of which is exported) we have many encouraging reports that the quality and presentation of our bacon exports to Britain have been showing good improvement.  But, to get the most out of the market, the case for a unified handling of our, at best, small share of the British bacon trade is very strong.</P>
    <P>I may also refer here to the arrangements made last autumn, in view of the uncertain bacon market conditions, to encourage a greater interest in the pork export market in which Irish supplies formerly held a good place. These arrangements have worked with reasonable satisfaction, although the volume of exports has necessarily been on a limited scale because of market reasons and the desirability of maintaining continuity in bacon exports; but the pork exports have, in six months, resulted in a direct saving of some £38,000 in bacon support&mdash;and no doubt much more, indirectly, by holding off extra bacon from a weak market.  They also have a useful side effect on both the home and export <Col N="789" /> bacon market in absorbing pigs suitable for pork but not so suitable for bacon.</P>
    <P>As to the future of the pigmeat export market it is perhaps difficult to be very optimistic that prices will be high in the times ahead.  Demand however is good, and the trade is there, but quite a few other countries are anxious to develop their pig industries too.  The situation is, therefore, a challenge to us to become more competitive by economising in every way possible on production costs; by increasing efficiency and improving quality at breeding, feeding and factory levels; and by adopting the most effective methods of export marketing.  I have already referred to certain additional facilities and incentives given to pig breeders and fatteners.  On the factory side, I would like to refer also to the grants being given for the modernisation of bacon curing premises and to the making available of State assistance to the bacon and meat trades for the establishment, by these industries themselves, of a meat research unit.  Both of these developments were foreshadowed in the White paper on the Government's Programme of Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the actual provisions of the Bill, I will first take Sections 7 to 9 dealing with the re-organisation of the membership of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  The 1939 Act provided for a Chairman and two ordinary members, both of them being required to have served for at least eight years as officers of the Minister; the Chairman is at present also a Departmental officer.  The Marketing Advisory Committee recommended that the Commission be re-organised to consist of three members nominated by pig producers, three nominated by bacon curers and pork exporters, two officers of the Department of Agriculture and an independent Chairman selected by the eight other members. The White Paper on the Committee's reports stated that the Government proposed that the re-organised Commission include two representatives of producers, two representatives of curers and two Departmental officers in addition to the Chairman.  In the <Col N="790" /> Bill, this is changed by an increase of one in the curers' representatives and a reduction of one in the Departmental representation.  The reason for the change has been that since the issue of the White Paper strong and unanimous representations were made to the Government by the bacon curers that as the primary purpose of re-organising the Commission was in regard to bacon export marketing and the Commission would have wide powers of control over the bacon curing industry it was inequitable that the representation of curers should be only two out of seven.</P>
    <P>The Irish Bacon Curers' Society emphasised that their members, comprising all the curers, could have no confidence in such a body and would fear the possibility of adverse effects so much that investment in the bacon curing industry would gravely suffer. In the circumstances it was decided to increase their representation to three and to cut the Government's own representation to one.  Producer representation was left unchanged at two, which is regarded as reasonable especially as the position of producers is safeguarded by the provision of guaranteed minimum prices for bacon pigs.  Contrary to what has been suggested in some quarters the representation of curers, major aspects of whose industry the Commission will control, will not be a majority but three out of a total of seven.  There would not be much point in keeping the curers' representation at two if, as was clear, they&mdash;the processing and exporting industry concerned&mdash;would lack confidence in the re-organised Commission before it commenced.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the period of office of the members of the Commission would be three years at a time. There would be an overlap of one year between the period of office of the Chairman and that of the ordinary members, inasmuch as it is proposed that the Chairman of the existing Commission would be appointed by me as Chairman of the re-organised Commission for the first year.  This overlap, which would continue in future, should be useful in securing a degree of continuity in the functioning <Col N="791" /> of the Commission, without going too far in that direction.  After the first year, the Chairman would be selected by the six ordinary members for a period of three years at a time.</P>
    <P>The other major part of the Bill is contained in Sections 23 to 25, which provide for the centralisation, through the Commission, of exports of bacon of specified grades in the form of Wiltshire sides and major cuts which include the back.  The intention is to apply this to exports of bacon of not less than Grade A standard to the British market, which as I already said takes practically all such exports. The possibility cannot be excluded that it may be desirable to apply the provisions to exports of other grades or to other markets, hence the general nature of the relevant Sections.</P>
    <P>In this connection, orders under Section 25, prohibiting the export of bacon except by or on behalf of the Commission, will of course come before the House under Section 31. As to the precise lines on which the centralisation of actual exports by the Commission would operate, I think that this would have to be left to the Commission itself to determine.</P>
    <P>The Commission would, however, acquire title to the bacon before export and would pay curers for it, subject to quality and condition, at prices fixed by me after consultation with the Commission under Section 23 (4) of the Bill.  For the benefit of Deputies I may perhaps quote the following recommendations in this connection from the Marketing Advisory Committee's Report:</P>
    <P>Paragraph 47.  &ldquo;The bacon should be purchased at an ex-factory price from the curers by the re-organised Pigs and Bacon Commission recommended by us later.  This ex-factory price may have to be determined on a rough and ready basis at the start but as soon as possible it should be based on representative costing so that efficient operation of factories will be encouraged.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 62.  &ldquo;It (that is, the re-organised Commission) should ship bacon only to appointed agents in <Col N="792" /> Britain, existing trade contacts and arrangements being maintained as far as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 64.  &ldquo;Although in the matter of the appointment of agents the Commission should have regard to the curers' nominations, it is important that it should have a free hand in making appointments and also in regard to the renewal of appointments from time to time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have quoted these only by way of illustration but as I have said I think it should be left to the Commission itself to decide what is best to arrange in these marketing matters.</P>
    <P>Section 27 dealing with powers of the Commission in relation to the development of markets for bacon and other pigmeat, Section 28 dealing with State grants to the Commission, and Section 29 dealing with State guarantee of loans to the Commission are, with appropriate modifications, in line with corresponding provisions in the recent Dairy Produce Marketing Act. I need perhaps at this stage refer in particular only to subsection (g) of Section 27, which gives the Commission ample powers in regard to the development of exports of pork and other diversified pigmeat products.  In view of modern trends in regard to pre-packaging, especially with the advent of supermarkets and self-service stores, I am taking powers under Section 26 of the Bill to make regulations on aspects of pre-packaging which, as mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, would compare with control already exercised in regard to canned and open-pack meats of other kinds.</P>
    <P>The position of the staff of the existing Commission is suitably safeguarded under subsection (10) of Section 12 of the Bill.  As in some other recent legislation, subsection (5) of that Section provides that the manner of the appointment of staff will be by public competition, subject to certain special exceptions which are specified.  Provision is made under Section 22, again as in other recent legislation, enabling a staff superannuation scheme to be considered.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are, I think, more what one would <Col N="793" /> term &ldquo;Committee Stage&rdquo; sections, but I shall of course be glad in replying on this Stage to deal with any points Deputies may wish to raise on any of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been studying this Bill and the White Paper which the Minister circulated with it and the Statement he has just made.  It does not seem that there is very much new in the Bill beyond the change in the personnel of the Pigs and Bacon Commission and the power to control and direct the sale of Wiltshire sides and backs.  I think a great deal more than that requires to be done if the pig industry is to reach the level we hope it will reach.</P>
      <P>Before looking at the matters of detail that will probably arise on this Stage of the Bill I think we have one reason for self-congratulation.  I remember when we first started grading pigs the average percentage of grade A pigs going into the factory approximated something like 58 per cent., if so high.  Looking at the average for the weeks ending 7th January, 14th January, 21st January, and 28th January there are now contained in the Grade A special and Grade A, 68 per cent., 69 per cent., 70 per cent. and 71 per cent.  That is a creditable performance.  That percentage of Grade A probably compares favourably with the grading in countries like Denmark or Holland.  I would be glad if the Minister would comment on that in concluding because I think I am correct in saying that an average of 70 per cent. in the top grade compares favourably with any other country in the pig business.  It is a great pity that when in fact, largely by inducement and by the provision of guaranteed prices in respect of that top grade, we have achieved that high percentage of Grade A pigs going into the factories, we should jeopardise all that by allowing apprehension to grow particularly among the small producers that they are not getting a fair deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the evidence of a high percentage of Grade A pigs actually being certified by the factories is presumptive evidence that, by and large, the grading <Col N="794" /> is all right but there is no use in deceiving ourselves that that view is shared by the small producers.  They do not feel that they are getting a fair deal in the grading of their pigs and, not for the first time, I want to remind the House that in matters of this kind, for the good of the industry itself, both producers and manufacturers, it is essential not only that justice should be done but to carry conviction to the minds of the producers that justice is being done.  If we do not succeed in doing that we are going to allow an element of uncertainty to creep back into the industry which will operate most adversely to it and most adversely in that section of the industry which we should be primarily concerned to protect and promote, that is the small producers.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his introductory remarks, said that one remarkable development, apart from the increased number of pigs going into the factories, was the decline in pig production in the west of Ireland.  That is the decline of the small producer.  I welcome the large pig producer to the industry; he is a very useful element in it but it would be a great disaster if the pig industry disappeared out of small holdings in the west of Ireland from Donegal to Cork.  If it is allowed to disappear it will be a most potent element in contributing to making the small farm in the west of Ireland uneconomic.  If the small farmers of Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Mayo and all down the western seaboard to west Cork do not incorporate pig production into their husbandry, their husbandry will become all the less viable.  So long as they produce milk, cattle, pigs and a certain quantity of fowl, not excluding turkeys, I believe a decent livelihood can be had on a small farm but if you drop out of the economy individual items of that composite picture the prospect of getting a living on the small farm becomes more and more difficult.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for repeating to-day what I said on a previous occasion: the big producer is largely able to look after himself because when he reaches a stage that he is bringing to any factory in Ireland 100 <Col N="795" /> pigs a week, or indeed 100 pigs a month, if he does not get a grade which roughly corresponds to the national average&mdash;70 per cent.  Grade A, 20 per cent.  Grade B&mdash;he has the effective remedy in his own hands.  He can say to the factory with which he is dealing: &ldquo;If that is the way you are going to grade my pigs I shall take them somewhere else.&rdquo;  A supplier who is in a position to withdraw from a factory an appreciable fraction of its total turnover is in a position to bring pressure to bear on that factory to give him a satisfactory grade for his pigs.  The man, however, who brings in two pigs, four pigs, six pigs or eight pigs and is given two Grade A out of eight, or five Grade B, or two Grade C or one Grade X has not only his heart but his pocket broken by such an experience.  It is not surprising if he has one or two such experiences that he will throw his hat at the whole thing and get out, because feeding pigs is hard work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand the purpose of that question.  I do not think it need necessarily imply that.  It could arise from sheer incompetence and I am now long enough in this world to realise that when I was young I saw everything in black and white.  If something went wrong I promptly assumed it was due to wrongdoing.  I have learned the painful lesson that a great deal of what goes wrong in this troubled world is due to sheer incompetence. Therefore if I wanted to answer Deputy Moher's question I would be constrained in honesty to say that 25 years ago I would have probably answered him enthusiastically: &ldquo;Yes, the bacon curers are robbing the producer&rdquo;, but I am that much older and wiser now and I realise that there are probably three contributing elements to it: some dishonesty, a great deal of incompetence and some unjustifiable suspicion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> Yesterday the Minister bewailed that the Opposition criticised the Government heavily but never told them what they should do.  My trouble is when I tell them what to do they go and do it, to my great political embarrassment, but I take the risk. If I wanted to approach this from a purely political angle I would thump the desk and say: &ldquo;The people are being robbed&rdquo; and that the Minister was in the conspiracy and probably politically it would suit me but for good or ill I got involved with the Department of Agriculture and when I am talking about the Department of Agriculture I cannot play politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Never mind that, it would be good politics, temporarily at least.  Whether it is or not, I cannot play politics with the Department of Agriculture much as sometimes I might like to do so.  I am saying that whatever the reason all the small pig producers are not the same age as Deputy Moher and myself and we want to bring the young, up-coming farmers into the pig production business with the enthusiasm we should like to see them bring to it. But having been reared amongst these people and having great sympathy with them I appreciate&mdash;and I believe the Minister knows this as well as I do&mdash; that there is a great deal of doubt and difficulty; doubt on the part of the small farmer whether he is getting a fair deal in the grading of his pigs. On the other hand I want to say that when I was Minister for Agriculture, I was conscious of the possibility of such a difficulty and I was casting around to find a means whereby I could effectively control grading in such a way as to carry conviction to the minds of the small farmers.  Finally, having examined it from one angle and another I became satisfied that, as long as the Department's vet is there with a general responsibility for the general supervision of grading, no serious abuse was likely to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I learned painfully, however, was that although I might have satisfied <Col N="797" /> myself as Minister for Agriculture that no serious abuse could develop so long as the Department vet had general supervision in regard to grading, I had not carried conviction to the small producer.  If we want to get the degree of expansion that I believe everybody wants to see, we have got to carry conviction to the small producer and it is not going to be an easy thing to do.  I should be quite prepared to be experimental in this matter.  I remember when we had the flax agreement with Northern Ireland, we got a price fixed for flax according to five grades.  You would have thought that to carry conviction to the farmers' minds that they were being dealt with fairly would have been impossible, but it was not.  What we did was to appoint a grader; the Northern Ireland flax spinners also appointed a grader and there was provision for an arbitrator in any case where the two graders failed to agree.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that out of thousands of cases of grading there were half a dozen appeals in the whole period the scheme was working because in fact farmers and spinners found the two men they had appointed knew their business and both of them knew that it was not much use trying to put something over the other because then one would say: &ldquo;Let us not waste time arguing.  I think it is grade 2 and you think it is grade 5; let it go to the arbitrator.&rdquo;  After a very short time the whole thing worked like clockwork and I think I am right in recalling that during all that period I did not get from Monaghan, which was my constituency, or Cavan, or West Cork a half-dozen complaints that there was any impropriety in regard to the grading.  I believe that if we set up some similar system of grading, even experimental, in certain factories &mdash;say in the factories in Connaught to begin with and extending to West Cork if it was found to work, but in a restricted area&mdash;it would be worth it.</P>
    <P>If it were working for a while it might be discovered that it would then cease to be necessary.  I do not say that is by any means certain but we might by experience find that after the suspicions and anxieties had been <Col N="798" /> allayed, the need for it would cease for the reason that a great deal of bad grading results from bad feeding&mdash; not all of it.  You can get a strain of pigs and no matter how carefully you feed them they will have fat on their backs.  However, there is a strong tendency, of which I have protracted personal experience, among pig feeders to feed a pig up to the limit of his capacity to consume right up to the day before he is sent to the factory.  It is terribly hard to persuade country people it is a good thing to ration a pig,</P>
    <P>I feel a good deal of the bad grading is due to improvident feeding.  If once these small farmers had conviction carried that the grading was fair there ought to be scope to bring the parish agent, if we had one, into the factory on killing days so that where a fellow got bad grading he could go to him and say: &ldquo;Where did you get the bonhams or slips?  Did you produce them yourself?  If so, I should like to see the sow.&rdquo;  If these are all right he could say &ldquo;How is the feeding? You must be doing something wrong to get the grade you are getting.&rdquo; We could thus very quickly build up a valuable reform in the whole pig industry.  It is often a source of astonishment to me that, particularly, a small factory catering for a restricted area have not found it worth while to do that for themselves. If I were a bacon curer in a restricted area I would employ a parish agent of my own.</P>
    <P>Where a small farmer was getting bad grades I would say to him: &ldquo;If I send out the parish agent here will you work with him?&rdquo;  I believe such problems could largely be resolved if that were done.  That was what the parish agent did in the areas where we planted them.  That is what poor Mr. Smith, who died last week, used to do although he was not a parish agent but a county committee of agriculture instructor.  I believe it would be a pregnant source of great improvement in regard to this specific problem to which I now refer and which I cannot over-emphasise because I believe it goes to the root of the development referred to by the Minister <Col N="799" /> today, namely, the decline in pig production in the west which I regard as a most deplorable development.</P>
    <P>I do not want to underestimate the difficulties of control marketing.  There is a case to be made.  I think the case has been made for some kind of centralised marketing in Great Britain in order to prevent or to try to prevent the wild fluctuations which result in the price being fixed by the London Provision Exchange.  But there is a difficulty here and it is one I should like to hear canvassed in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>There are a number of curers in this country who have trade connections in Great Britain going back over a century.  That is one problem.  There are a number of highly-enterprising curers who, finding that the sale of bacon through the wholesale channels in England has been unremunerative, have taken the trouble to go to England and to make individual contacts with specific wholesalers and with chains of retail distributors.  There is no doubt that these curers have acquired contacts of incalculable value to the bacon industry of this country. I do not deny that their superior zeal in this matter is probably earning them a premium over the quoted price of the London Provision Exchange which is the basic price in calculating the export subsidy.</P>
    <P>I remember we considered that question at the time we were working out the scheme for the export subsidy. My recollection is that we were all agreed that we wanted the bacon manufacturer to be put in a position to pay the producer the highest price he could afford to pay and that if he were in a position to go out and, by superior diligence, get a higher price than he would get by sending his bacon over for sale on the London Provision Exchange we should encourage that because if he got a little extra margin for himself in the vast majority of cases competition for supplies would make that filter through to the producer.</P>
    <P>We all know that bacon factories employ people to buy supplementary supplies outside their own area, to the <Col N="800" /> great advantage of pig producers in those areas who get 5/- or 6/- a cwt. more for their pigs, very largely because some of these curers are getting a premium on the market where they are trading.  Accordingly they are extra-eager to maintain supplies of the raw material to their factory for fear they will fail to deliver bacon regularly to these special contacts they have made either in Great Britain or elsewhere.  Are we now going to forbid them to maintain those?  I should like to hear the Minister on that.  I do not want to underestimate the difficulties. I can see the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the problem that if you are going to have a control market to operate centralised marketing the preservation of individual contacts will create very serious difficulty. There is a problem that if you try to do that the central marketing organisation will be left with all the dross and the choice stuff will go to the established marketing channels that the skilful curer has built up for himself.  It is a great hardship on a man who has been enterprising and who has been urged to go out and seek out the best markets for Irish bacon, who did it and spent a good deal of money doing it, to be told now: &ldquo;As from a certain date you will not be let&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a real dilemma here.  I do not think we should close our minds completely to some transitory experimental period in which at least we could examine whether some&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission could try to maintain these contacts.  They could devise many ways in which they could be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that is true. I feel there is a dilemma and a hardship on the enterprising curer who has made the effort.  As I understand, except for Wiltshire, Spencers and main cuts of that character, there is <Col N="801" /> still scope to allow the curer to trade direct in respect of ham and picnic hams, even possibly in pre-packaged goods.  Is not that so?  But I am not certain that some way could not be found out of this dilemma.  I would say with reluctance that if a practicable way could not be found out of it, I think the Minister would be justified in making the experiment of centralised marketing for the best interests of all concerned.</P>
      <P>But there are strong views against it, I am bound to say in honesty.  I believe that the experiment of central marketing requires to be made because we are faced with the fact that the Danes and the Dutch are using it and can rig the market against us with the immense supplies the Danes can dispose of.  I think our hands are considerably weakened for the want of it.  What I am afraid of is this.  It is something that we ought to bear in mind.  It may turn out to be the great advantage that some people think it is going to be.  We ought to bear in mind that we are going to purchase it at a great price and the price we are going to pay is disruption of the existing trade content.</P>
      <P>It would be utterly wrong that Oireachtas Éireann should legislate along these lines without realising the price we are going to pay.  It would be utterly wrong for Oireachtas Éireann to legislate along these lines without realising that the specialised market contacts are not only the property of the bacon curers but at one remove they are the property of the pig producers because part of the exceptional profit to be derived from them does trickle back to the pig producers. The Department of Agriculture is always there to devise ways and means to make it more probable that at least a fair share of that supplemental profit will get back to the producer in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had great difficulty in reaching a conclusion here for the position is really this.  Such high hopes are built on central marketing as an effective instrument to meet Danish competition in the British market which is based on central marketing that I think we <Col N="802" /> have got to give it a trial.  But it is not going to solve all our problems. We are going to do it at a very great price if no means can be found to maintain, even for a temporary period, the existing personal contacts that exist.  It is not going to solve all our problems by a long chalk.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to dwell specially in his concluding observations on whether there is any possibility of preserving to individual curers the right, even for a temporary period, to operate their own trade connections on the clear understanding that if that meant that central marketing was not going to get a fair chance, we would have to take the further steps.  At the same time, it would have the advantage that we would not have irrevocably spent that precious asset of existing trade connections before being certain that the central marketing was going to do as much as some people believe it will.  I said in opening that central marketing and the change in the personnel of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, in my opinion, is not going to do all that some people think it is going to do.  A great deal more requires to be done.</P>
    <P>There is one other constructive proposal I want to make to the Minister. I think he walked into a complete trap in regard to the personnel of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  I think I know well how it happened.  He published proposals originally that there should be 2-2-2, two representing the producers, two the curers and two the Department.  Then&mdash;I am only surmising; I can see how this happened&mdash;the curers came in and said there were always the big, medium and small curers: &ldquo;You are giving us only two representatives.  That will disrupt our organisation.  There will be jealousy.  It is impossible and it is not fair.  After all, it is our business you are going to control and we ought to be fully represented.&rdquo; The Minister was pushed into saying: &ldquo;Very well, have three so that there can be big, medium and small curers and I shall surrender one of mine on the Board and I shall call it 3-2-1,&rdquo; but he was quite wrong.</P>
    <P>I venture to swear that only Mr. Parkinson was coming to Dublin to <Col N="803" /> deliver a lecture on Parkinson's Law in Guinness's Brewery, the Department would have said: &ldquo;Well, Minister, this always happens.  If you have made up your mind and you think you must have three, do not let anyone dissuade you from having three.&rdquo;  Apart from that it does not look well to create a great deal of malaise in the country. We want to get this thing off on the right foot.  I know the Minister wants to keep the numbers small and he is right.  If you are determined to give the curers three, you must give the producers three and we must have some representative of the Department of Agriculture who will have some regard to the general interest.  That leaves us with one for the Department and the Chairman.  That gives eight.  Had I been Minister for Agriculture, I would have said that I would give the curers one, the producers one and myself one.  That would be nine.  Since I would be the only one who had a minority, it is I who would get all the blame and none of the credit.  If the thing were a success the Pigs and Bacon Commission would get the credit and that would be the grandest thing that could happen.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister, Mr. Parkinson notwithstanding, never to trust long-haired professors.  They can work out beautiful theories in books but if you put them in charge of a callow chandler's shop they may make a shambles of it in three weeks.  You can enjoy Parkinson's law as a week-end relaxation.  Such judicious theorising looks neat and all the strings are tied up into beautiful bows.  But in the practical affairs of men, the strings do not get tied up into beautiful bows; they always have bits and pieces hanging out of the end of them, and you have got to do the best you can.  As the great political thinker, Tom Kettle, said: &ldquo;In the art of politics, we are constrained with the reluctance of wisdom to accept not the second best but only too often the second worst, and thank God for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister wanted a small efficient commission.  The curers kicked.  He has given way to them. For peace sake, for commonsense <Col N="804" /> sake, let there be an equal representation of producers and curers on this commission.  Do not hesitate to put on two representatives of the Minister, and the Chairman; that gives you nine.  I agree it would be a better body if there were only seven on it, but there is not a Deputy who would not be a better man if he practised some virtues which he does not practise or abstained from some vices to which he occasionally gives way.  That is human nature, and this is a human institution.  It will be a very human commission, if I know anything about it.  A commission with bacon curers and pig producers on it will be about the most human thing one could imagine.  Let us make it human. There is luck in odd numbers.</P>
    <P>I earnestly urge on the Minister that he should establish it on the basis of three, three, two, and the Chairman, for no other reason than that it should get a fair chance and a fair start.  If that is not done, there will be a howl from the first day: &ldquo;It is the curers' commission.&rdquo;  That means it will never be given a fair chance to do the job it is being asked to undertake. If I had any sense politically, I would not refer to this at all.  I would urge the Minister to stand rigidly on the proposals he has here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is right.  That would not be my political judgment but, of course, I might be wrong; that is, trying to view it in the political sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is wise or foolish, I cannot do it.  If you are going to give it a run and, if it is the child of the Minister for Agriculture, it ought to be given a fair run.  It is not going to get a fair run so long as people call it the curers' commission. There is no objection to having extra representation, I suggest, and that extra representation will lay the ghost once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome, as I said, the large producer.  I set a special value on the small producer.  I want to suggest to the Minister that there is scope for a very important development in this industry, a development which I do not think has ever got proper investigation <Col N="805" /> and encouragement.  I tried to encourage it once or twice myself, but I did not get very far and, where the experiment to which I am going to refer was in operation in one area, I do not think it was well done.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind the great difficulty of the small producer is to finish the pig, because finishing the pig is a highly technical operation.  I think there is great scope for central finishing depots, such as the co-operative societies in being, or some depots set up for the purpose of distributing specially selected sows and boars to their area of supply so as to get the right strain of pig into the area, giving the small producer the primary responsibility for breeding.  Any good farmer who has a gift for pigs&mdash;it is not everybody who has-can feed a sow and, if he does not know how to feed a sow, he can learn.  The sow will feed the bonham. If the farmers have properly constructed houses, and that is easy to arrange, the bonhams can be brought to ten weeks old.  In the Minister's home county and my constituency, they bring them to 12 or 13 weeks.  We bring them to 10 weeks.  I am not sure whether it is at that stage or at the later stage when the bonham is a slip, that we ought to design their transfer to the central fattening station and finish them there.  I believe that is the way you could effectively integrate into the increased production of bacon pigs the small farmers of this country. I think that development, if it were extensively promoted, would very quickly restore pig production to the west of Ireland and to those areas where we most earnestly desire to see it developed.</P>
    <P>I remember when the poor Minister for Lands was starting Scéim na Muc, I told him he was barking up the wrong tree; it would be a flop, and he knew it would be a flop, if he knew anything about it.  But it was as good a political stunt as any other.  The Minister was down learning Irish in Aran.  He was able to say &ldquo;Scéim na Muc&rdquo; and Deputy Davern was thrown into ecstasies of enthusiasm over a Gaelic scheme for pigs in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>There is something worth doing. <Col N="806" /> We should promote the breeding of pigs amongst small farmers, give them the right kind of house to breed the pigs in where the bonham could be kept warm without tremendous expenditure, and help them to get the right class of stock, making it clear, above all, that when the pigs reach 10, 12 or 20 weeks, there is a buyer there who will take them and go through the process of finishing them.  There will have to be some grading there, too, to ensure that the pigs will be in proper condition when they are brought forward to the central agency. That would relieve the factory of all this complex problem of grading into A, B, C, and X.  It is an activity, I believe, the Department should promote through the medium of the co-operative movement, or by any other means that would be effective, because it would help the small producer back into this very necessary trade.</P>
    <P>My gracious me, how much more rewarding it is to the small farmer to keep four or five sows rather than try to fatten five or six pigs.  To somebody who likes pigs, keeping sows is not a bit more troublesome than keeping the fattening pig.  There are ups-and-downs in it.  It is true that sometimes you get a run of luck with sows, but if you had a properly organised scheme you could extend the benefit of insurance against loss of a sow in her litter, which can, of course, be a great catastrophe for a small producer. You cannot remove every hazard from agricultural operations but you can make them reasonably safe.  In any case you can make it certain that the small producer will not run the risk of ruin if he enters the scheme enthusiastically.</P>
    <P>If a small producer keeps five sows and each of these producers 20 bonhams in the year, that is 100 bonhams representing a cash income of approximately £500 a year for the keeping of five sow pigs.  It would, of course, fluctuate between £400 and £600, according to luck and skill, but over the past 15 years, I have reared between nine and ten bonhams per sow, and I am no great expert at it. The experts would rather look down <Col N="807" /> their noses at you if you reared less than ten bonhams per sow.  They would tell you that you ought to rear twelve bonhams per sow.  I sometimes think I would like to see them do it. However, it is true to say that if a person keeps five sows, it represents an income of from £400 to £600 per year.  Of course, feed would have to be taken from that; but if you are feeding them on skim milk and barley grain, it could be produced on your own holding if you have 40 acres. That is a very good basic income on which a small man can start.</P>
    <P>If he adds to that four calves a year, at the prices he used to get under the inter-Party Government and not the prices under a Fianna Fáil Government, plus the milk of his cows, he will not live on the standards of Mayfair, but he will live comfortably. If it is Mayfair he wants, he will not find it in Ireland.  But I believe a great many of our people, if given an element of security in modest comfort, would prefer that to the amenities of Mayfair, Bootle and Birmingham.  It is for these people that I long to see developments of the kind to which I now refer.</P>
    <P>I built the first pig progeny testing station in this country in Cork.  I had great hopes for it.  I thought it was going to do wonders.  Maybe it is doing wonders, I do not know, but I wish somebody would expound to me what exactly it is doing.  I thought that out of that pig progeny testing station there would emerge, ultimately, a stream of steadily improving breeding material, which would spread out over the country and benefit everybody in the pig industry.  Deputies are entitled to say to me: &ldquo;Why did you not find out about this when you were Minister for Agriculture and had every facility for doing so?&rdquo;  My reply to them would be: &ldquo;Did you ever talk to a man who is an expert on pig progeny testing?  He would addle the mind of anyone other than an Einstein.&rdquo;  They have managed to develop this whole business of progeny testing into so abstruse a mathematical abracadabra that it is practicably impossible to <Col N="808" /> understand what they are talking about.  I made an act of faith and I said: &ldquo;Whatever the abracadabra is, their aim is the same as my aim, that is, to provide the farmers with a superior strain of pig, and let us go ahead with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has been in operation now for four or five years.  Maybe it has done us a lot of good.  I hope it has, because I certainly urged the Government to spend a lot of money on it and I did it on the best possible advice.  But I want to tell the Minister this: there is no institution in this country that more grievously lacks public relations than the pig progeny testing station in Cork. I read its reports regularly and I can make neither head nor tail of them. The only thing I ever learned from one of the reports was that they finally determined that one boar was of outstanding quality and was passing on the most striking qualities to its progeny. But when they dashed off to find him, they found he had been dead and buried 18 months before they reached him.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say that is typical by any means of the activities of the progeny testing station, but I do say that, for the average intelligent person, to try to elucidate the significance of their reports is extremely difficult.  It may well be that the skilled pedigree breeder, who is the prime source of breeding stock for the whole country, is in more intimate contact with the progeny testing station and more fully understands its problems, but it is to be borne in mind that it is the taxpayer at large who is paying for it.  All my reading and experience led me to believe it was a good thing, but it is urgently in need of public relations. The people ought to be told what benefit is flowing from it.</P>
    <P>I do not see Deputies leaping up around the House now as frequently as they used to talk about the Landrace pig.  I seem to remember Deputy Davern used to be very fond of the Landrace pig.  He used to be very critical of me because I was not enthusiastic for the Landrace pig.  I was hindering and hampering the farmers of Tipperary from making the fortunes <Col N="809" /> they could make, if they but had access to the Landrace pig.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at Gortnahoe. Right enough, I am sure he deluged the country with the Landrace pig. He is not so enthusiastic for it now. We set out at the progeny testing station to try to get strains of pigs for the Large White and I think there are some Landrace under test there also, pigs that will give the farmers a decent average return.  Maybe they have got them, but, if that is so, I hope the Minister will take early occasion to explain to people how it has happened.  It is certainly eminently desirable.  Nothing is more important than that the strain of pig, in addition to the breed, should be the best that can be provided and it is the clear duty of the Department of Agriculture to do its part in getting the best strain made available to the people as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister is fully entitled on the occasion of legislation of this kind to send for the curers and to ask them what are they prepared to do about it.  I do not see why the curers in their own areas should not be distributors of the right type of sow, the potential breeders, if the right type of sow can be identified through the progeny testing station.  I think the curers have a very grave obligation to help producers in the areas where they operate to get the right type of sow and to provide the grade to the farmers who want to get sows and to get into the business.  I believe if that case were put to them sufficiently strongly, they could be induced to do it.  I think some of them did but the tendency was, after they embarked on schemes of that kind, to let them fade away, to lose interest.  I think the Minister could very properly point out <Col N="811" /> to them that they should interest themselves in that matter again.</P>
    <P>I want to recall that the Minister states on Page 2 of his statement:</P>
    <P>The present guaranteed minimum prices of 245/- per cwt. dead-weight for Grade A Special pigs, and 230/- per cwt. for Grade A pigs, are I think accepted as reasonably remunerative for producers ...</P>
    <P>The worst thing the Minister ever did since he came back on this occasion was the reduction of the guaranteed price from 235/- to 230/-, in 1957.  I think he did more to knock the heart out of the producers by that futile gesture than anything he had done in the previous 20 years.  It spread panic amongst producers and persuaded them that there was always the danger, if they really got production going again, that even the Minister for Agriculture would take a swipe at them and, the price having been guaranteed at 235/-, that would be the first object of a futile silly economy of that kind because they were the most vulnerable. Probably, the Minister is wiser today than he was then, but I think it ought to be made perfectly clear that we intend to keep the price of pigs stable in relation to the cost of feedingstuffs and that for anybody who engages in it skilfully, there is a reasonable living and that we are interested in any proposal from any producer to produce bonhams, slips or finished pigs and that persons who want to enter into a combination to produce slips and who do not feel equipped to go beyond that will have sympathetic consideration from the Department and every co-operation to help them in marketing the slips to fattening centres where that could be arranged, as in most cases I believe it could.</P>
    <P>Now I want to return to another very important aspect of this whole industry.  I can remember the time when I was young when thousands and thousands of live pigs were shipped from this country every year.  Those shipments comprised not only pigs suitable for conversion into Wiltshire bacon but also Birmingham cutters, porkers and other varieties of pig.  But <Col N="812" /> what was immensely important was that that outlet for pigs provided an outlet for relatively stout pigs that were not ideal for conversion into Wiltshire bacon.  Is there no hope of reviving that trade by agreement with the British Ministry of Food and Agriculture? I think it certainly is worth inquiry because it was a very valuable outlet in the past and I believe it could become a very valuable outlet in the future.</P>
    <P>I am astonished at the decline in our export of fresh pork.  When I first was a member for Monaghan, the fresh pork trade was a very large and valuable trade and it seems to have largely disappeared.  It was a trade, I think, largely based on suckers, very young pigs.  I do not know why it has disappeared and with the improving methods of refrigerated transport now available, one would imagine that it ought to be a growing trade. I should be glad to hear from the Minister if there is any prospect of the revival and expansion of that trade.</P>
    <P>I would not think this Bill is going to precipitate any very dramatic revolution in the marketing of pigs.  I do not believe that, standing alone, it will do very much one way or another to the industry as a whole.  It is an experiment which has to be made.  It is vitally important, if we are to give it any chance of success, that it should be attended by a marked expansion in our output of pigs, because no central marketing organisation could hope for any degree of success if it has not got a sustained volume of production to assure potential consumers in England that there will be a regular supply of Irish bacon on the British market.</P>
    <P>In the past, 90 per cent. of our problems were created by the inconsistency of the supply of bacon from Ireland.  We were in the market in one week and out of it the following week.  We had abundance of meat to supply the market only too often when the market was overstocked or else when demand was poor and then, when the demand became strong and the price steeply rose, only too often there was no Irish bacon available for sale there at all.  Therefore, if this <Col N="813" /> departure is to have any prospect of success, an essential postulate is that there should be a vastly expanded output.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to say that this experiment requires to be made and we will not oppose this Bill but I am anxious and worried about the price we are being asked to pay for this experiment.  I am not without hope that it may yet be possible to permit curers with established contacts in the British market to continue to operate them at least for an experimental period, so that, if central marketing proves less helpful than we hope, we can fall back on the established channels of trade, whereas, on the other hand, if central marketing provides an abundant market for all that we are in a position to produce, it is demonstrably a lesser hardship on those who have established contacts to surrender them to the central marketing body, provided they are guaranteed that there will become available to them alternative and equally valuable outlets under the central marketing machinery which it is sought to set up under this Bill.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on this Bill.  I do not want to conclude without saying that the experiment ought to get a fair chance.  It is not going to get it on the basis of three, two and one in the personnel.  With my blessing, the Minister should make it three, two and a chairman and to hell with three, Parkinson's Law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerable interest in this measure particularly in the areas of the country which have a traditional record in heavy pig production.  It is worthy of note that one-fifth of all the pigs marketed in this country are produced in County Cork. Anything that would assist in the provision of markets which would guarantee to the producer protection from the variations to which he was subjected in years gone by is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I want to add my voice to the appeal made by Deputy Dillon to the Minister to remove the lack of faith on the part of the producers in the proposal to create this new marketing organisation, by asking him to reconsider his decision regarding the weight of representation of producers in that body.  It will be detrimental to the future of this body if the producers are not satisfied they have fair representation and they are entitled at least to equal representation on this body with any other group.</P>
      <P>I can understand why those who are engaged in the business, particularly some reputable family concerns with a long history of acquired knowledge and experience in marketing in Britain and elsewhere, should feel that the impact would be greater on them than on any other section of the people and that they should have stronger representation. But they are only one party involved in this problem.  Numerically and in importance the producers are paramount and if you have not got the support of the producers behind that project then it will get off to a very doubtful start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to increase the representation of the pig producers on this body.  If he does not do that I believe co-operation will not be forthcoming.  We do know, whether there is substance for it or not, there is very grave criticism of the system of grading as it operates today in many of our bacon factories. It is vital that the producer should have his faith restored not alone in the <Col N="815" /> future of the industry but in the day-to-day working of our bacon factories. If these producers are called upon to act on this board in a minority group they will from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; be actuated by an inferiority complex which cannot but be detrimental to the progress that we all hope will attend any effort to improve the marketing of our pigs and bacon.</P>
    <P>We hope this effort will be successful. It is worthy of a chance.  However, I can recall with considerable feeling the frustration experienced in my locality when another effort was made by private enterprise to establish a concern which would, in effect, have done what this Bill is intended to do. I was one of a small group that secured the interest of one of the most reputable firms in Holland.  They actually came on the site, were prepared to establish a bacon factory, were prepared to give credit to the farmers within a radius of 20 miles and to send out lecturers, before we had the assistance that the farmers now have from the increased number of agricultural advisers now available.  That private company was prepared to do that and we had the benefit of the fact that they were restricted in their output in the country of their origin because of the limitation of supplies to them and the markets that they could not meet from that country, markets in three continents. They looked to a location in the centre of Munster as an ideal one for the development of such an industry.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture at that time denied them a licence, not the Minister now occupying that office.  Whatever powers were responsible for the refusal to license the factory at Millstreet dealt a very hard blow to the pig industry, because among the men who were investing heavily in that concern was a man with some 700 bacon shops in Britain alone who was prepared to sell the products of that concern in that country.  With his money invested in an Irish company giving the facilities it intended to give, surely it was to be expected that he and his colleagues would ensure that the products of that firm would be marketed in such a great market as was then available in Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> That is to some extent crying over spilt milk or over bacon that was not produced.  It was regrettable that it did not succeed but the difficulties presented by the Minister's Department at the time were such as to vitiate completely any efforts that were made to have that industry established.  It was an ideal location and its establishment would have meant a tremendous upsurge in local production, a tremendous improvement in the incomes of the small farmers who resided in that area and who had a very long tradition in pig production and in pig feeding. It was a very great opportunity that was missed and we can only hope the current effort will remedy some of the misdeeds of the past, including the reduction from 235/- to 230/- in the guaranteed price for Grade A bacon which I regard as having been unwarranted. Whatever principles guided the Minister in his decision, they were very ill-advised.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in recent times, in the constituency I represent, we are responsible for a very great pioneering project in the Lombardstown co-operative development.  It is indicative of what people can do when they join together for the common good.  I know the Minister visited the concern, saw it in operation and no doubt was impressed by what he saw.  I am glad the grants for the erection of piggeries were amended to give some little support to similar concerns so that they may be extended throughout the country. I referred to the location of this pioneering industry.  I hope it will be as successful as another pioneering project of the adjoining creamery society, that of the Ballyclough Society which in its own time was responsible for the pioneering of artificial insemination&mdash; quite some time before it received the blessing of the Department and before it was adopted and extended as it now is throughout the State.  I wish this concern well and hope the efforts that the committee and their able manager, Mr. Ryan, have put into the launching of this project will be attended by the success they merit.</P>
    <P>As the leader of the Opposition has indicated, we are not opposing this Bill because we think it should be <Col N="817" /> given an opportunity of improving the marketing conditions for the producers of pigs.  The improvement in the standard of bacon that we have experienced in the past six or seven years can be attributed principally to the guaranteed price in relation to feeding barley.  In my area, which is traditionally pig feeding but is also traditionally dependent on imported grain for feeding pigs, the quality of the bacon produced nowadays is far above that of the time when we were feeding pigs mainly on imported grain.  The land in the area was incapable of growing the type of barley required for pig feeding.</P>
    <P>I must stress at this stage that it is an impediment to people producing pigs if such ancillary schemes as ground limestone, drainage and land reclamation are not pursued with the vigour of former years.  If the effort is not renewed it will make it more difficult for pig producers in areas where it is difficult to produce feeding barley.  I regard any slow-down in this matter as being detrimental to the industry.  That must be done side by side with any efforts we make to provide markets abroad.  In the past few years, there has been a trend away from that development.  If there are pockets in the country where farmers find difficulty in growing grain for pig feeding, there should at least be an effort made to help them, by grants for transport, to have imported into their areas grain from other areas in the country where it is possible to grow it easily.  Ultimately it might be possible, through the schemes I have mentioned, to improve the land in areas where they cannot now grow feeding barley, to such an extent that expenditure on such transport would become superfiuous.</P>
    <P>It is for those reasons that I intervened to say we were prepared to support this Bill.  At the same time, I would stress our anxiety on this side of the House that there be increased representation for the producers on the board.  Much of the good in the Bill will be undone, unless that representation is assured.  We should get it off to a good start and ensure the success of the Bill by seeing <Col N="818" /> that the people most interested in the prosperity of the pig production industry&mdash;the small farmers&mdash;are given equitable representation on the board.</P>
    <P>Any improvement effected in the pig industry will undoubtedly be reflected in the country's economy more than any other encouragement that can be given to any other branch of agriculture.  It is well-established that the people engaged in the production of pigs are the quickest to react to any encouragement from the Government. We must ensure that when they have so reacted, they will not be faced with impediments instead of being encouraged by benefits.  We hope the Minister will reconsider his action in reducing the price by 5/- per cwt. and also the slackening in other measures of encouragement to pig breeders to continue with their efforts.  I would ask the Minister particularly to give urgent consideration to increasing the representation of the producers on the new board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to start by telling the Minister that I could keep him here until 5 o'clock on subjects such as this.  I had to endure much from the predecessors of the board the Minister is now proposing to set up. As the Minister was not then Minister for Agriculture, I am obliged to draw his attention to some of the things that happened in those days.  Pig feeders were passing through very troublesome times, losing a good deal of money. They were told a Pig Marketing Board was to be set up and that the new board then would take office in 1935. That board, or rather a commission, was set up with representatives of the pig producers and the bacon curers. At that time, the pig producers had the idea that, having been given proper representation on the commission, the people they represented would come well out of it.  The records show the result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer the Minister to the report of the body then set up to inquire into the pig industry, including hams and gammons.  It was a very interesting report, dealing with the deliberations of the Commission in 1937 and 1938.  There were <Col N="819" /> representatives of the pig producers on that Commission; the curers were also on it.  When that Commission was formed, one of the principal representatives of the bacon curers said: &ldquo;Thank God, this senseless competition is all gone&rdquo;.  In 1934, the excess profits of the bacon curers were taken to be approximately £10,000.  That may not sound a great deal now but it was a lot then and we were getting only 50/- for a fat pig.  The standard profit of the bacon curers went up and, in 1935, the excess profit was £39,000. I am not objecting to bacon curers making a good profit but when it comes to making excess profit, I do not like it.  I did not like it then because I was contributing to it and I could not afford to do so.</P>
    <P>In 1936, the excess profit was £207,000.  I mentioned that in this House before and I was challenged that it was wrong by a Minister who is dead and I shall let him rest, but there is the figure on page 25 of this report.  In 1937, the excess profit was £52,000.  During that time, we had three pig producers on the board with three bacon curers and we see where the pig producers got.</P>

I am not blaming anybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I say now, and I say it with responsibility, that the grading is all right now but it was not all right then.  The methods used by the curers were not all right and that has left a stigma ever since and that is one of the difficulties the Minister must face.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon seemed to be agreeing or saying that we should have centralised marketing of bacon by this Commission.  I disagree with that and I shall tell the Minister why.  There are many small curers in the country who have gone to Britain on their own initiative and have secured good customers for their bacon and that bacon is going through the ports of Waterford and Dublin but not going to London.  It is going direct to wholesalers in eastern and midland counties of England and to the owners of chain shops.  I know that; I have experience of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Centralised marketing will do away with that and I should be afraid, and I think this is one of the Minister's fears, that the large curers would get too much of a grip on the market and on the marketing board and on the whole system and that the small curers would go out of business. When the small curers go out of business, competition goes.  It is very important that there should be competition. It will be said to the Minister that all the difficulty we have is that we have no continuity of supply.  If you have a small curer supplying a consignment of bacon or hams to his customers, he will endeavour to maintain that supply and when a time comes when pigs are scarce, he will send out a buyer to secure the pigs. With the advertisement that we read in the papers when you have four or five bacon curers advertising for pigs at practically the same prices all round, you will read of some market or fair, or of the Dublin market, where pigs made some 10/- or 12/- more than the factory-quoted prices.  That <Col N="821" /> is the reason why.  Some small curer wanted a supply and he sent out a man to buy them.</P>
    <P>If you bring in centralised marketing, you will give more control to the bacon curer.  It might be said that I should be the last to mention this because two of the biggest bacon curing establishments in the country are in my constituency.  I prefer to be fair about this and to deal with it from the producers' point of view.  I do not think that the commission or the marketing system it would set up, if marketing were centralised, would maintain the contacts with these people.  I have no respect for that kind of centralised selling because the men who would be in it are not responsible in the same way as they would be to their own employers, if they had to go out and look for the markets.</P>
    <P>This Bill will also do away with something else.  The small curers, when going into the British market with their bacon and when their travellers are on the road, are also making it their business to sell specialised pig products.  The more specialised these products are, the more money there is in it for the bacon curers concerned and therefore the more they have in hand to pay out in competitive times to producers.  I ask the Minister to consider this carefully because it is a most dangerous step to centralise the marketing of our pig and bacon products.</P>
    <P>There are forgotten men involved in this.  There are some people in Ireland who are buying pigs for bacon curers and pork butchers.  I am sure there were some of them in the Dublin market yesterday to buy the 1,500 or 1,600 pigs there.  They are of some value to the country and with centralisation here, if the live pig trade changed&mdash;and it could change; something we might not be able to anticipate could happen&mdash;we could compete with the Danes in the British market if the prices for live pigs were better. We were once able to supply bacon factories with a quantity that often kept them working overtime and, at the same time, we were able to ship hundreds of thousands of live pigs to <Col N="822" /> England.  I shall be told that it would be better to have them processed in our own factories but I say &ldquo;No&rdquo;; these were heavy, specialised pigs which were sent over to be used for other purposes where there is a big population to consume pig meat.  I have figures before me that show we were able to export 314,000, 307,000, 408,000 and 476,000 live pigs in four successive years.  They are just wiped out.</P>
    <P>I consider that all the people concerned, and especially those on the selling end, should be represented on the board and the Minister should consider offering a seat on the board to the pig buyers.  I do not agree with Deputy Dillon when he says that the smaller the board, the more efficient it will be. I would prefer to have the board more representative.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the pork producers in his county.  In his county, they were great producers of pork and it was often surprising that the small farmers of Cavan, a county with such a small acreage, could produce such an enormous amount of pork pigs in the season.  I was glad to hear the Minister mention that we are back again in the pork trade in England in a small way, but from the note I took, I gather that what is being sent is saving a subsidy of, say, £38,000.</P>
    <P>Another reason I should speak on this is the importance of the pig industry to the small producer and the small farmer.  To get a small farmer into dairy cows or cattle will cost big money and the majority have not got the big money but he can get into pigs with a small amount of money.</P>
    <P>To go back to what I said when I started, it is important that the producers should have strong representation on the board to make sure that they are protected.</P>

      <P>Very well.  The Minister said that the number of pigs going to the factories was 1,298,000.  That shows how great this industry is and how careful we should be and how much more discussion there should be on this proposal.  I am not speaking here to thwart the Minister or make little of his Bill, but in an effort to help him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summing up, I say that I would not take the step of centralising the marketing of our bacon or handing it over to a central body and wiping out all the contacts the various producers, big and small, have made.  I would not have a board with more representation for the curers than for the producers.  I would not have the board without a representative of the Pig Buyers Association, the people who are buying five thousand to ten thousand pigs a week.  They have some rights and should have representation on it, just the same as the men in the special cream trade who put their case <Col N="824" /> to the Minister when he brought in the recent Milk Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this in any spirit of carping criticism, but in regard to the grading of pigs, I got a terrible scarifying when the grading of pigs started first.  As the years passed and the whole business became a little more rational, many people could see the importance of grading pigs.  We all agree on that but what is damning the whole grading system is that the farmer feels that some pigs are getting a bad grading.  That may be his own fault: they may not have had the right feeding, or perhaps may not have been the right breed, but what makes the farmer annoyed is that if he goes into his grocer some time afterwards to buy bacon, he buys fat bacon and pays a good price for it.  Then he considers that the curer, the grocer or someone else, has done him.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Danes put a mark in their bacon, right from the neck down to the ham.  They advertise in the English papers that, when buying Danish bacon, you will always find this mark on each rasher.  I suggested this before.  I suggested it to Deputy Dillon, when he was Minister for Agriculture, and to the present Minister and I am suggesting it again.  When bacon is graded as Grade A, then the A should be rolled down the whole length.  If it is Grade A special, all right, and if it is Grade B all right, and if it is X, let the X be rolled down on it.  People may say it is a lot of trouble but it is not.  If you go in and see the bacon being processed, you will see that the man has this roller which is heated up inside and which burns out the number of the grade.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Dillon when he says the pig progeny stations need better public relations and better publicity. I would not like the Minister to have central marketing and I want the producers to have the majority on the Board.  I should like the Minister to consider my suggestion that the pig buyers should have a seat on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>With a figure of 70 per cent. between Grade A and Grade <Col N="825" /> A Special given by the Minister in his introductory statement, I think there is little room left for the kind of suspicion which we would all like to propagate in relation to the honesty or dishonesty of bacon curers in grading. That figure of 70 per cent. definitely rules out anything that would tend to be wholesale dishonesty on the part of the curers in the grading of bacon.</P>
      <P>When we come to consider bacon, we must consider pigs and pig production because bacon is the end-product. I have no illusions about the problems facing this new board.  Breed is a factor in the ultimate grading of bacon.  We started the progeny-testing of pigs four or five years ago. It was started by the Danes as far back as 1906.  It is obvious we have considerable leeway to make up before we can draw even with these people in pig production.</P>
      <P>At one time, I was a great believer in the large pig-feeding unit.  I often thought these large pig-feeding units should have been developed as subsidiaries in many of our creameries.  I am not so happy about it now, with the experience of a few years ago when we had an outbreak of swine fever here.  If we had a very large number of these pig-feeding units, one could imagine the chaos and the losses that would accrue in a widespread outbreak of swine fever.  Everything possible should be done to encourage the small producer and to keep him in business.</P>
      <P>We all welcome the introduction of piggery grants.  They will go some distance in bringing back the interest in pig production which the small producer seemed to have lost.  I cannot understand or find any logical reason for, as announced by the Minister, pig production falling so noticeably in areas such as the west of Ireland.  If any form of production is suited to the small holder, surely it is pig production. The pig producer now has a guaranteed price for Grade A pigs. He is not subject to the fluctuations and vagaries of the pig market as he was prior to the introduction of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> We should all like to see a stronger representation for producers on this new board.  The producer has a guaranteed price, to a very large extent, and any complaint he may have of not having an overriding voice in the sale of bacon is neutralised by this.  We have suffered in the main British market for a number of reasons.  Our production of bacon has been of a seasonal type; our production of winter bacon has been low. That is one of the main disabilities under which we suffer.  We cannot create a market for a product, unless we create a taste for it and we cannot create a taste for any product, unless we can guarantee that product to the purchaser in the retail shops for the whole round of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no comparison between bacon and strawberries.  That is one of the disabilities from which we suffer.  One has only to study the marketing methods of our opponents in order to measure their effects.  In Great Britain, you will find a Danish wholesale society in or adjacent to large built-up areas.  It is a huge selling organisation.  I was in one of them on one occasion and the employment content of that one agency was 112 persons.  Their job is to keep Danish products for 52 weeks of the year in the retail shops of Great Britain.  Their job is to receive complaints from people who are vital&mdash; the housewives&mdash;in relation to any Danish product and to shuttle these complaints back to the source of origin for investigation.</P>
      <P>The average consumption of bacon in the United Kingdom is 10,000 tons a week.  The British producer provides something like one-third of the requirements of that market per week. The Danes have a greater portion of that market than the British producer. They have achieved that position by constantly studying the needs and requirements of the British consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The striking feature about the Danish sides of bacon hanging in the big wholesale depots is their absolute similarity.  One would need a calipers to find variation between one <Col N="827" /> side and another.  The uniformity of the grading and of the cured bacon is astonishing.  Again, these selling centres are able to anticipate the market. What we do not realise is that quite a lot of the Danish bacon consumed in Great Britain is exported green to two huge smoke plants which they have&mdash; one at Hull and the other in York-shire. The bacon is smoked.  Smoked bacon is inclined to deteriorate in cold storage.  For that reason the market is kept supplied with bacon from the smoked plants.</P>
    <P>We have no comparable organisation. We suffer from the disability that our sale of bacon has, in the main, been to 14 or 15 agents.  These agents were not concerned about maintaining supplies in any given area. They had a job to do and that was to sell the bacon, get rid of the bacon. They were not concerned about the maintenance of supply or about such vital factors as the type of bacon. Their main job was to sell the bacon which we sent over to them.</P>
    <P>The sale was haphazard.  The supply was haphazard and I often thought that for the volume of bacon which we produce it would be far better for us to make sure that we would maintain the supply as well as the quality in a given area over the entire 52 weeks of the year.  I once remember discussing the position with the manager of one of these Danish selling units and I shall never forget one comment which he made.  That was that we had, as far as the sale of our produce in the British market was concerned, an overall advantage in that we had our own people there to eat it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, we have fallen down as far as advertising is concerned. It is nothing unusual for the Danes to have a Danish week. Recently, Córas Tráchtála organised Irish weeks but long before we had Córas Tráchtála or any such organisation, the Danes had their Danish <Col N="828" /> week.  One watching British television could not but be amazed at the expenditure on advertising Danish bacon. We had nothing at all comparable. We had nothing to compete with that form of advertising.  As a matter of fact, it probably would not pay for the amount we had to sell.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister said in his statement that our contribution represents something like five per cent. of that total market of 10,000 tons per week.  Let us hope that the new selling organisation will at least do something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The success of their job will in the main depend very much upon the uniformity and the quality of the bacon which will be produced by the producers in this country and primarily by the type of bacon produced by the farmers breeding and feeding their sows in the production of bacon.  Curing is a factor.  Uniformity in the product is a factor also. I have the suspicion that many of our small bacon factories do not produce a first class product.  Many of them are equipped with machinery which, I believe, is obsolete and out of date.</P>
      <P>These are the factors we have got to face.  There is no use trying to minimise them.  There is no use saying that we do not agree with the central selling organisation.  If we are going to make any impact on that market, we will have to have an efficient central selling organisation.  We can only get that type of organisation from the kind of Board envisaged in this Bill.  If you want to argue in the opposite direction, the failure of many of our bacon factories to go into the export market and attempt to sell is the most damning evidence against them.  We know that we have to provide some type of organisation that would at least be as efficient and as good a selling organisation as that which we have got to face in competition from the Dutch and the Danes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I think it is high time that we took the <Col N="829" /> necessary steps to sell our bacon in the British market to the best advantage. I appreciate that we shall sell only the best.  No doubt, if we are to maintain the market, we must continue the supply.  We hope to do that as farmers by proper management, proper breeding of sows and proper feeding.</P>
      <P>From the farmers' point of view, we hope to get proper grading from the factories.  I referred to the fact on the Supplementary Estimate that small farmers oftentimes felt that they were not getting the proper grading in the factories.  I believe that the farmer who produces 100 pigs a week will always get reasonable satisfaction but it is the small man, who cannot afford to go to the factory to see his pigs being weighed, who is the victim of circumstances, whereas the big man will get the benefit of the doubt and possibly get Grade A.  The small man, on the other hand, will possibly get Grade B.</P>
      <P>I think the grading of pigs in the factories should be carried out by an independent inspector.  I hope that one of the first steps this new commission will take will be to appoint their representative in the factory to grade the pigs.  At present it is done by the factory management themselves.  It is only human nature if they favour themselves in the grading.  Very often, it is detrimental to the interests of the producer.  Having graded the pigs, I feel that the consumer is entitled to get the grade with which the pig was marked.  Every pig graded should have the stamp of that grade on his back or shoulder, whether it is Grade A, Grade B or Grade C.  When the farmer is paid for Grade B or Grade C, I hold that the consumer is entitled to get bacon at the price of the brand received from the bacon factory.</P>

      <P>Under the Registration <Col N="833" /> Acts, a birth is registrable in the district in which it occurs when it is possible to ascertain the place where the event happened.  It is understood that the birth in question occurred in the Registrar's district of Newport so that the birth should be registered in that district and not in the district in which the parents reside.</P>
      <P>It is the duty of the father or the mother of the child to register the birth.  In default of the father or the mother, however, any person present at the birth is qualified to register it. As the birth did not take place in the County Hospital, Castlebar, the Authorities of that institution would not be qualified under the provisions of the Registration Acts to register the birth.</P>
      <P>I am informed that this information has already been conveyed by the local authority to the parents of the child and to the councillor who raised the matter at the recent meeting of the Mayo County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The insured person referred to in the Question had been in receipt of disability benefit for a prolonged period when it came to the notice of my Department that a claim had been made to the local county council for abatement of rates in respect of his employment for a period during which he was paid benefit.  This claim immediately raised doubts as to his entitlement to benefit and in accordance with normal practice, payment was suspended pending investigation of the alleged employment.  The enquiries, which also involved the investigation of the non-payment of insurance contributions in respect of persons employed by the same employer, were necessarily prolonged. During these enquiries it was established that the insured person resided with the employer and for a number of years, while in receipt of disability benefit, had performed certain duties on the holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After full consideration of the circumstances of the case it has been decided that having regard to his age and general health condition the work which the insured person was capable of performing was mainly light work <Col N="835" /> for which remuneration would not ordinarily be payable.  Accordingly, he is being allowed to retain the benefit already paid to him and his current title to benefit is being preserved.  I should point out that in accordance with the Regulations, benefit is not paid to a person without dependants, while he is an inmate of a hospital or institution but is allowed to accrue to his credit pending his discharge.  He may, however, be paid advances to meet personal requirements while in hospital.  Arrangements are at present being made to ascertain what amount this insured person requires to meet his personal needs so that advances of benefit may be made to him.</P>

Having regard to the facilities available under the Housing Acts for the provision of private dwellings, I do not think that it is generally appropriate for housing authorities to engage in the provision of &ldquo;better-class&rdquo; houses for sale.  Where facilities for the provision of private dwellings are made available to the extent authorised by the Housing Acts, i.e., by the provision of developed sites, supplementary grants and loans by the housing authority, with State grants and the remission of rates, the outgoings on a privately-built house compare very favourably with those for a dwelling provided by a housing authority.  I have, accordingly, suggested to Wicklow Urban District Council that they should consider the provision of developed sites, supplementary grants and loans to facilitate private building for owner-occupation.</P>

      <P>Fees are payable by Radio Éireann to the Performing Rights Society.  The amounts so paid are the subject of formal agreement and are related to the number of licences in force, but it would be contrary to general practice in relation to contracts and contractual arrangements to give details. The fees paid do not cover the broadcast in restaurants or other public places of material protected by the Society.</P>

      <P>The maximum number of marks assigned to each of the subjects mentioned is 400.</P>
      <P>The maximum awarded to subjects in the Certificate Examinations is a matter that is reviewed periodically. It is only as recently as 1949 that the maximum for modern continental languages was raised to the same level as that for Latin and Greek.  A further review will have to be made in connection with the consideration of the Report of the Council of Education on the Secondary school curriculum which has recently been submitted to me.</P>
      <P>In relation to this further review the question will arise as to whether it would be educationally sound to act as envisaged by the Deputy.  There will also arise the question to what extent the choice of languages for study is influenced by the maximum marks assigned to them.  In fact, where Pass and Honours are concerned the particular maximum mark assigned does not arise, but only the percentage obtained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past week I have received correspondence from two farmers' organisations stressing the vital importance of the producers having equal representation with the curers on the Commission <Col N="847" /> which is being set up.  If the harmonious relations which we all hope will obtain are to exist in the commission the producers should have equal representation.  The producer is the keyman in this whole set up.  If we have not production, there is no need for bacon factories or the commission. Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the question of representation for the producer.</P>
      <P>The commission should get off to a flying start and have the confidence of the producer in the first instance and the co-operation of the bacon curers in the second instance.  They are the two vital factors which will make for the success of the commission.</P>
      <P>The commission have a big task ahead of them.  They will have plenty of work to do in the development of markets in England.  I have been in England but I have not had the same experience as Deputy Moher who spent some years there.  Neverthe less, it is quite apparent that the market is there but that it needs to be reorganised.  It is high time that proper steps were taken to reorganise that market and to get our produce into it in an orderly and well-organised fashion.</P>
      <P>I wish the commission every success. I believe that the setting up of the commission is a step in the right direction, and I make one final appeal to the Minister to give the producer this extra seat on the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Agricultural Avisory Committee established by a predecessor of mine gave views and made recommendations on the various problems to which they had been devoting their attention, I was asked what was my opinion about the report and the recommendations which that committee made on the disposal of our bacon on the British market.  I, like some of the Deputies who have spoken on this subject&mdash;I think I made this statement on a previous occasion in this House&mdash;never had any enthusiasm for or great faith in many of these bodies.  Most of us have had enough experience to make us a bit <Col N="848" /> careful about becoming too enthusiastic about what such bodies can do.</P>
      <P>In that frame of mind, I was asked to say what I thought about this report on the marketing of our bacon, and I said this: &ldquo;If there is any commodity that seems clearly to suggest that it should be marketed in a central way, it is bacon.&rdquo;  I said that, not forgetting, as has been mentioned here, how valuable individual contacts can be, individual contacts that have been made by curers and preserved by these firms for years and years. Notwithstanding the importance of these contacts, I think my approach would be accepted by most people, that, if we were to have a marketing board to deal with any products, this was it.</P>
      <P>All speakers who addressed themselves to this Bill today have spoken about the composition of this new commission.  It is true the committee's report, on which the Bill before us is largely based, recommended three producers, three curers, two representatives of my Department and an independent chairman.  It is also true, as I stated in my opening speech, that the Government, on considering that report, decided&mdash;and I would say rightly so&mdash;that a commission of that size was too large, especially when the number of interests involved was not so great as in the case, say of milk products, and that there was no justification for a commission of that size.  Therefore, the White Paper announcing the Government's attitude towards the recommendation, said: two producers, two curers, two Department representatives and an independent chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only when the Government's attitude towards a report of this nature is made known that it is possible to come down to an examination of all the implications of that announcement. When the Government made this announcement, the curers approached me first and then they saw both the Taoiseach and myself.  We had fairly long discussions with them.  I would like the House to remember this.  One does not quickly arrive at a decision such as this one: first of all, there was the recommendation of the committee; <Col N="849" /> secondly, there was the Government's announcement on that recommendation, to be followed by a Bill which in this one respect is a departure from these two.  That can be arrived at only by a process of reasoning and argument between those who are vitally affected and those who have to make the ultimate decision.</P>
    <P>I have no objection at all&mdash;because it is a natural thing to expect&mdash;to slogans being circulated such as: &ldquo;The curers are being given a monopoly of membership on the commission&rdquo; or &ldquo;The curers are being put in control of the commission.&rdquo;  You cannot expect to escape the prospect of your opponent's seizing upon an opportunity like this and using it against you.  I know I would not.  When you are a Minister and have a responsibility to keep your colleagues in the Government advised of what you think is fair and right, these minor considerations as to the way in which any departure from the published intention might be used against you will have no effect upon you.</P>
    <P>I made this change because I felt it was fully justified.  It was justified for the reason that the minimum price to be paid for pigs of a certain quality is guaranteed by the Government. When the pig is purchased and when the processing starts, then it is in the bacon factory that all these things take place.  If we are not to interfere substantially with private enterprise, and if we are not to interfere with the contracts which the curers and other businessmen have made with outside firms, surely we should, in fairness, even if the curers represent only 38 families in the country as against the numerous other people, appreciate that they are entitled to be heard and that, in fact, they have what appears to be an unanswerable case for increased representation on that body.  It was so unanswerable that we wanted, not because of the reason given by Deputy Dillon, to give them fair representation on this body.</P>
    <P>I believe the curers were entitled to be suspicious.  They were entitled to fear that on a board of seven, on which they had only two representatives, there were certain prejudices.  They <Col N="850" /> were entitled to feel that they &mdash; 30 of them representing 38 firms &mdash; were not getting fair treatment on a board which was set up, not to ensure that the producers' price would be this or that, but to market bacon.  They were entitled to ask what would be the result of their purchases of bacon and of their other work.</P>
    <P>We decided that they had a legitimate query.  I knew, immediately I decided, that we were providing for our opponents the stick with which to whip us.  But when you feel that the other person has made a convincing case you must realise that his demands must be acceded to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with the matter of the preservation of these private contracts.  In the course of my discussion with the curers I felt tremendous sympathy for their case. In my opening speech I think I made reference to the fact that we should try, if at all possible, to preserve those indivdual contracts.  Perhaps the commission might be able to maintain those contracts which are very valuable.  If they can do that, consistent with the overall responsibilities that will be given to them, all the better.  We had quite a few suggestions about the pig industry as a whole.  I was somewhat surprised that one of those came from Deputy Dillon because only a few days ago I thought his remarks on the industry were somewhat different from his approach here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day, Deputy Dillon spoke on the advisability of larger finishing units throughout the country.  I shall deal with my own attitude to that by saying that, in the course of a discussion on a Supplementary Estimate a few days ago, mention was made of the pig production industry and also of the Government announcement <Col N="851" /> recently about the improvement in grants for the erection of piggeries. The Deputy then asked me for an assurance that I was not thinking along lines that would suggest I was trying to abolish the small man in the finishing business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall not quibble about those things at the moment.  I am here endeavouring to give my own interpretation of what was said at the time but the records will give it better. I said that, as a man representing a county where the small producer is a very vital factor, not alone in the raising of bonhams, what we call suckers, but in the finishing field as well, I would be the last man in the House &mdash; I do not think there would be any other &mdash; who would do anything to hurt the small producer.  It would come to me as a surprise were I to learn that Deputy Dillon believed in the larger type of finishing unit.  If he does believe in the larger finishing unit so do I but I do not regard it as the be-all and the end-all.  The larger finishing units such as that in Lombardstown and those that are being erected elsewhere are desirable developments but I cannot see that we can ever take that sort of effort to the stage when they would prove to be the answer to finishing problems in regard to pigs and where farmers could devote themselves merely to the raising of bonhams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody has suggested that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to think that would ever happen.  Only a few weeks ago I read where a number of northern farmers met for the purpose of denouncing business men who had taken advantage of British price supports and who had gone into the business of that type&mdash;<Col N="852" /> poultry, eggs, broilers and bacon&mdash; and had fastened upon that opportunity of having large-scale production to the detriment of the real farmer producer.  In fact, we were fairly generous with the amount of these grants for the purpose of giving some encouragement to co-operative centres, such as that in Lombardstown or Ballyclough or in any other part of the country, big or small, to go in for the finishing of pigs, but I should not like to think that our industry would be based on the idea that we could look forward to that sort of development meeting what we now believe to be the real requirements of the industry.</P>
      <P>I already mentioned, and some Deputies also mentioned, the fact that production has gone down in the province of Connacht and in the three Ulster counties as against increases elsewhere.  When I attended a meeting of a county committee of agriculture in Galway and was invited to speak by being asked questions I expressed my disappointment that this should be so.  I expressed the same view recently in my own county.  I do not think this is altogether a recent development.  In my own county, I do not think this is altogether a recent development.  In my own county, I have often noticed that in the extreme north west, where the land is very poor and the holdings small and valuations low, one rarely saw a pig.  The same applies I think in congested parts of Donegal and in many other parts where economic circumstances are similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never could understand why that was so even if they had to buy the feeding stuff or most of it.  I could not understand why they could not do better in that line.  I think the same could be said of poultry.  It is not easy to know how one could change an attitude of mind that has been so long in existence in these areas. Undoubtedly, while the tendency in those areas was always as I have described it, it is more pronounced now. Pig production has always had its ups and downs but in my county, especially in areas where pig production has continued down through the years as long as I can remember, very few items produced on the farm contributed <Col N="853" /> more than pig production to enabling those engaged in farming in a small way to make ends meet while trying to raise a family.  That is one of the reasons my inclination is to do anything possible to help this industry and why I am very anxious to be associated with any effort in that direction.</P>
    <P>It is foolish to expect too much from this re-organised commission. When one looks at the figures and marketing institutions referred to in my opening speech, I think one must concede that there was something radically wrong.  I deliberately asked the advisory body when reporting on this to comment specially on this aspect of the trade and they found the same problem.  Nobody could see how that situation could be brought to an end.  I do not know how successful this reorganised commission may be in that field but the effort is surely called for.  While I do not want to be unduly optimistic as to the prospects of success, I feel the commission was necessary and I hope that when this body is set up it will tackle its work with determination.  I believe that with a body such as is outlined in this Bill and with the representation given, which is not loaded in one way or another, a fair effort is being made which should establish confidence in the minds of those concerned.  I believe it will do that.</P>
    <P>I could deal with these other matters of grading, percentages and all the suggestions made that something should be done to establish confidence in the minds of producers about the fairness of the present grading system. I think most of the Deputies who spoke about this believed that the grading system is fair enough.  The committee, which could not be regarded as prejudiced in favour of the curers, seem to accept the proposition that grading is fair, as shown in paragraph 93 of their report.</P>
    <P>There is this notion of sending in somebody to be on the side of the producers and somebody else on the side of the curers.  All that will cost money for a small return.  If one were to find something was wrong and had to take that step, it would be worth <Col N="854" /> providing, but if one is not even suspicious that even in a general way there is anything wrong on the part of the curers, then it would not be justified.  There is nothing as bad as appointing people for a service for which they are not required.  Not only would I have pity for those who would have to pay them but also for the people who might want to work and who might find that there was no work for them to do and find themselves doing nothing.</P>
    <P>I dealt with this matter of grading during the course of my few remarks at the conclusion of the debate on my Supplementary Estimate.  It is a subject to which I have addressed myself many times at public meetings in the country, both in my own constituency and in others.  I never believed at any time that there was a deliberate attempt on the part of the curers to give a wrong grading.  I concede that mistakes can happen and that even the person in charge of the grading might not be as conscientious in his work as he should be.  I concede a lot of things like that, but one thing I never conceded, even when the scheme was first introduced and people were far less accustomed to it than now, was that there was such a deliberate attempt. I often met farmers and deliberately said to them:  &ldquo;I do not believe a thing about that.&rdquo;  I have kept on saying that since, simply because I do not believe that businessmen would even dream of lowering themselves in such a way, even if they were sure of getting away with it.</P>
    <P>I agree that public confidence is an ideal thing.  I do not admit that there is any formidable lack of confidence, so far as grading is concerned.  I do not believe that the large producer has that great advantage over the small man, inasmuch as he can go in and say to the curer: &ldquo;If you do not treat me better, I will go somewhere else.&rdquo;  I believe that the small farmers are able, with their own eyes, to select the pigs which they think will grade well in a factory and send them to the factory.</P>

      <P>I can tell the Deputy they are doing it.  I am not saying that the eye will keep them right at all times but they can make a fair effort at it and they sell the other pigs by hand.  The small producers are not lacking in confidence in the method, but they are afraid of it.  If they think their pigs are not just what will meet the case, if I may use the expression, they say: &ldquo;Well, maybe I had better sell them by hand&rdquo;.  The confidence is not lacking to the extent that one would be justified in going to the expense of introducing a cumbersome system.  I think it was tried before in 1935-39 and I do not believe it made the slightest impression on anybody, nor do I believe that it would now, if it were attempted again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, as I say, is a very important industry.  It is one which I should like to see expanding.  I hope the steps we have taken, the provision of better grades and so on, will help in that direction.  Let me say that the extent to which we did call upon the producer to meet some of the cost some time ago of exporting our surplus bacon was a result of discussion between the curers' representatives, the producers' representatives and ourselves. The amount of the deduction was agreed by the three parties.  In these circumstances, where you have discussions between the State&mdash;which was called upon to carry a burden like this&mdash;the producer and the processor &mdash;who is interested in the position both as a taxpayer and as a businessman&mdash; who sit down and say: &ldquo;Here is a business we want to expand, but it is a difficult market outside the country and it is a costly market for the taxpayer so what can we do?&rdquo; and, by <Col N="856" /> agreement, fix a price of 5/- per cwt. towards the Central Fund to enable us to come together to combine to sell our surplus bacon with the least expense to the taxpayer, then people like ours must be prepared to accept an arrangement like that.  It shows that they are serious and do not want it every way.</P>
    <P>There is no question, to my mind, that it will have any detrimental effect, because, as I showed from the figures I quoted in the course of my introductory speech, there is a very welcome and substantial movement towards increasing the pig population.  That is something we all desire and I hope this Bill, and the commission, when it is re-constituted, will contribute something towards giving the movement in this important industry further impetus in that direction.</P>
