      <P>It gives me great pleasure and it is an honour to propose the name of Deputy James M. Dillon to Dáil Éireann for election as Taoiseach.  I do so in the knowledge that Fianna Fáil have not retained the confidence of the majority of the people.  There are many reasons why he should be elected.  The policy outlined by him and by Fine Gael is, in my opinion, the only programme that can bring about economic prosperity for our country and national unity.  His statesmanship, patriotism and work for Ireland require no commendation from me.  He is a parliamentarian <Col N="16" /> of a very high order.  He is an Irishman whom we all, no matter on which side of the House we sit, can admire and praise for his work. We can be proud of him, indeed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is an industrialist, a businessman and a farmer.  He has proved himself, while in the Department of Agriculture, an able administrator. While there, he was able to assist the industrialist, the agriculturist, the worker.  The fact that in three and a half years, he brought one million acres of land into production and that Fianna Fáil brought only 400,000 acres in 4½ years, in my opinion, is a testament to his ability.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons why Deputy Dillon should be elected as Taoiseach. I shall try to cite some of the reasons briefly, I hope.  The Land Project, the scheme for liming and fertilising the land, the progeny-testing scheme for our livestock and the Agricultural Institute are all testaments of his ability and his dynamic work.  He has shown his ability as an administrator by the part he played in the 1948 Trade Agreement.  I want to point out that that agreement is now one of the mainstays of our industrialists and is of great benefit to the agricultural community.  The fact of the matter is that by that 1948 Trade Agreement he helped the farmers in their convalescence&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;convalescence&rdquo; deliberately&mdash; following the long illness they suffered during the Economic War and the World Wars.</P>
      <P>As I say, he proved his skill as an administrator and that, in my opinion, fits him for the task of negotiating our entry into the Common Market.  He does not depend upon translators or interpreters.  I assert that is a gift from God that can be, and will be, if he is elected, of great benefit to our people.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the House that during the war period, he served on the Defence Conference and drew from the then Taoiseach, now the President of Ireland, a very high tribute for his work in that Conference in the interests of the Irish people, even though slanderers would like to say otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> In 1943, we had a somewhat similar position to that which exists today. The world was then at war and because of that fact, I advocated the formation of a National Government to meet the dangers that might then confront the country.  That proposal was rejected by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not advocate that now for the simple reason that, in my opinion, Party Government is best suited to this country and best suited to all democratic countries. Therefore, although there are perhaps some people, and I think a newspaper or two, who advocate it, I do not now advocate it or suggest it.</P>
    <P>History has a knack of repeating itself. I want to remind the House that at that time, in proposing that Mr. W.T. Cosgrave be elected as Taoiseach to form a National Government, I asked the then Leader of the House if it was his intention to carry on the policy he had carried on up to then, and the answer was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  I pointed out that the result of that policy would be a continuation of emigration which was then at the highest figure ever&mdash;except for the past couple of years&mdash;in the history of the country, and that more of our boys would join the British armed forces.  That opinion was borne out by subsequent events.</P>
    <P>I ask that question now and I presume I have been answered by the Taoiseach&mdash;he is still Taoiseach.  In his final rally, he said that Fianna Fáil would continue with their policy.  I assert that under that policy there is no hope for the people of this country.</P>

      <P>No hope.  That is as true today as it was in 1943. There is no doubt about it because the facts have been established since. We find ourselves today in the position that the only hope for this country is a Fine Gael Government which will put their policy into effect.  I suggest that the 50,000 people who voted for Fianna Fáil at the last election, and who voted for Fine Gael at this election, have been converted to that view, and if we had had a longer time to put our policy to the people, the number would have been greater.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of Fine Gael is clearly set out.  It is a policy of fair play for all, in city, in town and in country.  The burden of local rates is now intolerable.  Over £22,000,000 has been collected from the ratepayers over the years 1960-61. I want to remind the House that that is more than the total revenue of the Exchequer in 1932 and that was then an intolerable burden, according to Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Our policy will take particular care of our industries.  It plans to increase and expand them.  It plans to protect our workers who are engaged in these industries; it plans to protect the people who have invested money therein, and generally to expand our exports as set out by us in our 1956 plan.  Even the most hardened Fianna Fáil supporter will admit that the Gerard Sweetman plan when he was Minister for Finance in 1956 has done much to extend and develop our export trade.  I congratulate Fianna Fáil on having adopted it, because whatever success they have had in that regard is due to that plan.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael policy will give effective health services based on equity and the moral code.  It will deal with the problems of ground rent in a way that is fair to both landlord and tenant.  In the cities and towns, that is a very important matter.  The education of our youth is also of great importance and Fine Gael believe that in future we must have boys and girls efficient and well educated not only in Irish and English, but in French, German, Spanish, Italian and, God save us, even in Russian.  There is a challenge to be met and if we do not face up to it, we will be in the position which I have described before, in which we will have to depend on translators and interpreters because we will not understand what other people are saying.  It is imperative, therefore, that our educational plan should be put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our system of loans to farmers who avail of our advisory services and <Col N="19" /> thus develop and increase our production in agriculture, is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that Fine Gael have put in their programme a very positive clause that will see to it that justice and fair play are given to the existing members of the Defence Forces and to our former comrades of 1916 to 1923, no matter what side they took in that period.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, propose the name of Deputy James Dillon to the Dáil and in doing so, I am satisfied that if he is elected, the programme which he plans for the people will have an opportunity of being put into effect.  I say that if he is elected Taoiseach, Deputies will be voting for the spiritual and material welfare of our people.  I have no doubt whatever about that.  I can go further and say that Deputies will be electing a man whose traditions are long and well-founded.</P>
    <P>Again, no matter what slanderers may say, he comes from the clan whose forebears hoisted the Tricolour at Ballingarry.  There are very few people in this country today who can live up to the high ideals of Deputy James Dillon.  I now nominate and propose him as Taoiseach of this, the most important assembly in Ireland that, under God, will bring us the prosperity and economic development we all desire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our presence here today is the result of the verdict which the people have given in the recent general election.  I gather from the <i>Irish Press</i> today that the outturn of the figures for the different Parties is a source of some embarrassment, but I do not think that is a situation which it is impossible to remedy.  It seems to me that at the opening of a new Parliament the two main Parties of this State who were born out of an unhappy event which has long since passed into history might well consider the question of merging their forces and avoiding <Col N="20" /> the embarrassment of which the <i>Irish Press</i> speaks today.</P>
      <P>Many people in this country, even those in the different political Parties, think that a reorganisation of these Parties, on the basis of economic policies and not on distant political happenings, is long overdue and now would seem to be as appropriate a time as any other we are likely to find in the next five years to undertake that reorganisation.  I have watched both Parties in this House and I have watched their actions, especially when matters which are distinctive items of Labour Party policy have been under consideration.  Many and many a time in this House in debates and in divisions, the Labour Party was found on one side and the other two Parties, notwithstanding their supposed differences, were found united on the other side.  If there is a substantial basis of agreement between them, it seems to me that with courage and some pioneering effort an attempt could be made to bring about if not a complete merger at least a reorganisation which would bring together in one Party substantial groups in each of the two large Parties who appear to have the same kind of economic outlook and the same kind of political philosophy.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has now as always its own distinctive policy.  It has fought the last election as an independent Party and on the basis of that policy.  It is to reaffirm its independence and its separateness that we have decided to nominate Deputy Brendan Corish for election as Taoiseach which I now formally do. Deputy Corish is a young, active member of this House.  His qualifications as a parliamentarian are well and favourably known.  His administrative ability as a Parliamentary Secretary and Minister are on record for all to read.  He has all the qualifications which are necessary to make a successful Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may well happen that in the procedural arrangements which govern this House there will not be an opportunity for Labour Deputies to vote for Deputy Corish but, at least, we <Col N="21" /> have put on record the reasons why we have nominated him.  I merely want to add to these reasons this intimation that to reaffirm the independence of the Labour Party and its distinctive role as compared with other Parties we shall vote against the nominations for Taoiseach made by any other Party in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding Deputy Norton's motion I wish to make it clear that we believe that the programme for which our colleague Deputy Corish stands is different from and completely independent of the policies for which Deputy Lemass and Deputy Dillon stand.  For too long too many people outside have thought it should be the role of the Labour Party, a small political Party, to act as a tail-end of one of the larger Parties. I would remind the House and the people outside that no later than the 1st September it was proved to all and sundry that, when it came to a matter of grave importance, there was no difference whatsoever between the policy of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, and the policy of Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>We of the Labour Party believe that while the distance to be travelled may take a little while yet, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will eventually have to come together.  There is nothing between them except the old sores that we hope are nearly now healed. When that time comes, inside this Chamber and outside it, people will realise that the Labour Party policy advocated by our Leader, Deputy Corish, will be the only alternative to the existing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make clear our position on the proposal before us and our attitude in regard to the decision we intend to take.  On the last occasion on which we were voting for a Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass went forward with the greatest majority behind him that any Party has ever had in this House.  We believed, and we said so at that time, that he got that majority from the people on the understanding and the assumption that he appreciated the people had <Col N="22" /> become sick and tired of repeated changes of Government which did not bring fundamental or radical changes in policy.  He was given that strong overall majority for which he asked on that occasion and we exhorted him to use that position, that authority and that power to make these radical and fundamental changes which could save our country from the continuing condition of decay in which it has found itself during the last 40 years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass refused to accept that mandate from the people.  He refused to accept that interpretation of that powerful mandate and seems to have used his powerful majority merely to fritter away the goodwill, the support and authority which he was given in that Dáil.  The result of the continuation of conservative economic policies, with continued reliance on private enterprise as opposed to public investment, productive capital investment, has led, as everybody knows well, to a continual catastrophic drop in our population. This has shown itself in the very high emigration figure and reflects the failure of the Government to provide opportunities for employment here at home.  In addition to that there has been the failure of the Government, due, they say, to a lack of adequate national income, to provide for better social services, better health services and better educational facilities for our people.  They appear themselves to have been caught in the trap of their own propaganda that we were a prosperous society, propaganda put out in the teeth of the truth that we are, in fact, a society rapidly falling into decay and decadence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the previous Dáil, we put forward a number of motions containing, as we believed, progressive, constructive suggestions for government.  These included reference to health services, better educational services, matters dealing with the language and, above all, the extension of public ownership in regard to a number of the basic industries in the country.  During the lifetime of that Dáil we were opposed consistently on all these proposals by Deputy Lemass and his associates.  We received on the unimportant ones the <Col N="23" /> support of Fine Gael and their continued opposition to the more progressive and radical of our views.  But throughout the lifetime of that Dáil it could be said we received the constant support of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>During the last election, it seems to us that one thing became completely clear to everyone&mdash;that there is no fundamental difference in the basic social and economic policies of the two great Parties.  Proposals put forward by them for the solution of our economic problems were based primarily on private enterprise and were the same propositions put forward here time and time again for the last 40 years and which have failed time and time again for the last 40 years.  We share the public's own view that the only difference between the two, if there is any difference at all, was the relatively unimportant one as to whether Irish should be revived by compulsory or voluntary methods, which is of no real importance when you take into account the condition and difficulties of our people.</P>
    <P>The public took the view that Deputy Lemass should not be entrusted with an overall majority and that neither should Deputy Dillon be entrusted with an overall majority. They made it clear, as near as it appears to me it was possible to make it clear, that in their view there should be a merger of the two great Parties and that they should then go to the country again as a single unit professing the same faith.  I should like to repeat Deputy Norton's assertion that if there is great instability, then I do not think that the minority groups can take the blame for it.  If the two great Parties resist this direction from the public, it is they who must accept any responsibility for any instability there may be in the lifetime of the present Dáil.</P>
    <P>In the last election also, the Labour Party came out on a number of issues in which we were particularly interested.  They said they wanted to see a society in which every man's child had the same right to higher education, irrespective of whether the <Col N="24" /> parents could afford it or not.  They said they wanted to see the end of the blue cards, the end of means test medicine in Ireland, and to see a health service in which all were treated equally.  They said they wanted to see a society in which the old people were treated with respect and dignity.  Most of the Parties made those same professions but, in addition to those professions, the Labour Party pointed out that they believed the only way in which it would be possible to create the wealth necessary to provide for those services or the extension of those services would be by a wider extension of public ownership.</P>
    <P>We share those views.  We believe it is only by a wide extension of public ownership that it will be possible for us, in the first place, to direct the financial resources of our State towards creating a level of investment which will provide work for all those men who are able to work and want to work.  Secondly, we believe that it is only through public ownership that investment will be in the proper raw material in industry in Ireland, that is, the raw material of processed agricultural and marine goods of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we believe that only through public ownership would it be possible to raise national income to a level which would make possible the realisation of all these ambitions in regard to education, health and the care of the aged.  Fourthly, and above all, we believe that in the very troubled and very difficult times which lie ahead of this country in regard to the Common Market, there is no question whatsoever that the pocket type of industry we have at present, which flowed from the inefficiency of private enterprise here, cannot survive competition from the great industrial cartels in Central Europe.</P>
    <P>Because of those views we believe that we must support the candidature of Deputy Corish as Taoiseach and that we must oppose the candidature of Deputy Lemass and of Deputy Dillon.  I should like to add on our behalf that, in the event of Deputy Corish not being elected Taoiseach, <Col N="25" /> we want to give the assurance that where matters are considered by the Dáil and proposals put forward by whatever Taoiseach is elected, be it Deputy Lemass or Deputy Dillon, we shall give those which we consider to be progressive, forward-looking proposals, likely to be in the best interests of the public, our full support.  As for the others, we shall consistently oppose them.</P>

      <P>As an Independent, I do not have to play any Party game. I shall not make any speech about policies but I shall come down to essentials.  I am concerned only with the person who can form a Government that has some chance of survival. I am not interested in voting for people &mdash;even though I may admire them&mdash; who can form a Government that will last only for weeks.  I do not think the Dáil or the public want another election.  In fact, members of all Parties have come to me and said they hoped Deputy Lemass would be elected because they did not want another election.  Even members of the Opposition have said that to me.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with figures, with the fact that there are 70 members of the Fianna Fáil Party and all others together comprise 74.  You, Sir, are one, and that leaves us with 73.  The 70 members of Fianna Fáil can all be &ldquo;whipped&rdquo; into being here.  That does not apply to the other side.  There are six groups on the other side.  Who can &ldquo;whip&rdquo; the Independents into being here?  Nobody.  Who can &ldquo;whip&rdquo; Deputy Dr. Browne into being here?  Not Deputy McQuillan.  I am concerned with forming a Government. I would like to vote for Deputy Dillon and Deputy Corish, because both of those gentlemen have been very kind to me.  In fact, if I ever encountered any hostility, it was from Deputy Lemass's Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rising above that.  There is the country to be considered and not Parties.  There is the question of the country being able to carry on to meet such problems as the Common Market and unemployment; there is the question of our boys in the Congo; there is the question of Partition.  These are the <Col N="26" /> matters we should consider, and not this little game.  Everybody admits it is a little game.</P>
    <P>I would warmly support a National Government, but such has not been proposed.  Deputy Lemass has not said he is interested in such a proposal. It is up to Deputy Lemass whether he has a Coalition.  I can help in forming a Government that will last a reasonable time.  Any other Government would not last three weeks, let alone three months.  As I said, we can play any little game we like.  I shall say no more, except to emphasise that I am not voting for Fianna Fáil&mdash;I am voting for a Government.</P>

      <P>I am convinced that this country's future in the modern world can be secured only by a positive policy based on the highest principles of labour and liberalism&mdash;the highest principles of labour and liberal philosophy.  Conservative thought and action, long pursued by the Old Guard of both the major Parties in this country, have brought us only continuous emigration and loss of faith, particularly among the youth, in the future of the country.</P>
      <P>In those areas of governmental activity where any discernible progress has been achieved, such as the provision of houses for the people living in the many thousands of hovels scattered over the length and breadth of this land, it will be found on examination and it will be known to those who have studied it over any period, that those improvements, where they exist, have come about as a result of pressure and leadership from those public representatives whose fundamental beliefs are anchored upon the welfare of the ordinary citizens&mdash;the men Theobald Wolfe Tone referred to as the men of no property.  On the other hand, in those spheres where little or no progress has been seen&mdash;notably, I would say, in the treatment of the sick and the aged&mdash;there is plainly to be observed by all the handiwork of such of our Parties as have been quite content to tick over in the stagnation of a <i>laissez-faire</i> economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am mandated to vote first for <Col N="27" /> Deputy Corish, the Leader of the Labour Party.  Should he not be elected Taoiseach, my organisation feels I should vote for a second choice &mdash;Deputy Lemass.  It would, however, appear that the mechanics of the election of Taoiseach&mdash;with the nominees of the major Parties, Deputies Lemass and Dillon, being presented to the House first for approval&mdash;will deprive me of the opportunity of making a second choice.</P>
    <P>Therefore, much as I detest the idea of abstention&mdash;it is repugnant to my whole being&mdash;nevertheless, by according with the rules of the House and in accordance with my mandate, I shall have to wait until Deputy Corish's nomination is put forward, if we reach that stage, before casting an affirmative vote.  I must make it very clear, in case my action is construed as a silent over-all approval of the policy of Fianna Fáil, that I shall not hesitate to vote against Deputy Lemass, should he introduce legislation which I consider to be detrimental to the interests of working people, such as his recent notion about compelling strikers to work against their will.  Finally, for the benefit of the Labour Party, I would add that while voting now for Deputy Corish, I shall, nonetheless, pursue my own independent line on all matters which affect the Irish people, as I am doing here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the speeches of the Party politicians.  I cannot describe them in any other way. Considering that the population of this country has fallen considerably more in the past five years than in the previous 30 years, and considering that 200,000 of our people have emigrated in the past five years for want of employment, I think this is quite sufficient to prove the failure of Party politics in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are faced with a crisis when we find over 200,000 of our people leaving in five years in search of employment abroad, notwithstanding all we read in the Press and all we hear over the radio.  All that simply bespeaks failure.  In such a crisis, it is my view <Col N="28" /> and the view of a good many people that the Party politicians should settle their differences on this occasion and form a National Government.  I had intended to move an amendment, which was not accepted because it was not on the Order Paper, and I would ask the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to give the members of the House an idea of what was in that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann requests Deputy Lemass, as outgoing Taoiseach and as Leader of the largest Party in the House, to consult with the Leaders of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party with a view to the formation of a National Government, and that the House do adjourn until 6 p.m. to enable such consultations to take place before the election of a Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>That is what I intended to have discussed. It was not on the Order Paper and therefore it was not in order to take it.</P>
      <P>Apart from the serious crisis which follows the failure of Party politics, there is also the question of the Common Market.  The outgoing Government neglected that for a few years.  It was only when Britain decided to join the Common Market that our Government made a move in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we have the best brains of those three Parties united in action for the good of the people and the country generally, we are bound, I have no doubt, to get some good from the Common Market.  If we handle it properly, it may be possible for this country to escape the shackles of one market which we have at present and also of one financial institution that happens to be the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  It is time for us to make a move, to speak for ourselves, to have Irishmen of different persuasions speaking on behalf of Ireland and not to allow other people <Col N="29" /> to speak for Ireland.  I am afraid that is what is happening to-day.</P>
    <P>So, in view of the terrible unemployment and emigration and the coming of the Common Market, I appeal to Deputy Lemass, in the interest of our people and in the interest of the country, he being the Leader of the largest Party in this House and the outgoing Taoiseach, to use his utmost endeavour to form a National Government with his own Party, Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  If that works out, the Independents and the other people should not get any representation in such a Government.</P>
    <P>I would again ask the outgoing Taoiseach to try to form a National Government.  If he gives any assurance that he is inclined to do so, I will support his election; if he does not, I shall vote against him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my few remarks by saying that I think this is a great day for Ireland, rather than a tragedy.  The people have reduced the majority the Fianna Fáil Party had.  While the Fine Gael Party have increased in number, the increase has not been sufficient.  It has been stated by Deputy MacEoin that Fianna Fáil have lost the confidence of the people. Certainly, they have lost seats but how one would weigh the numerical difference and ascribe it to a lack of confidence is something I cannot understand.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party, by the number of candidates they put forward, gave no indication that they had any ambition to govern the country as a Labour Party.  If they had done so or if the position were in any way different, I would be with them, just the same as I was with them in the lonely days when we voted on five or six occasions against the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is a good thing that the Fianna Fáil Party will hesitate, as Deputy Dunne said, before introducing or endeavouring to pass legislation that is so obnoxious to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Sherwin, I can say truthfully that no member of any Party has approached me since I was <Col N="30" /> elected last Thursday.  That, I am very pleased to say and I say it without fear of contradiction.  I am sure, of course, that they know they would be on a losing wicket, in any case.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party have shown that they made an honest effort to secure election as the Government but the people did not give them the necessary return to enable them to do so.  I am not going to speak of coalition in any degree.  I do not know how one would parse or analyse the difference between a National Government and a Coalition Government. Deputy Barron asserts that he would support a National Government, which, apparently, Independents would not be good enough to support.  Let us not have any misinterpretation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>In the area I represent, Fine Gael increased their number and Labour did not improve.  I want to take this opportunity to try to kill at this stage the often repeated statement: &ldquo;Oh, Carroll&mdash;he is just Fianna Fáil in disguise.&rdquo;  Carroll is not Fianna Fáil in disguise but maybe by virtue of the fact that Carroll, too, was a participant in that awful tragedy of 40 years ago, his leanings and his feelings must be channelled in one particular direction.  That is not what I want to perpetuate.</P>
      <P>As I say, when we were brought back to this House during the recess, I voted against the Government repeatedly.  I will still vote against the Government repeatedly or against any Government or any Coalition on matters which I believe are not in the interests of the people.  Accepting the position, I have no alternative but to support the nomination of Deputy Seán Lemass as Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>When I offered myself in my constituency to the people, I offered myself as an Independent candidate and I had no hesitation in telling them that when I would eventually come to Leinster House, I would remain Independent.  Therefore, on this occasion, I am not voting for Deputy Lemass, Deputy Dillon or Deputy Corish as Taoiseach.  However, whatever Government are elected here today, I hope they will be a good Government.</P>
      <P>Coming from a rural area and from a farming area, there is one point I should like to make, of which I hope the newly elected Government will take stock.  From every side of the House, it has been admitted freely and clearly that agriculture is our premier industry.  That being so, our marketing system is of supreme importance. It is a sad reflection that within the past two months, bacon on the British market has fallen by at least £2 per cwt.  In the country the pig is regarded as the poor man's friend.  It is also sad to think that last week foreign bacon was making 15/- per cwt. more than our first quality Irish bacon.  It is up to the incoming Government&mdash; whether a Fianna Fáil, a Fine Gael or some other Government&mdash;to give the producers a lead in that direction, to put the proper salesmen there and have something done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make and I do not want to go into Government policy.  I am very new in this House, but I would appeal to whatever Government are elected to do something about the cost of living and to subsidise at least two items, bread and butter.  In the canvass of two or three towns, I found that bread and butter are both scarce and dear, as far as the poor man is concerned. I can see no reason why these items cannot be provided at the right price for our own people.  This country at the moment is top heavy with milk and milk products.  I know that in the towns and in the country margarine is <Col N="32" /> being substituted for butter.  By subsidising butter, money would not leave the country but we would create a taste for butter which would mean greater consumption and put money in the producer's pockets, whilst enabling our people to consume an item of diet which is so necessary to human life.</P>
    <P>I should also like to tell the incoming Minister for Health that the present health scheme is a failure.  I am a member of the Westmeath County Council and my biggest trouble at the moment is trying to restore health cards which have been taken away from people who deserve them.  I suggest that this scheme should be revised.  It is not working the way it was intended to work.  As I have already stated, for my term of office, whether it be long or short, I shall support any policy that is good for my constituents.  I shall oppose any policy conflicting with their views, irrespective of what Party is involved.  That is all I have to say and I hope the right Government will be selected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.R. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>As an Independent member, my leanings happen to be with the Labour Party and if the Labour Party happened to be in a position to nominate and elect a Taoiseach and form a Government, that Party would get my support.  However, that is not going to happen.  I do not think that a coalition between Deputy Blowick and Deputy Browne could by any means form a Government, so, therefore, I am left with a choice between two other Parties.  To my mind the choice between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is a choice between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.  However, I have to look at the matter realistically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take Fine Gael for a start.  That Party, apart from its leadership, has too many spacemen and West Britons in it to appeal to me.  That is the Party which went out a few weeks before the election and announced its famous 21 points policy.  They might as well have handed out 21 pints of porter for all the support it got.  That would have achieved as much.  That Party, during the election campaign. <Col N="33" /> set out to sell its own soul and the soul of Ireland for the sake of political power.  The Irish language should not have been used in the political campaign, and I hand no bouquets or laurels to the Party that used it as a plank in their platform.</P>
    <P>With regard to Fianna Fáil&mdash;a Party whose leaders, and in many cases, its members, have been up in the clouds for the past four and a half years and have now come back to earth with a shock&mdash;I would say this: if Deputy Lemass is elected Taoiseach, and I think he will be, and if he forms a Government, he will have my support, but under certain conditions.  He will definitely have to come down to earth and change his rich man's policy. Deputy Lemass, if he is to remain in power, will have to decide between rich and poor.  It is my opinion that the rich men, after being pampered for quite a long time, should be able to live without Government subvention or Government intervention of any kind on their behalf.  If Fianna Fáil, when it forms a Government, will turn its mind towards making more of the poor richer rather than making the rich richer, it will be doing a good day's work for Ireland and the people, particularly those whom I represent along the western coast.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about industrialisation and to read all that we see in the papers about this famous policy of industrialisation, but it brings rather cold comfort to the people of the West where the only industry about which the people know anything is ship building.  They fill the ships, of course; they do not make them.  Their other chief &ldquo;industry&rdquo; is the dole office queue.  Deputy Lemass will have to do something about these things.  It is time something were done about them.</P>
    <P>It is sad that after almost 40 years of native Government, the two chief monuments to the Governments' inefficiency down through the years are the numbers on the emigrant ships and the queues at the dole office doors. When Deputy Lemass and his Party show me definitely that at last they have decided to remedy these defects, and they are very obvious defects to <Col N="34" /> us in the West, he shall have my wholehearted support.  He must, as was stated by the Deputy who preceded me, give our children a chance to eat reasonable meals.  It is all right to subsidise butter and send it to feed people in England, but our own people come first and it is time we gave them what they so badly need and what should have been given to them without people from the West having to intervene in a debate of this kind.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House. Apparently some of the speakers before me thought that the election was not over at all&mdash;they spoke for so long.  There is one other point I should like to mention.  There is a young man from the town of Ballina who is in jail.  If he were a criminal, he would be entitled to a remission of sentence. If he were in jail in the unchristian North, he would be entitled to a remission of sentence, but when he comes from the Catholic South, he gets no remission.  I shall continue to remind Deputy Lemass of that young man until he releases him.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Lemass will meet me even half way on these points, I shall see that his Government run smoothly because I want to see industrialisation for the West and I know the type of industrialisation we got from the gentlemen on the left.  They closed everything.  As far as I am concerned, if some Fianna Fáil Deputies are making fortunes from the sale of locks, they should thank the Fine Gael Government for setting up the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you put the motion, Sir, I should like to intervene for a few moments to make it clear that I have not asked any Deputy in this House, outside the members of my own Party, to support the motion, either by their vote or by their abstention. I hope, and I expect, that every Deputy will vote in accordance with his own judgment as to what is the best course for the country, having regard to the circumstances which have arisen as a result of the general election.  If I should be elected Taoiseach, it would be my intention to implement the programme of my Party in all respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I might be allowed to refer to <Col N="35" /> just one point put forward in the debate by my colleague in the representation of the constituency of Dublin South-Central in regard to a National Government, I do not know why he thinks the onus in that matter rests on me.  Deputy MacEoin, and I agree with him, made clear the view of his Party in that regard.  The position of the Labour Party has been made abundantly clear.  It seems to me it would make for ineffective Government in normal circumstances to transfer into the Cabinet the divisions that normally find expression in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>If this motion is carried and if I become Taoiseach and form a Government, I should make it clear that I would think it necessary, should that Government be defeated on an important issue of policy, or if circumstances arose which made it obvious to everyone that effective Government could not be carried on, to resign.  If that situation should arise, another election would probably be unavoidable. While only a rash man would attempt to predict the future, I suggest that the forecasts which have been made by political commentators in the newspapers regarding another election in a matter of months, or so, should be discounted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment. The intervention&mdash;the rather unusual intervention&mdash;of the outgoing Taoiseach at this point of the discussion imposes upon me an obligation to make some observations I might otherwise have reserved for another occasion.  As Leader of this Party, I think it is unnecessary for me to assure the House no approach was made by me, or by any person <Col N="36" /> authorised by me, to any other Deputy of this House seeking his support other than the Deputies of this Party who have come here to support the policy for which we stood before the people.</P>
      <P>British newspapers may be excused for their hysterics about stable Government because they cannot be expected to understand our circumstances, the political issues which divide us, or, indeed, the institutions which we have set up for ourselves in this Republic. There are certain Deputies here bleating about panic.  We know what is troubling them.  If there were any danger of the Government falling they would break their own legs in order to avoid the division, but it is disedifying to hear responsible Irish citizens speaking of instability and the dilemma into which our people have got themselves under the system of election our people chose for themselves. When asked to abandon it, they contemptuously refused to do so.</P>
      <P>The fact is that our election under proportional representation has provided our country with stable Government, albeit not a dictatorial ascendancy. Not only has it provided our people with stable Government but it has provided our country with a truly representative Dáil.  It has not excluded Deputy Sherwin; it has not excluded Deputy Barron.  It has not excluded the humblest Deputy in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Whoever he is, he never suspects the fact, but he is here by the same right and title as is whoever may be elected Taoiseach of this House.  Under the protection of our Ceann Comhairle his rights in this House will get the same careful protection as the rights of the Leader of the Government, the Leader of the Opposition, or the Leader of the Labour Party will get.  Is that not something of which we should be proud instead of choking ourselves with crocodile tears about instability, for the disedification of <i>The Guardian</i> and the London <i>Times</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have provided ourselves with a representative Dáil.  We have in this House a representative Opposition <Col N="37" /> which recognises its duty, whatever part of the House it sits in, to defend the individual interests of any citizen, which may be challenged by this or any other Executive, which is prepared to offer constructive criticism of any proposal brought before Dáil Éireann by the elected Executive, and which is prepared to reassure the Executive that in any complex or difficult problems that may confront us, domestic or external, in either the immediate or remote future, they may look to all sides of this House for the kind of support any Irish Government are entitled to expect when they are concerned to defend the vital interests of our people.  I do not believe there is anybody on this front bench or the front bench opposite who doubts that when the cards are down, anyone who challenges them in the vital interests of our people will fail to find a united Oireachtas prepared to defend them.</P>
    <P>The Government have their job to do.  I submit that job primarily is to provide good Government.  Secondly, and no less important, is that in their dealings with Dáil Éireann, they shall seek to consult rather than to coerce. The Irish people have, in the most sophisticated way an electorate could, warned the largest Party in this Dáil that they expect from an Irish Executive, in their dealings with the Oireachtas, collaboration and not dictation.  They do not want an ascendancy; they want a democratic Government, and that is what they are going to get.  Given a fair practice of these simple precepts both in Opposition and in Government I dare to assert for the edification of our critics abroad that we will have stable Government.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned to edify the weepers and the groaners within the State; they are simply grinding a blunted old axe in the hope that the sparks will illuminate their own insignificance.  This is not the first time in my recollection that outsiders have rejoiced to sneer at this country. I tell them clearly that, in my judgment and with full knowledge of the public life of this country, Ireland will have at the hands of this Dáil one of the most stable Governments <Col N="38" /> in Europe.  Let some of the critics on the Continent whose hearts are bleeding for us reserve some of that sanguinary operation for themselves.</P>
    <P>I want to say that, in my judgment, our people have chosen better than some of their would-be preceptors would have had them choose because our people have remembered that an Ascendancy, even in Parliament, stands ever in the danger of which Lord Acton spoke when he said that &ldquo;all power corrupts but absolute power corrupts absolutely.&rdquo;  There is nobody in Dáil Éireann today who has absolute power but we are going to get a Government with all the power necessary to provide stable government, save only if they aspire to destroy the fundamental liberties of some simple person in this country, for on that issue they will find the combination against them adequate to remind them that the absolute corruption of absolute power is not within their reach, much less possession.</P>
    <P>We have formidable problems, domestic and external, to surmount. Instead of paralysing our capacity with the crocodile tears of self-pity because our people have preferred democracy to authoritarianism, let us take off our coats and get on with the job of leading our people through whatever perils may beset us, in the sure knowledge that, as we have not failed in any previous emergency, we, the Irish people, shall not fail tomorrow or in any of the long years that are still spread out before us in the logbook of a history in which we are privileged to play a part.</P>

      <P>I do not think I should be called upon to say this.  In view of what Deputy Lemass and Deputy Dillon have said, I merely want to say that so far as the Labour Party are concerned, their position since the election is exactly what it was before the election.  We have not made representation to any Party or individual with regard to the formation either of a Labour Government, a Coalition inter-Party Government or a National <Col N="40" /> Government.  I did not think it was necessary to say that.  There may be some doubts, not among the people of this House, but among the public following the remarks of Deputy Sherwin. I merely want to repeat that, so far as the Labour Party are concerned, they held no talks about the formation of any type of Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> Deputies, I think, are aware that members nominated in this way for approval by the House for appointment as Ministers are so appointed to be members of the Government and that it is a function of the Taoiseach to allocate to them responsibility for particular Departments of Government. It is not necessary for me to indicate now the Departments I propose to allocate to them.  I am, however, agreeable to so doing for the information of the Dáil: Deputy MacEntee will be in charge of the Department of Health; Deputy Dr. Ryan, Finance; Deputy Aiken, External Affairs; Deputy Smith, Agriculture; Deputy Childers, Transport and Power; Deputy J. Lynch, Industry and Commerce; Deputy Blaney, Local Government; Deputy Boland, Social Welfare; Deputy Moran, Lands and the Gaeltacht: Deputy Hilliard, Posts and Telegraphs; Deputy Dr. Hillery, Education; Deputy Bartley, Defence; Deputy Haughey, Justice.</P>
    <P>The decision to give to the Minister for Lands responsibility for the Department of the Gaeltacht is not because of any change of view as to the importance of that Department.  Apart from the suitability of the arrangement generally, and Deputy Moran's previous experience as Minister for the Gaeltacht, there is the consideration that it will, in my view, be necessary at some stage, arising out of our relations with the European Economic Community, to set up a new Ministry to deal with European Community affairs and with foreign trade generally.</P>
    <P>Because of the constitutional limitation on the number of Ministers, that course would not be feasible without such arrangement as I now propose, whether effected at this stage or later.  I think it is better to prepare the way now.  I propose to appoint to the Minister for Lands a Parliamentary Secretary to enable him to meet his extra responsibilities.  It is intended to transfer, by Government Order, from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Minister for Transport and Power responsibility for <Col N="44" /> matters relating to tourist trade development.</P>
    <P>The appointment of Parliamentary Secretaries is a function of the Government. I intend, when the Government have been constituted, to ask them to appoint forthwith Deputy J. Brennan to be Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy O'Malley to be Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance in charge of the Office of Public Works and Deputy Lenihan to be Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, with special responsibility in respect of Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee will continue to be Tánaiste.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this proposal, we propose to divide the House.  The Government proposed by the Taoiseach is substantially the same Government who, during the past four and a half years, suffered 215,000 of our people to be driven into emigration in search of a livelihood.  It is the same Government who made the farmers of this country poor.  It is a Government which we have no reason whatever to hope can satisfactorily meet the many problems which we believe require consideration and resolution, if further grave misfortune is not to overtake this country.</P>
      <P>I note with particular regret that, when the scheme to reduce the number of Ministers&mdash;which has much to commend it&mdash;falls to be implemented by the Fianna Fáil Party, the place they choose for the axe to fall is on the Gaeltacht.  We set up that Ministry so that the people of the Gaeltacht might know that we regarded their welfare in their own country as a primary responsibility of the Irish Government.  They are now fixed with notice that they are an annexe to one of the least significant Departments of State in charge of a Minister whose association with the Gaeltacht is confined to his periodic sojourns in the Aran Islands, undertaken to qualify himself to preside over that office of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose on this occasion to review the other matters of policy for which this Government have been responsible in the past, though much might be said upon them.  Further <Col N="45" /> opportunities will present themselves for that.  There is a matter, however, on which I want to say a word on the occasion of the Dáil's expressing its view on the appointment of a new Government.  There is a steady propaganda appearing in this country in a variety of disguises to split our people on ideological lines.  No one, of course, questions the right of the people of the United States of America, or of everyone in each of the 50 sovereign States of the United States of America, to have their political differences without ideological dissent, but in Ireland it is suggested that unless half the country embraces Marxian materialism, we are bound either to have an unstable Government, because there is not a sufficiently violent difference between us in this House, or we are all engaged in political play-acting, because none of us is prepared to repudiate the fundamental beliefs which we all hold in common.</P>
    <P>We are told we are engaged in unreal political shadow-boxing because none of us, so far as I know, is prepared to proclaim himself a Marxian materialist, or we are told by some observers that politics in Ireland have grown dull, as if this Oireachtas were a peepshow for the edification of any panic-monger or agent of the yellow Press which seeks to find diversion for its less sophisticated readers in our proceedings.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the differences between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are as wide as those that divide the G.O.P. in the United States of America and the Democratic Party.  Whoever said &ldquo;nil&rdquo; should have made his observations before.  After I have concluded, I will give him his chance.</P>
    <P>An interesting fact is that amongst our new-found critics is an organ that was once a gallant friend of Ireland, the <i>Manchester Guardian.</i> It now appears to have discovered under its new dispensation that it loves us no more.  We can live without its love and we are still free to dissent from its criticisms.  It glories in the right of the Liberal Party to be heard in Great Britain, but it charges us with panic and confusion because proportional representation suffers the voice <Col N="46" /> of Labour to be heard in this country. I glory in the right of its voice to be heard, or of the humblest Deputy&mdash; who is still anonymous&mdash;to say what he has to say, sure of his right to say it.</P>
    <P>There are few, if any, Deputies in this House who accept the materialist philosophy of left wing, if not, Marxian socialism.  If there are some, they are as reluctant to proclaim their faith as they are vocal in deriding their fellow Deputies for lack of faith to proclaim. I invite those whited sepulchres to come out into the open and tell us their true beliefs so that some day we can finally determine whether politics in Ireland are founded on the ideological differences of Continental Europe or whether, sharing common fundamental beliefs, we can here in Ireland, as they do in the 50 sovereign States of the United States of America, argue out our differences in the presence of our own people who do understand the issues, as their heavy poll in every general election for the past 40 years shows.</P>
    <P>We can consent to abide by their verdict without feeling it incumbent upon any of us to uproot the foundations upon which our Christian State is built in order to erect instead a Marxian society which, so far as I know, no one wants.  Come now then &mdash;the reds, the pinks, the pale pinks, and those who are no more than blushing for their own secret convictions. Let them come out in the open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let them come out in the open and proclaim their faith, and let the people as well as the so-called intelligentsia pass judgment upon them. I differ from this Government deeply, emphatically and, as at present advised, irreconcilably but far from regarding it as a reflection on our institutions that I cannot in honesty deny the fundamental beliefs I hold and the fundamental beliefs my opponents hold, I glory in the fact that we here in Ireland can legitimately and honourably differ to the point of election after election, as we propose to fight them <Col N="47" /> in the future, while proclaiming to the world that in this Irish Parliament Marxian beliefs have no root.  That in itself is a challenge to any and every Deputy publicly to profess such Marxian convictions if he believes in them, unless there are none found bold enough to proclaim them to the people, preferring to cherish them in secret.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what the commentators may say &mdash; especially those of the Press, those outside and some Independent Deputies &mdash; the people of this country have given their verdict, and their verdict is such that no single Party has an over-all majority in this House.  The significant thing we can see about this election is that whilst it is important to the Fine Gael Party that they have increased in their numbers, it is equally important to the Labour Party that we have increased our strength in Dáil Éireann and substantially increased our votes.</P>
      <P>The significant thing is that the people have not endorsed the stated policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I listened to Deputy Lemass today before he was elected Taoiseach to try to discover from him whether or not he intended to change his policy in any degree at all.  So far, there has been no such indication from him. Therefore, I say he is treading on dangerous ground, unless, in our view of the situation we now have following the election, he indicates that he is prepared to change his policy.  The Labour Party policy was published three or four weeks before the election and it was made clear throughout the campaign what that policy meant to the people.  I must confess I found it difficult to follow Deputy Dillon. Frankly, I do not know to whom his remarks were directed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon seems to think that the only alternative to conservatism in this country is rip-roaring Marxism.  For that reason, I want to <Col N="48" /> say the Labour Party's policy has been declared, has been printed and made available to every member of this House.  The Labour Party's policy is based on Christian socialism.  That should be pretty obvious to the people and I do not intend to take up the time of the House in protesting that our policy is such.</P>
      <P>Another significant thing in this election is this: the Fianna Fáil Party, led by the Taoiseach, tried to give the impression&mdash;whilst they did not use the phrase&mdash;that the people never had it so good.  That was the impression that was given deliberately by the Taoiseach, by the members of his Government and by the candidates of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We had splash advertisements in the Press to the effect that we had 350 new factories, that unemployment had decreased, that employment had increased, that health services were never so good, that the housing drive had been completed and that agriculture was in a state of prosperity.  While he and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party may think that, the people thought otherwise.  The Taoiseach must accept the verdict of the people. Therefore, there must be a change in attitude by the Fianna Fáil Party and certainly a change in their policy.  If there is not a change in their policy, it must necessarily mean that emigration and unemployment will go on at the same pace as it has for many years past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach may remember&mdash; whether he does or not, may I now remind him&mdash;that about two years ago he described the Labour Party as being like an old and rusty railway engine.  He may like to take back that unhappy phrase now because the indications are that the people have much more confidence in the Labour Party than Deputy Lemass seemed to think they had.  They have increased their representation in Dáil Éireann, small though the Party may be, to the extent of 25 per cent.  They increased their vote in the country by a similar percentage, while, on the other hand, the support for the Fianna Fáil Party has decreased by 80,000 votes.  We must also consider, with <Col N="49" /> these 80,000, the 215,000 other people who have left this country.  It is not for me to say how they would have voted in the election if they had been here and if they had been, as they must have been, unemployed.  I think it is fair comment to say that the Fianna Fáil representation in Dáil Éireann would be much smaller if those 215,000 people who are now in Britain and other countries had the right to vote in the election that has just taken place.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach was correct when he said there is no Party in Dáil Éireann who entertain at all the idea of a National Government.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we would not subscribe to that type of Government because it merely means a Government without an Opposition.  Personally I think that would be a dangerous thing and I believe that is also the feeling of my Party.</P>
    <P>Even if no Party in this House have an over-all majority, it does not necessarily mean that we are in for a period of unstable government.  We in the Labour Party are conscious of our responsibility.  We are conscious of the increased responsibility that has been put upon us by so many extra tens of thousands of voters.  We are prepared to shoulder that responsibility, whether it is Deputy Lemass or Deputy Dillon or anybody else who is Taoiseach.  As Deputy Dillon has said, one would get the impression from some newspapers and some commentators that we were in for a period of instability.  However, in matters such as the Common Market, our policy within the United Nations, our attitude towards the Congo expedition, there is no fundamental difference between the three major Parties.  I want to say on behalf of the Labour Party that, as far as negotiations in relation to the Common Market are concerned and as far as the final decision is concerned, we are prepared to shoulder our responsibility and do what we believe will be for the good of the nation.</P>
    <P>May I therefore pose the original question to Deputy Lemass as <Col N="50" /> Taoiseach?  Does he intend to continue his policy without any change at all?  Does he believe he should carry on as before?  Does he believe he should pursue the same policy in respect of all the facets of Government he has pursued for the past four-and-a-half years or is he prepared to accept the people's decision?  A substantial number of the people have rejected his policy and, in effect, called for a change.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was supported here this evening by two Independents.  I am not critical of them for what they did.  They gave their explanations and they will be judged on their explanations by the people and the other members of Dáil Éireann.  However, I should like to remind the Taoiseach, and particularly to remind the Independents who voted for Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach, that they have been very critical of major aspects of policy during the past four-and-a-half years. Are these Independents satisfied that the policy pursued in respect of health should be continued?  Are they satisfied with the policy in respect of housing, social welfare, and food subsidisation? When they voted for Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach, did they say they are satisfied with the policy pursued and that they will support him if he continues to pursue that policy?  It is a policy which has meant a continuance of emigration. In five years, we have lost 215,000 of our people and despite what was said by the Taoiseach during the election campaign, there does not seem to be any sign of an abatement in the rate of emigration.  As I have said, unless the policy is changed in respect of industry and in respect of agriculture, this emigration will continue.</P>
    <P>What of the Taoiseach's Cabinet? I have nothing to say about them as individuals but it is reasonable to say that the country expected a change in personnel.  Let me say there are men in the Cabinet who have given long and good service in the country and to the Government but they seem to have got into a rut and it must seem to the Taoiseach that they have got into a rut.  In respect of some of the new members of his Cabinet, the Taoiseach <Col N="51" /> must admit that on many occasions he has had to come into this House, as no other Taoiseach did, to help them to save their face.  If a member of the Fianna Fáil Party or any other Party is delegated to take charge of a Department, the Taoiseach should be confident that he is able to carry through whatever proposals he brings into the House or whatever piece of legislation he is responsible for.  That has not been the case in the past few years.  I say that without any reflection on any individual members of the Cabinet.  In any event, I do not think the Taoiseach has done himself or the Dáil a service in selecting the same team.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the country is satisfied with his industrial policy?  One of the most amusing things in the election campaign was the Fianna Fáil boast that in the past four-and-a-half years they had established 350 new factories.  I was in a good number of constituencies during the campaign and I found very few of them.  I should like the Taoiseach to tell us exactly where these factories are and how many are employed in them. The most important question is: have they filled the need for employment here?  In view of the emigration figures, the obvious answer is that they have not.</P>
    <P>The prospects for the future are not good, either.  During the election campaign, I read a statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lynch, in respect of proposed new factories not yet established.  He said the maximum amount of employment to be expected from them was 10,000, I do not think that is good enough.  I do not believe the members of the Government think it is good enough, when one takes into account not alone the rate of emigration but the flight from the land.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Dr. Ryan, did not think the flight from the land was unhealthy.  He commented that if people did leave the land, it meant there would be much more prosperity for those who remained on it.  Frankly, I thought that was a shocking statement from any Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not think the policy the present Government have pursued and seemingly intend to pursue is sufficient.  It is not sufficient for the Government or the country to sit down and say: &ldquo;If foreign industrialists come in here, we will give them financial assistance.&rdquo;  I have acknowledged previously that the assistance we give to foreign industrialists proposing to establish industries here is, to say the least, pretty generous; but it does not seem to have succeeded in absorbing our unemployed. I want to ask the Taoiseach if he is satisfied merely to continue that policy.  It has not absorbed our unemployed or those who fly from the land.  Therefore, we of the Labour Party propose&mdash;and this is a definite proposal&mdash;that where it is shown, and it has been shown recently, that private enterprise, either foreign or in this country, fails to establish industry to absorb our unemployed, then we believe it is the responsibility of the State to extend the activities of the State bodies and semi-State industries in an effort to absorb the unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about Fine Gael policy.  The Papal Encyclical will do me.  I would strongly urge the Taoiseach to consider that proposal. Despite the assistance of the State, these foreigners are not coming in sufficient numbers, and private enterprise has failed to measure up to the task.  Where private enterprise either fails or refuses to establish factories to absorb the unemployed, it is the bounden duty of the State to do so. In the past, I have quoted many examples where they have done so successfully, such as the E.S.B., Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company; and, no matter how it may be described, it was done successfully in the town of Dundalk, through direct Government assistance. They are to be applauded for that.  But if they have done it in these cases, they could do it on a far wider scale and prevent unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never presented myself as being an expert on agriculture.  Despite what has been said about agriculture, all our policies for it have failed.  If they had not failed, there would not have been the flight from the land over the years.  There must be a change in policy in that respect.  If the Taoiseach believes that a continuation of the present policy, with some variations here and there, will make agriculture prosperous, he is very far out.  The trouble is that the small and medium-sized farmers do not get a proportionate share of the money being advanced by the State.  The Taoiseach said in a recent speech during the election campaign that we had spent £24,000,000 on agriculture.  He apparently thought that was pretty generous assistance.  But I know from my own knowledge that it is not applied in the right direction. We talk about the small and medium-sized farmers being the backbone of <Col N="54" /> our agriculture but they do not get a fair crack of the whip, in that they do not get a fair proportion of the money available from the State.  Unless the policy in respect of financial assistance is changed, we believe that in the future agriculture will still be in its present bad state.</P>
    <P>I deplore the idea that went abroad during the campaign from some of the Government spokesmen when the farmers were told that as soon as we enter the Common Market, we would have a virtual paradise.  The Taoiseach may not have done that, but it was done.  That was a shabby trick to try to put over on the farmers.  While the people were exhorted to put Fianna Fáil back to carry on the negotiations for our entry into the Common Market, the farmers were not told the truth; they were not given all the facts.  They were told, in effect, that as soon as we became members of the Common Market, all our troubles would be over. Far from our troubles being over, I believe agricultural policy will have to be changed drastically to enable the Irish farmer to compete with the other European countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health was very eloquent during the election.  He wanted to know&mdash;at least, the <i>Sunday Press</i> wanted to know&mdash;what had Labour ever done for the people.  I do not know what the role of the Minister for Health is in an election campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not look at the figures, apparently.  The <Col N="55" /> Minister for Health seems to give the impression that practically everything that needs to be done in regard to social welfare has been done.  I have always regarded him&mdash;I have told him so and I think he appreciates my attitude towards him&mdash;as a conservative Minister for Social Welfare.  He always has been.  He talked in the election as if he had been a very generous and benevolent Minister for Social Welfare. He described all the benefits which had been given under his term as Minister and he said he had got the money from the Government to do this.  However, I think it is significant that in his four and a half years as Minister for Health and Social Welfare he increased expenditure by £1 million.  I think it would be right to ask him what he did with the £8 million he and his Government took in the withdrawal of the food subsidies. It was relatively simple for the Minister to give increases like 1/- in one year, ? in another and 2/6 in another when he had filched £9 million from the tables of the people&mdash;the ordinary people.</P>
      <P>I believe, and the Labour Party believes that, as far as Social Welfare recipients are concerned, increases should be automatically given to them as the national income increased but to carry on as we have been, giving them small, useless increases in benefits, is all wrong.  Unless that is changed, we in the Labour Party will not be able to support the Government. The Minister for Health seems to think that the poll he got in Dublin South-East was a vindication of his policy on the Health Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see in the voting throughout the country, one of the main concerns of the electorate was the administration of the Health Act. I do not know what type of people supported the Minister for Health in Dublin South-East but I do know that anywhere I went during the election the main topic was the administration of the Health Act.  There is utter dissatisfaction about it.  The Labour Party and I voted for the Health Act in the Dáil because it enabled local authorities and the Minister for Health <Col N="56" /> to do certain things to alleviate the burden on individuals and families as far as health charges are concerned. I believe the Health Act could be improved to a very great extent if the Minister for Health allowed the local authorities to be more generous in the administration of the health services and if the local authorities co-operated with the Minister.</P>
    <P>We have advocated that the health services be based on a system where people would receive benefits as a right and not as charity.  I believe the Minister for Health and other Members of the Government, including the Taoiseach, are living in the clouds if they believe the people are satisfied with the administration of the Health Act.  Fianna Fáil lost 80,000 votes in this election&mdash;a substantial number. Even the Taoiseach will admit that. The majority of those votes, which went to other Parties, were a protest, in great part, against the administration of the present Health scheme and I would urge the Taoiseach to emphasise that to the new Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach should ask the Minister for Health to consider the whole administration of the Act.  I am bound to say that under the old system, which was described as the red ticket system, people enjoyed better benefits in many cases than under the present system.  The old system was also called the pauper system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach intends to continue his present policy I am afraid we will not be able to give him our support in that respect.  There seems to be an idea that the housing needs of the country are filled.  Far from it, although there is a good lot of activity in reconstruction, rebuilding and the extension of houses.  As far as the need for new houses is concerned, it is greater now than it was in 1956 and 1957 because very few houses have <Col N="57" /> been built in the past four and a half years.  While members of the local authorities are anxious to build, there seems to be a dead hand in the Custom House.  In every town throughout the country there is a crying need for houses and they are not being built. There are still young married couples being forced to live in one room, despite all this talk about unemployment. As I said, there are thousands of people who have not decent living accommodation in the country.  I would strongly urge the Taoiseach to get the Minister for Local Government to resume the housing drive.</P>
      <P>I should like to conclude by telling the Taoiseach that if he believes he has the confidence of the people or of the Dáil in the policy he has pursued in the past he is absolutely wrong. There must be a change and I would ask him to be courageous enough to make the necessary change.  In this country we seem to be afraid of changes or of making advances.  Any changes we have made have only nibbled at our problems.  Radical changes are necessary if we are to stem the tide of emigration or to solve unemployment and other problems we have.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have had four and a half years of Government and, as far as world conditions are concerned, no Government in this country ever had it so good.  I think I would be right in calling those wasted years.  We do not know what the world situation will be in the immediate future, taking into consideration our Common Market membership application and the Berlin crisis, but I would again urge on the Taoiseach to be courageous and change from his old policy.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we are conscious of our responsibilities in this House.  As long as the Taoiseach introduces into the House good and progressive measures which will help our people at home and stimulate industry we will support him, but if he does not show initiative in bringing forward progressive ideas, then we will oppose him.  If he should propose a policy, as he did on the 1st September when he introduced what we regard as repressive measures against the workers, we will oppose him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> I want also to say that, whilst we are conscious of our responsibilities, threats of general elections are not going to frighten me or this Party.  If the Taoiseach, for example, brings in some measure tomorrow against which all of us on this side might be supposed to vote and somebody warns us that that will mean a general election, if it is not in accordance with Labour Party policy, we do not mind if it means an election next week or in the morning.  We realise that we have got a new measure of support in the country.  We are confident that when we go back to the country, whether next week, next year or in three years' time, we will further increase our support.</P>

In any case, let me conclude by saying that we are aware of our responsibilities but the threat of a general election is not going to frighten us because we are prepared to face the country any time on any issue which we believe is in the interests of the working-class people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has behaved in a rather dictatorial manner towards the House this evening in submitting the names of the Government and giving the House no outline whatever of what he proposes to do during the coming term of office of his Government.  Considering that the electorate, this day week, administered to the Taoiseach and his Government a very sharp rebuke, a repudiation almost of his policy, the Taoiseach might at least have given the House some indication of the policy he proposes to pursue during the lifetime of his Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that the single biggest problem facing the country at the present time that should exercise the mind of the people and the Government fully is the flight from the land. It seems that Fianna Fáil have already decided that the small farmers must go because they have been banishing them at the rate of 50,000 to 60,000 a year for the past four and a half years <Col N="59" /> and now there is absolutely no indication of a change of heart towards them.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about unemployment and about the 250,000 persons we have lost.  A glance at the preliminary returns of the recent Census shows that the people we have lost have been mostly from the small and medium size farms.  The population of towns has remained fairly static and it is from the land that we have lost the people.  If the present Government do not do something big to aid the small farmers, we will lose them.</P>
    <P>There are such problems as Partition, a vital national problem.  Our possible entry into the Common Market is an equally vital national problem. But, both of these matters must stand aside when we consider that the land is fast being turned into a ranch or desert.  Some small towns will become ghost towns in the not so distant future if something is not done to preserve the farms in their vicinity.</P>
    <P>Some Ministers of the Government, particularly the Minister for Social Welfare, in the administration of that Department, have definitely helped to speed many people from the land.  The Department of Social Welfare has become a persecutor of recipients of benefits from that Department&mdash;old age pensions, blind pensions, widows' pensions, or unemployment assistance or benefit.  I have no hesitation in saying that the Minister for Social Welfare has been the best recruiting agent for some of the big contractors in England, like Wimpeys, who come over here periodically, stand in the labour exchanges, and ask young men to go to England.  The Minister for Social Welfare has certainly given them all the labour that they want, particularly from the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach boasted during the election campaign that something like £23,000,000 to £24,000,000 a year has gone into agriculture.  It has gone into agriculture indirectly.  Nevertheless, it must be admitted that the industrial campaign for the last 25 years since Fianna Fáil came into office has been an absolute failure because to-day the <Col N="60" /> factories are not able to absorb all the people who are being pushed off the land.  If England were not able to absorb all the people who cannot be employed at home, and for whom the land has ceased to be a source of livelihood, it would be a very bad day for this country.</P>
    <P>Rates have gone sky high, further adding to the burden of taxation placed on the land.  We hear of a piped water scheme which will add another 10/- in the £ to the rates.  I cannot help recalling the Health Act of 1947 which has been such a hopeless failure.  I remember that we were told it would not under any circumstances mean more than 2/6d. in the £ on the rates. To-day it is from 20/- to 25/- in the £ and it is proposed to add another 10/- in the £ for piped water.  What did the Taoiseach mean when he told us in Westport a short time ago that the people, particularly the small farmers, never had it so good?  That seemed to me to be rubbing salt into their wounds.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Taoiseach and his Government that the principal problem facing this Government now and which would have faced any Government that the House might have elected to-day, is the maintenance of the small and medium size farms.  The policy of Fianna Fáil appears to be aimed at the complete elimination of the small and medium size farms.  The Taoiseach woke up suddenly to the fact that we had such a thing as the family farm.  A short time ago the medium size farm maintained big families in moderate comfort.  To-day it is just a home for a bachelor or an old maid.  It is not capable of producing a livelihood due to the fact that we have to meet such severe competition in the British market because the British Government subsidise and help their farmers to the extent that they do.  Our farmers are asked to work harder, to produce more and to export to a market that is heavily subsidised against them.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach, when replying to the debate, tell us what he has in mind to save the type of people to whom I have been referring or is it the intention of the Government in this term of office to continue to allow the <Col N="61" /> land to revert to big ranches as they have done in the last four and a half years, so that most of our towns will have nothing in the immediate area but a score of 30 acre farms within a few miles radius?  Is that the policy of the Government now as it was in the last four and a half years?  Are they deaf to all entreaties to stop the flight from the land?  It is not the people from the towns who are emigrating. To me the Census figures mean that the populations of the towns are remaining fairly steady.  It is from the land that people are going.  While Partition and the Common Market are big problems to which the Government will have to give their attention, I do not see what useful purpose can be served by trying to abolish the Border and to bring in the Six Counties if they are going to come into a country that has been turned into a desert by mismanagement at home.  That is the problem facing the Government.</P>
    <P>It was rather dictatorial of the Taoiseach to present the very same Government without giving some indication of what the policy will be. It is asking the House to accept the policy and the same personnel that the people so emphatically repudiated on Wednesday last at the General Election.</P>

      <P>In normal circumstances, I would have been content to accept the statements that have been made both on the motion to appoint the Taoiseach and on the motion which we are now discussing, but the circumstances in which the motion is being discussed and will be determined are peculiar and significant. Therefore, I feel compelled to make a a few general observations which I trust will be of some assistance to this House and of some advantage to the country.  I do not intend to discuss Government policy, whether it failed or not, during the past four and a half years, or whether that policy is adequate to meet the situation confronting the country in the immediate <Col N="62" /> future.  What I am interested in now is how the present situation in this House is going to be handled by the Taoiseach and the members of his Government when they are elected.</P>
      <P>I thought that I had passed the stage when any conditions in the country, or any statements being made by newspapers, both British and Irish, could irritate or annoy me.  I thought, occupying as I do the very enviable position of former Taoiseach, if I may say so, with no political ambitions, I could take the rest of my political career with a certain amount of ease.  However, nothing has irritated me so much, nothing, I felt, is such a danger to the country and to the problems facing any Government elected here tonight, as the sort of talk that has been going around since the election; the kind of editorials printed by some Irish and some British newspapers.  We have had headings like this: &ldquo;What now?  The worst possible result.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is really my contact with the people since the election, ordinary people, business people, people interested in the country, which has compelled me to speak here tonight. Influenced by that kind of talk, still with a poison going through their minds that was injected here during the debates on the referendum for the abolition of proportional representation, many people still feel there is ruination awaiting this country because the Fianna Fáil Party did not get an over-all majority in the general election.  That is what they say.  What is going to happen?  Are we going to have a general election in the next six months?  If we take the proper action tonight, and if the Government elected take the proper action in the coming years, then those fears can be allayed and there will be some hope with the assistance of all Parties, provided all Parties, whether in Government or in Opposition or Independents, do their duty as well as exact their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are here tonight not merely electing a Government, not merely doing the right that is vested in us as Deputies, but we are creating precedents and giving an example which may be an example for good or <Col N="63" /> ill to posterity.  We are facing a situation in which no Party of itself has a clear majority.  That is a situation which is normal under the system of proportional representation which the country asked for 18 months or so ago.  The country voted in accordance with those principles, in the way it wanted, in the last election and produced the results we are discussing here.  Every Party must face that situation and by the way we act now the future well-being of the country may be settled for good or ill for many years.</P>
    <P>We are told by some of these commentators, and by people throughout the country who have given little thought or have little experience of political affairs, that because of the instability that will be created as a result of the general election, there will be uncertainty in the country and that difficult problems which any Government will have to solve will be incapable of solution&mdash;the Common Market, about which there has been so much talk, and all the issues connected with it will be so mishandled as a result of there being absent from this House what has been miscalled strong Government.  Those matters are of very great import to the country. We can create good or ill and a situation which will dispel this uncertainty and give confidence in the Dáil and its Parliamentary institutions and greatly enhance the reputation of the Dáil and of Parliamentary institutions if the Government elected act in the way they should.  I shall endeavour as shortly as possible to suggest to the Government, with great respect, that they should act not merely in the interests of their own Party but of the country.  I believe what I have to say will be of great advantage, if adopted&mdash;I hope I do not sound too egotistical&mdash;to the country and perhaps of rather eminent value to the Party to which I have the honour to belong.</P>
    <P>What is the position?  Are we faced with ruin?  Is this country faced with uncertainty and incapable of dealing with the different problems. economic and social: the problems of emigration, the Common Market, <Col N="64" /> industrial activity and expansion, and of agricultural prosperity?  Will we be incapable of meeting those problems in a way which will bring prosperity to the country?  If we act in the right way, we shall be able to meet them and to solve them in a way no one single Party Government would be able to do, with goodwill and co-operation and a change of attitude between the various Parties in the State.</P>
    <P>We have just come through a general election.  I think we can say it was the most civilised election that has taken place in this country since the State was established.  That is very creditable to the Leaders of all the Parties.  There was absent from that campaign the political excitement so beloved of political commentators and those who want a story and to see people barging each other and throwing bricks.  If that is not present, then, according to them, there is apathy and something wrong with the people. I think it was a sign of political maturity, a sign that the Irish people have advanced in their political thinking and ideas, that all the issues that were fought on all sides, whether by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, were discussed calmly and, I believe, deeply and considered very dispassionately by the vast majority of the electorate who cast their votes and produced the results we have here to-day. That is something that we should be proud of.  There were no dramatics, histrionics, fighting, barging or the personal abuse which is so beloved by the person in search of stories for the excitement and delectation of British readers.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we had this very satisfactory result as a consequence of the general election.  There were certain people elected to the previous Dáil who stood for election and asked votes from the people on the basis that they repudiated the moral and constitutional and legal authority of the Oireachtas.  They had no legal authority and would not take their seats in this House.  Four of them were elected and did not take their seats here but treated Parliamentary institutions, set up by the people under the Constitution, going back to 1922, <Col N="65" /> as something beneath contempt and into which they would not come.</P>
    <P>There was also behind them, and perhaps behind the people they represent, a sort of extra-parliamentary movement which has found expression in the incidents in the North, in the wholly immoral and unjustified attacks on the people of the North.  As a result of this general election, at least these people are no longer in a position to claim any moral authority, or any authority whatever, based on the votes of the people.  That is of value. That is something of use to the country, but it is particularly valuable in the light of the statements that were made that this general election has produced the worst possible result.</P>
    <P>We have also in this Dáil a greater number of young people than has ever appeared in this House since the beginning of the State.  That is a hopeful sign.  That is something from which we can derive a certain satisfaction in the light of the cynicism and the criticism with regard to the institutions of this State, our politicians, and those who take part in the public life of this country.  That mood of cynicism and adverse criticism has not gone yet, but it is going.  If we, in the lifetime of this Dáil, however long it lasts, can give an example and set precedents which will gain the respect of the people, then we shall have made a valuable contribution to democratic Government and democratic principles.  If the people see that their elected representatives rose to the occasion and did what the people wanted, it will be obvious to all, at home and abroad, that the best democratic system of election so far devised, based on the principles of proportional representation, has worked and will continue to work in the future.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising to anybody experienced in the working of proportional representation over the past 40 years that the result of the most recent general election was the result which actually accrued.  I remember listening to the Taoiseach speaking here last July on the last day before the Summer Recess.  He was speaking of the impending election and he pointed out&mdash;he will correct me if <Col N="66" /> I am wrong in this; I am speaking from recollection&mdash;that in the history of elections in this country, no Party has ever obtained a clear majority at two successive elections.  Was it not as clear as the noon-day sun that that was going to happen at this general election?  That is what the people have decided.  They have given the Fianna Fáil Party a numerically strong Party but they have also given a very strong Opposition.  My reading of the verdict of the people is that they want a stable Government, a Government who will act in a different way from the way in which strong Government has acted in the past.  It is only in very exceptional circumstances that a clear majority such as that secured in the 1957 election will ever be secured again by any Party.</P>
    <P>It is refreshing for a democracy and a democratic people to have a change of Government.  It is still more refreshing to have changes in Ministerial personnel from time to time.  Alternative policy is good; alternative personnel is good.  The people have given their verdict after due deliberation, in the calmest and most civilised election ever held in this country.  All the issues were fully debated, fully thought out by the people, and a good vote was recorded. Certain newspapers were hoping that they would be able to report that the Irish people had no political good sense because only a very small vote was recorded in this vital general election.  The fact is that the vote was good.  The Irish people have elected a strong Government Party.  They have also elected a strong Opposition.  Let that situation work under the principles of proportional representation and both the Government and Opposition will gain even greater respect, each discharging their obligations and responsibilities on democratic principles.</P>
    <P>On the wireless, on every platform and here in this Dáil during the campaign for the abolition of proportional representation, the magic words &ldquo;strong Government&rdquo; were bandied about.  Instability because of the system of proportional representation was pressed, iterated and reiterated throughout the length and breadth of the country. The bloodstream of the Irish body <Col N="67" /> politic was poisoned by the propaganda campaign.  Because of that campaign and because of the absorption of English ideas, about English institutions and English parliamentary franchise, it was thought that one could not have a good Government&mdash;I want to avoid using the word &ldquo;strong&rdquo; because I dislike it&mdash;under proportional representation.</P>
    <P>We have the opportunity now to show that it is possible to have good Government under our system.  We have the opportunity to show that you can have what is so essential in the working of a democratic parliamentary system, with all due respect to those who talk about a National Government and of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael coalescing; we can have a good strong Opposition and a good strong Government producing better results and more hope for the solution of difficult problems than could possibly obtain under a strong Government such as we have had over the past ten or 15 years.  There lies upon all sections in this House a duty to meet the situation that arises in a proper way.</P>
    <P>I was disturbed this afternoon by one statement the Taoiseach made. Perhaps it was made without due deliberation.  I do not want to tie him to it.  He said that if he were elected as Taoiseach, he would carry on on the basis of Fianna Fáil policy and the strength of the Party here in the Dáil and that, if he were defeated on an important issue or circumstances arose which made it impossible to continue, he would seek a dissolution of the Dáil.  I was perturbed by his reference to circumstances arising which would make it impossible to carry on the Dáil.  Being human, perhaps the Taoiseach was needled into that statement by some of the speeches made here to-day by people who said: &ldquo;We will vote for you and keep you in office if you do what we want.  Out you go, if you do not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach can ignore such considerations but I think a warning should be issued now that if the Government use that device, namely, to seek a dissolution of the Dáil to force <Col N="68" /> another general election in order to try to secure a clear majority, the people will take vengeance upon any Party who seek to bring that situation about.  Not so very long ago, we had experience of a hard fought referendum on the abolition of proportional representation.  The people decided to retain proportional representation.  I would hope that the Irish people in their political maturity would wreak vengeance upon any Party who sought to force them on an issue in which they said: &ldquo;We will not carry on the Government. We will not let a stable Government be formed or we will not let it remain in office for long, unless you give us a clear majority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Neither the Fianna Fáil Party nor any other Party have any monopoly of the right to govern this country under the system of proportional representation. More than probably, the Fianna Fáil Party at the next general election will be in a somewhat similar position to that in which they are to-day. That is democracy.  That is good for the country&mdash;alternative Governments with alternative policies. These alternative policies are a refreshing experience as a result of the change of personalities.  Great good can be done for the country by bringing people from other Parties into consultation and collaboration in order to get their contribution and discharge their responsibilities in relation to the solution of the problems we have to face.</P>
    <P>That is the situation we have to meet here.  That is why I said at the outset that we are creating precedents tonight.  We have got to make proportional representation work because the Irish people want it.  Every member of this Dáil who is not a member of the Fianna Fáil Party is committed to the maintenance of that system of proportional representation.  It behoves every one of us to see that no political device is allowed to delude the Irish people into the belief that proportional representation will not work or that the system will not work because the Taoiseach has to depend, as he thinks he has, upon the casual support of those Deputies who supported him tonight.  The Taoiseach <Col N="69" /> knows well that he is not so dependent but what he is dependent upon is the goodwill and co-operation of the other Parties in this House.  That can be obtained easily.  Strength can be given to his Government and great advantage can accrue to the people of this country, if he will make this Dáil a deliberative assembly and consult the Dáil and the Parties.</P>
    <P>We had a situation here under a so-called strong Government when it was practically impossible to convince certain of the Ministers&mdash;I do not say all of them and I certainly do not say the Taoiseach&mdash;by argument or reason that the proposals they had put forward to the Dáil were capable of amendment.  The Dáil was regarded as a machine merely for registering the decisions of the Government taken after consultation with the Party in the Party rooms.  That situation must be changed.  You can have great strength by getting constructive opposition and constructive help from the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  If the Taoiseach changes the system and transfers responsibility from the Party room to this Dáil, then proportional representation can and will work.  We will have done our duty to the Irish people who want proportional representation. We will have given the lie to those people who say that the worst possible results would follow, that there would be nothing but misery and ruin facing the Irish people unless they got Fianna Fáil with a so-called strong Government.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation in Opposition to give constructive support to the Government after co-operation and consultation, if necessary inside or outside the Dáil, but certainly in the Dáil in regard to any of these very serious problems which face the country and the Government.  We have obligations and we should have rights.  Equally, the Government have their rights to get constructive opposition and constructive help.  The Government have their obligations to consult this Parliament and make Parliament a deliberative assembly.  That is what, I think, will be the obligation and right of the Taoiseach and his Government in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> If the system which I suggest very briefly is worked then the people can feel that they are entitled to work out their salvation knowing that not merely the Government but the Dáil, the Parliamentary institution set up under and in accordance with the principles of the Constitution, and every Party in it is making its contribution and not merely working for its own Party political ends.</P>
    <P>The British Constitution and the American Constitution are the only two Constitutions, I think, in the history of political thought that have managed to combine both stability and change with tradition and flexibility. We can secure that very important principle if we work in this Dáil on the problems that face the country. As a member of the Fine Gael Party and knowing the mind of the Leader of the Opposition, I think I can say that the House will get from him not destructive criticism or actions, not needling tactics but constructive proposals and help.  I believe you will get the same from the Labour Party, if they are approached in the proper way. The obligation then lies on the Taoiseach and the Government to respect our rights when we discharge our obligations and he fulfils his responsibilities and obligations.</P>
    <P>That, in my view, is an essential part of the scheme.  It is not only essential but it is vital for the benefit of the country as a whole that whatever residue of political patronage is left should by statute be abandoned.  It should not be in any sphere of activity, whether in connection with the appointment of people to carry on semi-State bodies, whether in connection with appointments of one type or another, whether in connection with working on the roads, in the factories or anywhere else, that a man's right to his livelihood, to advancement in life, to his promotion, to get positions of merit in the public service should be dependent upon his political affiliations or the number of speeches he has made for this or that Party.  I think that on the last occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with 99 per cent. of what Deputy Costello has said. In my opinion it was what one would call a patriotic speech and I hope all the Parties, including his own Party, will bear in mind what he said.  In other words, the Parties should co-operate a little with the Government; they should not, as has been the practice, just play the Party game, because there is a game and a great deal of what is said here is hot air, intended for the public outside&mdash;certainly not intended for the people here because we are all wise to one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House deals with the nomination of the Taoiseach's Cabinet.  I am not going to find fault with the personnel of his Cabinet but it is customary on such occasions to express opinions on policy.  I want to make one point on the question of social benefits.  When I voted for the Taoiseach I made no conditions, no threats but I have criticised the Government in the past and shall continue to do so.  I have not voted for the Fianna Fáil Party.  I voted for a Government. There is no use in people <Col N="73" /> throwing out innuendoes saying: &ldquo;You are afraid of an election.&rdquo;  I am not afraid.  I got in on the first count and it was just a fluke that I did not top the poll.</P>
    <P>On one occasion in the past I fought an election on a chair and 30/-.  I would not hesitate to do it again tomorrow. If I went around with a hat any day I would get enough to put me over it.  I am not afraid of an election and whatever I do is a question of conscience and belief as far as I am concerned.  I was satisfied that no other group could form a Government and let me say here and now that it was a great relief to everybody here when Deputy Carroll and myself went into the Fianna Fáil lobby.</P>

      <P>It was said that we did the right thing and that some people had not the guts to go in.  All my life I stand on my beliefs and I do not care whom I offend, here or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming back to the motion, there is one issue on which I would vote against the Taoiseach and that is the issue of social benefits.  The people who need these benefits are not organised and they are handed any little pittance that any Minister wishes to grant them.  Recently, there was a general round of increases in wages and it stands to reason that, following a general increase in wages, there would be a general increase in the cost of living, whether openly or in a hidden manner.  You can increase prices either by putting things up or by manufacturing deficient or defective goods.  You can do it in many ways but, no matter how you do it, those who get an increase in wages through union action may be able to meet it.  It must be remembered that 80 per cent. of all increases in wages is taken away again inside a year or two.  The workers benefit by only ten or twenty per cent. of the increase, but those on social benefits must pay as much as those who get increases. Therefore, they must get corresponding <Col N="74" /> increases to make up for the increased cost of living.  If those people do not get fair play&mdash;this is another issue, the question of means tests for old age pensioners&mdash;if the Government do not give those people assistance I will vote against the Government at any time.  Other than that, I am not making any threats.  I am prepared to give the Government a chance, and I think, in the words of Deputy Costello, other Parties should do the same.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that proportional representation as it stands will bring about a situation similar to this in any election over the next 20 or 30 years. Following the Civil War everyone was more or less lined up on one side or another, but the Civil War has faded now.  The body politic has broken up into fragments and you do not know for whom the people will vote.  It is idle for Fianna Fáil to think that they reached their maximum strength in the last election.  I do not believe it. They might fight an election tomorrow and lose a seat or they might win one or two.  We should make proportional representation work.  On the basis of the present election there is a stable Government, a strong Opposition.  I do not see why it cannot work, if the Opposition co-operates.  There is no need to challenge the Government on every issue; we can be constructive in our criticisms.  There is no need to throw them out by votes.</P>
    <P>I have made clear the issues on which I would vote against the Government but I would vote against them on one or two other issues also.  I am not going to be bound by anything.  I am giving the Government a chance. Deputy Costello's words should be considered by his own Party.  Let us co-operate.  Let us give up carrying the hatchet; it is all right to take the hatchet to the hustings but it is not all right here.  I want the Minister to remember that I want this question of social benefits to be reconsidered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been said in this debate, the election has taken place and the result is reflected in the Party composition of this House.  Whether that is directly attributable to proportional <Col N="75" /> representation or to the political system, the system of proportional representation is probably a matter of opinion.  It may even be a combination of both.  I do not share the same enthusiasm as some of my colleagues for the system of proportional representation but it is the existing system and as such we have to work it.  It seems to me that while Parties may be an essential part of our political framework, we have a duty transcending personal and Party considerations. That duty is to serve the public interest and it is our prime obligation and principal responsibility. That duty must be performed whether it suits personal or Party considerations. The country faces many difficult problems&mdash;political, economic, social and&mdash;last but not least&mdash;educational. All these matters require constant and urgent attention.  I am convinced we have an inescapable responsibility to pool our wisdom and experience in order to reach the right decisions and adopt the best policy in these questions in the national interest.</P>
      <P>The advent of the Common Market will create new and serious problems. What is important is not the name or form of our admission to the Common Market but the terms on which we assume membership or association. These terms or conditions will be vital to the economic future of the country.  They will be vital to the workers employed in Irish industry and vital to those who have invested money in the establishment and maintenance of these industries.</P>
      <P>The interests of both sections in industry must be safeguarded and the best possible terms negotiated in the national interest.  I believe there is no difference in outlook in this matter between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Indeed, on many questions we have more in common than in dispute and, having worked for many years in this House with members of the Labour Party, I can say the questions at issue are relatively few compared with the many matters on which there is agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great skill and care will be required <Col N="76" /> in negotiating the terms of our admission to the Common Market.  I am satisfied that the correct approach in this matter is a bi-partisan approach in the national interest.  The duty and responsibility which we have here is to unite the nation, to face the consequences and to secure the most advantageous terms possible for our industries and those concerned in them and also to provide for agriculture whatever conditions may be needed.</P>
    <P>If a bi-partisan approach is to be secured, the Taoiseach and the Government must take the Dáil and the country into their confidence.  Full information must be made available on all matters.  In this way, public confidence will be secured for the decisions taken.  These and other questions require examination and discussion before decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>Similarly, so far as the educational problems which affect the country are concerned, I do not believe there is any fundamental difference on the aims and objectives.  Considerable discussions took place during the election on the aim of restoring the Irish language.  I believe that, whatever difference there is, it is not in aim but in method.  I noticed that in the course of one of his last speeches the Taoiseach said he was prepared to examine the methods and to change them if necessary.  We advocated certain changes which I believe would inculcate a greater enthusiasm and love for the language than the system which has been worked up to the present.  These are matters which we can consider here and discuss in the future and if possible reach agreement on them.</P>
    <P>I believe there will be general disappointment at the names announced by the Taoiseach for the approval of the House as members of the Government. There is only one new Minister; all the others are members of the outgoing Government.  A few of them have been changed.  It is notable that all of the changes are of no real significance.</P>
    <P>Despite the advent of the Common Market, despite the very serious problems which confront the Government <Col N="77" /> and the Dáil, the Taoiseach does not yet appear to have decided what Minister will be responsible for negotiating our entry into that body. He expressed some view to the effect that changes may be necessary.  To judge by the names that have been submitted the most obvious conclusion is that there is an extraordinary poverty of ability amongst the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am surprised that, from his own point of view, the Taoiseach did not make more changes in the Government.  I believe it would have been possible to get somebody from among his supporters on the back benches or to have promoted other Parliamentary Secretaries, certainly one and certainly one other Deputy on the back benches.  If they had been promoted it would be an improvement on some of the outgoing Ministers.</P>
    <P>One of the complaints levelled throughout the country over the past few weeks, and which was reflected in speeches here today, is that the Government became complacent, that they were complacent about the serious problems affecting the nation.  In face of that complacency, the Taoiseach comes here and hands out the same Government with one single exception. That is hardly good enough.  It is hardly fair to the Taoiseach and it is hardly fair to the country.</P>
    <P>I suppose there were some political difficulties in asking older colleagues to make way for new members.  Whatever the difficulties I think it would be in the national interest that changes should be made.  It is not sufficient to let the matter drag on for some time.  In fact, the obvious conclusion from the changes that have been made is that they were made in order to facilitate the inclusion of all existing members and the admission of one new member.</P>
    <P>One of the demands Fianna Fáil made during the election and the one which was placarded throughout the country was &ldquo;Give Lemass a strong team&rdquo;.  Do the Fianna Fáil Party believe that the Cabinet presented to us this evening is strong?  Nobody else does.  It is obvious that it is a team in which there is a lack of public confidence in its ability and in its capacity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> One of the characteristics associated with Fianna Fáil over the years is that they have been a very efficient political machine.  That efficiency has been maintained to some extent by a system of patronage.  I believe there is now in this country a general dislike of the patronage system.  The first Government of this State established the Local Appointments Commission in order to avoid any suggestion that appointments would be made on a patronage basis and to secure that public positions would be filled on merit.  I believe that is a good system.</P>
    <P>Whatever the method of appointment, whether in the judiciary, in the Army, in the Garda or in the Civil Service, merit should be the prime consideration.  All other things being equal, if there are two candidates and one is a supporter of the Government and the other is not, then they are entitled to appoint the supporter.  If the public generally are satisfied that appointments are made on merit, and that that is the guiding criterion, there will be far greater confidence in the decisions taken and in the appointees selected.</P>
    <P>One of the legacies which the Taoiseach inherited is that Party and political considerations are paramount, so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned. It would be quite wrong for anyone in this House to believe that there has been any change in that view.  Whether the Government can continue in office for a long or a short period, Fianna Fáil have never been backward in exploiting political or other considerations to their own advantage.  What the people want to see is what changes will be made in the national, economic and social policy in order that the serious problems which affect the country can be tackled in a vigorous and energetic manner.</P>
    <P>One of the other changes which is of some significance is the fact that tourism has been taken from the Department of Industry and Commerce and handed over to the Department of Transport and Power.  Shortly, there will be nothing left of the Department of Industry and Commerce but the Minister and the building in Kildare Street.  It is also of significance <Col N="79" /> that when the recent problem arose in connection with the E.S.B., it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce who dealt with it.  Although the Minister for Transport and Power had responsibility for power, he did not figure in the discussions.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach has not made up his mind as to what Minister is to be responsible for conducting our negotiations for admission to the Common Market, he should make up his mind quickly, because any uncertainty or doubt is bad for the nation and causes a lack of confidence when confidence is essential.  So far as we are concerned, we must ensure that our paramount duty is to serve, as we have always done, the national rather than the Party interest.  That has been the hallmark of our record of service since the inception of the State.</P>
    <P>Where Government policy is sound, we will support it, and where it is otherwise, we will oppose it, or suggest what we consider is the correct policy in the national interest.  If that involves the consequences of a new election, we are prepared to accept full responsibility.  We want to see a good and effective Government.  We are disappointed at the fact that there have not been greater changes in the personnel of the Government.  We understand and appreciate the Taoiseach's problem, but if some older members were prepared to retire to the back benches, or to retire altogether, others should have been prepared to make the same sacrifice.  Most if not all of the Ministers&mdash;certainly the older ones &mdash;have long enough service to qualify for full pension.</P>
    <P>It is important that an effective, efficient, capable and energetic Government should be presented to the country.  This Government are not capable; on their past record, they are not energetic; and the admission of one new member will hardly make them efficient.  The Taoiseach had better talent behind him, and I believe that even on this side of the House, we could have got from the Fianna Fáil Party a better group of Ministers than the Taoiseach has presented.  That was his responsibility <Col N="80" /> and I believe the House and the country are entitled to it.  The changes that have been made are nominal and of no significance and, in fact, except for some internal political reasons, they would not have been made at all. This is not the strong team the Fianna Fáil Party asked the country to give them.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer is the fact that the country will expect to get from the Government a statement in regard to the adequacy of the equipment which our troops have in the Congo.  We were all greatly relieved that the assignment they undertook there recently did not have more serious consequences. The country admired the traditional courage which our soldiers displayed in the face of great difficulties, but there is a general feeling of dissatisfaction at the type of equipment and the standard of equipment&mdash; not the standard of training but the standard of equipment&mdash;which has been issued to our personnel there. If our troops are to serve abroad effectively and properly, they must be properly equipped with the most up-to-date weapons.</P>
    <P>This Government will have, as had the outgoing Government, a constructive and fair Opposition.  We have always regarded it as our paramount duty to serve the public interest and that, as I have said, has been the hallmark of this Party since the inception of the State.  May it ever continue so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware, from the views expressed by Deputy Corish, of where the Labour Party stand.  All we can do at this stage is make a comparison between the activities or otherwise of some of the members of the incoming Cabinet and the members of the Cabinet of the previous Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, we all sincerely hope that the Taoiseach as captain of the ship, having taken on his whole crew, will be a little more careful about the Minister for Transport and Power.  Let us not have to face the position with which we were faced over the past year or two, when everything was haywire in that Department, due to the inactivity <Col N="81" /> of that Minister.  When we heard of trade disputes and other difficulties, we found that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to come to their aid and the Minister for Transport and Power was missing. That happened, not once but on many occasions.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition seeking information through Parliamentary Questions, as is their right, usually found that the answers supplied by the Minister for Transport and Power were anything but complimentary to him, nor did they show that he was willing to co-operate with a constructive Opposition.  If the Taoiseach thinks that such an attitude on the part of the Minister for Transport and Power will help him and his Cabinet in the future, I can assure him that so far as the Labour Party are concerned, he will find that such is not the case.</P>
    <P>What struck me most forcibly in regard to the Department of Local Government was the number of circulars which were issued during the election campaign offering financial assistance to local authorities for all sorts of schemes.  I wonder was it mere coincidence that the money&mdash;at least on paper&mdash;for all those schemes was found during that period?  Surely the Taoiseach cannot blame us for doubting what emanates from a Department presided over by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government, when, at the same time, as members of local authorities, we had the experience of knowing that the self-same Department, presided over by the self-same Minister, refused to co-operate with the local authorities in connection with necessary amenities for housing in their own areas.  I think it was deplorable &mdash; and I am convinced it was political&mdash;for the Minister for Local Government, aided naturally by the Fianna Fáil Government and the Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, with the over-all connection between the Department of Local Government and the various local authorities, to endeavour to secure support and votes by offering schemes never intended to be put into operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish spoke at length on our views regarding the Minister for <Col N="82" /> Health.  I do not wish to elaborate further than to say that no one could expect members of the Labour Party to offer their support either to a Government, or to a Minister of such an important Department as Health, when in actual fact that Minister could improve conditions immensely but has made no attempt to do so.  We know he was the Minister responsible for cutting out all grants for the erection of dispensary buildings.  Could the Taoiseach expect our support if that Minister intends to continue such a policy? I have no intention of going into details regarding various Departments. However, we have not forgotten the past and all we can do in future is be suspicious of some of these Ministers, knowing their inactivity in the past, and be prepared, if they continue on the same lines in the future, to go all the way against them and against their Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke of the importance of the Common Market.  We all appreciate that but what did surprise me during the election campaign was a statement made by a Minister of State attacking the Labour Party because we insisted on all aspects of this important matter being brought in future before the Dáil, not for a mere political discussion but for the purposes of a discussion which would ultimately be of benefit to the various sections of the community.  Because we stated during our election campaign, as we stated in this House prior to the election, that that should be done. Ministers of the Taoiseach's Government found it suitable to say the Labour Party were condemning the Common Market project.  We have no apology to offer for what we said.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach thinks that through the strength of his majority, be it slender or otherwise, he can as head of the Government negotiate and sign agreements which have not been fully discussed here as to how they may affect the future of agriculture and industry, the Labour Party in spite of the protests of any Minister of the present Government, will continue to object.  Fundamentally our responsibility is to protect the industrial workers here who may be affected by <Col N="83" /> any agreement signed and equally to protect the agricultural community who must depend upon the honesty and sincerity of the politicians reaching decisions, having considered how such agreements may affect the people in the future.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear Deputy J.A. Costello speak on this subject here a while ago but let me remind Deputies that what he has referred to has been carried out by the Labour Members of the Dáil over the last four and a half years.  I can challenge any member of Fianna Fáil on that issue.  Time and time again when the Labour Party believed in the wisdom of proposals introduced by Fianna Fáil Ministers they supported them.</P>
    <P>On other occasions when they believed their proposals would not help the people of this country they opposed them.  That goes to show that, even though only a small part of the Opposition, the Labour Party helped where help was needed by any Minister promoting legislation which was good.  Furthermore the Labour Party believed that the rights of individual members should be respected and when the circumstances demanded it on a particular issue we were never afraid to say; &ldquo;Let it be a free vote&rdquo; because in the final analysis, whether a man is elected on a Party ticket or not, he is elected as a representative of all sections of the community in his constituencey.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach remembers that the role to be played by the Labour Party will be, as it has been in the past, based on these principles, he will know from the outset where he stands with us. Therefore, in regard to any proposal that is detrimental to the workers, as the one on the 1st September was, he may expect severe criticism and opposition from Labour.  On the other hand let him introduce improvements in social welfare, let him urge his Minister for Health to make some attempt to improve the health services and to straighten out the problem of the medical cards and he will have our support.</P>
    <P>We are uttering no threats.  We <Col N="84" /> have asked no support from anyone and offer none to anyone.  We have our own policy.  Too long have we been taunted here by the Taoiseach and other members of Fianna Fáil because the Labour Party, a small Party, did not answer the whip of the Fianna Fáil Government.  We were taunted and abused and because we voted against Fianna Fáil we were considered as traitors.  We cannot forget that.  We cannot forget that in the thirties when the Labour Party was justified in supporting Fianna Fáil they were told: &ldquo;As long as we need your help we will keep you but we will get rid of you as soon as possible.&rdquo;  The past is always a guide to the future. I would say the Taoiseach is a man of political sense and, considering the position of the last four-and-a-half years, he may not act in the same autocratic manner as was the case before his time.  He will find that if he adopts a sincere attitude we will get on much better.</P>
    <P>I appreciate fully what Deputy Costello said about proportional representation. I know that during that terrible battle there were people on my left who wanted to abolish P.R.  Some of the newspapers at the present time believe that if Fianna Fáil cannot get a majority or if Fine Gael cannot get a majority and they do not come together, P.R. should be abolished.  As we said two years ago, we have no right to deny democratic rights to the people.  Certain politicians believed two years ago that they could get a political stranglehold over the people if they could succeed in abolishing proportional representation.  The people rejected those proposals and, however we may differ politically, whether it be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour who have a majority, I hope that never again will politicians for their own selfish ends or for the selfish ends of their Party advocate the abolition of proportional representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has submitted to this House a proposed Government which at its very best cannot be described as anything but mediocre.  We have an opportunity now, before the Government takes <Col N="85" /> office, to impress upon the Taoiseach what is the real situation of the country and what is the real duty before him as Leader of the Government if he is to discharge the public responsibility placed on him by the result of the election.  What I have to say about the Government is not directed in a personal way to any particular Minister.  I regard them collectively as a very poor bunch.  I cannot see any real prospect of an improvement, unless lurking in the Taoiseach's mind, when he realises he is in a Dáil where he will get co-operation and constructive help, there is the possibility of a very quick reshuffle and the introduction of some imagination and strength of purpose into his Cabinet. It is clear that the electorate were not satisfied with the manner in which the government of the country was run for the past four and a half years.  There is no doubt that the time is now opportune&mdash;indeed it is imperative&mdash; for us to find some dynamic change in outlook to enable a nation suffering from the gushing haemorrhage of emigration to hope that in the immediate future some effort will be made at least to procure worthwhile employment for some limited number of the young people growing up here.</P>
      <P>I urge upon the Taoiseach that he rapidly come to grips with the real problems besetting this nation.  We have a Dáil elected, in which, thanks be to God, because of the strength and efficacy of the Opposition, we will be able to make the Government a good Government in spite of themselves or get rid of them altogether.  I do not want to see unnecessary or irresponsible general elections.  I believe the Taoiseach has sufficient political sagacity to assess the present situation.  I believe he has sufficient acumen to appreciate that from the pooled wisdom and effort of a constructive Opposition, he can gather great strength to his own Government.  We will be able to make up for the mediocrity of the Cabinet by giving him the assistance of enlightened and reasonable thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back to the Dáil after four and a half years' absence still representing <Col N="86" /> South-West Cork, a constituency that has come under the bludgeoning blow of emigration more than any other.  I can see there the direct effect of the dead hand of inept, inefficient, incompetent and unconstructive Government administration. Unfortunately, I was not here when the Minister for Transport and Power used the gambit of: &ldquo;I have no responsibility&rdquo; to bludgeon through legislation closing the West Cork railway. Fortunately, the tracks are not up yet and we may be able to enlighten the Government again. Throughout the length and breadth of the constituency, I have seen the callous abandonment of progress by the Government, for no reason other than political dissatisfaction.  It is a tragedy, in an area where we so badly need to put the hard-won acres back into fertility, to find the land reclamation scheme brought to a dead stop and the machinery rusting in water. The Government take no notice of the fact that in that area it is vital to the economy that every possible encouragement be given to bringing more and more of our limited land supply into full heart.</P>
    <P>We have seen also a slowing down in the rate of afforestation, a diminution in employment where there should be an increase and no improvement in the extraordinary state of the fishing industry.  It seems to be more economic for trawlers from several European nations to fish the Irish fishing grounds, and even market some of their product here, than that we should develop the industry ourselves.  The potentiality of that industry and its employment and earning capacity should be a fruitful source of investigation.  We have seen the disastrous effects of Fianna Fáil Government over the past four and a half years.  It may well be that all of that cannot be laid at the door of the Taoiseach, but he is captain of the ship now and he has a sorry-looking crew. I had hoped that the acumen, courage and truculence of the Taoiseach might have given him the impetus to produce a Cabinet with a Lemass stamp rather than an Old Guard stamp.</P>
    <P>We have to face the reality of the present situation.  It is this.  Our agricultural <Col N="87" /> industry is not geared for the competition it must meet in the Common Market.  I am impressing on the Taoiseach in the most earnest and constructive way that there will have to be a complete reappraisal of agricultural policy to enable the Irish farmer reap the advantages of the Common Market.  Through grants for improved buildings, such as stock byres and new type piggeries, through free loans or some other method of assistance, through improved advisory services and improved progeny testing, he must be enabled to produce in his animal husbandry the type of beast that will win for him the reward merited by the top-quality article.</P>
    <P>We are not geared for that, and it is a tragedy to think that the same stultifying hand, lacking imagination, will be in charge of the Department of Agriculture.  If any Department of Government wants a bit of initiative and strength of purpose, it is the Department of Agriculture, and there is nobody in this House who gives us less hope of these qualities than the nominee for that post.  Nobody more than the Irish farmers will give the Government a greater response to any proposal aimed at helping our agricultural export industry.  The Government must be brought to realise that no matter how heavily committed the Taoiseach may be basically to industry, agriculture must be put on a solid economic footing.</P>
    <P>If we are to survive on the industrial side in the Common Market, it will be on the basis of a progressive agricultural industry.  The Government will have to reappraise the present situation in its entirety.  I can see, with tremendous clarity, the difficulties which will beset all Parties in this House in the immediate future.  We now realise that the nation is in dire straits, mainly because no nation can make progress or no nation can look forward to a future, if its main export is its adolescent and early adult men and women.  We realise there is a heavy duty on this 17th Dáil to ensure that something is done about the problem and it is in that spirit of heavy responsibility that I urge upon <Col N="88" /> the Taoiseach to try to lift himself out of the slough of gross inactivity, of mounting inefficiency and lack of interest by the Government he now nominates, on its record.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent necessity on everybody in public life to ensure that this Government will get a chance to do the job, but there is a positive duty on us to try to force the Government to face up to the problems and not run away from them.  I am confining myself, in the main, to the difficulties in our primary industry because I do not believe in lip service to agriculture.  I believe that unless we can gear our farmers into a position from which they can compete in quality and quantity in the Common Market, we will be doing a gross disservice to our economy.  We can do that quite easily and it is infinitely better that the Government should approach the question of the Irish economy by putting more and more money into the small and middle-sized farms of Ireland, to develop their productivity and to increase their capacity to produce a better type of stock.  That money is far better invested in that way than in some fly-by-night industries of which we have had experience under Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>Above all else, we must show the world in this Dáil, by co-operative effort, that we will strive after good Government as distinct from strong Government, autocratic Government or dictatorial Government, and I believe there is sufficient goodwill shown to the Taoiseach already to encourage him to get to grips with the task of finding the way to providing a buoyant economy otherwise than by taxation or by finding money always through hitting somebody.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again that there are a number of complex problems facing us.  The vital one is that the Government should get down to the task of revitalising the Land Reclamation Scheme, of getting ahead with forestry development and of investigating the possibility of the development of the marine industry.  In that, there is great potential for employment and for a livelihood for our people at home.  It is true to say the Government cannot <Col N="89" /> do everything.  Times may be difficult, but on the presentation by the Taoiseach of his Cabinet, there is no evidence of any change of front, of any new line of thought, of any new effort.  It is, all over again, that shocking, appalling mediocrity&mdash;a Cabinet without drive or initiative.</P>
    <P>I feel, as does my colleague, Deputy J.A. Costello, that this Parliament can not only do a service to the people of Ireland but can resolve itself into the type of House that will be the ultimate realisation of what proportional representation in fact means&mdash;a co-operative assembly in which the Government will, in the face of reasoned, constructive criticism, be prepared to meet the problems in a manner which will encourage the Opposition to give its support and constructive help to worthwhile proposals.  That is the ultimate meaning of proportional representation. It is a system we have now adopted finally, and I am asking the Taoiseach to accept the ultimate analysis of proportional representation as something which will give effective, good Government as distinct from Party bludgeoning in the House.</P>
    <P>It is probable that with adjustment, with reason and with effort, the Taoiseach will get a long period in office.  He will get no Party harassing &mdash;no harassing for harassing's sake If he comes to the House with a realistic policy to deal, above all, with the problems that beset agriculture, the problems that beset industrial development, I think he will find that the combined wisdom and strength of this House will ensure that the hope now speedily dying in this country will be revived and that an Irish people, given intelligent, helpful leadership by a Government, will respond in a way that will make this country not only one shining like a jewel but one which will do a worthwhile job in world affairs.</P>

I believe those three persons have shown themselves to be unfit to be members of any Parliament because they have disclosed their lack of responsibility in not going into the lobby to vote for or against a person who was proposed in this House as head of the Government.</P>

      <P>The general election which we have just had was the quickest and most sudden general election in the whole history of the State.  We have had civil wars, economic wars, world wars but we have never had a general election within a week of nomination day.  I believe the reason it came so quickly was that the Government knew that the country is in a mess and they had hoped either to win with such a majority that they could do what they liked and remain in office for five years or that their opponents would be left to clear up the sorry mess which they had left.  Unfortunately, the best laid schemes of mice and men frequently go astray.  The Taoiseach now finds himself dependent upon the votes of two so-called Independents to keep him in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may tell you, Sir that I am not questioning it; I am merely reciting it as an incident that took place, which is an entirely different thing.  In any event, the Taoiseach, who, like his predecessor in his own Party, likes to wear the white cloak of respectability, has selected as his left-hand man the principal manufacturer, purveyor and slinger of mud in this country.  We have heard talk about a clean campaign.  There was one exception&mdash;the Taoiseach's left-hand man, the man whom he now puts before us as &ldquo;Mr. Seán Mac an tSaoi&rdquo; who, strangely enough, went before the electorate as &ldquo;Mr. Johnny MacEntee&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the House today, the Taoiseach <Col N="92" /> indulged in a certain amount of subterfuge. He put before this House as Ministers of his Government a succession of names in the English language, which was correct in so far as the gentlemen concerned were returned and went before the electorate in the English form of their names, but, in the hand-out which was passed around and which will go on the official record, we find a different form of names used for some 12 people who paraded the country as the upholders of our national language but who, in seeking the support of the electorate, used the English forms of their names. It seems to me that a Government who start off in such a hypocritical fashion are giving a very bad example to the country and one not deserving of support.</P>
    <P>Those who voted for this temporary Government today voted for the continuation of a policy which in Dublin city in the past four years reduced to one-quarter the housing programme which was there before they went into office.  They supported a policy which reduced by two-thirds the number of people in Dublin city entitled to free medical service.  They voted for the continuation of a health policy which is based upon the pauper poor law system of Queen Victoria of 1851 and the Fianna Fáil and Labour-supported Health Act of 1953.</P>
    <P>There was before this House an alternative in the person of Deputy Dillon who had pledged this Party, the second largest Party in the House, to a complete repeal of the obnoxious poor law health system that we have in this country.  But, other people, for reasons which the Ceann Comhairle will not allow me here to question, decided to support or to abstain from voting against a Fianna Fáil Government and the result is we now have once again as Minister for Health, the most reactionary, right-wing, Tory that could be produced in the most conservative country in the world, a man who believes that our present health system is fundamentally right. He agrees that it could be modified and improved but he believes that the fundamental basis of our health service, which is a 19th century poor low relief system, is correct.  We on <Col N="93" /> this side of the House disagree, and will continue to disagree, until we remove from Government office any man who believes in that or any people who support it.</P>
    <P>We have once again in the Ministry of Local Government the man who, taking the over-all national picture, reduced by one-half the house building programme of the former Government in which Fine Gael had such a tremendous part to play, a man who by his own policy reduced by three-quarters the housing programme in Dublin, the centre of the country where the housing problem was most urgent.  We have again in the Department of Local Government the Minister who sent to the Cork Corporation a letter refusing to provide money for housing because, he said, the Cork Corporation had not made allowances for the natural reduction of the population of Cork by emigration.</P>
    <P>That is the mean, despairing Government which the Taoiseach has the audacity to ask this House to accept. While agreeing with those who think that the Opposition must be constructive, I believe that this Government is so bad and so despairing that they must be got out very quickly.  The sooner a general election comes, as far as Fine Gael are concerned, the better. When it comes it will merely be a postponement of the general election of 1961.  Had the election not been the quickest one in the records of the State for the last 40 years, the result would have been entirely different. Those who are now trying to grin over there would be over here and perhaps feeling a lot safer.</P>

      <P>The Ministry for the Gaeltacht has now been handed over to a gentleman who while in office had the title &ldquo;an tUasal Micheál Ó Moráin&rdquo; but strangely enough when he sought the support of the electorate in his area he was plain &ldquo;Michael Moran&rdquo;.  One wonders about the sincerity of such a man and why a fíorghael like Gearóid Mac Pharthaláin is shifted from the Department of the Gaeltacht and Deputy Michael Moran <Col N="94" /> put in his place.  I can well understand why the Taoiseach felt it so politically imperative to shift a gentleman, who went by the title of &ldquo;Caoimhghin Ó Beolain&rdquo; but in the general election was entitled &ldquo;Kevin Boland&rdquo;, from the office of Minister for Defence.  He knows that the Army vote swung against Fianna Fáil on this occasion and that the Army which ought to have some confidence in their Minister indicated they had lost all confidence in their last Minister.  In the unsafe position of the world at present it was more than prudent, even apart from Party politics, for the Taoiseach to remove from the office of Minister for Defence a man who had lost the confidence of such a fine Army.</P>
      <P>I do not want to venture to forecast what confidence the new Minister will get from the Army but he could not do as much damage as his predecessor. I have been taken to task in some places for criticising the creation of the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice and the appointment of Deputy Haughey to that position.  On this occasion I should like to congratulate him on his appointment as Minister.  He is a person who has some ability and that is why I thought it unnecessary to create for him a post which never before existed and which we then believed was unnecessary.  It may well be that the Taoiseach has not yet completed his appointment of Parliamentary Secretaries but, if a Parliamentary Secretary was necessary in the last administration, I think it unfair to Deputy Haughey to leave him all alone on the top floor of Merrion Street, unless it be that the law reform introduced by Deputy Costello, Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Everett in the Coalition Government has now been exhausted and that it will take some time before we can have any new Bills from that Department, other than those for which leave to introduce will be sought later on tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is amazing that Fianna Fáil in the general election which has just been completed were able to spend about 10 times more money than all their political opponents put together and, at the end of it all, emerged with <Col N="95" /> fewer votes than their opponents. That is a fact that can be measured by putting a ruler to the columns of the newspapers.  It seems to indicate that their principal support came from a few who have accumulated wealth under them and who felt that their only security was to see Fianna Fáil returned to office.  It brings to mind the words of the Irish poet Goldsmith, who wrote: &ldquo;Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey, where wealth accumulates and men decay.&rdquo;  Wealth accumulated in the hands of Fianna Fáil to the tune of ten times more money than had all their political opponents put together while the youth, the men and women of Ireland, decayed and 215,000 emigrated in the last five years, a greater number than emigrated in the previous 30 years put together.  So that while Fianna Fáil accumulated the wealth, while their supporters accumulated the wealth, they got fewer votes than everybody else put together and the people who had no money left to feed themselves, much less subscribe to Fianna Fáil, left the country.  That is why we now have a Government who bought themselves back to power on the money accumulated in the hands of the few, while the many are afflicted by this pauper health system, denied equality of educational opportunities, a decent social welfare system and the necessary houses which any Christian Government would provide.  That being so, it is a deplorable and miserable Government that we in the Opposition have to face.</P>
    <P>I was hoping, when the election had not been more favourable for my Party, that at least there might have been some new faces on the Fianna Fáil Front Bench.  Instead we have the position in which the Taoiseach still has confidence in the group, in respect of whom the electorate have given a clear vote of no confidence.  Therefore it is very necessary to bring about the downfall of this Government and the sooner that comes about the better.  It is a natural experience that the period of greatest growth in any organisation is succeeded by decay. Fianna Fáil have experienced the <Col N="96" /> end of their growth and the rot and the decay have now set in. That will spread and the Fianna Fáil Party will continue to decline whereas the Fine Gael Party will have the tide flowing in their favour.  We hope the day is not too far distant when the general election will come and return a Fine Gael Party with an overall majority.</P>

      <P>I have listened to a great number of speakers from the opposite side tonight and to the speech which Deputy Cosgrave made about the patronage system.  If the particular section of the community, which is still depending on the patronage of Government for high positions, were brought under the control of the Local Appointments Commissioners, like other sections of the community, we would get rid of some very undesirable elements even in this House.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the comments on the action of the Taoiseach in appointing the same old team.  We must remember that that is the team that took over here four and a half years ago when the gentlemen opposite, to use another phrase of Deputy Seán Collins, ran away from the problem instead of facing up to it.  We must remember that that Coalition Government, with a majority in this House, lasted three and a quarter years, and then ran, and ran leaving a very dirty task after them.  We must remember that it was the team the Taoiseach got together then which restored the confidence of the people and succeeded in changing the face of the country.  I have heard a good deal of talk about emigration.  Employment in my constituency has doubled in the last four and a half years.  I challenge any Deputy to deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the responsibility of this Dáil to elect the Taoiseach.  It is the responsibility of the Taoiseach to select the team he considers best fitted to help him in his task.  He has done that.  We can be thankful for the fact that the progress which is giving so much increased employment all over the country can now continue and can continue, I believe, with the support of the vast majority of this House.  Over a certain period, we had a team building up.  Then we had three years of a <Col N="97" /> mixum-gatherum in which every penny was spent, and more with it.  We must remember that.  We must remember that the Coalition failed.</P>
    <P>There has been talk to-night about agriculture.  We all know the conditions and we can only hope that these conditions will change under the Common Market.  We cannot expect men to remain on the land at a wage of £5 10s. to £6 per week when the wage in industry is from £8 10s. to £10 per week.  While that condition continues, the flight from the land will go unchecked, and no amount of talk will stop it.  We all hope there will be a change for the better, a change which will induce our agricultural workers to remain on the land.</P>
    <P>For the past three years in my constituency, I have been observing the effects of one blunder made in the famous agreement of 1956, under which it was agreed to put a levy of £16 a ton on sugar and sugar products exported to Britain.  The total amount of the levy last year paid to Britain was £550,000. We were faced with the position in which the acreage of beet had to be rationed because of the blunder made by Deputy Norton and the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon.  For the past two years, I have been agitating about that blunder in this House, but I have got no change so far.  It is never easy to rectify a wrong.  However, under the Common Market, that levy will have to go.  There was talk here of geniuses.  What does anyone think of the two geniuses who went over and made that blunder?  Are those the geniuses it was endeavoured here to-day to put in charge of the Common Market negotiations?</P>

      <P>All I look for in my constituency is my quota, and I always get that.  When other Deputies have <Col N="98" /> been here for 35 years, they can talk then.  We must face the conditions frankly and honestly.  Deputy Sherwin said that the Fine Gael people told him Deputy Dillon would be beaten to-day. They were that nervous and that timid of taking on the job.  But they would not have got the job unless they endeavoured to coddle the Labour Party again and the Labour Party got such a burning the last time they would not touch Fine Gael again, and they were quite right.</P>
      <P>I believe this Government will survive for the next four or five years.  I do not think any one of you will have the courage to put them out.  If anyone has the &ldquo;guts&rdquo; to put them out, I will be here, as I have been here before, having a look over there and wondering what happened to certain people.  I do not think there is one on those benches to-night who was here when I first came into this House. Deputy Seán MacEoin came in on a by-election.  Deputies opposite should take my advice and sit very quietly over there.  They should not act the fools.</P>

      <P>Today were elected a Taoiseach and Government supported by two Independents.  On a previous occasion, we had a Fianna Fáil Government supported by five Independents so that at least we have a stronger Government on this occasion than we had at that time.  The general election of the past few weeks was overshadowed by the Congo crisis. The Taoiseach certainly chose a very suitable time for the protection and maintenance of his Party by choosing <Col N="99" /> that time and leaving such a short time for the general election campaign, particularly when there were many new candidates with the older generation passing on.  These new candidates had to make their names amongst the public so that they would become known.  They did not get that opportunity. The result is that the Old Guard of Fianna Fáil have come back hardly damaged.  It was a good tactical move on the part of the Taoiseach but it was unfair to the public.</P>
      <P>A general election is a very important event for the people.  It gives them an opportunity to examine the record of the outgoing Government in order to decide what Government should come in.  The people were not given a fair opportunity to examine the record of Fianna Fáil and to consider the policy of Fine Gael which was put before them at the recent general election.  The Fine Gael policy is designed in many respects to meet the needs of modern times.  It is a policy that meets the problems of the moment rather than some policy that had become outdated.</P>
      <P>For instance, this short campaign did not give the parents an opportunity of considering the decision of Fine Gael to abolish the system of compulsory Irish and to introduce instead a voluntary scheme whereby Irish would be encouraged and taught as a subject, instead of confusing the children by the teaching of subjects such as mathematics through the medium of Irish at a time when the child has very little knowledge of the Irish language and does not know the mathematics which the teacher tries to teach.  The same applies to the teaching of other subjects through the medium of Irish.  In fairness to the parents and children, the policy of Fine Gael in relation to Irish did not get a sufficient hearing and the mature consideration which would enable the people to give us a better measure of support in respect of that important matter because the education of our children&mdash;the men and women of the future&mdash;is very important.  Parents up and down the country are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. McAuliffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that what is before the House is the nomination by the Taoiseach of his Cabinet.  We are not discussing policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will depart from that subject.  I want to put a few more points in relation to the Cabinet now put before us by the Taoiseach. He has presented the country with the Old Guard again, with a couple of slight changes.  This is the Cabinet who held office with a huge majority for four and a half years.  During that time, they had sufficient power to implement any type of policy which would improve conditions for our citizens.  Instead of that, conditions went from bad to worse from the day Fianna Fáil came into office.  They promised to provide 100,000 new jobs. We find instead that 1,000 people emigrated every week from this country for the past four and a half years.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, the number of wage earners in this country fell by 1,000 per month.  These are very significant figures.  They certainly emphasise the fact that Fianna Fáil have failed completely to deal with the greatest problems facing this country at the present time&mdash;emigration and unemployment.  We can take it that the 1,000 people who emigrated each week left this country seeking employment in order to keep body and soul together.  Together with those 1,000 people who emigrated every week, we find from statistics, which cannot be contradicted, that the number of wage earners has fallen by approximately 51,000, which represents for four and a half years 1,000 per month fewer wage packets being issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also look now at a Cabinet which has appointed a Minister again in the Department of Local Government which fell down completely on the provision of local authority housing.  The helpless poor have been ignored, so far as the provision of such houses is concerned.  Those who are not so poor are able to avail of grants and loans which will enable <Col N="101" /> them somewhat to put a shelter over their heads but in relation to the helpless poor dependent upon county councils and corporations to build local authority houses, we find that during their four and a half years of office, the Fianna Fáil Party fell down on the provision of county council houses.</P>
    <P>During those four and a half years also, the amount of rates paid to local authorities by the ratepayers has increased by approximately £4½ million &mdash;that is, £1 million per year.  Much of that extra amount has gone towards a health scheme from which many of those ratepayers cannot and will never benefit.  That contribution of £1 million per year extra was given towards a health scheme which is proving unsatisfactory and which is a cause of hardship to the weaker sections who cannot fight their own battle.</P>
    <P>They are being beaten by red tape. At least under the old dispensary system, the element of humanity came into full play and you did not have the destitute poor defeated by red tape and prevented from having the health services which the old dispensary treatment system could provide. The number of agricultural workers during the past four and a half years has fallen by 7,000 per year.  That number of people per year left the land in that period.  That shows that the agricultural community are not prospering and that 7,000 people per year are being driven off the land into another type of employment.  Those 7,000 people comprise also a large number of the emigrants.</P>
    <P>In general, the farming community have had their taxes considerably increased while their income has been greatly reduced.  The Taoiseach has given us the same Cabinet again, realising that these are some of the weaknesses that were thrown up during the past four years when Fianna Fáil had a huge majority.  If Fianna Fáil had any policy, surely they could have implemented it with the huge majority they enjoyed in those years. From to-day's vote, we can see that they will have a reasonable majority in respect of any reasonable legislation <Col N="102" /> they propose to implement during the next four years.  Certainly, if they attempt to take from the people the fairest system of voting in the world, they will not get away with it.  That was one of the few positive steps taken by Fianna Fáil in the past four years &mdash;they used their majority to try to change the system of voting so as to ensure that all other political Parties would be wiped out, leaving only Fianna Fáil under the system of straight voting if it were put into effect.  That is not the type of legislation for which a majority should be used.  It is certain, on the numbers in the House on this occasion, that Fianna Fáil will make no attempt to override the wishes or the freedoms of the people.</P>
    <P>On this occasion, I see that the Taoiseach has nominated Deputy MacEntee as Tánaiste and Minister for Health.  Surely he was not impressed by the battle with the doctors which Deputy MacEntee has carried out relentlessly during the Government's last term of office?  Does the Taoiseach approve of that conduct? Does he consider it is to the advantage of the suffering patients in hospitals and dispensaries that this battle should continue?  I mention that because I notice that the Taoiseach did decide to change Deputy Boland and take him away from the Army where he is not wanted.  He considered, I am sure, that it was in the national interest to take him away from the Army. That is why I ask the Taoiseach why he did not take Deputy MacEntee away from the throats of the doctors and allow some freedom in the operation of the health services instead of the continuance of a rancour which we have witnessed for a number of years between Deputy MacEntee and the doctors.</P>
    <P>We find also that the Taoiseach has appointed Deputy Smith Minister for Agriculture but when the previous Government were formed with a huge majority in 1957, all the Ministries were filled except that of Agriculture. The Taoiseach at that time, who was an astute man, nobody will deny, decided not to fill that vacancy.  He left the post vacant rather than allow <Col N="103" /> Deputy Smith to take it over.  We had the most important Ministry in the country vacant for three months until Senator Moylan was elected to the Seanad.  He was then brought from the Seanad here as Minister for Agriculture. He endeared himself to the agricultural community and certainly made a positive effort to meet the various problems which normally affect agriculture.  Unfortunately, he died and the post was again left vacant until Deputy Smith was put into it.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that with a huge over-all majority on a previous occasion, the former Taoiseach left that post vacant rather than put Deputy Smith into it, but to-day the Taoiseach walks into the Dáil and presents the farmers and the country with Deputy Smith as Minister for Agriculture, a Deputy who, it was clear to himself and to the country, was unwanted after the last election. If the Taoiseach reflects, he will see that the attitude of Deputy Smith towards the farmers has never been good.  We remember the speech he made at Navan when he threatened to break down the farmers' fences, to put in bulldozers and fill ten fields with inspectors.  That is how he was going to deal with the farmers.</P>
    <P>I wanted to make these points because I feel the Taoiseach should have taken the opportunity he had to give us a new-look Cabinet, to take away from the country the Ministers who have caused emigration at the rate of 1,000 a week, a reduction of jobs at the rate of 1,000 a month and the disappearance of the people engaged on the land at the rate of 7,000 a year. We recall some of the slogans from the last general election about wives being asked to get their husbands back to work.  They went back to work &mdash;in England.  On this occasion, we are told to keep the wheels turning but if we were to keep C.I.E. wheels turning, we might not be doing so well. The Minister for Transport and Power has much to answer for in depriving some of the rural areas of nationalised transport.  When it is a question of nationalising transport or providing <Col N="104" /> any type of Government or public service a Government should be very careful not to deprive the people of that service when it cannot be replaced by private enterprise.  For these reasons, I deplore the fact that on this occasion the Taoiseach has not made a better choice of Ministers and given the country new hope.  The country cannot hope for anything new from the old team.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Corry talking about the old team being appointed made me throw my mind back a few years to the time when he was out in a bye-election telling the people of a certain constituency that he was certain to be on that team as Minister for Agriculture when he was making promises about the price of wheat.  While I have a certain sympathy with the Deputy, it makes me laugh to hear him talk about that time because while I do not know what the Taoiseach thinks about it &mdash; I shall soon tell him what I think about it&mdash;I know damn well what Deputy Corry thinks about it.</P>
      <P>The statement he made was that this team had changed the face of the country over the past four years. There is no doubt about that.  In the past four years, in rural areas among the people I represent and who have sent me for the seventh successive occasion to Dáil Éireann, there have been terrible changes.  Not alone have the children gone, the sons and daughters, but in many cases the fathers and mothers have left with them and the key is turned in the door and the home vacated.  That has arisen because the present administration in the past four years put the cost of living for the poorer sections of the people to such an impossible height&mdash; prices of flour, bread, butter, the ounce of tobacco and the packet of cigarettes&mdash;that the tenant-farmers have had to lock up.  The day of the larger farmers is coming.  That is some of the progress we heard about during the election from people such as Deputy Kitt who is listening to me now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take my parish of Dunmore.  The homes of 45 tenant farmers there have <Col N="105" /> been closed up.  Nevertheless, we hear a lot of trash from the other side of the House about progress.  We hear about the erection of more schools.  In my parish, schools are being closed up.</P>
    <P>My sympathy goes out to the Taoiseach.  I am not one of those who will say to him: &ldquo;I shall support you if you do this or if you do that.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach's responsibility is government. He has accepted that responsibility and must stand or fall by it.</P>
    <P>During the election every professional individual who spoke on behalf of any political Party had a great deal to say about the Common Market.  We heard a lot about it today, too.  It is laughable to hear some people talk about the Common Market or any market.  I remember a time when they were saying we could live without any market and that they wished every ship was at the bottom of the sea.  Do Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael not realise that they have no say on whether or not we shall enter the Common Market?  Do they not realise that if Britain enters it we must do likewise and if Britain decides to stay out we must stay out also?  Do Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, or Labour, also think they are deceiving the people of this country so much as to try to make out that they have any say as regards entry into the Common Market?  I am sure the Taoiseach is honest&mdash;if there is such a thing as an honest politician and I do not think there is, except myself.  I am sure he will admit that the decision rests with Britain and that whatever they do we shall do likewise.</P>
    <P>I am glad about the present position as regards the state of the Parties.  We hear talk about a strong Government. The people never elected a strong Government of any Party to injure the people of this country.  I have witnessed strong Governments in the past 40 long years.  The stronger the Governments, the greater injury they were to the people.  It was because Fianna Fáil were so strong for the past four years that they caused such injury.  It was because Fianna Fáil were so strong for the past four years that over 200,000 of our people from the rural areas had to fly out of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> We hear: &ldquo;Oh, but note how we fixed the financial position.&rdquo;  With one stroke of the pen, from the poorer sections of our people, on bread, on the necessities of life, they took away £9,000,000.  I defy them to deny that. Who suffered?  Of course, the poorer sections of the community suffered. Then, at that time, we heard: &ldquo;Oh, but we are getting on great in the United Nations.&rdquo;  Do you remember that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  It did not matter.  The over-all majority was there to steamroll anything through.  I know that many Deputies marched into this House to vote for the team, the present team which was the past team&mdash;I think I am entitled to discuss them&mdash;and they did not know what the issue was on which they were voting.  It was strong Government. That is what has crippled our country for the past four years.  I am delighted with the present position. There cannot be any dictatorship or else it is a case of going to the country again&mdash;and I am sure Fianna Fáil do not want to go into it either because if they get a scorching as they got the last time they will not be back at all.</P>
      <P>Another thing that was carried out in my county was piped water supplies. The position as regards the rates at the moment is that the land is not worth the level of the rates.  The people are running away.  The tenant farmer cannot afford to pay the rates.  During the election we heard people such as Deputy Kitt talk about piped water supplies to the people who want them. The piped water supply was as plentiful as the Mass cards he sent along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

      <P>I am looking over the team.  I do not want to find fault with any of them personally.  I want to find fault with them collectively, as they proved a failure over the past 41/2 years.  I wonder if the Labour Party think they will improve?  There is no improvement in them&mdash;you can take that from me.</P>
      <P>I am not one of those who will say to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;If you do this, I will put you in; if you do that, I am with you.&rdquo;  I could not be with him or his Party in their actions in the past 4 years.  I saw them bring a Bill to this House and they curtailed the debate on it.  It was a Bill to put people in jail if they did not work.  The first motion was a curtailment of the debate. I voted against that curtailment but I was misrepresented as regards my vote by the double-dealers down in Galway. Nevertheless, I shall get an opportunity to reply to that.</P>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach and his Government good luck.  I am not one of those who are bending at the knees for the length it will last.  Of course, a lot of them will support this Government lest it will have to go out again. They know they will not come back &mdash;especially on the Taoiseach's side. Here I am again for the seventh time in 18 years.  I represent people who work and live on the land, who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not expect the Taoiseach to introduce much because he did not introduce much so far but I shall vote against anything he introduces that will harm that section of the community. Do not mind the trash about all the wonderful things they are doing.  They say they are increasing employment. I agree that industrial employment has increased.  I give everyone his due.  I want the Taoiseach to realise that there are 28,000 fewer people working on the land than there were four years ago.  They are the people who make the money.  In drudgery and by the sweat of their brow, they pull new money out of the land.  They are more valuable than those in industrial employment.  They make the new <Col N="108" /> money and there are 28,000 fewer of them.  Those in industrial employment are like jobbers who go to a fair and spend £10 to make £10 5s.  The Government should assist the people who make the new money.  If they do, they will get any assistance I can give.</P>
    <P>There are people who went around the country denigrating Dáil Éireann and the members elected to Dáil Éireann.  It is a great credit to any man to be elected a member of the Parliament of his country, if only for one hour.  It is something he should be proud of.  In my view, it is a good job we got rid of the people who despised the institutions of our State.</P>

      <P>After the election, the most common comment heard throughout the country was that the people seemed to have made, in most cases, a very sensible choice in their representatives. After listening to the speeches here this evening and tonight, I am afraid I cannot agree with that view because it appears that Deputies came in here prepared to debate, on the motion to appoint the Government, the next election, the previous election and the election before that.  They do not seem to be terribly sure of what they want to do about appointing a Government.</P>
      <P>So far as the Labour Party are concerned, we voted against Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach and the majority of the House decided to appoint him. The job of nominating the Government is his and we see no reason why we should interfere with what is his prerogative, but we do reserve our right&mdash;and have done so&mdash;to offer from these benches constructive criticism of the Government whom he proposes to appoint.</P>
      <P>We see no reason why we should not be allowed to condemn Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Health and Social Welfare for a number of things he has done and has not done. Numerous Ministerial orders were sent out which made the Health Act more unworkable than it was when it passed through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see no reason why we should not condemn Deputy Dr. Ryan because of the fact that his dead hand, <Col N="109" /> and the dead hand of Finance, were laid on quite a number of schemes which would have been of benefit to the country, if they had been put into operation.</P>
    <P>We can see no reason why we should not condemn Deputy Smith because not alone has he failed to look after the farming community but he has failed to make any attempt to prepare them for our entry into the Common Market, if we are accepted.  He has also failed to exercise any control whatever over the body which is primarily under his control, the Agricultural Wages Board, with the result that agricultural workers are working for the lowest wage paid to any male employee today.  In fact, their wages are based, not on what is paid to their brothers in industry, but on what is paid to juveniles and girls in certain types of industry.  We think there should certainly have been a change of Minister in that Department, but the Taoiseach has the choice.</P>
    <P>We must complain about the failure of Deputy Childers to deal with transport and power in the way in which we understood they were to be dealt with when he was appointed Minister for Transport and Power.  His actions so far have had very little result except the closing down of a number of branch railway lines, to which Deputy Rooney referred.  I should like to add that any improvement in the finances of C.I.E. is due to a decrease in the wages bill.  Hundreds of people lost their employment because of a change in C.I.E. employment policy.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows the position with regard to the Army.  The dissatisfaction which was felt in connection with the Army pay rise is so well known that there is no need for me to mention it in this House.  Deputy Boland was in charge of the Army.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran failed to deal with the protection of our fisheries and fishery markets, and all the other matters which were part of his duties as Minister for Lands.  In addition, there was a complete failure on his part to give any kind of justice to the small farmers and landless men in the Midlands when land was being divided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> I suggest to Deputy Hilliard who is a colleague of mine in Meath that his function is not to select temporary sub-post office workers for a couple of weeks' holiday work, or subpostmasters and subpostmistresses of small offices throughout the country.  That should be left to someone else and political bias should not be introduced into such appointments.</P>
    <P>So on down the line.  We have been told that for the past four and a half years the Fianna Fáil Government have done a good job.  We honestly do not believe that the Government the Taoiseach has nominated are capable of doing a good job, but, as I have said, that is the Taoiseach's responsibility and if he thinks they can do it, we in the Labour Party are prepared to give him and them every chance.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Tully read the motion that is before the House.  If he does, he will see that the responsibility does not rest solely on the shoulders of the Taoiseach.  The responsibility for approving the nomination by the Taoiseach of these Ministers rests on the House.  Having heard Deputy Tully's speech, I was considerably surprised that he indicated that the Labour Party propose to give their approval to the nominations of the Taoiseach.  The responsibility is his and his colleagues, as well as the responsibility of me and my colleagues, and the Taoiseach and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is not normally regarded as an unimaginative man, but there is no doubt that his decision to parade the Old Guard again before the country will cause widespread disappointment.  That decision will be regarded as dull, unenterprising, unimaginative and over-cautious.  I do not propose to indulge in any personal criticism of any of the individual Deputies suggested by the Taoiseach for appointment as Ministers, but I think it is open to us to say&mdash;and I feel we have every justification for saying&mdash;that as a team, they have proved that they are unable to tackle what they themselves said was the task before them when they first took office four and a half years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am calling to mind what I think <Col N="111" /> was the first speech made in this House by the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Boland.  He told the House that the previous Government were elected for the specific purpose of ending a situation of mass unemployment and mass emigration.  That was the statement of a Government Minister newly elected to the House as to why the previous Fianna Fáil Government were elected.  That was the test held out by himself and it was underscored and emphasised many a time by the Taoiseach when he told the country that unemployment was the test of Government policy.  Now when the Taoiseach suggests to this House that we should fall in behind the Old Guard again, we are entitled to ask ourselves how they have measured up to the standard which they set for themselves when they took office four and a half years ago to end a situation of mass unemployment.</P>
    <P>How have they fared there?  Every one of us knows that after their efforts for four and a half years, instead of the ending of a situation of mass unemployment, as they described it, there were 51,000 people fewer at work than when they took office in the year 1957 and instead of the ending of emigration more than 200,000 people have left our shores over the last five years.  Having regard to those facts, I do not think I am exaggerating when I say the Taoiseach's actions here this evening will be regarded as dull, unenterprising and unimaginative.</P>
    <P>I call to mind also the fact that when the Taoiseach succeeded Mr. de Valera, now President of Ireland, as Taoiseach during the last Parliament, he excused himself for keeping on this Old Guard as Ministers by indicating that the appointments would be regarded as provisional. They remained, nevertheless, throughout the full period of the last Dáil and now we find that, with one exception, we are asked to approve of them again as the new Cabinet.  How long is this provisional arrangement to last?  I sincerely congratulate the Taoiseach, however, on the new appointment he has proposed, the appointment of Deputy Haughey as a Minister.  I <Col N="112" /> have no doubt it will improve the team which the Taoiseach is suggesting to the House.</P>
    <P>I remember also, while very little, if anything, was heard about it from the Fianna Fáil Party during the recent election campaign, that in the previous election when the Old Guard were paraded before us, very great play was made by the Fianna Fáil Party with the necessity to reduce Government expenditure and to give good example at the top.  We were told that while all avenues would be explored and all doors opened to find employment for our people, there was one door that would remain closed and that was the door to the Civil Service. Incidentally, I understand that at the end of the previous Government's period of office, the only worthwhile increase in employment was in the Civil Service and that the numbers in the Civil Service had increased by about 500.</P>
    <P>On the question of a reduction in Government expenditure, and the cost of administration generally, I do not believe there is anyone in the country who does not believe that is a necessity and something which this Government or whatever Government were elected as a result of the recent general election would have to tackle.  There will be widespread disappointment throughout the country that, far from reducing the number of Ministers&mdash;and the number of Ministers can and should be reduced&mdash;the Taoiseach in his first statement to the House this evening has actually indicated that there will be an additional Ministry later on. Therefore, we can look forward to an increase in the number of Ministers, rather than a reduction.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters which could be referred to here but I want to confine my remarks as far as possible to the motion before us. I want to say to the Taoiseach, because I believe it is a fact, that the loss of votes and the loss of seats to the Fianna Fáil Party in the general election must be attributed either to a loss of confidence by the people in the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government or to a loss of confidence by <Col N="113" /> the people in the personnel of the Government.  We have had no indication whatever that the Taoiseach proposes to do better so far as policy is concerned in the present Dáil than in the previous Dáil.  We have on the Order Paper in the motion before us a very clear indication that, if the verdict of the people is to be interpreted as dissatisfaction with the personnel of the Government, that verdict is to be flouted by the Taoiseach and by the members of the Dáil who support this motion.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is in order to discuss in a superficial way the election that brought these Ministers to their positions.  In any election, you cannot be a cry-baby and you cannot complain.  Once the election is declared, you must come out fighting. I remember well the Taoiseach saying many times&mdash;I heard it myself and read it in the newspapers&mdash;that plenty of time would be given to the Opposition to put their policies across. In fact, he did not give plenty of time.  In my view, that was because he did not have any policy to put across.  The old faces we see before us tonight are like the old face of his policy which was a stagnant policy.  He did not satisfy the people for four and a half years and was elected by default.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Opposition Parties had the minimum number of days in which to put their policy before the people, they succeeded in winning over 80,000 votes from the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered also that we on this side of the House when approaching an election are at a grave disadvantage, which, I suppose, is no fault of the people opposite; if we were in the same position, we would do what they did.  However, they are the biggest Party in the country and they seem to be adepts at this whispering campaign which is destructive, which seeks to decry policies which have been promulgated and to suggest that they will bring ill instead of good. We on this side of the House have to time the production of our policy.  We could not produce our policy on this <Col N="114" /> occasion at exactly the same time as the E.S.B. strike because we have not at our command publicity in three newspapers. We have to depend on the publicity we can get in the free Press in order to put our policy across. With all these disadvantages, we succeeded in getting 80,000 votes from Fianna Fáil.  That shows what way the pendulum is swinging and what way things will be in the future.</P>
    <P>It would be well to consider the Ministers we have.  They well know I approach this matter in no personal way.  I am interested not in personalities but in policies.  It seems that in 1961 we have reached the stage when the people of the country also are more interested in policies rather than personalities.  Perhaps the resignation of a certain politician had something to do with that.  We have a Minister for Health who has been at loggerheads with the I.M.A. for the past four and a half years.  There may be rights and wrongs in that dispute, but, apart from that, the Minister did not produce any new policy on health.  As far as the Minister for Health is concerned, it is a question of the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>We must consider what would have been the position if the people had a little more time to consider the policy put before them by the Party of which I am proud to be a member.  The people know they now have a Minister for Health who believes that the health services here must be based on the green card system, on the fact that you cannot get health benefits free of charge unless you are absolutely destitute, on the fact that 50 per cent. of the cost comes from the rates and that in two counties of equal population, one penny in the £ brings in £1,000 in one county and £3,000 in the other. In case Deputies think that is fiction, I am talking about Louth and Meath. But in our case we have 2,000 more people than Meath, but a penny brings us in only one-third the amount of money.</P>
    <P>We have a Minister for Health who wants to continue with this completely stupid system under which there cannot be fair play.  If the electorate had sufficient time, we might have had a <Col N="115" /> health service with a free choice of doctors, but because the Taoiseach tried to forget Government by default, the people did not have sufficient time to consider the matter and change their allegiance on the basis of policy rather than personality.</P>
    <P>The electorate know they have a Minister for Education who will continue the policy of compulsory Irish that has failed absolutely.  They know the policy they would have had under a Fine Gael Government.  We would try to give every child of poor parents an opportunity of attending a university and obtaining a degree.  We would have encouraged the Irish language rather than try to stuff it down the people's necks.  We would press for the education of people to meet the challenge of the Common Market and of a world growing smaller.  The people know they have got instead a Minister who will continue compulsory Irish. They had confirmation of that from the Taoiseach during the election campaign when he said: &ldquo;We will not lower our target one inch.&rdquo;  But the Taoiseach has not hit the target for the past 30 years and how does he expect to hit it now?</P>
    <P>The people know they have a Minister for Agriculture who has failed in one fundamental thing: he has failed to lead the Irish farmer.  He has never succeeded in getting the Irish farmer to feel enthusiastic. Of course, it is not so long since he tried to drive the Irish farmer before him with a stick. As Deputy Rooney said, the Minister for Agriculture was put in charge of a Department which had been voted £250,000 to improve agricultural marketing. Yet he ended his term of office without spending one penny, except the travelling expenses of members of a few committees he appointed and who made a few trips to the Continent and England.  It cost £7,800.  He ended his term of office without doing anything for agricultural marketing, except, within the past four months, putting through permissive legislation in respect of milk, bacon and a few other things.  This legislation allows him do certain things for agricultural marketing, but for four and a half years he did nothing.  If the Minister <Col N="116" /> could have led the Irish farmer, that might have made up for many of the other ills.</P>
    <P>This election was timed to get Fianna Fáil back into office with an overall majority, but the timing had no regard for the period of the year and what would suit the farmer. To-day the wheat crop growing in the fields is largely in jeopardy.  Negotiations should have been started with the flour millers over the last fortnight. But all that work is now to take place at least a fortnight later because Fianna Fáil wanted to hold the election at a time when they thought they would receive an over-all majority. While a large part of the wheat crop was deteriorating and likely to become a loss, the Minister for Agriculture was out trying to get Fianna Fáil back with an over-all majority.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have started a whispering campaign in regard to the election.  It is to the effect that we are not going to have stable Government. I want to state one reason why we are going to have stable Government. We are going to have stable Government because any time a minority put a Government out of office, that minority never got back to the Dáil.  The people do not want a general election unless absolutely necessary.  If the issue is trivial, then the minority who put out the Government will not come back.  As long as the Taoiseach introduces legislation for the benefit and progress of the Irish nation, he has nothing to fear. If he introduces legislation the people want and if it is defeated and we go to the country, then the ballot box will give the answer.  If the Taoiseach is defeated by all the non-Government Deputies and if the people agree with them, then they will be the Government; but if the people do not agree with them, then the Taoiseach will head the Government.</P>
    <P>In my view, there is no question of an unstable Government; rather is it a continuation of the Fianna Fáil autocratic administration.  Perhaps this Government may be the best thing that ever happened because it can be the brake as well as the spur.  I <Col N="117" /> do not know any group of people in this country at the moment, be they local authorities or in the private enterprise group, who do not need both the brake and the spur.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in the debate but I was rather surprised by Deputy Donegan's references to the Minister for Health and to the health services in general. Fianna Fáil brought in the Health Act and were, accordingly, responsible for any advances made in health services.  Accusations were made against the Minister about the number of people who have to pay contributions under the Act.  I have here a record covering Dublin county of the people who have to pay.  Sixty-six per cent. of them, or 39,945, pay nothing; eight per cent. pay between 8/- and 9/- and about ten per cent. pay 3s. a week.  Of course Fianna Fáil, like everybody else, are anxious to see a free health scheme.  Speaking of my constituency, which embraces part of the city as well as the county, I can say nobody who cannot pay is asked to do so.  Each case is gone into in the most conscientious manner possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan also criticised the Minister for Local Government in respect of the housing position.  If he goes back to 1956/57, he will find that in Dublin city and county there was not a penny&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would scarcely have intervened were it not for a misconception by Deputy Michael O'Higgins as to the Labour Party's attitude to the proposed Cabinet.  Of course the Labour Party realise it is the Taoiseach's right to put his Cabinet before the House for approval.  Nomination of his Cabinet is entirely the Taoiseach's responsibility.  We do not propose to vote against the Taoiseach's Cabinet; neither do we propose to vote for it.  We do not propose to vote at all, and by not voting, we do not say whether we approve or disapprove. We all have our personal views about the personnel of the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>I feel there was much good in the Health Act of 1953.  In fact, I do not see very much wrong with it.  I would appeal to the Taoiseach to extend its provisions so as to increase the number of people eligible to receive medical cards.  Our experience in rural constituencies has been that the means test is being applied too rigorously and that it accordingly deprives deserving people of benefits.  I would therefore urge upon the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to re-examine the position to see if it is possible to find some method of relaxing the means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy P.J. Burke seemed to have the wrong end of the stick.  Nobody is complaining about the maintenance charges for patients staying in hospitals. Personal representations to hospital managements and to local authorities will ensure that nobody is wrongly charged.  However, the working man who does not get a medical card, not only has to pay 15/- or £1 per visit to a doctor but he may pay sums varying from a shilling to 30/- for prescriptions.  Should that illness in the family be prolonged for any <Col N="119" /> length of time, it becomes a very serious burden on working class people. Now that Fine Gael have followed the Labour Party in regard to the proposed contributory health scheme and the two Parties being representative of practically the total Opposition, I would suggest that the Government and the Minister for Health should review the Health Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he will review the whole system and see if a contributory type of insurance could be devised that would at least guarantee to each contributor to the Social Welfare Fund a guaranteed medical service under the dispensary doctor system; in other words, that he would at least have the right to the service of the dispensary doctor and the facility of getting prescriptions compounded at the dispensary for his family.  It may not be the best solution but it would be a step forward.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding what Deputy Dillon says, I feel sure that any Government here are anxious enough to give the people all the benefits they possibly can.  If there is a united appeal from all sides, the Government should contemplate introducing such a scheme. secure in the knowledge that they will get the support of all Parties.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we have a change in the Ministry of Justice. Under the newly-imposed licensing laws, the rural dweller was confined to hours that suit the big cities.  The then Minister for Justice refused even to listen and he advised me, as a Deputy representing a tourist area, that I was wasting my breath in telling him anything because his mind was made up.  It is a good thing that we have a new face in the Ministry of Justice.  I would suggest that both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice should reconsider the position.  Certainly, they should consider the question of rearranging the hours to suit the people rather than make the people adapt themselves to the hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Past experience informs me that it will take more than one meeting of the Dáil to enable us all to work the general election out of our systems.  Deputies have their speeches nicely polished by constant repetition and will all want to give them at least one more run before finally discarding them.</P>
      <P>It is true that I am not proposing many changes in the Government. Some Deputies will understand why, when a Government resumes office after a general election, many changes cannot be involved.  It is, I think, 17 years since we had this situation here before.  Each of the four general elections preceding the one which has concluded involved a change of Government and, consequently, the appointment of a whole team of new Ministers.</P>
      <P>There are other reasons also.  Ministers are fair targets for attack during a general election.  Nobody objects to that and any Minister who did not expect to be a target for attack during a general election would be a very foolish man indeed but he would be a very poor Taoiseach who would discard a colleague who had served with him in the Government in circumstances which could be represented as conceding that there was justification for such attack.</P>
      <P>Apart from that consideration, there is, for me, the further consideration that before making changes in the Government, I would wish to give newly elected Deputies of my Party the opportunity of showing their merit and gaining experience in the Dáil as ordinary Deputies.</P>
      <P>I should like straightaway to refute that there is any foundation for the suggestion of Deputy Dillon that the change I propose in regard to the Department of the Gaeltacht implies any alteration of views regarding the importance of the work done by that Department.  We all, I think, realise that the work of the Department of the Gaeltacht necessarily overlaps the work of other Departments.</P>

      <P>It had, however, <Col N="121" /> more intimate relationship with work done by the Department of Lands and Fisheries, which also covers afforestation, than probably any other Department. Deputy Moran, who I am proposing should have joint responsibility for both Departments, was previously Minister for the Gaeltacht and I think a most successful one and, with the assistance of a Parliamentary Secretary who will be responsible for the fisheries development work of the Department, I think he will be able to give to the activities of the Department of the Gaeltacht all the time that it needs.</P>
      <P>I agree fully with Deputy Dillon that except in some very obvious and important matters the apparent similarity between the position of the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party is superficial only and conceals the fact that both Parties reached in respect of these matters the positions they are now occupying by somewhat different routes.  I do not want to enter into discussion of these matters now, which would take us very far afield.  Like Deputy Corish, however, I must say that I was somewhat puzzled by the main theme of Deputy Dillon's remarks when he turned and seemed to be addressing the benches occupied by the Labour Party, to denounce Reds and Pinks and apparently able to see a Marxist under every bench over there.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish asked me about changes of Government policy.  I think the main characteristic of the policy which the Government have been applying in recent years is that it has been continuously developing.  Indeed, the merit of Government policy has been that inherent dynamism and capacity for change.  I agree fully that in the circumstances which the Government are now facing our policy will need to develop and, perhaps, change considerably and, indeed, I attempted in speeches which I made both before and during the election campaign to indicate the lines along which I think it should develop.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Corish did not advert to the statement which I made on more than one occasion, that in my view in the circumstances of the years to come State enterprise must play a larger part in our economic development than it has heretofore.  I believe private enterprise, which has always been the main driving force of our economic progress, will remain so in the future but I cannot see any method of adapting ourselves to the conditions and availing of the opportunities that will present themselves in the context of the European Economic Community unless we are prepared to visualise a significant extension of State activity either in the promotion of new enterprises which private enterprise cannot undertake, or in partnership with private enterprise in other fields.  I am sure Deputy Corish is not unaware of the fact that quite recently substantial extensions of State activity in the commercial field have been announced and are now proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphatically deny that either I or any spokesman of my Party during the recent election campaign, or at any previous time, showed an attitude of complacancy regarding the country's <Col N="123" /> situation.  Indeed I warned my Party that any member who used such a phrase as &ldquo;You never had it so good&rdquo; would be promptly repudiated by me. I think I can say that, in every speech I made during the campaign, I emphasised my view that economic progress should be regarded as only beginning and that the rate of progress would have to be accelerated before we could achieve the aims we have set ourselves.  Indeed, I constantly warned those listening to me that we would have to achieve that speeding up of the country's rate of progress in circumstances very different and probably more difficult than those we had experienced heretofore.</P>
    <P>At the same time I think it is not in the least bit helpful to deny the reality of the country's progress in the past two and a half years since the publication of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> That progress is not just a matter of opinion.  It is something that can be measured. The actual increases recorded in agricultural and industrial output, the £60,000,000 increase in exports, the rising national income, the higher wages being paid and the higher level of activity in building and other trades &mdash;it is just foolish to deny their reality.  In fact they represent an accomplishment which should encourage us to face whatever the future may bring because if we were able to achieve these results over the limited period that elapsed since the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was published, there is no reason to underestimate our capacity to do still better in the future.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, obviously not correct that the progress made so far has fulfilled the needs of the country in every way.  Although unemployment is lower than it was at any time previously it still persists; although emigration this year has shown a very substantial drop it still persists, and as I told the Dáil on many occasions during the past two years, we shall need to double the rate of our progress before we can eliminate unemployment and emigration altogether.  Certainly at <Col N="124" /> no time did I consider or describe the economic advances of the country during that period as anything more than a good beginning and it is from this year on that we shall have to endeavour to build on the foundations already laid to achieve the structure we desire.</P>
    <P>Deputy John A. Costello, I think, misunderstood a reference I made in an earlier speech to-day regarding my intentions during the lifetime of this Dáil.  I said that I would feel myself under an obligation to resign as Taoiseach in two circumstances.  One was if the Government should be defeated on an important issue of policy.  By that I mean an issue which should not be finally or irrevocably settled, in my judgment, without giving the people an opportunity of expressing their opinion on it.  The second was if circumstances developed here in which everybody could see, and agreed, that effective Government could not be carried on.  May I make it clear I do not intend to bring about a situation which would involve another general election?</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said he is not afraid of a general election.  I do not think there was ever a politician in any country in the history of the world who said he was afraid of a general election.  Let us all agree that no one of us is afraid of general elections and then stop talking about them.  In my view a situation which would involve a general election could arise, on my understanding of the facts, only as a result of a political decision taken by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties in conjunction.  If that does not happen, then I see no reason why this Dáil cannot continue to do good work for the country for its full period of five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked me about my intentions regarding <Col N="125" /> the conduct of negotiations that will follow upon our application to the European Economic Community.  I think the main responsibility for these negotiations must rest on myself as Taoiseach but I contemplate that the actual conduct of negotiations, where it involves the attendance of Ministers at meetings in Brussels or elsewhere, will most likely be entrusted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I said already, however, that I contemplated that it might be desirable at some stage to create a new Department of Government.  The new Department I have in mind would of course be mainly concerned with our relations with the European Economic Community rather than the completion of the negotiations leading to membership.</P>
      <P>If the situation develops as I contemplate, there will be continuous activities in connection with one or other section of the European Economic Community which will involve the constant and wholetime attention of a Minister because only somebody with nothing else to do could possibly keep in touch with what is happening, or even attempt to read the voluminous documentation that is already pouring out from headquarters of the European Economic Community.  The stage at which it will be appropriate to set up that Department is something I would not attempt to decide at the present time because it will be desirable to do so only when the pattern of the future situation is fairly clearly established and when the outcome of our negotiations can be foreseen to some extent.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to say that I do not think there was need for Deputy Dillon, on behalf of his Party, and Deputy Corish, on behalf of the Labour Party, to give to the Dáil and the country the assurance that they will act with responsibility.  I think we have come a long way from the day in which any Party in this State would be prepared to sacrifice the national interest for Party advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputy John A. Costello for the speech he made.  I agree with him that this Dáil is quite capable of doing the business of the <Col N="126" /> country in so far as that involves the enactment of legislation and there is no reason to anticipate that, arising out of the result of the General Election, any difficulty of any kind will emerge.  If we look back on the history of the last four and a half years, very few Bills produced by the Government were controversial in a political sense. There were very few Bills to which Parties were opposed in principle, though there were many Bills, of course, subjected to protracted debate and not infrequently amended in consequence of these debates.  So far as I am concerned, I hope that in the future, as in the past, reasonable amendments proposed by anybody will be very fully considered and, if consistent with the purpose of the Bill, will ordinarily be accepted.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say, and I speak here with some experience because I have been a member of the Dáil for a long time, that Deputy John A. Costello was right in saying the quality of the membership of the Dáil&mdash;I am not referring to any one Party in this regard&mdash;is considerably improved as a result of the election.  Before the Dáil adjourned Deputies will remember that I expressed the hope that in the conduct of the election we would give the world a fine example of Irish democracy in action.  The last words I said in the election campaign at a meeting in Cork on the eve of the poll&mdash;feeling somewhat relieved at the prospect of getting into my car at the end of it to drive back to Dublin in the knowledge that I had not to make another speech the following night&mdash;were that I thought we had shown the world how Irish democracy worked and that the leaders and members of all Parties were to be congratulated in consequence.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned personally, I did not during the election campaign use a single word which could have added to or aggravated in the slightest degree any bitterness still remaining in the Irish political situation.  Indeed, Deputy John A. Costello was quite right in saying that the election was in that respect, and in every other respect, conducted in a manner which brought honour to the Irish people.  I am not now debating the result.  I am <Col N="127" /> thinking only of the manner in which it was conducted.  If we were able to conduct our public controversies in the manner we did on the hustings, at the crossroads, and on the platforms I see no reason why we cannot in this <Col N="128" /> Dáil discuss in a constructive and helpful way any matter that comes before us, ultimately producing results which will improve our legislation and ensure that business here is efficiently and properly conducted.</P>

      <P>I am proposing that the Dáil adjourn until 15th November, 1961.  I do not contemplate that on the 15th November we shall have more than a one day meeting because one of the main purposes of that meeting will be to enable Bills to be introduced for consideration at subsequent sittings of the Dáil.  There are a few Bills I should like to get leave to introduce now, so that they can be circulated and ready for discussion on 15th November.  There is an Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill, 1961 and there is a Coroners Bill which has nothing to do with the general election.</P>

      <P>We have no objection to that course.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach a question in that regard.  We had the experience, the Taoiseach will remember, last year of a number of Bills of a pretty complex character coinciding with the financial business in the Spring, with the result that we were at the end of the session disposing of legislation very late.  I trust that the Government will be able to arrange that the discussion of legislation can be undertaken at a time other than that at which we are disposing of the financial business; otherwise, we will be in the same jam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that we had a fairly general clearance of the legislative decks before the dissolution in the Summer.  While there will be Bills for introduction on 15th November, 1961, some of them may be of a character that the House would prefer to have them carried over, so far as Committee Stage examination is concerned, until after the Christmas Recess but we can consider that.  I shall endeavour to arrange that as much legislation as possible will be available to be disposed of by the Dáil before we get down to financial business.</P>
