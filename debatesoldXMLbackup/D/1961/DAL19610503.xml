    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will give the reason for that social welfare regulation which prohibits an increase in sickness benefit to those who are in receipt of 100 per cent. disablement allowance from the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Army pensioners in receipt of 100 per cent. pension or allowance are disqualified from receiving disability benefit and any increase thereof in respect of adult of child dependants unless since discharge they have requalified for benefit of limited duration by the payment of 26 contributions or for benefit of unlimited duration by payment of 156 contributions. Persons who have requalified are not, however, entitled to an increase of benefit in respect of a wife or children unless the allowance for dependents in the Army pension is less than the corresponding increases under the disability benefit code, in which event the difference is payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the persons concerned were already in receipt of maximum payments for themselves and their dependants from the Department of Defence in respect of their disability, it was intended that disability benefit should not be paid under the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  This was <Col N="1520" /> in accordance with the principle that not more than one payment should be made from State funds in respect of any contingency.</P>
    <P>As a concession, however, it was decided that the personal rate of disability benefit, together with the difference between the rate of increase for dependants payable with the benefit and the rate of increase applicable to the 100 per cent. pension, should be paid in the case of insured persons who have requalified.</P>
    <P>The present personal rate of disability benefit is 32s. 6d. a week; the increase for a wife is 20s. a week and for each of the first two children 10s. a week.  The 100 per cent pension rate is £3. 17s. 6d. a week; the addition for a wife 11s. 7d. a week and for two children 12s. 3d. a week.  Thus, a pensioner who has requalified for a disability benefit and has a wife and two children is entitled to a pension at the rate of £5. 1s. 4d. a week plus disability benefit at the rate of £2. 8s. 8d. a week, making a total of £7. 10s. 0d. a week.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the position in this respect has been greatly exaggerated and that, for the present, at any rate, it is not necessary to take any steps other than to maintain strict police supervision of anyone engaging in this kind of trade.</P>
      <P>The Garda have reported to me that only two premises in the State have been carrying on a &ldquo;locker-lounge&rdquo; trade and that arrangements have been made for its discontinuance in the case of one of them.  I am not without hope that this kind of trade will cease altogether in the near future.</P>
      <P>However, in order that there may be no doubt in any person's mind as to the Government's attitude in the matter I wish to repeat the warning which I gave in reply to a similar Question on 15th March that I will not hesitate to introduce legislation to stop it if the existing law proves to be inadequate for that purpose.</P>

In view of the fact that the trend is downwards in exports, despite the fact that the amount of money spent on publicity has gone up, would the Minister not consider the time is ripe to re-examine the position with regard to this expenditure and ensure that only a suitable type of whiskey gets the publicity which is now being given to the type of whiskey going out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree, but I should like to quote for you, Sir, your own words here on 9th February this year when a Private Members' Bill, the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill, 1961, was introduced.  You pointed out that the usual procedure under Standing Orders is that, if a Private Members' Bill is opposed on First Reading, the debate is automatically adjourned until the next day on which Private Members' time is taken.  You went on to say, and this is what I am interested in: &ldquo;However, perhaps the Government wish to dispose of it today.&rdquo; The debate continued:</P>

I remember in 1952 when a Private Members' Bill was introduced by the Labour Party.  It was postponed until Private Members' time was available and Private Members' time was available within a fortnight. There is a certain established practice in this House.  In present circumstances Private Members' time will <Col N="1539" /> not be available in the lifetime of this Dáil and therefore the matter cannot come up again.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is in the Bill will not be allowed to see the light of day, I understand, because the Government have said they will not allow a First Reading.  In the Bill there is provision to amend Section 3 of the Aliens Act 1935.  That section states that a non-national has the same right to acquire, hold and dispose of real estate and property of every description in like manner as a national is entitled to hold, dispose of and acquire similar property and rights.  As a result of the situation which has <Col N="1540" /> arisen in the last 15 years, a situation in which a vast quantity of agricultural land has passed into the hands of non-nationals, I think it is time to put a curb to the purchase of land suitable for the relief of congestion and the setting up of economic holdings.  I hold that land should be reserved for the Irish people.</P>
      <P>The amendment offered to the 1935 Act states simply that land suitable for the relief of congestion and for agricultural purposes will not be allowed to be purchased by non-nationals unless they can give satisfactory evidence of residence in this country for a period of 10 years.  There is no attempt whatever in the Bill to prevent the purchase or acquisition of house property, of land for industrial development purposes, building sites, or anything like that.  This is an attempt on our part to do what the Minister for Lands suggests is absolutely necessary, namely, make a pool of land available in order to bring up to an economic standard the 80,000 smallholders and congests in this country at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I want to give the House some of the reasons why this Bill should be rejected forthwith without a Second Reading.  The Bill is a foolish measure for many reasons: (1)  it conflicts with the principle of reasonable reciprocity; (2) it imposes a limitation on free sale; (3) it would have a bad effect abroad on efforts to attract foreign capital into the industrial sector here; (4) it would provoke retaliation against our people in other countries; (5) it would be an impediment to Irish people returning here because if it were passed, it would prohibit Irish-Americans and others coming back; and (6) it would have a disastrous effect on our relations with friendly States.</P>
      <P>We are living in an era in which the barriers between peoples are being removed and this is especially the case in Europe since the advent of the Common Market and if this Bill were passed, it would present us with the extraordinary situation that any member of the British Commonwealth could come in here&mdash;a man from South Africa could come in&mdash;but a Frenchman would be prohibited from doing so.</P>
      <P>The seventh reason is that it is in direct conflict with the Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Act, 1958, the effect of which was to minimise the statutory restrictions which have hitherto been in force in relation to external participation in industrial activities in this country.  Even if the Bill is designed to meet the purposes the Deputy has stated, it is foolish also in this way: it misses completely pre-1947 companies which were used as the main instrument in providing for some unfair acquisition of Irish land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is based on a motion introduced in this House in 1954.  At that time the principles of this Bill were rejected by all Parties in this <Col N="1542" /> House, except the Deputy and his then colleague.  I accordingly ask the House to give this Bill the same treatment as the motion identical with it was given when it was rejected out of hand by the House and when the Deputy did not even see his way to challenge a division.</P>

If that is the net issue, I think he ought be allowed to have that right.  It is impossible to judge the merits of a Bill until one has had an opportunity of reading it.  But on the net issue as to whether a Private Member is entitled to have a Bill printed, I think the Government are wrong not to allow it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on amendment No. 8 and amendment No. 9 was adjourned last Thursday, I had pointed out that I assumed the Minister for Local Government was motivated by some particular reasons when he decided to reduce the constituency of Waterford from four to three seats and permit the constituency of South Tipperary to retain its four seats.  I also said that I could visualise him adopting certain principles when endeavouring to come to his decision. I suggested to the House that one of the considerations he would think about when endeavouring to come to his decision was which of the two constituencies had the greater population; which place was nearer to the High Court ruling of 20,000 per Deputy.  I pointed out that assuming he had already made up his mind to transfer a certain number to North Tipperary, if he examined the question, he would find the position somewhat like this, that Waterford at the 1956 census had 74,031 people registered as against 73,718 in South Tipperary, a majority of 313 in Waterford's favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As pointed out, that was not all of the story.  You would have had to <Col N="1546" /> add to Waterford approximately 1,000 extra population because of the extension of the borough boundary which took place since the 1956 census.  Then you would have had in round figures 75,000 population in Waterford constituency. In reverse, accepting the figures Deputy Mulcahy was kind enough to give to the House in connection with the transfer to North Tipperary from South Tipperary, I find the 73,718 of South Tipperary would have to be reduced by approximately 3,000 people, to drop to some 71,000.</P>
    <P>The position existing at the time the Minister was making up his mind to deprive Waterford of one seat and to permit South Tipperary to retain that seat was that Waterford would have had, on a population basis, some 75,000 people, whereas South Tipperary would have had some 71,000, a difference of 4,000.  I would assume that that must have weighed in some small way with the Minister in coming to his decision but he decided, in his wisdom, to override that fact.</P>
    <P>There is a further fact.  Population is the basis mentioned in deciding the ratio of Deputies to constituencies and the High Court decision was that population basis would be a deciding factor.  But if you leave that aside and take it on the electorate, we find that the electorate in Waterford was 43,156 and in South Tipperary, it was only 41,196, a difference, in round figures, of approximately 2,000.  Without any alteration in South Tipperary or Waterford, there were 2,000 more voters in Waterford than there were in South Tipperary.  Then, again, the factor comes in of the transfer to North Tipperary of approximately 1,531, which I presume had already taken place in the Minister's mind. My figures are as quoted by Deputy Mulcahy in the House last Thursday and not contradicted by the Minister and I assume them to be correct. There was a transfer of 1,531 electors from South Tipperary to North Tipperary, leaving the figure for South Tipperary 39,666 electors.</P>

      <P>The figure for South Tipperary is 39,665, but, adding the 400 that covers the extension of the city boundary to Rockingham, there are 43,500 voters in Waterford&mdash;a difference in round figures of 4,000 electors in favour of Waterford.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these two important factors, the Minister, in his wisdom, decided that the Waterford representation should be reduced and that South Tipperary should be permitted to continue to elect four Deputies.  I have no wish or desire to deprive South Tipperary or any other constituency of representation, but I hold that if, following a High Court decision, the Minister had the unenviable task of deciding between two things, there must have been some facts on which he worked and I should be anxious to hear what those facts were.  I have put forward the facts from the Waterford point of view as I and as most Waterford people see them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a third factor the Minister claimed on last Thursday, a very deciding factor in his mind, namely, that he wanted the minimum interference with county bounds or natural boundaries.  I could go a long way with the Minister there.  That is a very honest and very fair approach but, when we come to Waterford and South Tipperary, does the Minister carry out his avowed desires and intentions as between Waterford and Tipperary? In order to give Waterford the full quota of votes necessary according to the High Court ruling, all it would <Col N="1548" /> mean would be the transfer of the Urban area of Carrick-on-Suir and Carrickbeg into Waterford constituency.</P>
    <P>There is a natural affinity between Carrickbeg and Waterford for hurling, for parochial purposes.  Waterford is the city nearest to Carrickbeg.  The harbour authority of Waterford governs the port of Carrick.  Carrick has representatives on the harbour authority.  In every connection, both Carrick-on-Suir urban area and Carrickbeg have such close affinity with Waterford that they would not even recognise the fact that they had been transferred.  In regard to area, it would simply mean moving in a distance of three to six miles.</P>
    <P>Instead of doing that and transferring roughly 4,700 people from that area to Waterford, the Minister decided to multilate Waterford constituency to the extent of moving the natural boundary and county bounds from Old Bridge, Clonmel down to within six miles of Dungarvan town where I reside, a distance of 21 to 22 miles and including, in a line from Youghal, right through Ballyhane, Cappoquin, up through Modelligo, right across to Rathgormack, leaving Rathgormack outside&mdash;one-third of the whole county.  I wonder how the Minister can reconcile that with his statement on Thursday that his aim was to have the minimum of interference with natural boundaries and county bounds.  I would be keenly interested in hearing the Minister's explanation.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister was not compelled by the court decision to do what he did.  There was a reasonable excuse, perhaps, when he was dealing with other areas and for saying that, had it not been for a certain law action.  Waterford would have had four, South Tipperary would have had four and everything would have been happy.  The Minister's hands may have been forced in other constituencies but I suggest that there is a question to be answered by the Minister if he is to assure the House that everything is fair and above-board in this case.  The Minister must be like Caesar's wife in this matter, above suspicion.  He must clear the air of the charge that is prevalent <Col N="1549" /> in my constituency of political gerrymandering.  It is believed, not by me alone but by leading members of the Minister's own Party and I will quote their words later.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a speech made in this House by Deputy Loughman of Clonmel on the Second Reading.  He said: &ldquo;We were consulted and we gave&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall quote the Deputy verbatim, but if the Minister went to the bother of seeking Deputy Loughman's advice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;why did he not consult Deputy Kyne, Deputy Lynch, Deputy Ormonde and Deputy Kenneally. Perhaps Deputy Ormonde and Deputy Kenneally were asked, but certainly Deputy Lynch and myself were not asked for our views as to what was fair or proper.  Was it just a question, as I am inclined to suspect, of what was fair and proper for Fianna Fáil?  I would hate to think the Minister was a party to that kind of wangle.  I am tired listening to the Minister and his Party condemning the people in the North for gerrymandering. If he is going to do likewise what can we say in future?  If this happened to a Catholic in the North we would have national protests. Deputy Loughman and his Party would almost seek an invasion of the North to prevent this injustice being done by Unionists against Nationalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In speaking about my county I am not doing so because I am in danger there.  It could be that Fianna Fáil would lose the seat notwithstanding the position arrived at by the Minister. If the Minister were as honest as he wishes us to think, why did he not <Col N="1550" /> set up a Select Committee to examine the whole problem as we did on other controversial matters that should be above politics?  This would have enabled representatives of all Parties to discuss the matter and then come before the House to seek unanimous approval.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that a meeting of the Waterford Trades Council, not engineered by Deputy Kyne or sponsored by Deputy Kyne in any way, but representing 10,000 workers in Waterford city, unanimously condemned the action of the Minister. To come closer home, the Waterford County Council representing the whole County of Waterford, on the motion of the chairman, Councillor Charles Curran, a Fianna Fáil member of the Council, unanimously condemned the decision of the Minister and called upon him to amend it.  I should like to quote Councillor Curran's words: &ldquo;It was an act of vandalism against the Waterford constituency.&rdquo;  He was supported in that motion, which as I say was passed unanimously, by a non-contestant in the last election, Councillor Quirke, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, who called upon the people of Waterford, who are now seconded to South Tipperary, to show their disapproval of this action by refusing to vote in the coming election.  Then another Independent Councillor having no connection with the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party or Fianna Fáil, advocated that all Parties should combine in Waterford in the coming election and refuse to put forward any candidates and place the Minister in the embarrassing position of having no Waterford representatives in the next Government or of having three Government - nominated representatives.</P>
    <P>That would be drastic but perhaps the situation needs something drastic. The Minister's action is resented in Waterford.  Waterford people, irrespective of Party, must ensure that their interests, social, cultural and political will not be sacrificed to the needs of another constituency or any Party in this House.  The people of Waterford <Col N="1551" /> are with me in this protest.  Unless the Minister gives us an answer that will clear both his good name and the good name of his Party his action will draw nothing but discredit on Fianna Fáil, not only throughout Waterford but throughout the length and breadth of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>My only reason for speaking now is to refute the statement by Deputy Kyne that I was a party to gerrymandering in Waterford County. I deny that absolutely.  On the Second Reading I did say that if it were left to me I could certainly make a division of the county which would benefit my candidature, if I am a candidate at the next election.  Far from being a benefit to me, the constituency is so divided that I can safely say that in the whole area outside Ballymacarbry I do not know half a dozen people, and that is the biggest part of the constituency, including Lismore, Cappoquin and Tallow.</P>
      <P>I do not know about these rambling figures the Deputy gave us.  He referred to county boundaries, but the argument he made was not a very sound one.  Take the town of Carrick-on-Suir which has close affinity to Waterford.  I was born there and I can assure Deputy Kyne that there is not a town in Tipperary with a more Tipperary outlook than Carrick-on-Suir. If Carrick-on-Suir were to be included in Waterford there would be a far greater rumpus than there will be because of the transfer of the portion of Waterford which is being added to Tipperary.</P>
      <P>We did not wish early on that Waterford should be divided and it is not our fault if it is divided.  We introduced and passed a Bill in 1959, a Bill which gave to Waterford four Deputies as it gave to Tipperary, based on procedure over the past 40 years. The courts found against it and we were then faced with a different division. If the figures Deputy Kyne gave us here to-day were accepted, the ratio would have to be stepped up to 22,000 per Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Using Deputy Kyne's figures&mdash;take 3,000 from the South Tipperary population <Col N="1552" /> of 73,000 and we are left with 70,800.  From this figure, deduct the population of Carrick-on-Suir, 4,800, which the Deputy suggests should be added to Waterford and we are left with 66,000.  This will give a ratio of 22,000 per Deputy, South Tipperary being a three member constituency. Because the Bill is based on 20,000 per Deputy and as the court decided that there should not be a greater differential than 1,000 per Deputy, the whole Bill would have to be changed.</P>
    <P>My reasoning is: why should Tipperary not have equal rights with Waterford when the matter came to be decided?  If the Minister or the Government decided that Waterford was to be the county which would get four seats, I do not think we would have made the same fuss about it.  We would have accepted it, just as we accepted portion of the southern end of South Tipperary being tacked on to North Tipperary.  We realised it was necessary that that should be done.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Reading, I am quite happy that South Tipperary is to be a four-member constituency.  I think South Tipperary is entitled ordinarily to that recognition.  I cannot see that Waterford has any greater claim to it than South Tipperary.</P>

      <P>There were three Deputies in North Tipperary, four Deputies in South Tipperary and four Deputies in Waterford.  The Minister told us that when he was deciding on this matter, he would take the natural boundaries into consideration.  Deputy Kyne has given the figures: 43,156 for Waterford and 41,000 for South Tipperary. The obvious thing to do was to make South Tipperary a three-seat constituency and to add a little to Waterford, but no&mdash;the whole of the west of Waterford was taken holusbolus and pushed into South Tipperary because: &ldquo;very reluctantly we agreed that that portion should be taken from South Tipperary and tacked on to North Tipperary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Further on, in column 220 of the same Volume, Deputy Loughman said:</P>
      <P>It was essential that some votes from somewhere should be added to North Tipperary so that they would have three seats.  The decision was that that particular number of votes should come from South Tipperary. We were very reluctant to see votes taken from us because of the great support we got there.  It is not an easy thing to allow an area to go which we feel is an excellent one from our point of view.</P>
      <P>Mr. Norton: It is heartbreaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Loughman: The Minister decided that and we have to accept it.  We gave that to Waterford. <Col N="1555" /> Deputy Corish appeared to suggest that we attempted to gerrymander. </P>
    <P>In the name of heaven, what else is that but the most obvious gerrymandering that was ever known?  Without changing the boundaries of Waterford, it could have been made a four-seat constituency by adding a small number of voters to it.  Instead of that, Fianna Fáil carved up whole parishes, townlands and electoral areas in the west of Waterford, and put them right into South Tipperary.</P>

He says here in the House only five minutes ago that there is a terrible difference between the people in Carrick and Waterford and between the people of Tipperary and Waterford, but here, in column 221, he says: &ldquo;No matter how the Waterford constituency or the Tipperary constituency was divided, there could not be any gerrymandering, because the people are the same generally throughout the country.&rdquo;  I want to know where we are with him.</P>

      <P>It would be a very interesting thing.  This constituency of Waterford within the bounds of the county of Waterford had practically enough voters to justify its having four seats.  The remainder of the constituency of South Tipperary had not enough voters for four seats&mdash;it <Col N="1557" /> had a little over the three.  I am not going to elaborate on this too much, but the obvious thing for the Minister to have done was to have left Tipperary a three-seat constituency and add a small bit to Waterford.  Instead, he has carved off an enormous piece from County Waterford in order to make South Tipperary a four-seat constituency.</P>

      <P>I should like to intervene for a moment in connection with this dispute that has taken place between the representatives of Waterford and of South Tipperary.  It is quite evident that there is a good deal of dissatisfaction in both counties, if we are to judge by the statements by Deputies on both sides of the House.  I accept what has been said by them with regard to the dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>I have examined the map of the constituencies of Waterford and South Tipperary, and I am amazed at the fact that geographically these constituencies are very small in comparision with some in the west, for example, my own constituency of Roscommon, which now embraces portion of Leitrim and is a four-seat constituency, extending over 85 miles in length.  The Waterford constituency is only a fraction of that size.  The same applies to South Tipperary, so that there would be no great difficulty or hardship for any Waterford Deputy in travelling from Waterford into Tipperary and considering the needs of people there, or for Deputies from South Tipperary to extend their activities over to the coast of Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that there is a very sound case to be made for making a seven-seat constituency out of Waterford and South Tipperary.  One of the factors that persuades me to make that suggestion is the Minister's contribution on the last day when he pointed out, and rightly so, that he himself had taken steps to implement proportional representation in its fairest form, namely, by reducing the number of three-seat constituencies and increasing the number of four- and five-seat constituencies.  It is beyond contradiction that the fairest form or interpretation <Col N="1558" /> of proportional representation can be achieved where a constituency embraces a large number of Deputies. We had in this country a nine-seat constituency. I am not suggesting that on this occasion we should return to that, but the Minister has said that perhaps at a future date there will be a further reduction of three-seat constituencies and a consequent increase in the number of four- or five- or perhaps six-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be too much to suggest to him, taking him at his word, that he should on this occasion solve the difficulties that are facing him both in his own Party, I believe, and in the interests of the general public, by combining these two constituencies. That would give fair representation, and it would be up to the people themselves to decide whether the odd man will be from Waterford or from Tipperary.  It would be essentially a democratic decision made by the people of both areas, rather than one made by this House which is being opposed by the Deputies on behalf of their constituents.  I suggest to the Minister that as far as a democratic basis is concerned, there can be no objection in the world to making it a seven-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>If you were to make a seven-seat constituency in other parts of the country, it would be a most unwieldy affair.  In Roscommon, you would nearly need to bring in Sligo and Leitrim or perhaps part of Deputy Carty's constituency.  That would mean a tremendous distance to cover for any Deputy, and it would be very difficult for him to consult his constituents and have a knowledge of their requirements so as to be in a position to act quickly.  No such argument can be put forward with regard to Waterford and Tipperary.  It is a compact unit, or could be made into one, and it is not unreasonable to suggest that it should be made a seven-seat constituency. I strongly urge the Minister to make that alteration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker would certainly find a way out, but I doubt if that way out would receive a welcome from the Deputies from either <Col N="1559" /> Tipperary or Waterford.  Whether it did or not, the basis on which the Deputy makes his proposition now is not quite in accordance with the facts of the matter.  In the course of the debate the last day, Deputy Mulcahy said P.R. was being defeated because there were not larger constituencies, constituencies with a larger number of members.  To satisfy him I pointed out that, far from going in that direction, under these proposals we had gone in the other direction and had reduced the number of three-seat constituencies from 22 under the 1947 Act to the 17 proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I also suggested that that trend might continue in the future, but it is far from the truth to deduce from that statement that that represents my own belief.  I should like the House to be aware of the situation at this stage.  I disagree entirely with the suggestion of joining South Tipperary and Waterford to form one constituency.  If we take the country from Waterford city to the North-West extremity of South Tipperary up to the electoral division of Cappagh, we find that such a constituency would be as unwieldy as any of those complained about here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne and Deputy Lynch charged that gerrymandering was the motive behind this division of the constituencies. It has been said not only on the last Bill but also, I think, on this Bill, that one cannot indulge in gerrymandering in this part of the country, even if one were disposed to do so, because our people are not grouped politically in well-known entities in any part of the State.  Without that prerequisite, therefore, you could not possibly consider that gerrymandering could be carried out here with any degree of success.  I think that was accepted in the debate on the 1959 Bill but, if proof is needed, it comes from the Deputies who have made these charges.  During the course of his speech Deputy Kyne himself said that Fianna Fáil might lose a seat in Waterford.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows he is making a case based, first, on the groundless charge of gerrymandering and, secondly, on the suggestion that the breach of the county boundary between Waterford and South Tipperary is &ldquo;vandalism&rdquo;, as it was described at a protest meeting, and with which Deputy Kyne fully concurs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, I would almost agree with that resolution myself. Whether you add one seat to either Waterford or South Tipperary, the boundary will be mutilated in any case.  That is what the Deputies from Waterford should remember.  There is no other alternative.  We have all this sanctimonious talk about vandalism, but whether you make either Waterford or South Tipperary the four-seat constituency, the county boundaries as such must disappear under this Bill, whether we like it or not.  That is why I say I would almost go as far as those who refer to &ldquo;vandalism&rdquo; in this resolution, but we are required to <Col N="1561" /> do this by law whether we like it or not.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputies on the opposite side will admit that I, of all the people here, have gone to great lengths to indicate my own mind on these matters?  I do not believe in the breaking up of county boundaries, but the law is there and it must be done. We have no choice in the matter.  It has been no pleasure for me to have to listen to people talking in the terms I have heard here.  It has been no pleasure for me either to get up and defend what has been done, but the fact remains that the law is there and it must stand.  It rests on the interpretation given in the judgment of the High Court.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne, in his amendment and during his speech, and Deputy Lynch said that the division they advocated meant the addition to Waterford of only Carrick-on-Suir and Carrickbeg.  It means more than that. In fact, if we were to reverse the procedure, reduce South Tipperary to three seats and bring Waterford up to four, we would have to go in either one of two directions.  We would have to go either east of Clonmel or west of Clonmel.  We must leave Clonmel alone.  Clonmel as an entity is too big and it would be absolutely ridiculous to divide it.  Going either east or west of Clonmel, we would have to breach the county boundary of South Tipperary.  If we breached it to the east we would have to take in not only Carrick-on-Suir and Carrickbeg but we would have to take in an area that would run north-east as far as Mullinahone.</P>
      <P>If we went to the west of Clonmel we would have to take in an area of south and south-west Tipperary running within three or four miles of Tipperary town.  Have a look at what that looks like and see what choice we have in this matter and see whether all the arguments are in favour of the solution proposed by the Waterford Deputies rather than the proposals in this Bill. A number of Deputy Kyne's figures, although nearly correct, were not correct.</P>

      <P>They were not the actual figures.  Our figures diverge in a number of cases.  But I am not making the argument on the basis that the Deputy's figures are wrong and that mine are right.  He has made certain calculations and computations which gave him a basis of population that showed Waterford County to be of greater size in population than was the Tipperary South Riding area.  If he wants to go on figures, I am prepared to go with him on figures.</P>

      <P>Let us take the population as I found it in the 1947 census which is the pattern we naturally went back upon, after the High Court decision, to consider all these matters.  Let us take the county constituency of Waterford.  According to the last census, the total population in that constituency is 73,180.  For the Tipperary South Riding constituency we find that the figure of population in the last census is 73,718.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne set about dressing up his Waterford figure before he started making comparisons.  He added a bit of Kilkenny that came in by way of an expansion of the city boundary since the 1947 Act became law.  It came in in 1955.  In addition to that he says we knocked off a bit of South Tipperary and threw it into North Tipperary. By taking that from the South Tipperary figure in the 1947 Act and comparing it with the boosted figures in the Tipperary County constituency of 1947 plus a bit from County Kilkenny he then can show that the Waterford County constituency has a greater claim, if claim there be, to the additional seat than has South Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have a look at the 1947 boundary. Have a look at the 1946 census as <Col N="1563" /> applied to it and, using that yardstick, the argument is not all with Deputy Kyne as to why the seats should go on one side of the boundary or the other. I do not like the overall position. Many people in this House do not like it.  There is nothing we can really do about it at this present juncture. Whether or not the members on all sides of this House may see the wisdom of doing something positive about it in the future I do not know but I sincerely hope they will and that we can get a reasonable approach to this matter, an approach which was regarded as lawful until the matter came before the High Court&mdash;lawful all down through the years since the establishment of the State.  There was no niggling one way or the other as to a few hundred up or down when boundaries were to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The differentials we worked on from the extreme lowest to the extreme highest in the 1959 Act were very little different from the differentials that existed in 1947.  The differential we are now compelled to work within is far lower than any differential ever operated under any of the Acts since 1922.  I think that position will in time come, by common sense, to be rearranged and that circumstances will be brought about that will enable us to change the situation in which we now find ourselves.  Until then this is the situation in which we find ourselves. It is the situation in which future Ministers for Local Government and future members of this House will find themselves, increasingly, in Bills twelve years from now.  I have no doubt the problem will not ease: rather is it likely that it may become more acute.  Time will tell that.  If we are to maintain, as I think we should maintain in a common-sense sort of way, our natural administrative county or electoral area or other type of recognised clearly-defined boundaries we shall have to change something much more radically, something much more important than just a matter of changing part of the Schedule to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I feel the time will come when we <Col N="1564" /> shall do that.  Speaking for myself, I assure Deputies I shall be very glad to see that time come.  I sincerely believe that the manner in which we must now operate is not in the best interests of the community as a whole. It does not make for fair representation of all our people, no matter in what part of the country they may be. The sooner that can be changed the better I personally shall be pleased.</P>

      <P>The Minister surprises me.  He is most anxious for these changes.  Who stopped him? Some of us thought that in view of the decision of the High Court the Minister and the Taoiseach would move here for an amendment of the Constitution which would give them the power to make all the alterations they wished and about which the Minister speaks so seriously.  Why did they not do that?  Then they could have got over their problem of boundaries, and so on.  They made no attempt to do so.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us there was no gerrymandering.  He said it could not be done.  &ldquo;We could not get the true census of political opinion and thought.&rdquo;  Does he take us to be fools? Does the Minister not know that Fianna Fáil have the full report on the voting strength in every ballot box in the Twenty-six Counties since the Referendum which was held two years ago?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Parties in Opposition cannot know their political strength arising out of that position because all those people who voted against the wiping out of P.R. combined. That was a combination of political thought and support&mdash;supporters of Fine Gael, of Farmers, of Independents, and of Labour.  But all those who voted for the change, who answered the Whip to make it a single-seat constituency, for the benefit of Fianna Fáil, were supporters of that Party.  In every ballot box the position <Col N="1565" /> was known to the organisation of Fianna Fáil and it is now known to the Minister.  The result is that not alone in every electoral area is the position known but it was known when this Bill was being compiled and known last year when the illegal Bill was put before us.</P>
      <P>As I said here last year, Fianna Fáil then gerrymandered and are now gerrymandering but to a lesser extent. They are greatly limited by a decision of a High Court judge.  Now, Fianna Fáil say: &ldquo;We could not do any more. We are bound by the decision of the High Court.&rdquo;  Could they not say: &ldquo;We could not gerrymander any better because we were caught&rdquo;? The Minister tells us about the census figures of South Tipperary and Waterford. I do not know why we are getting these publications if they are not correct.  Apparently, the Minister now tells us that the publications Deputies receive are not correct.</P>
      <P>According to the publication I study, as well as Deputy Kyne and others, the 1956 figures show us clearly a higher population in Waterford than in South Tipperary for the basis of election for a Deputy and for the population itself.  If that is wrong, the Minister had better get on to somebody else.  I should much prefer to accept the figures as published in the 1956 census than to accept the word of the Minister here now.  He says we must go back to 1947.  He says that as they were caught and had to mend their hand, they must go back, not to the 1956 figures but to the 1947 figures.  They went back only to the 1959 figures until they were caught.</P>
      <P>The plain truth is, as we all know, that Waterford had a higher figure on census returns and the Minister now realises that he is in much the same position as that of a certain statesman who is apparently in protective custody, a gentleman named Tshombe, making a plea for tolerance, as it were, on the part of those who were in opposition and pointing out how helpless he was and that he could do nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now know what the Minister did.  He had no alternative.  He was <Col N="1566" /> surrounded on all sides, bewitched, bothered and bewildered by all the trouble brought upon him by the people who said, as quoted by a Deputy a little while ago, they could not do any more about it after consultation. There is no justification for slashing away one-third of a county from the rest of the county.  Even accepting the Minister's statement that he had no alternative but to go over the natural boundary, that did not give him the right to give to a minority&mdash; the constituency of South Tipperary&mdash; the right of taking one-third of a county from the majority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Loughman says he knows some people down there.  I am sure he has been down there already.  The only trouble the Minister may have is that the people will get to know Deputy Loughman.  This is a glaring case of injustice and just as bad as was done to Cork last year.  Even with the support of Deputy Loughman, the Minister can give no fact to justify slashing Waterford for the benefit of Tipperary.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said in favour of Deputy McQuillan's suggestion. What surprised me was how clearly Deputy Loughman pointed out that there was no animosity between the people of Tipperary and Waterford.  If that is so, and if the people of Waterford think so much of Deputy Loughman and if the people of Tipperary think so much of the Waterford Deputies, there is nothing wrong with making it a seven-seat constituency of South Tipperary and Waterford. There might then be some hope for the people of West Waterford who will otherwise be depending&mdash;quite likely &mdash;on a Fianna Fáil Deputy from Tipperary to represent one-third of the county in the Dáil.  The Minister hit this point without meaning to do so because not only will that be the situation for the next couple of years but it may be the situation for 12 years&mdash; the people being represented by a man far removed from them and far away from their local authorities.</P>
    <P>I certainly support Deputy Kyne's amendment.  There is nothing to be <Col N="1567" /> said for the Minister's proposal which is supported so solidly by Deputy Loughman.  If the Minister fails to see reason for accepting Deputy Kyne's suggestion on a political basis, the only real alternative is Deputy McQuillan's proposal of a seven-seat constituency for South Tipperary and Waterford.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister assure me that he did not discuss and decide on the allocation of seats with members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are members of this House in this House two weeks before the House was officially informed of the decision? I challenge the Minister to deny that. It is true because I received&mdash;as no doubt did other members of all Parties &mdash;information two or three weeks before ever the Bill was printed.  We knew exactly where the twists and turns were because the Bill was examined at Party level in this House, with a view to the advantages to be secured by Fianna Fáil.  I also say to the Minister that at one stage prior to publication of the Bill the urban area of Carrick, including Carrickbeg, was proposed for inclusion in Waterford, and Waterford was to have four seats. These facts are well known, no matter how the Minister protests or attempts to fool the public.  He cannot fool the ordinary Deputies who know what I am saying to be exactly the truth.</P>

      <P>If what the Minister says is correct, this Bill is not aimed at eliminating opposition in Waterford. <Col N="1568" /> Does anybody think it is natural for Deputies of any Party not to resent or protest against the loss of a seat in their constituency when it proportionately lessens their chances of being returned to the House?  Is it not strange that neither of the two Fianna Fáil Deputies from Waterford have protested publicly or privately or in the House in connection with the reduction of one seat in their constituency? What is the logical inference? It is either Party discipline&mdash;that you must subordinate your county interest and your personal interests to the overall interests of the Party&mdash;or they themselves believe the change has certain advantages.  I am not accusing them of either motive.  I can only draw my own conclusions from their silence but if they felt, as I do, that this was a worsening of the status of Waterford city and county, it would be their duty to stand up as I am doing and speak their minds in this House.</P>
      <P>I had no hope that this amendment would be accepted.  I am not talking to get the Minister to change his mind&mdash;I knew that was impossible from the day the Bill was printed&mdash; but I am talking through this House to the people of Waterford and I hope my words will be read and considered and that the effect will be that this measure will boomerang on the Minister and that in his efforts to save Deputy Loughman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1569" /> The Minister immediately slapped down Deputy McQuillan's proposal.  If Waterford were made a seven-seat constituency, I can assure the House Labour would win two seats.  There is no need to worry too much about the distance which is not much more than 60 miles from end to end.  Deputy McQuillan's area is about 90 miles.  But that would not worry us too much.  On behalf of the Labour group in Waterford, I can assure the House we would be quite willing to contest the election on the old constituency boundary. That will not be accepted, I know. There will be no compromise.  The Minister tries to tell me that it is not possible to gerrymander because the areas are not built up in groups.  How, in the name of goodness, is it possible then to build an area in the north with an all-Protestant group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister know that it is Deputy Ormonde who will suffer most as a result of taking in this particular portion?  The Minister is counting on the fact that there was half a quota over and above two quotas and so Fianna Fáil can afford to lose 2,000 votes.  It is just too stupid to expect me not to notice the gerrymandering.</P>

      <P>If the Minister will read his speech on last Thursday, he will see that he said he hoped to do as little violation as possible to natural boundaries.  Surely he does not contend that drawing a line from Carrick down to Templemichael, across the whole of the county, is an insignificant mutilation? In reply to a question, the Minister told me that the population of Waterford was 74,031, according to the 1956 census.  Does the Minister now say that figure is wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a misunderstanding. The 1955 extension of the boundary of the city of Waterford was prior to the 1956 census.  The 1956 census, therefore, included that part <Col N="1570" /> of Kilkenny known as Rockingham, which is now brought into Waterford. Therefore, in the reply given, the figure would be 74,000 odd, whereas the figure I have quoted is 73,000 odd.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the reply given in volume 181 of the Official Report, the Minister gave the figure of 74,031 for Waterford and 73,718 for South Tipperary. Does the Minister now say that is incorrect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe the Minister thought he was doing us a favour.  He says the figure was 74,031 under the Act that was declared invalid.  Under the same Act, the figure for South Tipperary was 73,718.  That gives 318 more votes in Waterford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>More voters.  Why does the Minister say Waterford had to lose a seat when Waterford had 318 more potential voters than the adjoining constituency? What was the reason other than to get Deputy Loughman in? Will the Minister tell me the reason in one sentence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not guarantee to do that.  It might be too difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are approximately 2,000 more potential voters in Waterford than in South Tipperary.  Yet the Minister says he was compelled by law to reduce the number of seats in Waterford and to leave South Tipperary as it is.  It is an extraordinary <Col N="1571" /> position.  South Tipperary has not a shadow of the claim Waterford has. Outside of Dublin city and county, Waterford is the next highest area in the whole of the Twenty-six Counties. It is higher than Cork, Dún Laoghaire, Limerick or anywhere else.  The figures can be examined.  They have been issued by the Central Statistics Office.  I know I am correct in the arguments I am advancing here.  This is gerrymandering of the cheapest, lowest and dirtiest kind ever carried out under any electoral measure.  I resist it here in the House and will continue to do so elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I know that by pressure of votes the Minister can impose his will in this matter, but he can never claim that he had justice on his side because he has not given a single fact to repudiate the case I made beyond his ridiculous statement that taking away Carrick-on-Suir would violate the boundary.  I challenge the Minister as to where the suggestions I made would in any way violate the High Court ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard for quite a long time, nor do I hope to hear again for quite a long while, such a befuddled, muddled calculation as was adduced here by Deputy Kyne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister always gets personal when he is beaten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been more personal in this matter than I could ever be.  I do not want to descend to his level in this matter.  In so far as answers to the questions I have been able to interpret as being asked by the Deputy are concerned, putting Carrick-on-Suir and Carrickbeg into Waterford would bring in 4,700 population which would be deducted from the total number of the population of South Tipperary leaving approximately 69,000 population for three seats.  Deducting from that figure again 2,900-odd would bring you down to 66,000.  What the Deputy does not seem to realise is that allowing Waterford to get away with that addition of 4,700 would bring us to the position of having in South Tipperary a higher <Col N="1572" /> ratio than any other constituency in the country and would bring us beyond the total aggregate in differential that has been laid down by the High Court ruling and in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne could not see that if numbers were brought in from South Tipperary to Waterford sufficient to bring down the ratio in South Tipperary, Waterford would then be greater than the highest elsewhere in the country.  Otherwise it would mean that on the eastern side of South Tipperary you must go northwards as far as Mullinahone, because if you went on the other side of Clonmel you must go north and north-westwards to within a few miles of Tipperary town in order to get the numbers brought into Waterford sufficient to keep both South Tipperary and Waterford within the requirements of the Constitution.  Those are the reasons, but they would not occur to the Deputy.  He is not very much concerned about giving the whole picture. The Deputy quoted figures.  The figures I will quote for him are taken from the Census of Population for 1956 in Table V which gives the population in each constituency.  According to the figures, South Tipperary's population was 73,718 and that of Waterford was 73,107.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point stressed was the number of electors in each constituency. So far as the document I have got to bring before the Dáil is concerned, the number of electors do not matter a damn.  It is the population that matters and I have given the figures so any argument the Deputy has based on the number of electors is a flat-footed one.  I have no discretion in the matter of asking myself how many electors there are in either constituency, much as I might feel inclined to do so.  It is the population figure only that must be considered.  If the Deputy thought that I was ignoring the figures of electors, I can tell him that there are discrepancies like those he has pointed to in any two constituencies one might wish to compare. However, I cannot officially be aware of that nor is there any point in my being so aware because they do not count and have no bearing on the delineation <Col N="1573" /> of the boundaries.  That is the answer to the Deputy's figures and the Deputy can check those figures if he feels so inclined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has now given us the answer as to where he got his figures.  The Minister need not be worried that I do not accept those figures.  I can produce in this House the figures I secured in reply to a Parliamentary Question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that by taking in Carrick-on-Suir we would leave such a balance of population in South Tipperary that it would be the highest in the country.  Could the Minister say whether it would be higher than Dublin is now?  Would the Minister say whether, if I tabled a motion involving a minor alteration of boundaries in South Tipperary, leaving the required number in South Tipperary for three seats, he would accept it on Report Stage?</P>

No matter how he twists figures, he cannot ignore the extension of the borough boundary and the increased population that meant to Waterford. According to the Minister himself, Waterford has 339 people more than South Tipperary.  All the Minister is doing is steamrolling this provision through the House to save his colleague, Deputy Loughman.  Is it not permitted to have a vote on each amendment?

If that is the purpose of his question, the reply is: the district electoral divisions of Ballybeg, Kilrush, Kiltealy, Moyacomb, Newtownbarry, Rossard, St. Mary's and Tombrack.  These give a total of 4,652, which is being added to the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency, so reducing the population in the constituency, as we now know it, of Wexford county, from 87,259 to 82,600 and losing one seat&mdash;in other words, four seats to the 82,600&mdash;and also bringing up the other constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny by an amount in population required to justify its retaining the five seats it has had.</P>

We did not do it to bring Carlow-Kilkenny up because, as the Deputy has said, dividing the number of seats into 98,838 would have brought us within the terms of the judgment but, within the same High Court judgement, 87,259 in Wexford could not be justified for five seats and could not be justified for four seats because it was too big and the average would be too great.  So that, we had to take it from Wexford and, as it so happened, it was possible to accommodate that excess of Wexford in the adjoining constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.</P>

      <P>The position is that there were sufficient votes in Carlow-Kilkenny for five seats, but there were too many votes in Wexford for four seats.  Am I right in that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would not mind telling me how many votes too many there were in Wexford to comply with the judgment of the High Court&mdash;the actual figure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The judge did not lay down a definite figure which I could multiply by four or five and say it was the absolute maximum which could justify four or five seats.  There is no doubt, however, that the division of 87,259 by four gives a higher ratio <Col N="1579" /> than the highest ratio in any other constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister has not answered my question. My contention is that Carlow-Kilkenny had a sufficient population to get five seats and the Minister tells me Wexford has too great a population. I want to know by how much our population was too large that votes had to be taken out of it.  It is a simple question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be a very simple man and simple in his approach, but it is not a simple question. We have got ourselves out on a limb discussing this one aspect, the High Court judgment.  It is in the application of what the High Court said that we have been making arguments and asking ourselves questions. That Wexford has in this instance more than could justify four seats and that Carlow-Kilkenny can be said to have sufficient to justify five seats is a relative matter.  Another aspect that must be considered is the overall spread, the overall differential between the lowest ratio in any constituency and the highest ratio in any constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what is the highest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The highest is 20,916 and it is in the light of the highest and lowest ratios that we must work out the pattern to conform with the High Court judgment.  The Deputy's question is not as simple as it at first appears.  One cannot say exactly by how much Wexford would exceed the number that would justify four or five seats but it is quite true to say that something had to be taken out of Wexford.  It is too big.  Its average would be boosted higher than that in any other constituency thus creating a greater differential than would be in conformity with the judgment in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that something had to be taken from Wexford but I am <Col N="1580" /> not convinced that it was necessary to take out what it is proposed to take out.  If he looks at the map, he will find that the new constituency of Wexford has been wedged into considerably by the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.  Eight electoral districts have been taken out of Wexford. I contend that the Minister would still have been within the Constitution and within the ruling of the High Court, if he had taken out six.  I do not think there is any justification for going right into the middle of the county.</P>
      <P>There is one district there from Tombrack to within two miles of the central point of North Wexford.  The townland of Ballybeg also goes right into the centre of the county.  If the Minister takes out Kilrush, Kiltealy, Moyacomb, Newtownbarry, Rossard, and St. Mary's and leaves in Ballybeg and Tombrack as part of the Wexford constituency, as they are entitled to be, will he still not have the correct population?  It would leave Wexford a more normal constituency than it is now.  Anybody who looks at the map can see that the new division is ludicrous. Would the Minister agree to look into that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In any division that could have been made, it is possible to say that perhaps we could do without the ten people of this town-land or the 101 people in that half street, but this is the way to look at this question: we add the population of Carlow-Kilkenny and Wexford together and divide that by the total number of seats.  You must then see how this relates to the terms of the court's judgment.  It will be found that the additions and subtractions we have made result in the ratios in the two constituencies being nearer to the national average than otherwise could be achieved.  We are nearer to the national average by adding those eight townlands than we would be if we added those six.  If I were asked why it was decided to include these eight instead of the six, I would say the reason I have given was the basis for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the Minister is penalising Wexford <Col N="1581" /> unnecessarily.  All he has to do is to get his ratio in relation to five seats in Carlow-Kilkenny and in relation to four seats in Wexford.  Can he not tell me, with his advisers beside him, whether he would not still have the ratio right in Carlow and in Wexford, if he left the townlands of Ballybeg and Tombrack where they rightly belong in County Wexford?  Surely the Minister can answer that simple question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that any Deputy who has a special case winds up by making an argument in favour of the constituency he represents in order that he can say to his constituents: &ldquo;I did my best; you cannot blame me.&rdquo;  Whatever is done, he hopes they will remain charitably disposed towards him for fighting so hard for them in this House.  I am uncharitable enough to think that is prompting Deputy Esmonde's contribution in this matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister is the Minister for Local Government responsible for this Bill.  I am discussing, as I am entitled to discuss, the constituency I represent.</P>
      <P>I submit that I am entitled to an answer to a simple question.  The Minister has his advisers.  A Cheann Comhairle, I appeal to you, as you have just taken the Chair.  The Minister for Local Government is responsible for this Bill.  I am a Deputy for Wexford.  I have submitted a simple question to the Minister.  According to the Bill, he is taking eight electoral divisions from my constituency and putting them into Carlow-Kilkenny.  I have asked him will he not equate the position in Carlow-Kilkenny which has five seats and likewise equate it in Wexford which now has four seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to use any nasty terms like gerrymandering or political expediency, which I could easily use, because, as the Minister says, I am a simple fellow.  I accept that I am a simple fellow, and I do not like to say those things.  I have asked a perfectly straightforward and reasonable question. <Col N="1582" /> The Minister has his advisers beside him and could give me the answer.  He has more or less suggested that I am being obstructive.  He is the Minister, who is paid to do that job.  I suggest that he should show me ordinary courtesy and answer my question.  If he says he does not know the answer but that he will consider it before Report Stage, I shall be satisfied.  I do not like to be insulted in this House.  The Minister has not the right to insult me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy was as concerned as he now appears to be, he would have put down an amendment to give effect to what he is now saying. Instead, at the winding up of this Committee Stage, he has asked a question, the answer to which he apparently knows.  Since he knows it and it is so convincing to him, why did he not put down an amendment dealing with these couple of divisions in Wexford about which he is so perturbed?  I have already tried to answer the Deputy.  I will consider what he has said, and if I can make any further sense from it, I will try to give him the fullest satisfaction on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The figures for the adjoining constituencies of Carlow-Kilkenny and Wexford, as proposed in the Bill, are in accord, and more so than they would be if the Deputy had his way with regard to excluding these other two divisions from the eight I have included in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency. The figures are better in both constituencies than they would be if the Deputy had his way and had them changed.  As I say, over and above that, despite the fact that I believe that, and put it to the House that that is so, for what it is worth, I will consider the matter the Deputy has put before me.</P>

Am I to understand that on Report Stage he will give me the population figures for the electoral divisions? I know the voting figures already, but I have been unable to get the population figures.  The whole <Col N="1583" /> basis of the Bill rests not on the voting figures but on the population figures. I should be obliged if the Minister would give them to me on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has his own difficulties with relation to his feelings on handling a measure of this type.  He cannot satisfy everybody but in Carlow-Kilkenny, on the one hand, and in Wexford, on the other, he is imposing an unnecessary refinement based entirely on an arithmetical situation.  In order to work in that arithmetical refinement, he has outraged the feelings of a certain number of people.  From the arithmetical point of view, or the legal point of view, he is unnecessarily forcing a certain number of the population to vote for Carlow-Kilkenny Deputies rather than Wexford Deputies.</P>
      <P>As I say, it is entirely a matter of arithmetical refinement and the position is that the arithmetical rearrangement has not as great an effect as the Minister expects on the population figures, looking at the realities of the thing in relation to the actual electoral figures.  I pointed out that the figure given by the Minister some time ago in relation to portion of North Tipperary as the estimated electorate of that area was 1,531 and that the actual number of Dáil voters is 1,459. In view of the fact that a fall like that in the figures is probably hidden in the new electoral register, the arithmetical necessity is not as great as the Minister may feel it is.</P>
      <P>On this question of a purely arithmetical refinement, the feelings of a certain number of the population are being outraged.  They are being put in the position of voting for Carlow-Kilkenny Deputies rather than Deputies from the county to which they naturally belong.</P>

      <P>I know it is too late, but I should like to make the suggestion for the Minister's consideration that the eight electoral divisions <Col N="1584" /> should be left in the constituency of Wexford.  Even with four Deputies, we would far prefer to represent the whole county rather than part of the county.  I feel that those concerned in the eight electoral divisions would also prefer that.  I realise that I am probably asking for the impossible in that.  The electoral divisions of Kiltealy and Rossard have been ceded to Carlow-Kilkenny.  Rossard, for instance, includes portion of the parish of Ballindaggin and goes within four or five miles of the town of Enniscorthy.  I feel sure that Deputy Esmonde will agree that the town of Enniscorthy is in the heart of Wexford, if it is possible for any town to be there.  So far as we in Wexford are concerned, we know there is nowhere to place the blame.  There is no question about that, but we will never forgive Fine Gael for butchering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I intend to try to meet some of the objections the Minister raised to the method of dividing up these constituencies so as to give a <i>pro rata</i> number in accordance with the High <Col N="1585" /> Court judge's decision, both to South Tipperary and to Waterford.  It will be necessary for me to secure a copy of the Dáil Report of to-day to have the statistics which the Minister gave and to check the various details, and it would be impossible for an ordinary Deputy without the assistance the Minister has from his officials to put forward an amendment within the few days that would be left.  I would suggest that, in fairness and to give those of us who are interested in it an opportunity, it should be at least two weeks from to-day or from yesterday, whichever the Minister would prefer.  I think that is essential.</P>

      <P>With regard to the figures which the Deputy says he must get from the Dáil Reports, it will take him three or four days to get the figures there.  They are fully available in the Census of Population for 1956, which is available in the Library for any Deputy who wants to see it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but there seems to be a conflict between the figures I have and what the Minister stated.  There is also a question of checking in the urban area of Carrick and the local registers there and in the city of Waterford, the number of people who came in in the extensions, and the various dates of the extensions of the boundary, to see if there are differences, because there are apparently differences between the figures I tried to arrive at honestly and the Minister's figures.  I would say that that checking could not be done. I will be confined to this House till 12 o'clock to-morrow and would not have an opportunity of doing anything until Friday at the earliest. It will entail a visit to Carrick and to Waterford and possibly looking up the Census of 1956 and various other things, as well as examining the speech of the Minister.  That will not be available until to-morrow in typescript form and can only be got through the courtesy of the speaker who made it.  It is not unfair to request time because it is not easy for an ordinary Deputy to get his information without assistance.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to reform the law as to civil liability and the long title of the Bill so indicates.  Three important branches of private law are dealt with.  Firstly, it is proposed to consolidate and amend the law with regard to the survival of causes of action on death.  Secondly, the law as to what the Bill calls &ldquo;concurrent fault&rdquo; is being amended and codified. Thirdly, the existing statutory law as to fatal accidents is being re-enacted in the light of the earlier provisions of the Bill.  As the Bill is accompanied by a long and comprehensive Explanatory Memorandum, I do not propose to go into detail on the various sections and shall confine myself to a general elaboration of the principles involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part II of the Bill is concerned with the rule that a personal action dies with the person.  This rule is a rule of the common law.  It finds no place in Scots law.  The legal maxim <i>actio personalis moritur cum persona</i> is a very old one and its exact meaning is far from certain.  It is inaccurate in that there are many personal actions such as actions in contract, by reason of the common law itself, and actions for wrongs to specific personal property, because of statute, that do not die with the person.  Indeed, the existing rule has been said to be one that has been made at all tolerable for a civilised country only by a series of exceptions.  At present the special sphere of the rule is the law of tort and it applies on the death of either party to claims for unliquidated damages for personal injuries, fraudulent misrepresentations, defamation and trespass to goods or land.  The <Col N="1589" /> rule has no application in cases coming within the Fatal Injuries Act, 1956. The dependants of a deceased person killed by the negligence of another have, since Lord Campbell's Act of 1846, been able to recover damages in respect of the financial loss caused to each of them by the death.  The range of dependants was enlarged by the 1956 Act to include brothers and sisters, adopted and illegitimate children and also persons in the relationship of <i>in loco parentis.</i></P>
    <P>Sections 6 to 10 of the Bill will allow for the survival of causes of action vested in or subsisting against a deceased person and the Schedule lists for repeal a number of enactments dealing with the matter and dating back to 1285.  Certain causes of action which are regarded as purely personal, such as breach of promise and defamation, are being excepted.  In these actions the presence of the plaintiff or the defendant may be of the greatest importance.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (2) of the Bill will prevent the recovery for the benefit of a deceased person's estate of damages for pain or suffering or personal injury or loss or diminution of expectation of life or happiness.  Damages of this type are recoverable in England and in the North under legislation enacted in England in 1934 and followed in Belfast in 1937.  It appears that the Law Revision Committee whose report was responsible for the 1934 Act were not alive to the fact that the implementation of their recommendations would have had any such result.  In fact some members of the Committee expressed dismay at the development that occurred.</P>
    <P>What can in fairness, be described as chaos followed the legislation in England until finally an attempt was made to clarify the law in a decision of the British House of Lords in 1941. This was the case of <i>Benham v. Gambling</i> referred to at paragraph 10 of the Explanatory Memorandum.  The result was to restrict considerably damages for loss of expectation of life or happiness.</P>
    <P>The English law as laid down in <Col N="1590" /> 1941 may be summed up under five heads.  Firstly, whether in the case of child or an adult, very moderate figures must be chosen.  Secondly, the sum awarded is not to be determined by applying a statistical or actuarial test as to the number of days or years of life of which the individual has been deprived.  Thirdly, the test is objective and not subjective.  Fourthly, the appropriate figure should be reduced in the case of a very young child.  Fifthly, the social position of the deceased, his prospects of worldly possessions and the financial losses or gains that he might have expected are to be excluded.  These rules make for a large amount of impossibility and unreality.  &ldquo;In putting a money value on the prospective balance of happiness in years that the deceased might otherwise have lived, the jury or judge in fact is,&rdquo; said Lord Simon in <i>Benham's Case</i>&ldquo;attempting to equate incommensurables&rdquo;.  It seems that &ldquo;the thing to be valued is not the prospect of length of days, but the prospect of a predominantly happy life&rdquo;.  In the same case, Lord Simon made the following statement in reference to the social and financial position of the deceased: &ldquo;Lawyers and judges may here join hands with the moralists and philosophers and declare that the degree of happiness to be attained by a human being does not depend on wealth or status.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Benham v. Gambling</i> has been subjected to strong criticism in England, and it has been called &ldquo;the most notable example of judicial legislation in recent years.&rdquo;  Though the underlying motive may have been to prevent the award of substantial damages to the executors of a deceased person for injuries suffered when he was alive, the decision ought logically apply to cases where the injured person survives. However, in the case of a living plaintiff, the difficulty can presumably be overcome by awarding large damages under the head of pain and suffering. The result will still be that it may often be cheaper to kill a man than to main him, but the real solution of this must be to allow for sufficient damages to be awarded to those who suffer loss by the death.  The dependants <Col N="1591" /> and not the estate are the people who are injured by the death.  Where the deceased has willed his property to a stranger there is no strong case for allowing the stranger to obtain, in addition, damages for loss of expectation of life.  It should be noted that funeral expenses may be recovered under subsection (4) of Section 7.</P>
    <P>The whole problem is a difficult one, especially when one considers that the person who has lost his expectation of life or happiness is dead and that damages are being awarded not to him but to his personal representative on behalf of his estate.  In the Bill of the English 1934 Act damages for pain and suffering were excluded, but the relevant provision was omitted in the House of Lords at the private suggestion of Lord Wright who was a member of the Law Revision Committee. Why this was done is not clear nor why, once it was done, exemplary damages were retained.</P>
    <P>Be all this as it may, we had to take a decision one way or another.  The Government, having carefully considered the various aspects, were satisfied that it would be better to exclude damages for pain and suffering and loss of expectation of life.  Though speculation as to what figure can properly be placed subjectively&mdash;or objectively&mdash;on the shortened expectation of life and the prospective happiness of a deceased person may be very interesting in theory, we are of opinion that it should in practice be avoided and that our Courts should not be asked in particular cases to do the impossible.  If our Courts were to follow the English decision, the amount to be awarded must be small.  It has been said in England that the maximum figure should be £500.  Generally it would seem that the loss of a measure of prospective happiness has been substituted for the shortening of life; and in a case in 1952 a low award was made where the deceased was living apart from his wife who, as a Catholic, would not divorce him.  In a case in 1950, £5,249 was awarded to the dependants under the Fatal Accidents Acts and £1 under the 1934 Act.  These <Col N="1592" /> cases show the absurdities that emerged. In assessing damages under the Fatal Accidents Acts, account must be taken of any damages payable under the 1954 Act to the dependants as beneficiaries in the estate.  Similarly, the Court that is assessing damages under the Act of 1934 must take into account the fact that damages under the Fatal Accidents Act have been or may be given.  Although the two claims are independent and may accrue for the benefit of different persons, nevertheless, if the provision for the dependants is made good under the Fatal Accidents Acts, the loss consequent on the shortening of life is to be deemed to be <i>pro tanto</i> reduced.  There can be no duplication of damages.  In England, it is better to claim under the Fatal Accidents Acts because the damages recoverable under the 1934 Law Reform Act are subject to death duties and also subject to the claims of creditors.  Before I leave this subject and the peculiarities of awards under the 1934 Act, let me quote from the conclusion of an article, with the title: &ldquo;Is life a Boon?&rdquo;, that appeared in the <i>Law Quarterly Review</i> in 1941.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is clear,&rdquo; wrote Sir Carleton Allen, &ldquo;that we need another statute and it is to be hoped that it will not, in the ingenious and diverting manner of so many of our statutes, produce exactly the opposite effect of that which was intended.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with concurrent fault and embraces the liability of concurrent wrongdoers, contribution between concurrent wrongdoers and contributory negligence.  It is proposed not alone to amend the existing law but also to declare it in statutory form.  This represents, as the Explanatory Memorandum points out, the first attempt at codification in the realm of tort in any of the common-law jurisdictions.  Part III follows the measure suggested by Dr. Glanville Williams of the University of Cambridge in his <i>Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence</i> published in London in 1951.  As Dr. Williams himself mentions, his proposals are based on a study of the law in Britain, Canada and this country and also on the work <Col N="1593" /> of the United States authority, Professor Gregory, whose <i>Legislative Loss Distribution in Negligence Actions</i> was published in Chicago in 1936.  Lawyers and students will be familiar with Dr. Williams's work, which is constantly referred to in the leading textbooks on the law of torts and which was cited with approval by counsel in the High Court case of <i>Moloney v. Llewellyn</i> decided last year and mentioned at paragraph 25 of the Explanatory Memorandum.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 to 33 provide for the liability of concurrent wrongdoers and also for contribution between such wrongdoers.  The sections will replace the Tortfeasors Act, 1951, which has been found unsatisfactory in practice, and also the common law.  &ldquo;Wrongdoers&rdquo; will include persons who commit an ordinary civil wrong (tortfeasors), persons who commit a breach of trust and persons who commit a breach of contract.  By reason of Section 12, a concurrent wrongdoer will, as in general under existing law, be liable for the whole damage except where the plaintiff is guilty of contributory negligence or in the case of proprietary damage resulting from a collision at sea.  Concurrent wrongdoers will be liable to have judgment issued against them together or separately and special provision is being made for cases of insolvency in Section 14.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 27 will enable a concurrent wrongdoer who is sued by an injured party to recover contribution from a fellow-wrongdoer, as under the 1951 Act; but he must make his claim for contribution in the same action.  This is not possible under the Tortfeasors Act, 1951, where all the wrongdoers are not sued together.  This was the case in <i>Lee v. Dublin Corporation</i>, decided by the Supreme Court a few years ago and reported in the 1956 Irish Reports.  The proposals in the Bill are designed to avoid as far as possible multiplicity of actions in respect of the same set of facts and to ensure that, except in unusual cases, all matters of liability, whether between the injured party and a wrongdoer or between the wrongdoer <Col N="1594" /> and fellow-wrongdoers, will be heard and determined in the one action.</P>
    <P>Sections 34 to 42 are concerned with contributory negligence.  The main provision is that contained in Section 34 (1).  It is proposed to provide that in every case of negligence, where both the plaintiff and the defendant are at fault, each party will pay for his own share in the responsibility for the damage.  Under existing law, a plaintiff fails in a negligence action if he has himself been guilty of contributory negligence, unless he can prove &ldquo;last opportunity&rdquo; of the defendant. Apportionment for common fault was introduced in the Continental legal systems during the last century.  It also prevailed in maritime cases, the original Admiralty rule being equal division of loss.  In the common law jurisdictions for causes of actions arising on land, the first step was taken in Canada in 1924.  As a result of a recommendation of the Law Revision Committee in 1939, the British Parliament enacted the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act, 1945.  This legislation was followed in New Zealand and Western Australia by legislation passed in 1947 and in Belfast by legislation passed in 1948.  In South Africa an Apportionment of Damages Act was enacted in 1956.</P>
    <P>Apportionment legislation has met with almost universal approval.  There has, however, been in certain jurisdictions a movement away from the notion of common fault towards that of absolute liability in the case of motor accidents.  In French law, liability for such accidents is strict and the presumption of responsibility is rebuttable only on proof of what is known as <i>force majeure</i> or <i>cas fortuit</i>, or some outside cause not imputable to the defendant. The <i>Cour de Cassation</i> or final French Court of Appeal has held that where two motorists collide, each party must pay for the damage done to the other car and its driver and passengers.  This is the opposite of the idea that once a dangerous thing is moved by a human agency, and becomes dangerous only when so moved, the damage is caused by the human being and not by the thing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> The French concept of applying to car accidents what we know as the rule in <i>Rylands v. Fletcher</i> may appear illogical, unless it is understood that, insurance against third-party risks being much commoner than insurance of oneself and one's own car, the whole of the loss is far more likely to fall on insurance companies than if any other solution had been adopted.  The practical result of collisions between motor cars is very much the same with us.  As Deputies will be aware, where two insurance companies are involved they apply the &ldquo;knock-for-knock&rdquo; arrangement, under which each company shoulders the loss suffered by the party it has insured.  Though in France each company bears the loss of the party it has not insured&mdash;in other words, the other way round&mdash;the end result as far as insurance companies are concerned is the same, because what a company loses on the swings in some cases it gains on the round-abouts in others.</P>
    <P>In Quebec and Ontario, there is a presumption of responsibility in every car accident where one part is a motorist and the other is not; and the onus of disproving negligence is upon the owner or driver.  In Saskatchewan, there is a state insurance scheme and compensation is paid from a central fund irrespective of the driver's fault.  All owners and drivers contribute to the fund by paying premiums.  This goes much further than the French system or our &ldquo;knock-for-knock&rdquo; system in that it operates whether or not each party is a motorist. The first Saskatchewan legislation was passed in 1946 following the report of an inter-departmental committee. The idea of extending to car accidents what is the principle of workmen's compensation had been propounded in New York in 1932 by the Columbia University Committee on Compensation for Automobile Accidents.</P>
    <P>So much for the comparative aspect of the negligence problem.  Let me now give an example of what apportionment of responsibility as proposed in Section 34 of the Bill will mean in <Col N="1596" /> practice.  Two motorists A and B are involved in an accident through the negligence of each, so that A suffers damage to the extent of £500 and B to the extent of £100.  It is held that A's responsibility amounts to four-fifths of the total responsibility and B's to one-fifth; that is to say, the proportion of responsibility is 4/1. A will recover from B one-fifth of his damages or £100 and B will recover from A four-fifths of his damages or £80.  Thus, on balance B will owe A £20.  A will suffer his original damage (£500) less £20, or £480, and B will suffer his original damage (£100) plus £20, or £120.  This is a fair and reasonable approach and accords with distributive justice.</P>
    <P>Though there is no need for a last opportunity rule in a system of apportionment, it is not quite clear whether and to what extent the rule has survived the 1945 Act in England. Moreover, something approaching very close to &ldquo;last opportunity&rdquo; has been introduced into Admiralty cases. As a Canadian authority points out the appellate courts in England, after the Judicature Act of 1873 had allowed appeals from the Admiralty Division of the High Court, &ldquo;failed to realise that last clear chance was fashioned to alleviate the harshness of another common-law rule unknown to Admiralty.&rdquo;  This was the common-law rule of &ldquo;all or nothing.&rdquo;  I was rather surprised to discover that &ldquo;last opportunity&rdquo; has even crept into French law to some extent and a case decided by the <i>Cour de Cassation</i> in 1928 has been referred to as the French <i>Davies v. Mann.</i>  I do not propose to go into the complexities of &ldquo;last opportunity&rdquo; which, I am afraid even the most skilled lawyers find difficult fully to comprehend and expound. Suffice for me to point out that, in order to avoid any doubt in the matter, it is proposed in <i>section</i> 34 (2) (b) specifically to abolish the rule in its particular applications.  This will obviate the confusion which has arisen in England by differing statements of judges as to the effect of the 1945 Act.  In addition, we are following the precedent set by South Africa in <Col N="1597" /> her Apportionment of Damages Act, 1956, of which I have already spoken.</P>
    <P>Sections 43 to 49 of the Bill contain general provisions dealing with the law of concurrent fault.  The principal section is Section 47, which covers collisions at sea.  The section proposes to re-enact, subject to certain desirable amendments, the existing law as contained in the Maritime Conventions Act, 1911.  That Act replaced the old Admiralty rule and was designed to implement the Brussels Convention of 1910.  This it did not fully do, and the omission is being remedied in Section 47.</P>
    <P>Parts IV and VI of the Bill propose to re-enact the Fatal Injuries Act, 1956, and to amend Section 18 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936.  Part V makes certain changes in the Workmen's Compensation Acts, 1934 and 1953.  These changes are purely consequential and are being made solely to keep the relevant provisions of these Acts in line with the amendment of the law of contributory negligence proposed in Section 34 (1).</P>
    <P>I trust that the Explanatory Memorandum has been of assistance to Deputies in studying the proposals in this Bill.  This is in very many respects a technical and difficult Bill and, for that reason, it was decided to accompany it with a longer and more detailed commentary than is usually called for in the case of Bills that come before the House.  As I said earlier and as the Memorandum explains, Part III of the Bill is based on the measure suggested by Dr. Glanville Williams, at present in the University of Cambridge and formerly Quain Professor of Juris-prudence in the University of London. Dr. Williams at an early stage was kind enough to offer us every help.  He was as good as his word; and I should like to express to him our thanks for his invaluable assistance and for his readiness at all times to place at our disposal the results of his scholarship and research not alone in regard to concurrent fault with which his book, <i>Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence</i>, is concerned but also in regard to problems that we had to consider <Col N="1598" /> in connection with the survival of causes of action on death.  We are extremely grateful to him.</P>
    <P>Copies of the Bill and of the Explanatory Memorandum have been forwarded to the members of the Judiciary, to the Bar Council, to the Council of the Incorporated Law Society and to the law schools of the Universities.  I need hardly say that we will welcome any suggestion that will lead to the Bill's improvement so that we will ultimately have the best possible measure.  We are here concerned with a wide range of legal issues that are of importance not only for the lawyer but also for the community in general.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This long-delayed Bill is very welcome.  I should like to express my appreciation of the memorandum the Department produced in connection with it.  It has gone into the matter not merely in great detail but in rather confusing detail.  I hope it is a confusion that will be cleared up on longer reading.</P>
      <P>I should also like to thank the Department for the statement the Parliamentary Secretary has read.  It is becoming a habit for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries simply to read whatever the Department provide for them rather than to speak on the matter themselves.  I suppose I may take it as coming from the same hands as those which produced the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The Bill has some strange features. Part I is Preliminary and General.  In greater part, it is taken from the draft statute which is to be found at the back of Dr. Glanville Williams's book <i>Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence.</i> I think a few extra definitions are included because there is more to be covered in this than is contained in the draft Bill in the textbook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the Bill deals with survival of certain causes of action on death.  I notice in the statement, speaking on a rather minor point, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the case, which is also mentioned in page 3 of the White Paper, of <i>Benham v. Gambling</i> and to the difficulty of <Col N="1599" /> putting any monetary equivalent on loss or diminution of expectation of life or happiness.  One of the judges in that case said it was difficult to ascertain the loss or measure of prospective happiness.  They decided that social position was a loss to be considered when the matter was being determined.  Why so much time should have been spent, I do not know, seeing one section of the Bill says that is not to be one of the matters which survives. Part II, which allows certain actions vested in a deceased person to survive, says nevertheless that the damages recoverable for the benefit of the estate from that person shall not include exemplary damages, or damages for pain and suffering or personal injury but what the historical references to <i>Benham v. Gambling</i> are meant to convey, I do not know.  In the paragraph in which the reference to <i>Benham v. Gambling</i> is in the White Paper on page 3, the statement was made that although subsection (4) of Section 7 proposes that there are rights to be given&mdash;and the reference is that although subsection (4) proposes that the rights conferred by the section are to be in addition to the rights conferred on the dependants of the deceased&mdash;I am leaving out the air companies and so on&mdash;two sets of damages will not be recoverable in a death case.  That then is followed by this amazing expression:</P>
    <P>The intention is that in assessing damages under the Act of 1936 or under Part IV, the Courts will take account of damages which may be or have been awarded under Section 7. </P>
    <P>There is a reference to an English case &mdash;I think a House of Lords case&mdash;of 1942.  That is not a decision which is binding in our courts, although it might be followed, but if the view expressed in the memorandum is, as I read it, that it is the intention which has been given effect to in <i>Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ltd.</i> that is, so to speak, good enough.  I just want to point out that mere expression of intention, without the matter being guaranteed by phrases in the <Col N="1600" /> legislation, may not have the same decision as was given by the court in the <i>Davies v. Powell Duffryn</i> case.  For the moment, I pass over the important part of this legislation which is Part III.</P>
    <P>Part IV in the White Paper refers to the Fatal Injuries Act and that has been simply repealed and then embodied again in this legislation.  Why that has been done, I do not know.  It may be that it was thought it would make for convenience to have everything under the same statute; if that is a point of view, it can be given due weight, but the other Act has not been found wanting.  There may be some difficulty with regard to the commencement of the Act.  That is referred to in one of the earlier sections of the legislation we are discussing, Section 4, and, I think, a saving clause in Section 5.  Except for mere padding purposes, I do not know why the Fatal Injuries Act had to be repealed and then brought back in full form as Part IV. Parts V and VI are necessary.  There are certain minor amendments to be made in the Workmen's Compensation Acts and in the Air Navigation and Transport Acts.  The first is to allow that diminished damages may find their place in the alternative remedies for workmen and the second matter is to put a fatal air accident on the same footing as an ordinary fatal accident.</P>
    <P>With regard to the remainder, I notice the White Paper says that Part III follows a measure suggested by Dr. Glanville Williams in his <i>Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence.</i>  It is rather a mild way of expressing what has happened.  In this book, the professor, in Chapter 22, sets out a suggested codifying and amending measure.  That starts on page 498 of the book and goes on for many pages after that.  I think I am right in saying that the whole of Part III is taken word for word from Professor Glanville Williams' book.  I am wrong in saying &ldquo;word for word,&rdquo; because he had a habit of saying &ldquo;provided that&rdquo; here and there and the draftsman has put in the word &ldquo;but&rdquo; seven times, I think, instead of using &ldquo;provided that&rdquo;. There is no significant change&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Col N="1601" />

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might speak so that he may be heard.  If there is some significant change, I do do not know what it is. We have not heard it and we shall wait to find out what it is.  As I read through the suggested codifying amending measure, I suggest that section by section, subsection by subsection, and proviso by proviso the codifying statute is followed.  I do not say that is any fault; it may be very good, but it does raise this question: if we take holus-bolus a suggested draft statute put into the end of a textbook and embody it in permanent legislation, does it mean the framework of that cannot be disturbed by amendments that might be considered more appropriate to Irish conditions than what is in this measure?  I suggest there is complete copying of this.</P>
      <P>I heard the Parliamentary Secretary read an acknowledgment to Professor Glanville Williams for his aid in this matter and undoubtedly there has been tremendous aid from him.  As far as my observation goes, starting on page 7 where Part III starts, that is the important bulk and I say that literally the provisions of section after section are all taken from this draft statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I want to express my appreciation of the White Paper that has been produced.  It does give one a certain amount of sign-posting to what was otherwise a very difficult matter to grasp and those who prepared the White Paper are definitely to be com-mended. There is a reference, however, to a case decided in our High Courts, that is, <i>Moloney v. Llewellyn.</i>  I should say that the greatest measure of appreciation for this whole measure will concentrate on Section 34, the apportionment of liability in a case of contributory negligence, a provision that practitioners have desired for a long time.  It is something that members of this Party tried to put into legislation some years ago.  It is a great thing to have it there, even though, because of the number of sections in this, it seems to be rather <Col N="1602" /> hidden.  The important section is Section 34.  That is where liability in cases of contributory negligence has to be apportioned.</P>
    <P>It is rather peculiar that the memorandum should have picked out for reference the case of <i>Moloney v. Llewellyn</i> referred to in the Irish Law Times Reports, 1960&mdash;the case was in the year 1959.  In that case, the judge who decided the case said that the court must face the &ldquo;almost impossible task of assessing the respective degrees of negligence and having to express that result in mathematical terms.&rdquo;  Then he bent himself to the consideration of the respective degrees of negligence as between the parties and in the end he made some distribution&mdash;I think eighty per cent., on the one hand, and twenty per cent. on the other&mdash;and asked himself the question: &ldquo;Could this not just as well have been seventy-five per cent. and twenty-five per cent?&rdquo; as it could easily have been.  His comment in the end was: &ldquo;The task is an impossible one to carry out perfectly.&rdquo;  Whether the emphasis is on the word &ldquo;perfectly&rdquo; or not, I cannot say, but it will be appreciated and accepted that what has been embodied in Section 34 is that if there is a jury sitting, the jury, or if it is a judge, the judge himself, will have to face what in that case was called &ldquo;the impossible task&rdquo; of assessing the respective measure of damages and putting them in mathematical terms.</P>
    <P>When I got this very lengthy piece of legislation, I began to search it fortuitously to find out whether or not two matters about which I have talked for three years in succession on the Estimate for the Department of Justice had been adverted to and whether any changes had been made. I thought the appropriate place where these might find their place was in Section 45, which deals with the abolition of certain defences.  The two defences that are abolished are:</P>
    <P>(1)  It shall not be a defence in an action of tort merely to show that the plantiff is in breach of the civil or criminal law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1603" /> (2)  It shall not be a defence in an action for breach of statutory duty merely to show that the defendant delegated the performance of the duty to the plaintiff. </P>
    <P>The two matters, I think, that require attention are the legal situation as it has developed over a number of years where a highway authority interferes with a highway and that interference causes an accident; that accident refers to the negligent doing of the work, or misfeasance.  There is right of action.  The highway authority is protected if it does not do anything and if the accident results because of a natural depression due to the passage of time in the highway.  As long as the highway authority, so to speak, steers clear, nonfeasance on the part of the authority can stand as a defence. I should have thought that in these modern times we would abolish that. I should imagine that if the courts were consulted, it would be found that the vast majority of practitioners think it a most inequitable defence to have to meet.  I have myself heard views expressed by members of the judiciary.  They have no liking of that particular defence, either.</P>
    <P>The second matter is one which I shall bring more immediately to the attention of the House by way of amendments on Committee Stage.  It is a matter which has been the subject of discussion in legal circles and indeed anywhere that legal men gather. They cannot understand why, with all our Republican ideas, we still hang on to the defence of the Crown; the Crown can do no wrong.  That association with our institutions started with Carroll and the Minister for Justice and developed to the point that one cannot sue out successfully a cause of action against a member of the Government.  Why that should have persisted for so long is something I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>I know there was considerable inertia on the part of some Government Departments because they were afraid that, if they were not allowed to shelter behind the old Crown privilege, many actions would be taken successfully <Col N="1604" /> against Departments of State.  Whether that might mean great expense to be met on the part of the State, I do not know, but that was the objection for quite a number of years.  It prevailed when efforts were made to have the doctrine of common employment abolished. It was asserted then on behalf of certain State Departments that, if that doctrine disappeared, its disappearance would mean a succession of actions in which the State had previously been successful, for example an action against the Minister for Finance in relation to a mechanically-propelled vehicle.  This was secured beforehand by the doctrine of common employment and that security would be lost, if the doctrine were abolished. In a search over five or seven years a single case has not come to light in which a group, otherwise liable, had hidden behind that doctrine successfully. That objection has, therefore, disappeared.  The same objection has been made in relation to the getting rid of Crown privilege, but that has been done in England.  In fact, I do not know of any country which still maintains that old protection, a protection to which we still hold on.</P>
    <P>This is, in the main, a Bill for Committee.  It is in Committee that Part III can be attended to most satisfactorily. The memorandum certainly signposts the way to a great many of these sections but it is not wholly clear at times.  That is not the fault of those who prepared the White Paper. It is because the matter is confused. Even between lawyers there is no definite agreement.  The Bill is welcome, the more so because it has been so long delayed.  I am still doubtful of the wisdom of taking an important section of an important Bill from what is a textbook reference and drafting a piece of legislation on it.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this Bill is a matter of great personal gratification to me and I should like at the outset to congratulate those responsible for the drafting of the Bill and for the accompanying White Paper.  I know from personal knowledge that there has gone into the preparation and drafting of this Bill a <Col N="1605" /> great deal of hard work, research, legal erudition and industry of a very high calibre.  People should appreciate that they have in the service of the State officers who are competent to produce a Bill of this kind.  These people have, in fact, produced other Bills of a law reform character which are the admiration of older and more experienced States than we are and which have a longer legal tradition and a more extensive legal knowledge.  I think some of our measures have been copied in other countries.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of great personal satisfaction to know that the modernisation of our legal code is coming to fruition.  Legislation of this character brings about some measure of standardisation and certainty in this particularly difficult legal domain.  The Parliamentary Secretary is entitled to his share of the credit in pressing forward in this sphere.  I tried for many years to have law reform measures introduced, but without success.  The opportunity presented itself to me at a certain period and we did some little work then in connection with law reform. We at least got it going and I think we are entitled to say now that the efforts we made have helped to bring about the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good Bill and one that should bring great benefit to both the legal profession and the public at large.  We, who practice in the courts, know the extraordinary difficulties with which litigants are faced in any branch of the law of negligence at the moment, particularly in relation to concurrent wrongs and contributory negligence.  Legal decisions on contributory negligence, on the way in which negligence actions ought to be conducted before a judge and jury, the considerations juries should be presented with by a judge, the questions that should be asked, have all been the subject of a number of legal decisions and it would take more than mere human intelligence to reconcile them or know precisely what they mean.  I think I am entitled to say that we are now in a position in which it is almost impossible for a judge or a practising barrister to know precisely <Col N="1606" /> how to conduct a case, how to charge a jury, how to frame the questions the jury must answer.</P>
    <P>This Bill will put an end to that very difficult position.  The greatest contribution, as Deputy McGilligan has said, is in Section 34 of Chapter III in relation to the apportionment of liability in a case of contributory negligence.  I should like to add to that the final pooling of the third question, or the question that we lawyers know as the third question.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary philosophy among legal luminaries, both here and in England, who are pirouetting not on a legal pinpoint but on a series of philosophical pinpoints.  It is a matter of satisfaction that there will be no longer any question of this contributory negligence bringing unnecessary complications into simple facts, which tend to hide the truth of a fact instead of simplifying it.  Judges should always be able to ask a jury a straightforward question.  There was a decision in the Supreme Court within the past fortnight on this very point&mdash;the position as regards compensation and the abolition of the third question.  It is desirable that the matter of the abolition of liability in the question of contributory negligence and nonfeasance would be simplified, so that it would be easy to ascertain what was the degree of negligence and what the dependants should get.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to a case decided some years ago and the difficulty which arose about doing just that.  Judges and juries had real difficulties. It may have been difficult for a judge sitting without a jury, just philosophising without being able to bring in the commonsense of the jury to bear on the case.  The protection of injured plaintiffs in my view, after a lifetime of experience in these matters, depends upon referring the jury simply to the issue of the question of liability. If they are simply directed, juries will have no difficulty in determining where the liability lies and in assessing damages accordingly.  Juries can be relied upon to bring their commonsense, their knowledge of the world and <Col N="1607" /> their view of the facts to bear in each case and to assess damages accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of what I regard as a difficult topic and which was brought into consideration in connection with this Bill&mdash;whether there should be allowable in this country as in England damages for loss of expectation of life.  There is a lot to be said for the giving of such damages, a lot to be said against it. Go back into the history of the law and consider the question in connection with judges who, in 1941, threw up their hands in horror at the difficulties attached to the assessing of damages for loss of expectation of life.  Then go back to the common law where it mattered nothing to the dependants if a man lost his life.  That was the common law laid down by judges and it was the same mentality which was responsible for creating and framing the rule on loss of expectation of life which efforts were made to remedy by Lord Campbell's Act and later by the Fatal Accident Act.  It is a matter that might be considered again now.</P>
    <P>My view, on balance, is that the Parliamentary Secretary's attitude is correct but I think it is worth considering again.  There is one part of this matter which does require very serious examination.  The Parliamentary Secretary did refer to the question of dependency and the damages for dependency.  In my view that is a part of these problems that requires very much more consideration than it has been given.  During my time in office we introduced a Fatal Accident Act and I recall having long consideration with very learned officials of the Attorney General's office to see if it were possible to achieve some rule other than actuarial calculation, which exists at the moment, for giving damages to dependants of persons who die as a result of negligence.</P>
    <P>I have seen in the course of these actuarial calculations and rules of thumb grave injustices done.  Say a man dies as a result of the negligence of a driver of a motor car.  He leaves a widow and a number of children. You can solemnly go to the courts to prove your case, but on an actuarial <Col N="1608" /> basis, as to what the widow and each of the children lost as a result of the death of the breadwinner.  You get an actuarially produced sum as to the value of the joint lives of the husband and the wife including a calculation of the amount lost by the widow as a result of the husband's death.  That is an unreal way of calculation in cases like this but it is the only way that is possible at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court says you must have actuarial calculation and, by having it, you ignore completely the fact that you cannot work out in such terms what the loss of a husband means to a wife and what the loss of a father means to a child in money's worth.  I would suggest there should be some further consideration of the matter of dependency compensation with a view to seeing if there is not some method that could be achieved other than rule of thumb and actuarial calculation.  I have had the case of a man earning £7 a week, aged about 40, with a wife between 32 and 36 and several young children.  The man was killed.  Through actuarially calculated compensation the youngest child got £200.  Is it not absurd to say that when a man dies leaving a widow and several children, the youngest child gets only £200?</P>
    <P>I confess that during my term of office, though I did everything I could, within the limits of my capacity and in the time at my disposal, to try to find another method and the then Attorney-General produced for me a summary which was put into the draft of the Bill, I had to drop it because I thought there would be so much litigation over it that it would not be practicable or workable.  I would advocate that, in assessing dependency compensation, no account should be taken of the assets left by the man who was killed.  It used to be that even insurance policies were not taken into account until statute law amended that.</P>
    <P>We put into that Bill a provision that widows' and orphans' pensions should not be taken into account.  I do not think it is proper that when a man dies leaving some assets and that <Col N="1609" /> when his death was caused by the negligence of a defendant, the deceased's assets should be deducted from the compensation payable to that man's dependants, to his widow and children.  That is one obvious revision that could be brought in and which I regret I did not bring in when on the other side of the House.  It is a matter which can very readily be explored even more thoroughly than the question of the loss of expectation of life.</P>
    <P>A section to which I think the Minister should give very much more consideration than has been done already&mdash;I am not saying that by way of criticism because I believe very great consideration has been given to every section of this Bill&mdash;is section 35, a very technical section dealing with identification in determining contributory negligence.  There is a bad principle involved in that section and it is contrary to what Williams suggested in his book.  The matter could be very usefully given further consideration. It is a matter for Committee of course but I want to draw attention to it.</P>
    <P>There are two other sections, sections 22 and 29, which might be considered, and probably will be considered in Committee, in their relationship to each other.  I shall not go into the matter in detail now. Suffice it to say the point that emerges, and which is not clear and may cause some little injustice, is where two people are sued for neglect and one of them settles with the ptaintiff.  Then, if you take an ordinary case of an employee suing his employer for neglect in regard say to a system of work, or some other neglect, he is entitled to Workman's Compensation.  The insurance company, who are the real defendants, work this out.  In the former it is possible, or even probable, that there will be a decree and they will settle for a certain amount of compensation giving, say, £1,000 in order to get rid of the case.  When the case comes to be determined as between the other defendant, having regard to the provisions of these two sections, it is not quite clear whether the second defendant can say to the <Col N="1610" /> first defendant: &ldquo;you have settled, but I am bound by the provisions of these sections.&rdquo;  Then they make the case that the person who settled was not liable, but the plaintiff is entitled to make the case that he ought to have got a better settlement having regard to the fact that the second defendant was liable.  It is a question that might be looked into between this and the Committee stage.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters to which I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  This might be an appropriate stage of the Bill, if it is at all possible to bring it within its scope, to put right something which I feel is a grave injustice to people under 21 years of age.  Deputies may not be aware of the fact that if a person who has suffered damage through the negligence of a defendant and brings an action the defendant can lodge money in court and if the plaintiff does not take that out he has to pay all the costs and will probably get very little as a result of it all and perhaps get nothing at all.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in young people under the age of 21. Those of us who practise in court, appearing for infant plaintiffs, as they are called, or minors, who suffer damages, are in a very serious difficulty in settling a case for that child or in deciding a grave issue as to whether the child will take the money lodged in court or not.  It is a grave responsibility for any solicitor or counsel where a child is involved.  Not only have you to make a decision to take it out but you have to have the ruling of the judge that it was proper to take it out.  It has happened that counsel advised the taking of the money and the judge thought it was not enough: the trial went on and the infant got less than the amount lodged in the court and had to pay all the costs.  I suggest that this is an opportunity to remedy that position.  I have tried to get the rule-making authority or somebody to do it and I have been speaking about it for a long time.  At least in the case of an infant, there should be discretion vested in the judge where the money is not taken out of court <Col N="1611" /> not to make the infant pay the costs. That is a reasonable request and a reasonable reform.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which should be considered&mdash;the question of injury to an unborn person.  There is doubt as to the law in reference to that.  The mother is travelling in a motor car, receives injuries and the child is injured as a result of negligence. There is doubt whether that person can recover damages and that ought to be cleared up.  These points are just on the bare outline of the case. I should like if possible in this or in some other Bill soon, to deal with the reforms that Deputy McGilligan mentioned in regard to the nonfeasance or misfeasance in the case of local authorities.  If they do nothing there is no remedy but if they do something negligently damages can be got against them.</P>
    <P>Before finishing I shall repeat what I said before that it is a matter of great personal gratification to me that this Bill has been introduced.  It will be of great benefit to the public and I hope it will be of great benefit to the legal profession.  It ought to take away a lot of those unnecessary complexities that have crept in over the years, particularly since the advent of the motor car.  As I said before, this Bill shows evidence of great industry and great legal erudition and it is a credit to those who are responsible for bringing it in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to what has been said about this Bill in welcoming it. I suppose I can claim, in a small and very limited way, to have encouraged the introduction of this Bill in one respect, because of the fact that I was associated with the introduction of two Private Members Bills which bore the same title as this Bill.  The first Civil Liability Bill was introduced by Deputy Costello, Deputy McGilligan and myself and some other Deputies back in 1952.  At this stage I think it worth recalling that the then Minister for Justice on the Second Reading of the Bill said that if we withdrew our Bill he would take steps immediately to <Col N="1612" /> introduce a Government measure to deal with the matter.  Well, in that spirit expressed by the Minister, the Bill was withdrawn and unfortunately, so far as the Bill was concerned, the Government then got into some political difficulties and the House in which the Minister spoke as a Minister was dissolved.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, after the general election of 1954, I and other members of the then Government continued to express an interest in the idea of some modification&mdash;not, indeed, as extensive as is proposed here&mdash;of the law relating to civil liability.  It is true to say that it was the particular personal interest in this subject of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, and the then Attorney General, Deputy McGilligan, that made it possible for the research that has obviously gone into this Bill to receive the necessary encouragement.</P>
      <P>It is not possible in this House to mention either in praise or in criticism persons outside the House but everybody knows that encouraged by the interest of Deputy Costello and Deputy McGilligan, one civil servant did a tremendous amount of work in research and in thinking in relation to this measure and we all should express our appreciation of what was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, and to that extent I suppose I and perhaps Deputy Costello may have to say <i>peccavi</i>, we did not introduce this measure in the period of the previous Government, although it was the intention of the then Government to have it in the legislative programme for 1957.  As these things will happen, in 1957, the then Government ran into some political difficulty and the Dáil found itself dissolved and this Dáil came into being.  When this Dáil was elected, I reintroduced a Bill called the Civil Liability Bill&mdash;I think it was in 1957 or 1958&mdash;and again I received Ministerial assurance at the time, when the present Minister, on behalf of the Government, proposed that even leave to introduce should not be granted to my measure, for the reason that a Government measure was ready and would be introduced forthwith.  I asked: &ldquo;What does that mean?  Does it mean that we will have it at least during the present session?&rdquo;  That was <Col N="1613" /> almost four years ago and in the past four years, from time to time, when the opportunity presented itself, not having the right to reintroduce in the present session of the House a similar Private Member's Bill, all I could do as a private Deputy was to continue to enquire when this Bill would, in fact, be brought before us.</P>
    <P>We know that this measure was, in fact, introduced on 13th July, 1960. That is almost 12 months ago.  May I express the hope that the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister&mdash; whoever has had to fight to have this Second Reading introduced&mdash;will continue to display evidence of interest in the subject of law reform?</P>
    <P>It certainly is a very regrettable thing that in this Parliament, in the year 1961, some 40 years after the State was established, we are only starting to do things in relation to law reform that were done by the British Parliament years ago.  In so far as it applies to the defence of contributory negligence, this measure of necessary law reform was introduced and passed in the British Parliament in the middle of the last war.  Although in the middle `40's, the British people were facing problems and difficulties of a very definite character, they had all the time in operation, as I have said many times in this House, a Law Reform Committee which enabled the British Parliament&mdash;the evidence is in the British statutes now&mdash;to introduce and pass a whole series of worthwhile reforms of the common law.  One of them, of course, was the modification of the defence of contributory negligence which was carried out in England by a statute passed away back in 1945.  In the `40's, chiefly due to the imagination and genius of Sir David Maxwell Fyffe, who was Home Secretary, they were able to go ahead, although they had other engagements, with the unglamorous but very essential work of keeping the set of conventions which we call our law, which govern and control the duties and obligations of one citizen to another, up to date and in accord with the changes of the times.  We have done no such thing.</P>
    <P>This measure here is one of the few <Col N="1614" /> measures of law reform that have entered this House.  I am glad to say that some were introduced in the previous Dáil and probably the first measures of law reform were introduced under the first inter-Party Government.  At least, the trend which was created in the last decade has grown a little bit, I am glad to see, and in this measure it has taken a very definite form.</P>
    <P>I should like very sincerely to join in the tribute paid by Deputy Costello to the silent service, to those whom we may not criticise or praise in this House and who have undoubtedly in the back rooms contributed to a very worthwhile measure.  We will have to discuss details of it later, but I believe this Bill, in its form and in what it sets out to do, will be a remarkably fine statute of civil law reform.  The Parliamentary Secretary has referred to the help given by Dr. Glanville Williams.  While I am sure that help was welcome and was certainly beneficial, nevertheless, were it not for the fact that there were available here a number of people to benefit from that, perhaps this measure might not see the form it has today.</P>
    <P>Having said that in praise of the Bill, there are one or two things I should like to say in criticism and I hope my criticism will be taken as being constructive criticism.  When I saw the size of this Bill, when I read the White Paper, I hoped that under a Bill to be styled the Civil Liability Bill, in due course to be an Act, we would try to do the entire job in relation to civil liability.  I regret to say that under this Bill there are a few anomalies which continue to exist. Deputy Costello has referred to some of them.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to only one in particular, that is, that under this Bill there is still to be preserved in this country something which is foreign, or which should be foreign, to our view of the law, that is, the maxim that the King can do no wrong.  Under this Bill the common law principle that you may not sue for tort a Department of State, the Government or the State itself, continues to be preserved. It does not apply in England. <Col N="1615" /> Some years ago&mdash;I cannot remember the name of the statute but I think it was passed in 1946&mdash;the British Parliament decided that it was absurd that a subject who was injured by the tortious conduct or act of any servant of the Crown should be deprived of the right he would have if the person who did him down was not a Crown servant.  There is available to a British subject the right to sue in any British court to recover damages for any tortious act that may be done by a servant of the Crown.</P>
    <P>That cannot be done here.  I want to give Deputies an example.  It may be an imaginary one and perhaps it may not be.  One can imagine a number of employees of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs going out to erect a telegraph pole on an extremely wet and windy day.  They dig the hole and put in the pole.  They fail to put cement or some other material around it to keep the pole steady and they pad it with clay.  Where they erect this pole happens to be some 18 or 20 yards from a corner.  One can imagine that sometime later if the rain and wind continue the pole to which the telegraph wires have been attached starts to bend and shortly afterwards comes somebody riding a motor bicycle and that person is guillotined by the wires of the telegraph pole.</P>
    <P>In such a set of circumstances under our law at the moment&mdash;and it is not changed by this Bill&mdash;if that person's dependants brought an action the defence, to which there is no answer, would be that no action lies against the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. Presumably some <i>ex-gratia</i> payment might be made with the authorisation of the Minister for Finance and that would be an end to the matter.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that under this Bill an effort has not been made to look at our common law and to take into consideration the change in the times with a view to abolishing this principle of the non-liability of the State for neglect or tortious acts.  Under the law as it is in relation to the responsibility of the State, even the Attorney General or the Government <Col N="1616" /> itself would have no power to issue a fiat or to give permission for a common law action to be taken once the matter relates to a civil wrong.  There is provision, as perhaps Deputies are aware, in relation to breach of contract or certain property rights and matters of that kind to permit an action to be taken against a Minister of State but that does not apply and has no reference to civil wrongs.  It is my opinion that the long title of the Bill&mdash;the Chair will eventually rule on this&mdash; would permit of an amendment on Committee Stage which might cure that omission and deal with the difficulty. Perhaps that will be done later.</P>
    <P>This is a technical Bill which refers to matters of detail of law and I do not think it can be discussed in any great detail on Second Reading.  A useful discussion might develop on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I do not know whether there has been consideration given to the Committee Stage but this Bill is pre-eminently one that should be referred to a Select Committee of the House.  That Select Committee might be charged by the House &mdash;I know that notice might be necessary but that could be waived&mdash;with considering in detail the provisions of the Bill, perhaps interviewing and receiving representations as a committee from various bodies, professions outside the House, so that between all of us a useful measure might emerge.</P>
    <P>As I read the Standing Orders&mdash;I have not read them very carefully&mdash; if a Special Committee of the House were appointed the difficulty would be that the Special Committee itself would not have power to receive oral or other representations or evidence from outside bodies, while a Select Committee, if empowered by the House, could do so.  This is pre-eminently a measure which should be sent to a Select Committee having power, if it thinks wise to do so, to interview the Bar of Ireland, the solicitors' profession or the representatives of insurance companies and other persons and bodies who are interested in this measure, and being in a position to entertain and receive their views.  While perhaps it is not in place for me to make any suggestion, I feel that, in relation to a committee, <Col N="1617" /> a Select Committee would be preferable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope very sincerely that this is just one of many measures that I am sure the Minister's Department recognise as being necessary to bring our law more in accordance with the facts of Irish life. We have been inclined in a silly way, from time to time&mdash;I am not referring in that connection to recent measures &mdash;to sneer at lawyers in this country. The practitioners in our courts, no matter who they may be or how they practise, can operate and practise the law only as it is.  The law in this country is the common law, which came into operation here under Poynings Law away back around the year twelve hundred, and it applied to Ireland the then common law of England. We lawyers, if I may use that phrase, have always protested that the common law, which we are expected to operate, is not in accordance with the needs and requirements of this country.  Lawyers cannot change the law.  The only body and the only authority that has the power to change the law is this House. Certainly the records will show that from these benches over the years, when the Estimate for the Department of Justice was being discussed each year, appeals were made for a measure of the kind which has now been introduced. I should like to feel that there will be other measures of this kind, because certainly their introduction will be worthwhile.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a matter of order.  The House will be already aware that the business ordered by the Government for to-day did not include item No. 6.  This matter came to my notice while Deputy O'Higgins was speaking and I did not want to interrupt him.  This is the first opportunity I have of raising it.  Notwithstanding the fact that item No. 6 was not ordered for to-day, it was taken.  I accept, of course, that it was a mistake.  I am not suggesting that it was done deliberately in any shape or form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1618" /> I am perfectly aware that under Standing Order 115 (2) a Money Resolution can be taken at any time, but I submit that the normal practice is that it is always taken after Second Reading and before Committee Stage. That is the normal practice.  The important thing is, I think, that business should not be taken without being ordered, because if that is done, adequate consideration of business in the House completely fails.  I think that, a mistake having been made, the proper thing to do is to order that the Money Resolution be discharged and put down in the appropriate way after Second Reading has been put through.</P>
    <P>I have not got the typescript of what exactly took place at the time, but I understand that the Money Resolution was called and that the Parliamentary Secretary was asked, through the Chair, to move it.  It then became apparent that a Money Resolution cannot be moved by anyone but a Minister.  That is one of the Standing Orders of the House and, on that basis, a Money Resolution having been called, of course a Minister had to come in and move it.  The calling of the Money Resolution was an error.</P>
    <P>When we find a patent error, the only thing we can do is resolve it.  I suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that the proper resolution of this error is to discharge the order made and put the Money Resolution down again&mdash;if you like for to-morrow morning&mdash;and do it in the proper way.  If we take business that has not been ordered, the whole orderly procedure of the Dáil must fall to the ground.</P>

      <P>I do not want to offer any criticism of the Chair, but it is the standard practice of the Chair that if something is being taken that has not been ordered, the Chair asks leave of the House to take it.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the introduction of this Bill. I feel that there may still be some misconceptions in the minds of some people in view of one remark by Deputy Costello who pointed out that, in his view, this Bill would be of benefit not only to members of the lay public but also to the legal profession. Possibly he did not quite adequately stress the fact that benefit to the legal profession would come much more from clarification of the law rather than any financial advantage which <Col N="1621" /> may result to them.  In actual fact, the legal profession would make much more money, if the law remained in its present uncertain condition, so that in no circumstances should the Bill be regarded as a lawyer's Bill which will benefit them financially in any way.</P>
      <P>I think, too, that this is not a Bill on which either side should reprimand the other on the question of delay.  Certainly Governments from different Parties had up to now failed to produce this Bill.  The Bill is really in the hands of experts.  I could well understand that as the experts proceeded through this very difficult sphere of an analysis of the whole question of civil liability, they must constantly have been finding one other point, and two other points, which needed further elucidation.</P>
      <P>I can well imagine that those who drafted this Bill must themselves be far from satisfied with its scope as it now stands.  It is a difficult matter to discipline oneself and say: &ldquo;I have gone as far as I propose to go at the moment.  We will let it stand and let further amendments be taken under another Bill at a later stage.&rdquo;  That has had to be done.  In general, the amount of amendment and clarification is very considerable.  In particular, the whole question of the survival of causes of action after death is one which certainly was crying out for attention.  I welcome this because great injustice has been caused through causes of action ceasing on the death of one or other of the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad that Deputy Costello dealt very fully with the question of the basis for assessing damages especially in cases of dependency.  I have long felt that this question of damages is one which calls for substantial clarification because, as long as the amount of damage is a matter purely in the hands of a jury, the danger of an injustice is very great indeed.  Anyone who has sat on a jury in a running-down action where damages are claimed will know that the final decision as to the amount of damages which will be awarded when <Col N="1622" /> liability has been established is purely a matter of averaging out between the various members of the jury.  To allow the assessment of damages to rest with the jury is basically unsound.  The only justification for the jury is to get a layman's opinion as to where the liability should properly rest, but the calculation of damages is not a matter for 12 ordinary men.</P>
    <P>There is too much danger of prejudice, of gross irresponsibility, and cases have arisen, and are arising almost every day, where one member of a jury will say that in his opinion £10,000 would be adequate whereas another will put the damages at 5/-. With such excesses on one side or the other, it is almost impossible to reach a just solution.  I would hope, therefore, that at some stage we might consider some better basis for the calculation of damages altogether.  I agree with Deputy Costello that a purely actuarial calculation is very often unsound, but, at the same time, if we could get some standardisation we would be doing a very good day's work and, apart from anything else, we might be able to avoid the awarding of excessive damages which inevitably results in increases in premiums on insurance policies.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the possibility of adopting the British procedure of the formation of a law reform committee.  That also is something which is very close to my heart, but, unfortunately, with our comparatively small numbers it is very difficult to form the number of committees which this House should have, and it is regrettable that even with the small number of committees at present in existence there is a high proportion of members on each committee who are on the others as well.  We find it difficult enough to form committees of this House.  Despite these difficulties there is very much to be said for having some standing committee of the House keeping a watchful eye on the whole question of law reform and being prepared to receive representations and make recommendations on the whole question.</P>
    <P>The main difficulty about the law <Col N="1623" /> is its uncertainty, and, as Deputy McGilligan pointed out, lawyers are always being blamed for the tortuous procedure of the law.  It is up to us in this House to make the law more easy, more understandable and more reasonable, and to take the responsibility off the lawyers, because they should not have it.  I am not fully persuaded that on this Bill at this stage we should refer the matter to a committee.  It has already gone too far. It is generally agreed that the Bill as it stands is basically sound and that the sooner we get it passed the better, but the matter of forming a committee to deal generally with the question of law reform is one which certainly would have my full support.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made, too, of the fact that the tortious act of the State does not lead to any liability on the State against a third party.  I would agree very much with Deputy O'Higgins on that point that the time has come when the State should no longer be able to avoid its responsibility for any negligence on the part of its servants.  I know that at times <i>ex-gratia</i> payments are made in such cases, but I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that the rights of the individual should be preserved against the State just as they are against another individual.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this Bill should have been met in this way because I feel that the more we can deal with law reform as a matter of general agreement the better, and it is a pleasure to take part in a debate where we find ourselves so much in agreement.  At the same time, I would hope that the fact that we seem to be in general agreement on this measure should not prevent us on the Committee Stage from going into it in great detail, because sometimes a Bill, even when it is agreed, may require amendment either by deletions or by additions, and I hope that in the general spirit of goodwill which is prevailing we may not find ourselves failing to be critical of the whole provision.</P>
    <P>Possibly, the most welcome feature of this to me is the fact that this, a very <Col N="1624" /> technical Bill, is being dealt with by experts&mdash;not only those who are practising the law but also the Parliamentary Secretary, who has dealt with this matter in his introduction of the Second Reading in a most competent way.  I know from my own personal experience that his work so far is greatly appreciated by the legal profession, and I feel that the way in which this Bill has been introduced to us has shown us that the Parliamentary Secretary is making a very real contribution to the whole question of law reform.  In that I would like to wish him success, not only in this but in any subsequent law reform which he may be able to introduce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only two points to make.  Certain Bills come before the House which could be described as lawyers' Bills.  In regard to these Bills, the lawyers know all the answers but the layman finds it difficult to follow them, especially a Bill of this magnitude. The layman should be able to follow a Bill.  Apart from the Bill presented to this House, a popular Bill, simplified and with explanatory notes, should also be on sale to the public.  The public should have an idea of what the law is.  They are told that ignorance of the law is no excuse.  It is extraordinary that very few people know anything about the law when they find themselves in the dock. They know the common crimes&mdash;that they should not break windows or rob a bank&mdash;but they do not know the law contained in measures of this nature.</P>
      <P>The last speaker said that the question of damages should not be a matter for 12 men to decide.  I was in court last week.  I was not a party to the issue.  I was a friend of the party to the issue.  I do not go to the courts often.  Somehow, I do not like them.  I do not like the atmosphere&mdash; a few people with wigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy told us on a previous occasion that he never goes near the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but a friend of mine was involved in this case.  A jury is most important, because <Col N="1625" /> if it has any tendency to sympathise, it will sympathise with the victim, with the poor person rather than with the big insurance companies. From my observations of the courts, the lawyers representing the insurance companies are very wide-awake fellows. Obviously, those big business people know whom to pick.  They pick the fellow who knows the ropes, who has been at the same sort of job all the time.  But the other party to a case might go to any lawyer, a lawyer who does not specialise in that branch of the law, and is therefore at a big disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The jury, however, is human and will have sympathy for the small man, instead of the big insurance companies. If the matter rested solely with the judge, he might be a severe judge, rigid as far as the law is concerned and with no human aspect.  I say: long live the jury.  I found one poor person frightened out of her life, being bullied by a &ldquo;smart aleck&rdquo; lawyer. Those are the people who must be protected.</P>

      <P>It is very fortunate that Deputy Sherwin has contributed to this debate.  I think many of the law Bills in this House would be the better when they go from this House, if some nonlawyers were to participate in the proceedings. The difficulty is that lawyers look at these Bills from their own particular angle.  Whether they be practising or non-practising lawyers, they are, nevertheless, soaked in the traditions of their profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is one which can touch any person in the land.  Any person who has suffered injury or who may suffer injury in the future is affected by this Bill.  While people complain about lawyers and about the injustice which <Col N="1626" /> they sometimes believe is meted out to them in the courts, I think it is a pity non-lawyers do not come into this House on an occasion like this when we are discussing such a vital Bill, affecting thousands of cases which go through our courts every year, contract cases, cases of torts or personal injury cases.  Our legislators and draftsmen might produce better work, and our amendments might be better, if the non-lawyers were to assist in the framing of legislation such as we have for our consideration today.</P>
    <P>To quote Deputy Booth's phrase, in the general spirit of goodwill which prevails, and being prepared to be generous, I want to ask a question. Who, in the main, is responsible for the lines this Bill has taken?  It is an unseen group of men who have been labouring not this year only but for many years past, men who have been engaged in intensive research through the legal system of this country and other countries and drafting many Bills, which, it is common knowledge, are pigeonholed in the Department of Justice, ready to be taken out as soon as there is a frenzied call from a Government short of legislation from other Departments.  While any non-lawyer must be grateful that we have some badly needed law reform Bills at the moment, let it be said that one of the reasons for it is the Government's gross inactivity in other important Departments of State.</P>

      <P>We have had a measure of generosity thrown out, and in order to keep the scales right, might it not be in order to say why certain things have taken place?  Let me ask another question.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice deserving of any thanks whatever in relation to this Bill or any of the current law reform measures?  He is not.  If he is doing anything in relation to the matter, he is not doing anything the Minister for Justice could not do or is doing something the Minister for Justice ought to do.  The Minister for Justice is not in the House <Col N="1627" /> to-night when he could be in the House to-night.  He was not in the House when other law reform Bills were going through and he could have been.</P>

      <P>Our Parliamentary system provides that the head of the Department must take responsibility for the mistakes of his Department. That is democratic advantage.  A democratic disadvantage is where the work of a Department lies to the credit of the head or deputy head of the Department although he may have had nothing to do with it.</P>
      <P>There has been a tremendous amount of work in relation to this Bill. Obviously, any Bill which seeks to make tremendous amendments in the law of tort, which is one of the main branches of legal knowledge, must entail a colossal amount of work.  I think sincere and full congratulations should be extended to those who have done such tremendous work and have brought it to this conclusion.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary or his advisers or the Minister or the Attorney General have considered whether an Act of Parliament can amount to a breach of copyright.  If such can occur, this Bill may put this country in some jeopardy.  So much of it has been copied almost word for word from a draft Bill of Dr. Glanville Williams that we might well be leaving ourselves open to an action.  I should hope that in such circumstances the members of this House would not be joined with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice as concurring wrongdoers.  The Bill as it stands might leave us open to that.  It might not be open to us to plead the privilege of this Parliament if proceedings were taken in the country in which the book was published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I say that, it is not necessarily to the disadvantage of the Bill itself that that has been done because what Dr. <Col N="1629" /> Williams has recommended has a great deal to be said for it.  This Bill is principally a Committee Stage Bill&mdash;one to which amendments and addenda can be made.  Short of trying to deliver in half an hour a lecture on the law of tort one cannot really cover this Bill properly.  A number of matters have been left out which we of Fine Gael believe should not have been omitted.  We did not take the opportunity we should have taken to abolish the ancient, pernicious and grossly unfair doctrine that the King can do no wrong and of sheltering behind that ancient monarchical institution to protect our Ministers and Departments of State from actions which may lie against them.</P>
    <P>The mere fact that <i>ex-gratia</i> payments have sometimes been made in advance is no reason why the Department of Finance should jib at any move to repeal that outmoded and grossly unfair legal rule.  I cannot believe that the Department of Justice or any progressive Department want to retain that rule.  I believe the blame lies entirely with the Department of Finance.  I believe it is time this House indicated it will not tolerate such a feudal and Middle Ages idea as that the State can do no wrong.</P>
    <P>Of course, the State and institutions of the State can do as much wrong as anybody else even though the general taxpayer will have to compensate for anybody who has done wrong. Obviously, a burden spread amongst 2¾ million people would be far less severe than a burden can be on one individual.</P>
    <P>What is the position at the moment? Let us take the high Government building in Kildare Street.  Suppose a fault should develop in the lift and the lift doors remain open.  Suppose the lift is at the bottom and some person at the top of the building walks into the empty lift shaft and falls to sudden death.  As things stand, there would be no right of action to anybody against the State because the State could not be responsible for the condition of the lift.  We have an exception where we provide under the Road Traffic legislation that action can be taken against the Minister for <Col N="1630" /> Finance in respect of a State-owned vehicle.  There are many fields outside that in which damage can occur to individuals and not to amend that sorry state of affairs in a Bill in this age is a deplorable position.</P>
    <P>Another extraordinary aspect of our legal position at the moment is that there are less damages or compensation for death than for the loss of a limb or an eye.  I appreciate that if you die you cannot get the damages yourself but your dependants will get far less.  There will be far less money to provide for them if the breadwinner dies than if the breadwinner were to remain living but disabled. It can be argued that if the person dies you do not have to maintain, feed and clothe that person for the rest of his natural life.  Quite true. But the difference between the compensation awarded in the case of death and the compensation awarded in the case of living persons is so great as to require legislative measures to ensure that proper compensation be paid in the case of death.</P>
    <P>The matters covered by this Bill are ones which a solicitor in the ordinary way would not dream of making a decision upon.  He would refer it to a senior counsel for advice and perhaps senior counsel would advise that a second senior be brought in.  It happens that solicitors in their business have to explain the law to poor people&mdash;people coming to seek redress.  Many cases never reach court at all because poor people have not the means to initiate legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>While I would say that the greater number of lawyers will always endeavour to assist the poor and people without means, nevertheless there will always be cases in which justice cannot be done to a poor person.  It may require a system of free legal assistance in order to arrive at a position in which the courts would be open to all without consideration of their means.</P>
    <P>This Bill goes some way to assisting people with limited means to recover compensation in respect of injuries. At the moment, if, as happens, one person is only 1 per cent. responsible <Col N="1631" /> and another is 99 per cent. responsible, the person who is 1 per cent. responsible puts himself in jeopardy by taking legal proceedings.  If he goes to court, the jury may well find that the defendant has been guilty of negligence but that the plaintiff has been guilty of negligence also.  The result is that such a plaintiff not only does not get any damages but has awarded against him a substantial bill of costs which in a High Court action may run into several hundreds if not thousands of pounds.  Obviously, where you have such a system, people are hesitant about seeking redress in our courts and that will create, as it has done, feelings that the courts are open only to people with means.  This Bill proposes to provide that if a person has contributed to some extent to his own misfortune, then to that extent&mdash;but only to that extent&mdash;he will not recover against the other side.</P>
    <P>I believe that will increase the number of cases in which people will seek redress at law but it will also have the effect, and this will be one of the advantages, of getting more actions settled out of court.  Those who jeer at the lawyers think this is a lawyers' Bill and that only the lawyers are interested in it because of the money they will make out of it.  At the moment insurance companies with vast reserves behind them can easily stand the cost of defending a High Court action or even going on to appeal in the Supreme Court, if they feel there is the least prospect of succeeding on an issue of contributory negligence, so long as they think the other side is any kind of a mark for money.  One of the effects of this Bill will be to compel insurance companies to have regard to the degrees to which people have been responsible for an accident and on that account, I believe we may be saved some of the excessive and unnecessary legal actions which have been taken from time to time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth attacked the jury system and I was glad that Deputy Sherwin rose to rebut that attack.  It is not by way of criticism of our circuit court judiciary that I say that <Col N="1632" /> I have found in the circuit court, where actions are frequently decided without a jury, that you can get more biassed decisions, either with small or great damages, than you get even from a jury.  Lawyers who practise in court from day to day can forecast in circuit court actions what damages will be awarded, depending on what judge takes a particular case.  It is obviously undesirable that decisions affecting compensation or damages in large amounts should be left to the whims and fancies of particular judges.  It is not criticism of them to say that I have no doubt that were we to empanel 12 members of the House and ask them to decide in a matter of compensation, we might well get 12 different decisions.  But suppose you have a case where you have a motor cyclist and a motorist involved.  You may have a judge who has a bee in his bonnet about motor cyclists or cyclist generally.  He will give purely nominal damages to a motor cyclist who may have been injured by the carelessness of another.  Alternatively, you may have a judge&mdash;there are not many that I know&mdash;who may be a motor cyclist and who would give substantial damages to a motor cyclist.</P>
    <P>We know from experience that where decisions are made by individual judges, you can get those extraordinary extremes, but if you submit a case to 12 jurymen, they are charged with their responsibilities.  The barristers on both sides explain to them the considerations that must not enter into their minds and the considerations which ought to be considered.  In case there is any doubt, the judge, in his final charge to the jury, limits the matters which the jury may take into consideration.  Recently, we had a discussion on juries in the course of the Juries Bill debate and I think it was common case that jurymen, by and large, are responsible people, not likely in the mass to take extraordinary decisions.  There may be individuals who do it but they are almost certain to be evened out when you have 12 jurymen.</P>
    <P>If justice is to be done, I believe our system of dealing with damages in the <Col N="1633" /> High Court must continue to depend on juries.  This Bill will allow juries, I believe, to give more just decisions than may have been the case in the past.  There was always the possibility, even probability, that in the past juries here awarded greater damages in some cases than they might reasonably have done.  It was felt in such cases that you were only stinging an insurance company and that you were paying high premiums and that there was no great harm done.  That did not happen in all cases, but it happened in some, and it may have been what Deputy Booth had in mind when criticising juries.</P>
    <P>Under this measure, the jury will have a dual responsibility.  They will have to consider the proportions in which the two parties have been responsible so that in road accident cases they may well find themselves having to balance one side against the other. I believe there will be less likelihood in such cases now of excessive damages being awarded than there might have been in the past.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have favoured sending this Bill to a Select Committee of the House.  I think that would not be the best way of getting it through quickly and that, with the limitations which are in it, it would be better to put through this amount of reform at this stage rather than send the Bill to a Select Committee.  From information elicited in the House recently, we know that the various court rules committees have not been overworked, that they have been rather ineffective and that some of them have not met at all. Obviously, the people best equipped to sit on a Select Committee on this Bill are those who are busiest in the practice of the law.  If this did go to a Select Committee, I think it would lead to procrastination, even with the best of goodwill on all sides, and it would be better to have this House consider the Committee Stage of the Bill.  A Bill of this kind, if understood properly, should be debated by others besides lawyers.</P>
    <P>There are some individual comments which I should like to make on the Bill but I think I had best reserve them <Col N="1634" /> for Committee Stage.  I renew my congratulations to those responsible for the Bill and for the vast amount of research which went into it.  We should not, I think, let the occasion pass without making special comment on the practice which has grown up in the Department of Justice of issuing explanatory memoranda in connection with Bills of this kind.  Even to lawyers, believe it or not, a Bill such as this is hardly comprehensible unless there is an explanatory memorandum with it.  Magnificent a piece of work as the Bill is, the explanatory memorandum surpasses it.  Every commendation is due to those who put so much work into the preparation of the Bill and the accompanying White Paper.  It would be churlish on my part to criticise further. I shall reserve my more individual comments for the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the House for the manner in which they have received this Bill, and to say that the majority of the speakers have accepted the Bill in a very excellent spirit. With regard to the comments made by Deputy McGilligan, I shall confine myself to saying that he might, at least, have given me the credit for being able to read.  I should have thought that Deputy McGilligan would not have been so foolish as to think that just because we adopted, in the main, the proposals of Dr. Williams, the House cannot amend the Bill in any way it pleases.  Of course, it can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also have expected that Deputy McGilligan as a member of a Faculty of Law would have been familiar with the practice which prevails in many countries, particularly in the United States of America.  There, academic lawyers, professors in the Universities, very often provide the Legislation with a piece of legislation ready for enactment.  I suppose it was too much to hope that Deputy McGilligan would be sufficiently in touch with other legal systems around the world. I make no apology for accepting Dr. Williams's Bill.  I made it absolutely clear in my opening remarks that we were doing so.  If Dr. Williams's Bill is a good Bill and if we believe it will do what we want to do, we make no <Col N="1635" /> apology to anyone for adopting it.</P>
    <P>The carping, niggling criticism that we have copied the Bill in full from Dr. Williams's book is not even correct. If those who made the criticism had studied the Bill in full, they would have seen that we have made certain changes.  I should also point out to Deputy McGilligan that we are fully aware of the comments the judge made in the <i>Moloney v. Llewellyn</i> case. We are also fully aware&mdash;I suppose it is too much to expect that Deputy McGilligan should be aware&mdash;that judges have been apportioning damages in Canada since 1924, in England since 1945, and in Northern Ireland since 1948.  I do not think that particular aspect will terrify our courts or make the Bill in any way difficult to work.</P>
    <P>I was particularly grateful for the manner in which Deputy Costello spoke on the Bill.  In his comments there was evidence of a constructive and thoughtful approach.  His suggestions will be very carefully examined. We are, indeed, very grateful for that kind of constructive criticism. I am certainly quite prepared to have another look at the provision excluding damages for reduction in the expectation of life.  As I said in my opening remarks this is a difficult and complex problem and we finally came down on one side.  It is, however, a matter on which we will be only too pleased to have the considered view of the House and from that point of view I am particularly grateful for Deputy Costello's very useful exposition of the problem as he sees it.</P>
    <P>All the points made by both Deputy Costello and Deputy O'Higgins will be carefully considered.  The question as to whether adequate damages are provided for dependants is one on which we can always have a useful and helpful discussion here, a discussion in which the views of the practitioner will be of very great assistance in coming to a decision.  I agree with both Deputy Booth and Deputy Costello in their criticism of the purely actuarial calculation of damages for dependants.  As they are aware, in Scotland there is the <i>solatium</i> provision which is an attempt to compensate <Col N="1636" /> for the actual sorrow suffered.</P>
    <P>We shall also examine the question of the lodgment in court of money for persons under 21 and the case of the unborn child.  I can tell the House that we did consider the whole question of the distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance on the part of a local authority.  Deputy O'Higgins referred specifically to this matter.  He will appreciate that there is more than just legal reform involved.  There are the very considerable financial implications for the local authority.  We gave a lot of thought to that.  I should not like the House to think that, just because we have not included any provision with regard to it, we have not explored it pretty fully.</P>
    <P>I want to give Deputy O'Higgins full credit for the fact that he has been interested in this matter of the introduction of a Bill of this kind for a considerable time.  I should be less than gracious if I were to deny him that credit.  He has consistently here prodded and repeatedly asked when the Bill would be introduced.  He has shown his interest to-night in the constructive speech he made.  He raised the question of the old maxim that &ldquo;The king can do no wrong&rdquo;.  We have modified that to some extent with regard to motor vehicles.</P>

      <P>I agree that the whole question of State liability should be examined.  I have had suggestions made to me in regard to that matter. One aspect of the approach of both Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Ryan struck me as a little amusing.  In so far as the Bill was a good one and the explanatory memorandum excellent, the officials of my Department must get the credit; in so far as the Bill was alleged to be nothing more than a mere cog in some respects, I was to be blamed.  That was a fine distinction that did not escape me.  I also realise, as some members have pointed out, that the whole background of this Bill must be considered in relation to the question of whether or not we continue to have juries in civil <Col N="1637" /> cases.  We have not made any proposal in this Bill in regard to juries in civil cases and I do not think this would be the appropriate Bill to make any such proposal.</P>

      <P>My personal approach to that problem is to proceed very slowly and cautiously.  That is why there is nothing in the Bill on those lines.  We wanted to have this Bill introduced and circulated.  If the matter of injuries were to be covered, we should not have had the Bill during this session; and I feel sure that Deputy T.F. O'Higgins is as anxious as I am to have this Bill enacted without too much delay.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin mentioned that the Bill was complicated and difficult. Certainly this branch of the law is a complex and complicated one but he should realise that we published with the Bill a very detailed and clear explanatory memorandum.  Indeed Deputy Sherwin, if he goes through the Bill slowly, will find it extremely readable even to the layman. I do not think he can be too critical of us in regard to the complexity of the provisions.  The Bill itself is not in general too difficult to follow and our explanatory memorandum attempts to make at least the main issues involved clear to the layman. I would agree with those who very rightly said this is primarily a Committee Stage Bill.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that as it is a legal reform measure it should be brought into the House here and discussed as such and that any element of Party politics should be removed and that we should all confine ourselves to devoting whatever measure of skill and experience we have to providing for the people the best possible Bill. I am confident that once some of the initial things that some people have to say have been said, we shall be able to go on from there and do that. I understand there is a desire that this Bill should go to a Special Committee of the House?</P>

Item No. 6 was not ordered.  Item No. 6 is not, in fact, among the Orders of the Day. It appears in the top half of the Order Paper, so to speak, and it would be quite impossible for the orderly conduct and business of the House if something not ordered were taken without its being expressly put to the House that it was being taken out of regular procedure without leave of the House.  I made the submission earlier &mdash;I agreed I would leave it until the Second Stage was over&mdash;that the motion for the Money Resolution should be deleted from the records of the House or rescinded, or whatever the procedure is, and that the Resolution would be put down for to-morrow morning.</P>

      <P>It is in order to move a Money Resolution at any time before the Committee Stage.  So as far as that part is concerned, the motion for the Money Resolution was quite in order.  There was no order made that the Money Resolution should be taken and in allowing the Money Resolution to be brought before the House, the mistake was entirely mine and I take full responsibility. There was no intention to <Col N="1640" /> deceive the House, no intention to put anything across the House that the House did not want to discuss.  If you look at your Order Paper, you will see item No. 11.  I merely glanced at &ldquo;Civil Liability Bill (Motion for Money Resolution)&rdquo; and I assumed that the motion for the Money Resolution was to be taken.  That is the position.  I regret any inconvenience caused to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill is a composite measure.  It proposes not alone to amend the law of defamation but also to consolidate the existing statutory law.  The principal consolidation will be found in Part II, and I propose to deal with that Part first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may preface my remarks by saying that the basic principles of the law of defamation, which is the usual way of describing libel and slander, are to be found in the common law.  The Courts have down through the years, laid down in a great number of cases the rules, with the exceptions and distinctions, sometimes very finely shaded, that make a man answerable in law for defaming another.  Deputies will observe that Part II is entitled &ldquo;Criminal Proceedings for Libel&rdquo;.  As well as being an actionable wrong, libel is also a criminal offence.  In early times, libels were prosecuted as criminal offences by the party aggrieved before a judge and jury as indictable misdemeanours, and actions for damages on the civil side were rare.  In those times the party complaining of the libel could institute and carry on a criminal prosecution on indictment in his own name.  The <Col N="1643" /> private prosecutor disappeared in this country in 1924 when the Criminal Justice (Administration) Act of that year was passed and the Attorney General designated as the only authority to prosecute on indictment for a criminal charge.  However, the private prosecutor in libel cases had long before 1924 given place to the plaintiff who sued civilly and recovered damages.  This was probably considered a better business proposition than seeking vindication through the criminal law.  Indeed, I have been unable to find any notable instance of a prosecution for what I might call a personal defamatory libel in recent times and where criminal prosecutions occur to-day, they are concerned with blasphemous, obscene, or seditious libels.  Technically the law does not in any way hamper the Attorney General from preferring an indictment in a case where he considers it is proper to do so for a libel on an individual person.  Truth is not a defence in a criminal libel unless public benefit is involved.  Hence the saying: &ldquo;the greater the truth, the greater the libel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is proposed in Part II to continue subject to slight modifications called for by the passage of time, the existing statutory enactments.  For example in Section 5 the essentials of the Act of the Irish Parliament of 1793 are being re-enacted.  The Irish measure was a reproduction of a very well-known statute passed in England the year before and known as &ldquo;Fox's Act&rdquo; from its sponsor Charles James Fox. Its object was to delimit the functions of a judge and to establish the powers of a jury who in the view of a judicial authority in 1868 were &ldquo;the true guardians of the liberty of the Press.&rdquo;  Likewise, the provisions of the Libel Act of 1843 are continued in Sections 6 and 7.  The bar to commencing a prosecution of a newspaper without the leave of the court which was imposed in 1888 is of course being continued in Section 8.  None of these provisions calls for elaboration at this stage, and, although one might prefer an abbreviated form of Section 6, which deals with a plea of justification and publication for <Col N="1644" /> the public benefit in a criminal prosecution, there is the risk of departing from a formula that has governed criminal procedure for well over a century. Sections 11, 12 and 13 are intended to put all punishment on a statutory basis.  This is the position at present except in cases of obscene libel and a first offence of blasphemous libel, where the punishment under the common law is unspecified fine or imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I feel that there will be a general recognition that this tidying up of scattered sections of the present statutory enactments on the criminal side is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>In dealing with Part III of the Bill which is concerned with the civil aspect of defamation, I should like to refer to the legislation passed in Great Britain in 1952 and in the North in 1955.  This legislation followed the report in 1948 of Lord Porter's Committee, who recommended certain reforms in order to make the law more appropriate to modern conditions and to remove certain anomalies.  The Government are satisfied that with some exceptions the English legislation could with advantage be followed here.</P>
    <P>The introduction of broadcasting with its offspring television has made it desirable to label defamation through this agency as libel or slander.  Defamation by spoken word is slander and becomes libel when published in any permanent form.  To remove any doubt it is proposed in sections 14 and 15 that defamation through wireless broadcasting, television or any other recording techniques will be libel rather than slander.</P>
    <P>The simple provisions of the Slander of Women Act, 1891, are being continued without alteration in Section 16.  This Act added a further exception to the general rule that slander is not actionable except on proof of special damage.</P>
    <P>In Sections 17 and 18 the provisions of the Libel Acts of 1843 and 1845 are being re-enacted.  They embrace some defences open in court actions in mitigation of damages.</P>
    <P>The 1843 Act applies to any action for defamation and makes it possible <Col N="1645" /> for a defendant, after giving due notice to the plaintiff, to give evidence in mitigation of damages that he made or offered an apology to the plaintiff for the defamation before the action was started or as soon afterwards as he had an opportunity of doing so.  It is, of course, conceded that there was defamation and the only question to be settled is the amount of damages. Where the defendant is proceeded against in respect of a libel in a newspaper, the plea of apology in order to be effective must under the 1845 Act be accompanied by a lodgment of money in court.  The High Court Rules do not permit in cases of libel or slander the lodgment of money in court with a denial of liability, as they do in cases of other torts except where a question of title to land is involved. Such a lodgment appears to be permitted under the English Rules.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with slanders where, unlike cases of libel, the law requires that actual pecuniary loss must be proved by the plaintiff in order to recover damages.  There are three classes of cases, in addition to the exception already noted under the Slander of Women Act, where words spoken are held by the common law to be actionable <i>per se</i>, i.e. without proof of special damage.  These exceptions are:&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  words imputing a crime for which plaintiff may suffer at least imprisonment in the first instance;</P>
    <P>(b)  words imputing to the plaintiff certain contagious or infectious diseases:</P>
    <P>(c)  words spoken of the plaintiff <i>in the way</i> of his office, profession or trade and naturally tending to injure or prejudice his reputation therein.  </P>
    <P>Section 20 will modify the law in respect of the last of these exceptions, and it will no longer be necessary to prove that the words were spoken of a plaintiff in the way of his office, profession or trade.  They may be spoken of him in his personal capacity, but if they are calculated to disparage him in his office, profession <Col N="1646" /> or trade they will be actionable without proof of special damage.  I need hardly say that a personal reflection such as words attributing immorality or insobriety may have very serious consequences to a man in his office, profession or trade even though not spoken of him in that capacity.</P>
    <P>Slander of title is &ldquo;a false and malicious denial whether spoken or in permanent form of a person's title to property&rdquo; and slander of goods is &ldquo;a false and malicious depreciation whether spoken or in permanent form of merchandise sold and manufactured by a person.&rdquo;  At present a plaintiff in such cases must prove actual pecuniary loss and no distinction exists between written and spoken words.  Following the principle adopted in Section 20, it is proposed in Section 21 to make slander of goods, slander of title and other malicious falsehoods actionable without proof of special damage where the words are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff in respect of any office, profession or trade carried on by him at the time of the publication.  Such slanders and malicious falsehoods will also be actionable without proof of special damage under Section 21, if the words are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff and are published in writing or other permanent form.</P>
    <P>Under existing law, in ascertaining the meaning of words complained of as defamation, the test is not what the defendant intended the words to mean but what they would be reasonably understood to mean by those to whom they were published in the light of the surrounding circumstances.  This has led to some anomalies.  The first is where a defamatory statement is intended to refer to a fictitious character but is in fact defamatory of an existing person.  The second is that of a statement made truthfully of an existing person, but which is found in fact to be defamatory of another existing person.  In a third category, there are cases where statements quite harmless on their face and referable to an existing person are, <Col N="1647" /> because of facts unknown to the author or publisher, defamatory of the person intended to be referred to or some other person.  All these are instances of unintentional defamation where reform is desirable to ensure that, while the reputation of an injured person is cleared by an adequate correction and apology, the heavy expense of legal proceedings will be avoided.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bill creates the defence of innocent publication and the making of an offer of amends. Innocent publication must fully satisfy certain conditions.  The publisher must not intend to publish the words of and concerning the aggrieved party and must not know of any circumstances by virtue of which they might be understood to refer to him.  Innocent publication may also be satisfied where the words were not defamatory on their face, and the publisher did not know of circumstances by virtue of which they might be understood to be defamatory.</P>
    <P>In every case, in order to avail himself of this defence, the publisher must establish that he exercised all reasonable care in relation to the publication and &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; includes any servant or agent of the publisher concerned in the publication.  The offer of amends must be made promptly and accompanied by an affidavit specifying the facts relied upon to show innocent publication.  Where a defence is made under the section, no further evidence will be admissible to supplement proof of innocent publication.  The offer of amends means an offer to publish a suitable correction and a sufficient apology, and, where copies have been distributed, to take reasonable steps to notify persons that the words complained of are alleged to be defamatory of the aggrieved party.</P>
    <P>Should the offer be accepted and a question is raised as to the steps to be taken in fulfilment thereof, it may be determined by the appropriate court which may order payment of costs on an indemnity basis to the aggrieved party.  The liability of any other party jointly responsible for publication is <Col N="1648" /> not prejudiced by the making and acceptance of an offer of amends.  If the offer is not accepted it will afford a defence if the section can be shown to have been complied with and if the offer was made in accordance with the section and was not withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The defence of innocent publication will not be available in cases where special damage is proved, or where the defendant is not the author of the words complained of, unless he proves the words were written by the author without malice.  The section will not afford any defence where malice is established.</P>
    <P>It is not in the interest of any section of the community that frivolous or unduly enterprising actions for defamation should be encouraged.  At the same time, if a defendant who claims to have acted wholly innocently wishes to avail himself of Section 22, he must comply fully with its requirements; and this should afford the aggrieved party sufficient vindication without litigation.</P>
    <P>It is a good defence in civil proceedings for defamation to prove justification, viz. that the words complained of are true in substance and in fact.  A libel may contain a series of serious charges which a defendant succeeds in proving to be true and a minor one in which he does not succeed in his defence of justification. Under the existing law a plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict and to damages although in such a state of facts there could be no appreciable damage caused to his reputation.  It is proposed in Section 23 to save a defence of justification in any case where the words not proved to be true do not materially injure the plaintiff's reputation when regard is had to the truth of the charges proved to be true in substance and in fact.</P>
    <P>It is also a defence to an action for libel that the words complained of were &ldquo;fair comment upon a matter of public interest.&rdquo;  This will be regarded as an important safeguard in the maintenance of that freedom of expression of opinion which Article 40 of the Constitution was designed to protect. It is not always easy to distinguish between fact and comment.  Indeed, it <Col N="1649" /> would be safe to say that in the majority of cases a libel complained of in this context would consist in part of statements of fact and in part of expressions of opinion.  Section 24 will therefore rationalize the defence of fair comment in harmony with the preceding section dealing with justification. It will save a defence of fair comment from failing in cases where the libel or slander complained of consists partly of allegations of fact and partly of expression of opinion and the truth of every allegation of fact is not proved, but the expression of opinion is fair comment on such allegations of fact as are proved.</P>
    <P>I now come to Section 25, which is designed to give qualified privilege to certain reports in newspapers and broadcasts.  A qualified privilege is already enjoyed by newspapers under the Law of Libel Amendment Act, 1888, but the field covered by that Act was delimited by the needs and circumstances of that time and its area must be widened to embrace categories of reports appropriate to the present day.  Unlike Section 22 which applies to all publications, Section 25 is referable to newspapers only.  It has been the subject of representations to us by the press who seek the same measure of protection as the British and Northern newspapers enjoy by virtue of the legislation in 1952 and 1955.  If there is proof of malice, there will be no protection whatever under the section for a newspaper.  Subject to this, publication in a newspaper or broadcasts of reports or matters mentioned in the Second Schedule are privileged.  Only fair and accurate reports are covered by the Schedule.  In Part I of the Schedule, where the privilege attaches without any obligation to make an explanation or contradiction, the subjects comprise fair and accurate reports of proceedings in public of outside legislatures or bodies appointed by them to hold public inquiries.  Also privileged are (1) fair and accurate reports of public proceedings of international organisations with which the State or the Government is associated, and of the International Court of Justice, and of courts and courtsmartial of a foreign country, (2) fair and accurate copies of <Col N="1650" /> registers or other documents open to public inspection, and (3) any notices published by authority of Courts in the State.  The British Act of 1952 (and the Act of 1955 in the North) covers the public proceedings of legislatures in the Dominions.  Ireland and India were specifically named.  The Porter Committee recommended that all foreign legislatures should be covered.  The Bill contains no limitation on fair and accurate reports of public proceedings in foreign legislative assemblies or of proceedings of a foreign court or court-martial. Thus a wider field is proposed for our newspapers in this matter.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Second Schedule lists the statements that will be privileged but subject to explanation or contradiction. Section 25 withdraws the defence of privilege in respect of any such statement if it is shown that the defendant has been requested to publish (or broadcast as the case may be) a reasonable explanation or contradiction and has not done so or has done so inadequately or unreasonably.  The subjects covered in Part II comprise fair and accurate reports of decisions or findings of certain associations formed in the State or in the North to promote art, science or learning, trade or professional bodies, and sporting associations, where the decisions or findings relate to members or to those subject by contract to some control by the association.  Fair and accurate reports of proceedings at public meetings in the State or the North <i>bona fide</i> and lawfully held for a lawful purpose and related to a matter of public concern, whether admission is general or restricted, are also within Part II.  This Part, in addition, embraces fair and accurate reports of proceedings at meetings or sittings whether in the State or the North of local authorities, commissions, tribunals, and local inquiries where the public or the Press are not excluded. Fair and accurate reports or proceedings at general meetings of companies (other than private companies) formed in the State or the North are also within Part II of the Schedule.  Likewise, Part II covers copies, fair and accurate reports or summaries of notices issued for the information of <Col N="1651" /> the public by any Government Department, local authority, or the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, or by a corresponding department, authority or officer in the North.</P>
    <P>At present, under the 1888 Act, a newspaper enjoys qualified privilege in respect of fair and accurate reports of proceedings at public meetings within the State of local bodies, etc., and of official publications and notices, subject to publication by the newspaper on request of a reasonable letter or statement of contradiction or explanation.  The effect of Section 25 (2) of the Bill is to extend this qualified privilege (i) to fair and accurate reports of the proceedings at meetings of sporting, scientific, commercial and vocational associations formed in the State, and (ii) to the proceedings of similar associations formed in the North.  The British and Six Counties Acts of 1952 and 1955 respectively afford protection in respect of such reports within the United Kingdom only.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that doubts have been expressed as to the validity of agreements to indemnify publishers against libels of which they are unaware, Section 26 will make lawful an agreement unless the party to be indemnified knows the matter is defamatory and does not believe that there is a good defence to an action in respect of the publication.</P>
    <P>Section 27 will enable a defendant to endeavour to reduce damages by proving that the plaintiff has already been compensated for the same or similar words.  This will alter the existing law.</P>
    <P>In 1881, provision was made for the registration of newspaper proprietors in the Newspaper Libel and Registration Act of that year.  The object of the Act was to enable a member of the public to inspect the entries on the register and discover the identity of the proprietor or proprietors of a newspaper.  Changes in proprietorship had also to be registered.  About a dozen sections in the Act dealt with the establishment and maintenance of the register, and the appointment of a <Col N="1652" /> Registrar, which position, incidentally, came in time to be filled as a matter of administrative convenience by the person who was Registrar of Joint Stock Companies.  Certified copies from the registrar are obtainable and penalties are provided for breaches of the requirements as to registration.</P>
    <P>The Act does not apply to companies. In due course, the Registration of Business Names Act, 1916, required the persons carrying on business under a business name to register particulars, including the names and addresses of the persons carrying on such business. Some proprietors of newspapers who also trade under a business name must be registered under both the Act of 1881 and the Act of 1916.  Registrations under the Act of 1881 have fallen to a very low figure&mdash;sixteen in the current year&mdash;and the retention of the somewhat elaborate structure established by that Act cannot now be justified. Accordingly, it is proposed in Section 29 that where a newspaper is not owned by a company the proprietors must be registered under the Act of 1916 only.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that, for the purpose of this registration, we are continuing the old and more restricted definition of newspaper which excluded monthly publications whereas in the other parts of the Bill we have adopted the new and wide definition which takes in publications appearing at intervals not exceeding 36 days.  In other words, the benefits in the Bill are given to a wider range of publications while the obligations as to registration will remain with the same class of publication as came under the terms of the 1881 legislation.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House. I trust that the explanatory memorandum and the explanatory sidenotes in the text of the Bill have been of assisance to Deputies in studying the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I have much pleasure in giving complete approval to this measure, which I am sure has been given great thought and which is very badly needed in the general public interest to bring the law of defamation up to date.  I congratulate <Col N="1653" /> the Parliamentary Secretary and the officials concerned.</P>
      <P>I have very little to say on the text or details of the measure.  Those details can be more appropriately dealt with on Committee Stage.  There are just three or four points to which I would direct attention, giving my own personal point of view rather than anybody elses.  It is proper that the Parliamentary Secretary when introducing a Bill of this kind would endeavour to modify the statute law and bring it up to date.  I cannot see that the elaborate provisions in reference to criminal proceedings about libel are really necessary but I suppose it is better to have them there and up to date so that we will know where we are.</P>
      <P>I wonder would the Parliamentary Secretary get some of his legal experts to ascertain for me in relation to a libel action&mdash;I am perhaps mentally lazy or too old now to go searching for the origins of matters of this sort&mdash; the meaning of the saying: the greater the truth, the greater the libel.  Why is it there?  I have never been able to understand it.  I do not know why, if circumstances are such as to render necessary criminal proceedings for libel and the defamatory words complained of are true, it cannot be a defence to prove truth without any question of public policy.  I have never been able to understand it.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might be able to enlighten me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why it is there or why it is continued, in view of our criminal libel proceedings at present, where no one but the Attorney General can prefer an indictment.  The Attorney General can, in fact, interpose at any stage of the proceedings that a private citizen might be audacious enough to initiate.  He can interfere if a person decides to take a case against someone for criminal libel, and he can make the decision whether he will carry on the indictment before a jury.  He can decide whether there is any necessity for those proceedings at all.  I do not know why it should be left to the public representative of the people, the Attorney General, to <Col N="1654" /> say whether or not a person should prosecute for criminal libel.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I want to refer is again a rather ancient survival of an old law which I have never been able to understand.  It has always seemed to me to be a complete anomaly.  I do not know of any reason why it should be there, but it is there. The very first case I had was a case under the Slander of Women Act.  The case was transferred from the High Court to the then County Court or Recorder's Court.  There happened to be a very unpleasant individual presiding over the court, the late Thomas O'Shaughnessy, Recorder of Dublin.  He thought the High Court were not doing their job in sending the case to him and without hearing the case&mdash;he asked me what it was about and I very timidly and very nervously told him it was a case under the Slander of Women Act&mdash;he said: &ldquo;A farthing damages and 6/8d. costs.&rdquo; It was contrary to the law, of course, but it impressed on my juvenile mind the Slander of Women Act.  That was the award I got from his unpleasant lordship.  I hope I am not using the wrong word in using the word &ldquo;lordship&rdquo; before the Bill becomes an Act.</P>
    <P>However, I do not understand why if a woman is slandered in her virtue, there should be any difference in costs and damages.  The case may be pretty serious, and why should there be a provision that if a woman is slandered in her virtue she should not get more costs than damages?  Why that anomaly is there, I do not know.  I recommend to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should remove it.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the next point I want to make.  Why does not the Parliamentary Secretary in bringing in this Bill do what has been talked of by lawyers and many members of the public&mdash;abolish the distinction between slander and libel?  Why there should be this artificial difference between the spoken word and the written word has been a topic for consideration ever since I became a student.  People have tried to explain that it is because the written word remains and the spoken word goes with the wind.  The spoken <Col N="1655" /> word may be very much more damaging than the written word.  Why there should be that artificial distinction passes my comprehension. Apparently they have not abolished it in England, but we should abolish it here.  I commend it for the consideration of the Parliamentary Secretary and the House during Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is in reference to Section 18 which I think reproduces the provisions of one of these numerous Acts which are usually classed under the name of Lord Campbell, and most people do not know which Lord Campbell and which Act. I am referring to the Acts of 1843 and 1845 which enable newspapers to make an apology as soon as possible and lodge money in court.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary's advisers will tell him that if he looks up some of our books on libel, that is a peculiar but usual provision on the statutes.  I am not saying it should not be there or that it should not be continued.  It is there and there is no reason why it should not remain.</P>
    <P>In a recent case in which, I appeared the newspaper in question published what they termed was an apology and lodged money in court, but they found to their horror that it was not of any use to them.  The position is that the case can be gone on with and the plaintiff may get more money than is lodged &mdash;in which event everything is grand for the plaintiff&mdash;or get less money than is lodged, in which event my recollection is that even though the jury give less, the plaintiff can take out the bigger sum.  That does appear to be a very illusory defence for the newspapers. In fact, it is very seldom used.  The only time I ever knew it to be used was in the action to which I have referred.  It was used, I am glad to say, with success by the plaintiff.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the provision for lodging money in court.  Under the rules of the High Court, a defendant sued for libel cannot lodge money in court unless he admits the defamatory <Col N="1656" /> nature of the words alleged to have been published.  Personally, I think it is a good provision, but it is a curious thing that while our High Court rules prevent a defendant in a libel action from lodging money in court without admitting the truth of the defamatory nature of the publication our circuit court rules do allow it.  The High Court do and the Circuit Court do not. No secret lodgement in such cases is permitted in the High Court.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think the High Court rules are right.  I believe the defendant in a libel action should not be enabled to lodge money in court, without admitting the defamatory nature of the publication.  That is my own personal view.  I think it is a piece of manoeuvring to try to get away with the libel which is published.  It is a manoeuvre because if a sum of money is lodged in court and the jury think the plaintiff has been libelled but that a smaller sum of money is adequate and that no special damages can be given, the defendant may get away with it. That is a piece of legal manoeuvring on the part of the person or newspaper which has published a defamatory statement and I think they should not be allowed to get away with it.</P>
    <P>I have expressed my gratification at this Bill.  I commend the Parliamentary Secretary for bringing it in, for the erudite research which has gone into the provisions of the Bill, and for the very considerable amount of work and industry put into its preparation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I find myself in the position of being very glad to express my gratitude to the House for the manner in which they have received this Bill and in particular to Deputy Costello.  Deputy Costello has raised a number of points.  He referred to the old maxim: &ldquo;The greater the truth, the greater the libel.&rdquo;  Like Deputy Costello I am not exactly sure of its origin.  It might have been conceived because criminal libel was libel likely to lead to a breach of the peace and that likelihood was probably greater if the statement made was true. Therefore, the greater the truth the greater the libel.  However, I would not attempt to be dogmatic about this but there it is for what it is worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1657" /> I personally share the views of Deputy Costello with regard to the slander of women and I have queried the matter.  Indeed, I am very glad that it has been raised and will be pleased to have a second look at it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello answered himself with regard to the reason for the original difference between libel and slander.  Whether or not we should consider the abolition of the difference is another matter I will look into.  The same applies to the provisions of Lord Campbell's Act.  I myself doubted whether in view of the new provisions we were making in this Bill with regard to newspapers it was necessary to retain the old provisions, and I finally came to the conclusion that we would retain the provisions in the Bill and ascertain the views of Deputies who had experience of such matters. Here again I share Deputy Costello's views, and I feel that the provisions of Lord Campbell's Act are probably unnecessary and illusory; but if there was no particular reason why we should get rid of them, it might be just as well to be on the safe side and hold on to them.</P>
    <P>These are the only points I would comment on at this stage.  They can be gone into more fully on Committee Stage.  I should repeat that I am most grateful to the House for the reception it has accorded to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I had got to the point of referring to the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, and I expressed the view that there was a good procedure with regard to the practice, procedure and administration of the courts and the law in respect of certain groupings of the court.  Under the 1936 Act, four rule-making committees were established. One was the Superior Courts Rules Committee which included Supreme and High Courts; the second was the Circuit Court Rules Committee; the third was the District Court Rules Committee; and there was a committee for Land Registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme, as I understood it in those days, was quite good.  It was an attempt to get the judiciary on these committees, and members of the profession were represented, both the Bar and solicitors, in various groupings.  It seemed a good thought that, having left the law as it was to statute law and case law, then those people would be expected to know the law and to recognise the deficiencies that might occur from time to time in the law. They should be put in charge of the various committees, and their duty was that at least once each year the <Col N="1659" /> several committees had to meet under the chairman appointed to each, and their duty at that particular meeting was to consider the law, practice and administration of the courts as it affected the separate rules.</P>
    <P>It was made a statutory duty imposed on the four committees that they should, as soon as possible after what would be regarded as the statutory meeting held during the year, report on what they thought about the law, practice and administration of the courts and what amendment of the law they thought desirable.  All they could do, of course, was to make a report which bound nobody, but it appeared to be a good idea to have the judiciary, the members of the profession, adverting to the defects in the law from time to time, and to give these reports to the Minister for Justice.  The object of that was that he would consider how the law or the procedure of the courts stood and take the necessary steps to make whatever amendments seemed desirable.</P>
    <P>But the scheme broke down.  I should remark that the committees were officered by members of the judiciary.  When the scheme broke down, it did so because those who were given a statutory duty to make those reports failed entirely in that duty. I asked for information first of all, in the course of a debate like this two or three years ago, and I eventually followed it up by a Parliamentary Question, and I discovered then that, certainly up to two years ago, not one of those committees had carried out these statutory duties imposed on it by the 1936 Act.  No report had been received from any committee.  I referred to the matter here quite recently and asked the Minister for Justice would he either seek to enforce compliance with these duties which the legislative body had imposed on the judiciary or clear up the matter by repealing these sections.  I thought it was undesirable to have members of the judiciary whose task it is to enforce the statute law and the ordinary law, giving a very bad example by failing conspicuously all over those years since 1936 to do their duty in this respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> However, in the end, what I regarded as a rather weak suggestion was made to me, that the matter would be considered and if it were thought that the judges should not be brought to carry out their duties, then the Act of 1936 would be amended.  It was suggested that that might occur quite soon.  What has occurred since that question was put down and I got that reply is that we have had two pieces of legislation, one regarding the establishment of the new courts and the other the Bill which tries to settle more generally the whole system of the courts and their various divisions and that has imposed new duties upon certain members of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>Why it is thought fit to impose extra duty on a body of people who over the years since 1936 have failed to do their duty, I cannot understand.  I have not heard of any apology being made or any excuse being given by those people as to why they did not make those reports.  It is surprising that, instead of repealing that law or trying to enforce it, we should decide to move out in another direction and give certain members of the judiciary new duties, more particularly with regard to the district court.  It is a sad situation in which people who should give good example are giving the worst possible example.</P>
    <P>For three years in succession, I have questioned the matter of penal reform. Maybe I do not talk the same language as those in the Department of Justice, but I find it very hard to understand their attitude in this matter.  When I was speaking on this Vote in 1959 and dealing with penal reform, I mentioned to the Minister that I had taken a certain inference from his phrase and I said that there was no promise whatever of any improvement in the field of penal reform.  In the speech which the Minister read in 1959, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;our resources do not permit of experimentation to any large degree ....  Moreover most prisoners are not long enough in custody for any training or rehabilitation measures to take effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I said I hoped it was not too striking <Col N="1661" /> a conclusion to state, as I had stated, that &ldquo;that means nothing has been done or will be done in respect of penal reform because of the fact that we have too few prisoners and that they are there for too short a period.&rdquo;  To that point, the Minister said: &ldquo;Of course, penal reform has been continuous during the years.  This is a further little step forward.&rdquo;  I replied at once: &ldquo;I should like to hear how far penal reform has gone over the last two years.&rdquo;  The reply I got to that was: &ldquo;If the Deputy went into Mountjoy now, he would be supplied with a spring bed.  Indeed, he would nearly need a recommendation now to get in there.&rdquo;  Then I said: &ldquo;We are to mark that down as a big advance&mdash;spring beds for prisoners in Mountjoy! Is that the extent of the penal reform?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I find this year there is a passing reference to a piece of legislation of the penal reform type.  On page 13 of the Minister's brief, he referred to the fact that certain expenses had been increased and that this mainly arose because there were staff claims under conciliation and arbitration machinery and the recruitment of additional staff for the supervision of political prisoners in Mountjoy.  He then embarked upon this rather lyrical passage:</P>
    <P>An improved dietary for prisoners and inmates, which is being introduced very shortly, is responsible for the increased victualling costs. While the present diet is of good standard from the point of view of nutrition, I cannot help feeling that it is somewhat monotonous and that some variation of the dietary is desirable.  The changes which I propose to make and which should help to relieve the monotony include the substitution of flakemeal for pinhead oatmeal, provision of a milk pudding or other sweet with the dinner, an increase in the tea ration and the sugar content of tea, and an additional bread and marmalade ration instead of porridge on a certain morning. </P>
    <P>I take it this is on the same lines as the spring mattresses in Mountjoy?</P>

      <P>This time the Minister thought fit to boast, as one of the items of solid achievement, that over the year the Garda Síochána conciliation and arbitration scheme had operated.  I remarked that that seemed to be somewhat impudent from the present Minister for Justice, seeing that for the best part of 17 years arbitration in any form had been refused to State personnel, either civil servants, members of the Army, teachers or members of the Garda.  For quite a while, the situation developed &mdash;not a bad situation&mdash;that when arbitration had been introduced for the civil servants, there was a certain relationship between the salaries in the Civil Service and salaries in the Garda Síochána and the Army as well as the teachers' group.  However, they moved on to a special conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
      <P>If it is possible to boast that we have had a full year under the conciliation and arbitration scheme, it does not seem to have led to any great comfort amongst the Gardaí themselves.  I have read any number of articles indicating great disquiet in the ranks of the Gárda.  The two things questioned were that Gárda promotion was being made in such a way that there were many grievances and, in addition, a considerable amount of dissatisfaction was expressed in many articles in the Press that, so to speak, the giving of extra emoluments to the Guards while at the same time withdrawing rent allowances meant a reduction in fact in their emoluments, because the money given barely made up for the rent allowances. In addition, the rent allowance was a matter that could be allowed for in income tax while the extra salary was not allowed and they were, in fact, charged for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I began to wonder, when the Minister was so anxious about the monotony of the dietary in Mountjoy and elsewhere and felt himself bound to relieve it by substituting flakemeal for pinhead oatmeal, providing milk pudding, more tea and sugar and all <Col N="1663" /> the rest, were these things taken into consideration&mdash;particularly since most of them are matters affecting the index figure of the cost of living&mdash;by the arbitration and conciliation board when the rather meagre increases were given to the members of the Garda? It seems to me to be rather tactless for the Minister in the speech on his Estimate to say so much about his anxiety to have the dietary of prisoners and inmates of certain mental hospitals improved&mdash;nobody can object to that&mdash;to boast about it in the terms in which it was done, while at the same time there is seething discontent in the ranks of the Garda, more particularly in respect of emoluments and pay.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of letter writing in regard to promotion.  The <i>Independent</i> had an article on March, 23rd, of this year, which was headed &ldquo;Garda Promotion Grievances Grow&rdquo;, and which stated:</P>
    <P>Discontent over the promotion system in the Garda Síochána has spread to all ranks and has grown to such proportions that, according to a recent issue of the <i>Garda Review</i>, there is an atmosphere of distrust everywhere.</P>
    <P>The journal added that the discontent was now &ldquo;bordering on despair&rdquo; and the manner in which it had gripped practically every member to whom promotion meant anything was &ldquo;truly alarming&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Members of the Force, from Chief Superintendents down to the most junior of recruits, are at no pains to conceal that the present system should be altered, but recent representations by their organisations to the Commissioner and the Minister for Justice have been turned down. The result is that widespread discontent is said to be sapping the morale and efficiency of the Force. </P>
    <P>The fourth paragraph in the article stated:</P>
    <P>There is no great dissatisfaction at the method of promoting Gardaí to the rank of Sergeant, but from there on the system of selection for higher rank has created a profound sense of grievance. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> That particular paragraph was followed up by a series of letters saying that that was a complete mistake and that one of the most serious grievances concerned the promotion from Garda to the rank of sergeant.  I shall deal with that in a moment.  Apparently, the old system was that a sergeant who sought promotion to inspector entered for a competitive test, the result of which was the deciding factor.  Then, the article said:</P>
    <P>That system has now been replaced by a qualifying examination in professional subjects, followed by an interview. </P>
    <P>Of course, the interview is what matters. It is the interview which has caused disquiet.  There is no doubt that where an interview is made one of the special requirements for candidates for promotion, many strings can be pulled and influence can be used.  The results of an interview such as this are not like the results of a test marked in a Civil Service way.  The results of an interview can be changed, distorted and misinterpreted in such a way as to bring about a situation such as that which is developing, where there is a great sense of grievance with regard to promotion.</P>
    <P>As I said, this article passed over the method of promotion from Garda to sergeant.  There were a number of letters written almost immediately on that.  One fairly lengthy letter in the <i>Independent</i> a couple of days later said that that paragraph was wrong and that, on the contrary, that was where most of the discontent arises.  It went on to say:</P>
    <P>The majority of the force are in the Garda rank, and they, with their Sergeants, are nearly always first to arrive at the scenes of incidents and it is they who often take the brunt of criticism and abuse.  Why not look into the matter of their promotion system in order to reduce their grievances? </P>
    <P>They then continue the argument used concerning the type of examination and interview.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> The article continues:</P>
    <P>That has caused discontent, frustration and jealousy.  It seems to disregard men with long service and experience, and human nature being what it is, it has given rise to the belief that there is too much room for influence. </P>
    <P>That is the kernel of this letter.  If I add that as a corrective to the article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of March 23rd last it indicates that, right over the Force, with regard to promotion from Garda to sergeant and upwards, there is definite discontent amongst all the members.  This article of 23rd March ended in this way:</P>
    <P>A Superintendent said yesterday:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are left with the Selection Board as before, with the interview system, with the senior men of experience being passed over, with a secret system of selection, and with a Force riddled with grievances and discontent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is on the simple matter of promotion. When I add to that the articles I have read from time to time in the <i>Garda Review</i> and letters which have appeared in the papers, I find it is not a question merely of promotion but of the emoluments of the Garda and the special grievance with regard to the quarters in which they find themselves housed from time to time.</P>
    <P>Articles were published in the <i>Garda Review</i> particularly the January or February issue.  If people there were speaking the truth&mdash;I do not know who they were and I do not know if any care was taken to verify the particular grievances they ventilated&mdash;if they were speaking anything near the truth in connection with the rules they have in certain places and with the conditions of damp and leaking, the conditions with regard to the beds they have to sleep on, the conditions with regard to the ventilation of the place, the matter is serious.  It was stressed in most of these articles that there is a peculiar prohibition.  I suppose all the fittings and furniture are supplied by the Office of Public Works.  Apparently there is a prohibition <Col N="1666" /> on a member of the Garda Síochána providing for himself in the sense of bettering the quarters he has to live in.</P>
    <P>One knows that grievances can be magnified and that a great deal can be made out of very little.  At the same time, two issues of that journal were published and I saw no counter suggestion made through the usual matter of inspired question in the House here to get a corrective given. I saw nothing of that except I heard an odd phrase from the Minister for Justice himself to the effect that anybody can make a certain case, can make a case here, and there are people who can count up their grievances once they get, so to speak, a lead. The matter lies there.  There has been a considerable amount of agitation in the Force with regard to it.  I do not know if any cause can be ascribed to it.</P>
    <P>There is quite a big percentage of wastage in the Garda.  I understand that the training is sufficiently good here that, after people have been subjected to it, they can immediately, on leaving the Force here, get much more responsible positions and better pay in Britain.  It is occurring not merely in the Civic Guard area but over the whole population.  One would expect that after trying to get recruits of a certain standard and then giving them a certain training, a certain educational value, we would at least try to keep those people here.  It does not seem to me that any very great increase will be required.  I know it cannot compete with the salaries offered, say, in the London Metropolitan Police but that is not where the wastage is, in the main: it is all over the country.  Even outside the police force, people are being given quasi-police status on the other side.</P>
    <P>Anybody hoping for a betterment of the situation because of increased emoluments given to the Garda must have lost confidence when he realised the recent increases and realised he is up against the recent cost of living figure, apart altogether from the more important matter of the cost of living outside.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1667" /> A lot of the Minister's speech was taken up with the revision of the Garda rates of pay, Garda conciliation, the rent allowance and the increase in police pensions.  Could the Minister not find it possible to get any satisfaction amongst members of the Garda themselves?  They cannot but accept with a great deal of cynicism the statements by members of the Government and Parliamentary Secretaries from time to time at functions and dinners with regard to the state of prosperity in the country.  The comment you will hear from many a Garda is: &ldquo;If there is prosperity, we are not sharing in it and are not being given any extra cut. If there is a bigger national cake, it is divided in ways in which we do not get what we think is an appropriate ration from it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement about the drop in the figures for indictable crimes is that the number of such crimes reported dropped from 17,865 in 1959 to 15,375 in 1960, a decrease of 2,490 or 14 per cent.  We will take the statistics as they are given to us.  The editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> almost immediately pointed out that it was not much in the way of a boast because the figures for 1959 were an all-high record&mdash;the highest this country ever had.  So, to get some decline from that, the figures are not in themselves a great deal to boast about.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> article was not absolutely correct.  I understand the figures for 1959 are not merely lower than those for the year before but for the year before that again. These two years showed an upward trend and the decline is something not to be boasted about.  A couple of years ago, I referred to a statement made by a very well known social reformer who was on a visit to this country, making investigations.  When the figures for indictable crime reported to the Garda for that year were brought to his notice, he expressed horror.</P>
    <P>This man was used to delving into reports on crime in London and other big industrial cities and in Glasgow and various other parts of Scotland. <Col N="1668" /> Having expressed horror, he added that, in relation to delinquency, crimes and indictable offences, one must always remember the tremendous out-flow from Ireland by way of emigration. He made what to me was a surprising statement then but I have heard it commented upon favourably since.  He pointed out that a certain proportion of the delinquents appearing in the courts in Britain are really from amongst our emigrants.  That can be overdone.  However, I know that people in responsible positions in our offices in England were approached by police magistrates there who were very seriously concerned at the number of young Irish girls as well as young Irishmen who appear before them classified generally as juvenile delinquents.</P>
    <P>In any event, it surprises me.  I thought a person who wanted to play delinquent might prefer to do it at home rather than go off to a strange country in order to start a new type of career there but I have been assured by people engaged in social reform that that is recognised. If we have it to say that indictable crimes reported have dropped, we must remember that drop will have to be compared with the drop in population.  I do not know how the figures are worked out but one of these days when we get the census figures, we should have some standard to go by.</P>
    <P>On minor offences, the Minister's statement said the figures relate to the number of prosecutions for summary offences and not the number of offences committed.  The reason for this, he said, was that it would be impossible to say how many summary offences were committed since a substantial number of them, such as minor breaches of road traffic laws, never find their way into the Garda records.  Then some figures did follow in the next paragraph.  The number of prosecutions&mdash;these are summary offences&mdash; rose from 89,000 approximately in 1959 to 103,000 approximately in 1960, an increase of some 14,000.  Of course that sounds terrible until one reads the next line or two, &ldquo;which, I may say, was due entirely to an increase in the number of prosecutions for road traffic <Col N="1669" /> offences.&rdquo; Nearly half of that increase relates to offences against lighting regulations.  The prosecutions for those offences increased by over 6,000 to a figure of 28,253 in 1960.  The Minister made the surprising comment that he thinks that in the interests of road safety, the House generally will welcome this evidence of increased vigilance with regard to breaches of lighting regulations.  As well as that, the statement said there were increases in respect of all the common driving offences.</P>
    <P>We then get a reference to a number of prosecutions under the Licensing Acts.  I put those really on the same footing as road traffic offences, particularly licensing prosecutions.  They are all very minor and I think the police could be better occupied in trying to prevent, or in detecting, serious crime rather than having so much of their time taken up with lighting and general road traffic offences.  As regards the licensing laws, I have often felt that it would be much better if the police were told not to pay so much attention to breaches of these laws.  Let people have their amusement, even though it means staying on in a licensed house beyond the appropriate time, but, apparently, it is one of the great standards the Garda have, if the number of prosecutions they find it possible to bring from time to time for breaches of the licensing laws is high.</P>
    <P>The other interesting comment made in this connection concerns the only other figures that are of any significance numerically in connection with summary offences.  These relate to unlicensed dogs.  The number of prosecutions increased by over 500 to 4,090. That record, a page and a bit, is, to my mind, a record of futility.  It is certainly a record of misapplied energy.  If the police, particularly in Dublin, are to be occupied in putting labels on windscreens of cars owned by people who commit trivial breaches of parking regulations or meeting people out on bicycles that have not got a red light at the rear or have no front light, and more particularly, if they are to be wasting time looking after the number of unlicensed dogs, <Col N="1670" /> they certainly will not have time for serious work.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister indicate to us, when he talks about charges in connection with unlicensed dogs, what fraction of the number of dogs in the country does he think are licensed. I believe it is more the rule than the exception for persons who have dogs to take out licences for them.  If there are prosecutions of people having dogs without licences, even that record, although it increased by over 500 up to 4,090, is merely scratching at the problem.  It would be far better to abolish the system of having dog licences altogether rather than have the real contempt of the law that is indicated by those who own unlicensed dogs.</P>
    <P>Here is a question I have asked for three years in succession.  Are we ever going to get any improvement in court procedure in regard to things like this? I have brought the matter to the notice of this House on three occasions already and I now mention it for the fourth time.  The procedure in England for trivial offences under what was called the Magistrates Courts Act is more realistic and there is an effort being made to introduce something like that Act in connection with traffic offence legislation going through there at the moment.  It is not confined to traffic legislation.  I think it is used also in regard to people who travel on the underground or on the ordinary railway system without a ticket or with a ticket that does not entitle them to travel in the class of compartment in which they are found.</P>
    <P>The system in England is that these cases hardly ever result in a person being brought to court.  The procedure is, I understand&mdash;I am not speaking with any accuracy or quoting from any official information &mdash; that anybody caught committing a trivial offence is given a notice that he has committed a breach of whatever statute it may be.  He is told the maximum penalty that may be imposed, whatever it may be.  There is a procedure whereby he is warned by letter that he has been found guilty of a certain offence and he is told what the penalty is and asked <Col N="1671" /> if he wishes to pay the penalty.  A further notice is sent by the police to the effect that if he likes to come to court and if he has anything to say about the case, he may do so and waste his time and money in that way.</P>
    <P>Well below five per cent. of these cases ever reach the stage of an appearance by a defendant or an accused person in court.  In addition to the accused not having to come to court, it means, if a person accepts the penalty and admits that he is guilty and pays the fine, there is no question, as we used to see in regard to railway offences, of a guard or conductor having to come to court to produce strictly formal proof, say what the fare was and how the person was discovered on a section of the line.  All that is done away with and the result is a great saving of time for railway officials, not merely those in the operating section but even the administrative people. That pertains here to an extent much worse apparently than it ever was in England.  It did pertain here, and still does, in regard to motoring offences, parking on the wrong side of the street, parking for too long, no lights and all the rest.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the system has improved since the days when I used to visit the district court but it was certainly a scandal to see the amount of time and energy involved in connection with this type of offence. You had the amazing performance of mass swearing of about ten or 12 Gardaí at the same time, all striving to get their finger-tips to touch the Testament.  Then each member of the ten or 12 concerned in that collective fashion read out a statement of offence and the general situation was that there was a call around the court to find whether the offender was present.</P>
    <P>If it was an ordinary offence connected with a bicycle or a parking offence and the defendant was not present, the district justice generally fined him a little more than he would if the defendant had come down to court.  If the defendant came to court, the questions generally ran along a regular line: What was he?  Was he self-employed?  Was he employed by <Col N="1672" /> someone else?  Was he let off to come to court?  Would he lose wages and, if so, what wages would he lose? Then, if he would lose wages because of his absence from work, a 10/- fine was reduced to 2/6 or a 5/- fine was reduced to 1/-.  If the defendant did not appear for this rather fatuous performance, he was fined more heavily.</P>
    <P>Further, if a defendant was fined, even if he were prepared to pay on the spot, the fine would not be accepted from him there and then.  I believe that was because the sheet before the district justice had naturally to have a whole heap of entries made on it; and, unless the individual was lucky enough to have his offence called when the district justice was at the end of the sheet, there was no question of taking the fine on the spot, as it were.  The district justice had to retain the sheet to make the entry which eventually becomes the entry in his minute book. Even if a defendant had the ready money on him to pay the fine, it would not be taken from him.  Even in the case where the district justice did hand down the sheet, there was no provision made in the district court office for the reception of money then and there in payment of fines.  The result was that the person was fined and subsequently a member of the Garda Síochána was sent out to collect the fine.</P>
    <P>I am told that on an average a Garda called at a person's house three times before he eventually got paid. It was a question of the man of the house being out, or there was not enough loose change to pay the fine, or there was no one in the house.  It took three calls before the two half-crowns were collected.  Simultaneously there was another situation developing. Certain neighbours did not know for what purpose the Garda was calling and there grew a suspicion that the man concerned must be really guilty of some serious crime.  All that could be avoided by fines on the spot or by giving the offender a chit and making him pay the fine at an office, thereby putting the onus on him to pay it instead of on a member of the Garda Síochána to collect it.  If the defendant wanted to test the point, he <Col N="1673" /> could go to court; he could also go to court if he wished to query the amount of the fine.</P>
    <P>I make the suggestion again that the Magistrates Courts Act ought to be looked at and the procedure that has developed under it and the practice that has been established now over many years in England should be established here.  It would save a tremendous amount of time and a good deal of expenditure of energy, time and even money by the Garda Síochána in their fruitless efforts to collect small fines.  We have made an approach to this in road traffic matters.  How far that will go, I do not know.  In any event, the effort is being made on the departmental side.  I hope it will be successful and I hope the success in connection with road traffic will spur on those concerned to make other changes with regard to other trivial offences.</P>
    <P>I have on several occasions here queried the condition we found ourselves in in connection with the outbreak of war in 1939.  Under Article 28 of the Constitution, there could be declared in this country in certain circumstances a state of national emergency. From the point of view of the Constitution, such a development has this possible result, that, while a national emergency lasts, nothing in the Constitution may be invoked against legislation which is stated or expressed to be for the purpose of saving the State in time of war and nothing in the Constitution can be invoked against any activity which purports to be an activity under legislation of that type.</P>
    <P>Under Article 28, it does not matter whether or not war is raging in the country.  It is a question of whether there is a situation of war in which the country is not directly involved but in which conditions develop which bring about a state of national emergency. That national emergency lasts until the two Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash;both Houses have to pass that resolution&mdash;resolve that the national emergency has disappeared.  In 1939, on the outbreak of war, this House and the Seanad duly passed such a resolution. <Col N="1674" /> No nullifying resolution has ever been passed by either House and that means that this country is still considered to be involved in a national emergency, due to the outbreak of war in 1939.  Physically, the war ended in 1945.  Here we are, 16 years after, and there is no movement with regard to breaking up that situation of national emergency.</P>
    <P>I have never been able to find out why that condition has persisted here. I remember some years ago I made inquiries officially as to whether there was any serious administrative difficulty likely to arise if the state of national emergency were brought to an end.  I could not find in the suggestions made to me any that carried any particular appeal.  I think, again, this is just a matter of inertia on the part of certain Departments.  They are in the position that, if some difficulty does arise which cannot be met by the ordinary law under the Constitution, there is a way of meeting that situation. All that has to be done is to pass a piece of legislation and say in the title of that legislation that it is for the safe-guarding of the State at a particular time.  The courts cannot question that. They have already said so themselves. Once the resolution is passed, the legislation is beyond any question by them as to whether or not it is in fact required in a state of national emergency.</P>
    <P>The second point is that, if the law be based on its long title, then the Constitution does not count.  Further than that, if there is any activity under that legislation, no constitutional point and no question of the Constitution can be raised against anybody who either acts or purports to act in the carrying out of that type of legislation. It means that the Constitution, while not definitely in abeyance, can at any moment be put into abeyance by legislation passed with a certain addition to its title and, from that time on, the Constitution is of no avail to anybody.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have questioned several times as to what is the anxiety of any Department.  Where does anybody think a Department might be held <Col N="1675" /> up in any conceivable emergency if the national emergency proclaimed in 1939 were now brought to an end? I never got any reasonable explanation. Nobody ever had the nerve, so to speak, to put in minutes any statement of difficulties that might arise.  Certain suggestions were made that there might be conditions which would not be met under the ordinary law and could not be met by a piece of ordinary legislation because some constitutional issue might arise and it was, therefore, necessary to have some way of evading or nullifying the Constitution.  I do not see why that sort of thing should not be brought to an end&mdash;at once.</P>
    <P>I have already referred in another context to the question of State liability, more particularly in connection with private wrongs or torts. The situation in this country is that we have maintained much longer than England has the protection given to State servants by the extension of the old doctrine that the king can do no wrong and that he could not therefore authorise wrong to be done by his employees, agents or servants, so that if any injury were caused by a civil servant, it was unauthorised.</P>
    <P>Before the Road Traffic Acts broke through this, the situation was that if anyone were knocked down by a military lorry or a Post Office van, the right of action was against the driver of the vehicle involved and of course it was not much good, if the aggrieved person were looking for thousands of pounds, to proceed against a driver earning as low as £7 a week.  We have broken through that in a couple of cases.  The State liability is not a protection any more in connection with accidents that occur by reason of mechanically-propelled vehicles driven by State employees.  Similarly, in the Fatal Injuries Act, that was attended to and a workman employed by the State was put into the same category as a man working for a private firm or individual.</P>
    <P>But in all the other areas of life in which torts may be committed, if there is a State servant in the background, that servant is protected.  England has <Col N="1676" /> given this up for years and years under the Crown Proceedings Act and other such measures.  They have abandoned the old-time protection for State servants.</P>
    <P>The bogey that has always been raised in that connection is that if this protection did not exist, there would be a tremendous number of claims against the State and that the State would have to pay very heavily over the year and the Exchequer would suffer enormously.  That is not so.  It can be controverted by examination of cases over a number of years.  Under the law as it stands, any number of people could have suffered torts and they would have been left without any resort except against the State servant concerned.  I do not believe there are many such persons, but that is the excuse that is put up.  If that excuse about the danger of huge claims against the State, if the protection were withdrawn, is a reality, it means that a tremendous number of citizens are suffering from the extension in an out-rageous fashion of the doctrine that servants of the king must be protected. I believe it is time an end was put to that.</P>
    <P>There has been agitation in the House, by Parliamentary Question, in the past two or three months and there have been Ministerial statements on it. In this group of estimates, we have the Estimate covering the various courts. Under the Constitution, the judges of the High Court and of the Supreme Court are put into a position of strength.  They are told they are to be independent and, to enable them to feel that independence, they are given the fortification erected in defence of judges in many countries as a result of agitation.</P>
    <P>That fortification is that once a judge of either the High Court or Supreme Court is given his judicial office, he may not be removed from it, except under certain conditions.  Another thing is that the judge's emoluments may not be lowered during his term in office.  Under the Constitution, that only applies to the two types of judge mentioned but by legislation in the case of circuit court judges &mdash; the Courts of <Col N="1677" /> Justice Act of 1924&mdash;the same condi tions apply.  They are given the same tenure.</P>
    <P>That means, of course, that judges of the circuit court have not got the same constitutional protection as those of the High Court and the Supreme Court, but they have legal protection. If anybody wants to get rid of a circuit court judge, the Act of 1924 would have to be repealed.  That has not been done and nobody is thinking of it, but there are situations in connection with the judiciary which it might be well to discuss on this Estimate.</P>
    <P>One of the things judges have to sacrifice under the Constitution is that they may not take up other employment. The Constitution says a judge shall not be a member of either House of the Oireachtas and shall not hold any other office or position of emolument outside his appointment.  One of our judges&mdash;the President of the Circuit Court&mdash;is at present in Cyprus. The question was raised about him as to how that had come to happen under the terms of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>He might have resigned his post here.  He had sufficient years on the Bench to qualify for full pension, and the thought was put forward that he had retired on pension.  It turned out that was not the case and it was made known to the Dáil that he is holding down a judicial position in Cyprus <Col N="1678" /> and, at the same time, his post as President of the Circuit Court in Ireland.  In this case, he has to direct the circuit court administration here, and very often attend conferences on the administration of that court and we are asked to assume that he is doing that properly from Cyprus.</P>
    <P>Then a statement by the Taoiseach bore the meaning that Judge O Briain was not getting any emolument from the office.  Of course the Constitution does not say a judge shall not receive any other emolument.  It says he shall not be a member of either House of the Oireachtas and that he is not to hold any other office or position of emolument.  Does anybody seriously contend that a higher court in Cyprus is not an office of emolument?  It clearly is, and if Judge O Briain is in receipt of an emolument in Cyprus, while holding down a judicial position as President of the Circuit Court in Ireland, where then do we get?  It appears to me that the Chief Justice could be made Chairman of the Electricity Supply Board or of C.I.E. in the morning so long as he did not take any emolument.  That is, of course, the height of absurdity.</P>
