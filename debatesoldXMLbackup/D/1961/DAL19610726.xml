      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) of Section 3 states:</P>
      <P>A body so established shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a seal and with power to sue and to be sued in its corporate name and to hold land.</P>
      <P>There are precedents for this such as in the Voluntary Health Insurance Act.  The form there for such a body is &ldquo;to acquire, hold and dispose of land.&rdquo;  Do these words not require to be incorporated in the general powers of a corporation of this kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. This body will not be an independent body in the sense that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board is.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Board is, in fact, a commercial enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the statement that it has power to hold land mean that a situation can be brought about in which, having acquired land, the body might find itself unable to dispose of it, if it wished to do so?  There does not seem to be any power in such a body corporate to dispose of property which it has.  We are all aware of the difficulties which arise in the case of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would turn to the section which deals with the winding up of such bodies&mdash; Section 7.  It is contemplated that the property will be transferred only to certain persons &mdash;&ldquo;the Minister; any one or more than one other body established by an establishment order; any one or more than one health authority, or any one or more than one joint board of health authorities established under Section 45 of the Health Act, 1953.&rdquo;  It is not contemplated that it would be disposed of to a private person or as part of a commercial transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose that is contemplated.  We are all familiar with the problem that arises when a local authority acquires land to build some public amenity and then determines afterwards that it is not suitable <Col N="1803" /> or more suitable land becomes available. There used to be a provision that they had an obligation to sell that land back to the person from whom it was compulsorily acquired in the first instance.  In many cases, there was no power to sell the land.  That led to confusion.  Why does the Minister not give them that power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not contemplated that there will be health authorities. The position would probably be this: If an establishment order were made setting up a body which required to purchase property, it would, so to speak, be purchased on behalf of the Minister and held for him.  The purpose of the section is to make it definite that a body of this sort may hold land.  These bodies perform entirely subsidiary functions on behalf of the Minister for Health.  I am advised that it is not essential that their powers to purchase and dispose of land be specified in the Bill.  It suffices to state that they are entitled to hold land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right but if this Bill had been an Act, the Blood Transfusion Service would probably have been a body corporate under this Act.  Is that not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Blood Transfusion Service buy Pelican House and after a time find it might be more suitable to move into the suburbs and wish to dispose of Pelican House and purchase alternative premises in some other centre.  There is that power under this Bill to dispose of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they would not have power to dispose of Pelican House in that way because we are dealing with a body which at the moment is not covered by this Bill.  Perhaps it will come within the context of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It might.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It could if it were to pass the necessary resolution under Section 8.  It cannot be liquidated.  That is one of the provisions, that the process of liquidation does not have to be gone through.  If in those circumstances it were decided that the National Blood Transfusion Association were to become an established body under this Act, then the establishment order would provide for all those contingencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection 5 says that:</P>
      <P>The Minister may from time to time by order amend an establishment order made under this subsection.</P>
      <P>Subsection 3 establishes the body as a body corporate.  Subsection 4 says that all courts shall take judicial notice of the seal of a body so established.  It does seem to me a little bit contradictory that in this section we are setting up a body corporate to be subject to the judicial laws but that at the same time the Minister may amend the establishment order.  I personally do not object to that but we should put the matter in correct perspective.  Are these three subsections not in some way contradictory of one another?</P>
      <P>Further, under subsection 5, the Minister may amend an existing order. That means the Minister still has considerable autonomy over this particular body.  Such being the case, would the Minister care to indicate to the House that he is prepared to answer Parliamentary Questions, as he in fact indicated on the Second Stage he intended to do?  Would the Minister indicate to the House that whoever the successor to the present Minister may be will also be answerable to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot do that. But in any event, there is no inconsistency. I am sorry but the Deputy seems to be under a complete misapprehension. There is no inconsistency between any of the three subsections he has cited.  One gives power to establish a body corporate.  The other gives power to amend the establishment order by a further order, subsequently to be laid before the House. There is not any inconsistency in that. <Col N="1805" /> It might happen that it might be found desirable in practice to merge two bodies which have been established under separate establishment orders. Then the one establishment order would cover the merger and all the provisions to be made arising out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says, but, at the same time, does it not give the Minister full power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the Deputy on the Second Stage that the Minister has every power at present and that the purpose of this Bill is to bring under statutory control the functions and powers which the Minister can now exercise without the cognisance of the House.  These are powers which have been exercised by my predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is somewhat at cross purposes with my argument.  What I am trying to convey is this.  This is a new Bill&mdash; Section 3 is the main section of it&mdash; dealing with the setting up of these new bodies.  These bodies will be corporate bodies or statutory bodies, whatever you like to call them.  At the same time, there is another subsection which leaves the Minister the power to countermand anything they do.  I am not objecting to that, subject to the fact that the Minister is answerable to this House for anything he may do.  He has the majority behind him and he may do anything he wants to do.  It is natural to assume any subsequent Government will have the same, but I want to ensure that the Deputies have the right to query by Parliamentary Question any order the Minister may make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a reasonable demand to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not subsection 5 giving him that authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  The Minister must lay that amending order <Col N="1806" /> before the Dáil and it can then be discussed by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings me to the very point I want to make. Can it be dealt with by Parliamentary Question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not the judge of what can or cannot be dealt with by Parliamentary Question.  That is a power vested in the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather begging the question, if I may say so.  One of the main functions of Deputies, be they in opposition or in Government, is to come in here and query things that have passed into legislation.  We cannot discuss these things on Estimates because we are ruled out of order.  We cannot refer to legislation on Estimates.  Our sole defence for the public, for those we represent and for the democratic system as a whole is the procedure of Parliamentary Question.  I am merely asking the Minister to clarify whether this makes him subject to Parliamentary Question or not.  He says not, but I think it does.  If he is going to give a definite order to a corporate body&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am awfully sorry but really the point is this.  The Deputy misconstrues the function of a Parliamentary Question.  If he wanted to raise the administration of any one of these established bodies, the proper way to do it would be by motion before the House.  However, I am quite willing to answer, but I am not the judge as to what questions will be permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's reply that he is prepared to answer, but the difficulty is that he will not always be Minister for Health.  I am not saying that from an election point of view, but there will be subsequent Ministers for Health.  We are constantly passing legislation here but at the same time we are to an extent removing the functions of a Deputy. I want to ensure that all legislation we pass may be subject to Parliamentary <Col N="1807" /> Question, because I think it is the greatest safeguard of our freedom. If the Minister would just indicate whether he believes that to be the case in this instance, perhaps he could amend it accordingly.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In paragraph (b), page 3, to delete all the words in the paragraph after &ldquo;established&rdquo; in line 3.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this amendment is to ensure that where an existing corporate body established under the Companies Acts becomes an established body it will be possible to apply the Local Government Superannuation Act, 1956, to the staff of the limited company which becomes an established body.  In order to do that it may be necessary to modify the existing provisions of that Act.  For instance it may be necessary to modify them to enable credit to be given for service with the company when superannuation comes to be reckoned under the Local Government code.</P>
      <P>Again, it may be necessary to waive the condition of a superannuation contribution. It might happen that the staffs of some of these companies might have a pension scheme &mdash; we do not know if they have at the moment, but they might develop in that way &mdash; before they decide to pass the necessary resolution to enable them to become established bodies under this Act.  It might happen that they might have pension schemes of their own towards which no contribution had been paid. We could not apply the Local Government Superannuation code to the staffs of these bodies without modification in the manner proposed &mdash; giving credit, for instance, for service with the company before the company became transformed into an established body and, secondly, waiving the contribution addition which is a pre-condition of the Local Government Superannuation code.</P>

      <P>At the end of section 4, page 3, to insert two new subsections as follows: &mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) An establishment order or an order amending an establishment order may include provisions for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the application, with the consent of the Local Appointments Commissioners, of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Acts, 1926 and 1940 to appointments to offices under the body established by the establishment order as if it were a local authority but subject to any modifications specified in the order, and</P>
      <P>(b) the application of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 to the body as if it were a local authority but subject to any modifications (including modifications relating to service reckonable as pensionable service) which may, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government, be specified in the order.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where provision has been made in an establishment order or an order amending an establishment order for the application of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 to a body established by an establishment order (whether with or without modifications relating to service reckonable as pensionable service) and an officer of that body becomes a pensionable officer of a local authority, subsection (1) of section 11 of that Act shall, in its application to him, be construed as if the following paragraph were added to that subsection: &mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(i) service as a pensionable officer of a body established under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961 to which this Act has been applied under that Act or other service which would be reckonable by such body for the purposes of his superannuation&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&nbsp;(i) a local authority, or</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say so. The key words there are &ldquo;notwithstanding any restriction in any other Act.&rdquo;  The purpose of that phrase is to get over the difficulty under which entrance into local authority service is regulated by the Local Authorities (Officers and Employers) Act of 1926. This will facilitate the transfer of an officer from one of these established bodies into the service of a local authority if it is decided at any time that the services discharged by the body can be discharged by an ordinary local authority.  I cannot see any difficulty arising if there is not an office similar in every respect to the office previously held by the transferred officer.  In practice, I do not think any difficulty would arise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>3.  In page 4, before section 10, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister shall cause a copy of every order made by him under this Act to be sent, as soon as may be after the order is made, to each member of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>(2) Every order made by the Minister under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next seven days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>(3)  Non-compliance with subsection (1) of this section in respect of any member or members of either House of the Oireachtas shall not affect the validity, or the coming into operation, of an order made by the Minister under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to meet the points made by Deputy Dillon, Deputy Corish, and others on the Second <Col N="1811" /> Stage.  Under subsection (1) of this new section, each member of the Oireachtas will be sent a copy of the order made under this Act &ldquo;as soon as may be after the order is made.&rdquo; That is an innovation.  I do not think such a provision exists in any other statute.  Every member of the Oireachtas will now be put under notice, so to speak, that this establishment order has been made.  This is being done to meet the point made by Deputy Corish.</P>
    <P>Again, to meet the point made by Deputy Dillon that there was no provision in the section, as drafted, for annulling an order if either House so desired, we are introducing this amendment to cover that situation. Having regard to the fact that copies will be circulated, we have reduced the time from whatever the normal number of sitting days is down to seven.  I think that should be sufficient time for any member to move that an order be annulled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is unavoidably engaged and has asked me to take the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I should, perhaps, say at the outset that this Bill does not affect agricultural workers.  Their holidays are dealt with in separate legislation &mdash; the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Act, 1950.  As Deputies know, when the present Bill was introduced, the Minister for Agriculture was given leave to introduce a separate Bill providing for additional holidays for agricultural workers.  When I use the expression &ldquo;all workers&rdquo; or &ldquo;workers&rdquo; it should, therefore, be understood as referring to non-agricultural workers.</P>
      <P>The exclusion of agricultural workers from this Bill is by reference to the definition in the 1950 Act.  This involves no material change in the present position and such classes of employees as creamery workers will remain within the scope of the present Bill.</P>
      <P>Existing legislation providing for holidays for workers had its origin in the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936.  This Act provided that industrial workers should get at least one week's annual leave with pay in the year and, in addition, the six public holidays.  Two years later, shop workers were given a similar entitlement under the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938 but a distinction was made in the case of workers in special classes of shops who would normally have to work on public holidays, for example, refreshment houses and Sunday trading shops.  These workers were given a right to two consecutive weeks' annual leave with no entitlement to public holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, extended the benefit of statutory holidays to all workers whose salary was less than £350 a year, irrespective of the type of employment.  This Act provided for seven consecutive days' <Col N="1814" /> annual leave plus the public holidays, or compensatory leave or pay for workers who might have to work on a public holiday.  The provisions about annual leave in the 1936 Act were repealed and, for annual leave purposes, industrial workers were brought within the scope of the 1939 Act.</P>
    <P>Since 1939, a considerable number of workers have, through collective bargaining between trade unions and employers or otherwise, secured an additional week's annual leave.  Many workers have a statutory right to this extra leave by virtue of Orders of the Labour Court (made in accordance with proposals of Joint Labour Committees) or by virtue of Agreements registered under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>The Government would have preferred if all workers had been able to secure these additional holidays by collective bargaining.  However, it is clear that many workers are not in a position to do so.  It is mainly to bring the holiday allowance of these workers up to the present accepted standard that the Bill is being introduced.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a consolidating and amending measure.  It will cover all classes of workers, irrespective of salary or type of employment.  It proposes to abolish the distinction in existing legislation between workers who have a separate entitlement to public holidays and workers who have no such entitlement but get additional annual leave.  If this distinction were retained, certain employers, for instance those in Sunday trading shops and refreshment houses, would be obliged to give their workers three consecutive weeks' annual leave in the year without any option to give days off, or compensatory pay, in lieu of public holidays.  I am satisfied that a greater flexibility than this would be beneficial to both workers and employers.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is no wages ceiling in the new Bill.  The figure of £350 specified in the 1939 Act bears little relationship, of course, to present day money values.  I had considered the desirability of increasing this figure to, say £800 or £1,000 per annum, but <Col N="1815" /> I have now decided that it is not really necessary to prescribe any upper wage limit in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, proposes that all workers will have a minimum statutory entitlement to two weeks' annual leave each year plus the six public holidays, or compensatory leave or pay for workers who may be required to work on such public holidays.  As in existing legislation, the annual leave must normally be given in one continuous period and workers must be paid, in respect of that leave, two weeks' normal wages.  However, as at present, domestic workers may be given their leave in two periods of seven consecutive days and domestic workers who are in receipt of lodging may opt to forego annual leave in favour of compensatory payment.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in existing legislation for the granting of annual leave of non-domestic workers other than in one continuous period.  With the increase in the statutory minimum from seven to fourteen days, it is possible that a case may be made for staggered holidays for some classes of such workers.  Section 16 proposes that power be taken to deal with this by regulation.</P>
    <P>Some workers get, at present, in addition to one week's annual leave and public holidays, other days off with pay.  These days may be Church holidays or other holidays customary in particular parts of the country.  I think that many of these workers and their employers would wish to continue such arrangements.  Accordingly, the Bill contains a new provision that such extra holidays may be counted as annual leave up to a maximum of seven days in any year.</P>
    <P>The Bill re-enacts provisions in existing legislation about the payment to workers, who leave employment before they receive annual leave, of an appropriate proportion of holiday pay. This payment is known as &ldquo;cesser&rdquo; pay under the 1939 Act.  With the increased annual leave, the amount of cesser pay to which any worker will be entitled in respect of a particular <Col N="1816" /> period will, of course, be proportionately higher under the new Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that workers should get six public holidays in the year with pay.  In general, under the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, the carrying on of industrial work on public holidays is prohibited.  There are, however, a number of exceptions to this, for example, some types of shift work and work covered by special exclusions.  In non-industrial employments many workers would, in the normal course of their employment, be required to work on all or most of the public holidays. Even where public holiday work was not a normal feature of his job, a worker might, in exceptional circumstances, have to work on an odd public holiday.  It is, therefore, necessary and desirable to retain the various alternatives which existing legislation provides to cover such cases.</P>
    <P>A worker who is required to work on a public holiday will, therefore, be entitled to one or other of the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)a day off, with pay, within a month; or</P>
    <P>(b)an additional day, with pay, added to his annual leave or</P>
    <P>(c)extra payment for the public holiday.</P>
    <P>The 1939 Act provided for payment of a worker who worked on a public holiday and who was not given a compensatory holiday, at a minimum rate of time and a quarter.  The Bill proposes that this rate be increased to double time.  This rate is fairly common practice in industrial employment but it is by no means universal.</P>
    <P>I consider that the higher rate is justifiable.  The real purpose of this section in the Bill, is to give workers a right on a public holiday to the day off with pay.  Employers have considerable flexibility in arranging for compensatory time off for workers who are required to work on a public holiday.  The increase in the rate of pay from time and a quarter to double time does not therefore impose any burden.</P>
    <P>A number of provisions in existing legislation are being retained either unchanged <Col N="1817" /> or with minor amendments. For instance, the Bill continues the provision that an employer who dismisses a worker immediately before a public holiday must, if the worker has worked for the qualifying period, pay him a day's pay in respect of the holiday. Workers will continue to be entitled to get annual leave within their employment year, i.e., a year counting from the date or anniversary of the date, of entry into employment.  A worker whose remuneration includes board and lodgings must be given a specified daily allowance in lieu while on holidays but the rate of allowance prescribed in the 1939 Act is being appropriately increased.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was in course of preparation, I received suggested amendments from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and a number of these have been incorporated in the present text. I intend to propose some other amendments on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill contains the usual provisions relating to offences, prosecutions, penalties, and powers of inspectors.  I do not think they call for any particular comment other than to say that the fines have been revised upwards to take account of the change in the value of money.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that the House will agree that the proposals in this Bill are reasonable and timely.  The Government has proceeded with its preparation and introduction with all possible speed so as to ensure that workers will derive benefit from its provisions during the present holiday season.  There is a provision in the Bill which will give workers an entitlement to the additional annual leave retrospective to the beginning of the employment year current at the commencement of the Act.  To enable these hopes to be realised I look forward to a speedy passage of the Bill through its stages in the House.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill to which which we have no objection.  It is rather unusual in my experience for a Bill of this kind to be introduced by the Minister's colleague.  The House is always very glad to make allowance if indisposition or public engagements <Col N="1818" /> abroad prevent the attendance of a Minister but I understand the Minister for Transport and Power has merely informed the House that the Minister has another engagement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in this strange position that when we seek to facilitate the Government by the prompt despatch of business, we are told the Minister is not here to do the business. I must recall to the House, and indeed to the Minister for Transport and Power, that members of the Executive would be wise to bear in mind the fundamental fact that whatever prestige in our society they enjoy which derives from this House is by being loyal servants of this House.  They are Ministers of the Irish Government.  It is an unseemly thing for a Bill of this character to be brought before the House by someone other than the Minister responsible for it and that a prepared statement should be read out to the House by a Minister who, naturally, knows little or nothing about the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may make an observation, this Bill, in so far as I know, is agreed generally and it is really a Bill where minor points can be discussed on Committee Stage.  I do think it is a Committee Stage Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister. It is substantially a Committee Stage Bill, inasmuch as the principle is generally accepted.  Nevertheless, I feel bound to record surprise and regret at the absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when a Bill of this kind is brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1819" /> I have always taken the view, and still do, that as a general rule relations between employers and workers in this country are best provided for by free negotiation between employers and workers, but I recognise that as time moves on we can with propriety lay down certain minimum requirements which contribute to an improvement in the general social pattern of the State.  These minimum requirements here set out in regard to holidays will command pretty general support in the country.</P>
    <P>I understand that provision is made here where special circumstances make it impossible for a man to be absent from his work at a busy time that by mutual agreement between employer and employee, overtime will be paid instead.  It is important to provide that, supposing the requirements of the business in which employer and employee are jointly concerned make it physically impossible to provide the holiday at the appropriate time, by mutual agreement, some alternative device can be employed adequately to compensate the employee or to provide him with a holiday at some other time. All advances of this kind are to be welcomed so long as we are satisfied that we can afford them.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the provisions of this Bill will not impose any excessive burden on the costs of production in this country, but I do think it is no harm to look across the water and see there the dilemma into which the British people appear to have got themselves at the present time by allowing output to fall behind the reward that employer and employee have thought proper for themselves for the work they have done.  The fact that these matters must be borne in mind provides the occasion for saying that when we speak of increasing the reward for work done we should have present to our mind that the increasing of costs is not a burden to be borne only by those who work for wages in any branch of industry or trade.</P>
    <P>In the recent encyclical letter of the Pope, it was pointed out that the evolution of economic thought pointed towards <Col N="1820" /> the sharing of managerial responsibility and reward by both employer and employee.</P>
    <P>It is also true that the cost of production must be equitably shared between both parties to any business enterprise.  If, as I think it is generally agreed now, this Bill represents the reasonable minimum which I think is probably operative in both areas in industrial employment in this country at the present time, it will not involve any substantial charge on the production costs and, even if it does, it is probably true that whatever additional charge will come in course of payment can be absorbed by the companies or organisations which employ employees affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Both employer and employees will recall, I am confident, that with each step in the improvement of the employees' conditions and in the expansion of the dividends paid to shareholders, there must be a corresponding increase in the productivity of the organisations where this increase in reward is allowed.  What is important to remember is that if regard is to be had to this aspect of the matter, it should be had not only in regard to wages but to dividends as well.  Nothing is more important in industrial relations, to my way of thinking, than that justice should be done and that justice should be seen to be done. Nothing is more destructive of satisfactory industrial relations than that employees should feel that all the sacrifices are called for from them, while none are imposed on those who hold capital in the firm in which they are working.</P>
    <P>It often strikes me that people are prone to overlook that fact.  When we invest capital in a firm or business, and employ 10, 100 or 1,000 men or women, I think we should not too readily overlook the fundamental fact that apart from the day's work the man who works for wages contributes, he is contributing something infinitely more precious to him.  He is contributing to the success of the enterprise his most precious asset, and that is his useful working years of life.  That is as much an investment in the ultimate success of the enterprise as any money <Col N="1821" /> or property which the shareholders on their side invest.  If those factors are constantly borne in mind it will be easier for all to recognise their obligation to maintain output so as to meet the charges that come in course of payment as a result of improved conditions or improved dividends.</P>
    <P>I am glad to notice in such statistical returns as are available to us that the individual output in most industrial firms in this country tends to rise and in so far as individual effort produces larger output, improvement of the kind envisaged in this Bill can legitimately be fixed as the minimum for all.  I should be interested to hear, however, before this Bill is finally disposed of, how far it will expand the holidays at present generally provided in industrial and mercantile employment.  Are there many industrial and mercantile enterprises which provide less than a fortnight's holidays in a year for their employees?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Unorganised perhaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Even unorganised.  I should be astonished to hear there are many people working in industrial or mercantile employment who get less than a fortnight's holidays generally.  Mind you, this is a thing which requires to be said: I know of certain enterprises where the employees are already getting more than a fortnight's holidays, and I take it that the view of this House is that where that is already the case, this Bill is not to be regarded as in any sense an invitation to change the existing practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we should be asked to dispose of this Bill on Second Stage without being furnished by the Minister with some estimate of the number of persons who are at present getting less than the minimum number of holidays prescribed in this Bill.  I should think the number would be very few.  If I am correct in that it is a further argument for the principle of the Bill.  I do not suppose, in view of the fact that we have not got the Minister for Industry and Commerce with us, that the Minister for Transport and Power has got very much <Col N="1822" /> information about it, but he may be able to get those important statistics for us.  If he can, I should certainly be glad to have them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather unfortunate that Deputy Dillon should comment on the present position in England in a discussion on this Bill.  He implied that the application of this Bill when it becomes an Act might lead to a similar position here where productivity would decline and we might find ourselves in a state where our imports would exceed our exports continually.  The present position in England is not caused, I suggest, by want of productivity on the part of the workers but because of a change to Tory Government, and because of the fact that those who produce, the people who do the work, are not people who support that Government. If everything is aimed against your interests you will naturally not attempt to give of your best.  You will only give it when you see a return for what you do.  The present position in England, which is of no concern to us except in so far as it affects us indirectly, has been brought about by the mismanagement of a Party which is not in tune with the productivity units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland we had appeals for productivity from the workers, to do more work in the same time.  We are willing to do that and have done it, but no man should be asked to produce more to work himself out of a job.  In the past that was the position but there has been a change.  Employers have realised that there is only one way to secure more productivity and that is to give the man who is producing a share in that productivity.  So much so is that true that incentive bonuses have now come into their own right.  Time and motion study experts are aware of that and the workers are being given a fair share of the money realised from increased productivity.  Workers must all the time demand that they get their share from the increased work they do and also that the money accruing to employers, rather than being converted into dividends, should be used to reduce prices so that the export market or the sales at home will be increased. <Col N="1823" /> Instead of increased productivity leading to a loss of employment it should be utilised so that workers can have some assurance of continuity in employment.  That is essential.</P>
    <P>I should like to say for the record that I was glad to read in the Pope's Encyclical issued recently that His Holiness not only recognised that right of the worker but said what we have been saying, that in certain circumstances the workers have a moral right to share with management.  Until such time as that is recognised and until it is granted you will not have between workers and capital&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be going outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise but I was tempted by Deputy Dillon's point.  The Labour Party have for a number of years been pressing the Government to introduce such legislation as is incorporated in the Bill.  We have nearly always received the reply that this was the duty of the trade unions, a matter between the unions and employers. That is quite so and we accept it.  As Deputy Dillon has indicated, in practically all places where industrial employment is carried on and where trade unions have organised workers, we have secured concessions as good as if not better than those incorporated in the present Bill.</P>
      <P>I still think the Bill is serving an excellent purpose in so far as it is granting at least a minimum amount of holidays to the unorganised section of the workers.  That is essential because these unorganised firms, usually in small, isolated towns had an advantage when competing with a firm which granted the full two weeks' holidays, plus the public holidays, as a right to the workers.  They were able to deliver their produce and service places when other firms were on holidays. They were taking the part of the cut-price shops in relation to ordinary distributors in a city.  I feel it is time the Government stepped in and compelled them to give at least a certain minimum rest period to their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1824" /> I would like to draw attention to the fact that when Deputy Norton was Minister for Industry and Commerce he advised our representatives at the International Labour Office to support a resolution for a statutory two weeks' holiday for workers throughout their sphere of influence.  That is an indication that, as far back as four or five years ago, our Party were pressing, and they have continued to press, for a Bill such as this to be brought in.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that in the present age with so much machine work it would be necessary for workers to get an equal period of rest compared with what they had ten or 12 years ago.  We all know that, in this machine age, the accident rate will be increasing continually unless workers are rested and get a proper period for vacation.  Otherwise the accident rate will increase, sometimes with fatal results. I would suggest for that reason, and because of the strain of present day industrial conditions, that a longer holiday period is badly needed. While we welcome the Bill and hope the House will press it we feel there are some points that require to be amended.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that he had discussions with the Irish Trade Union Congress.  I realise the Minister is substituting for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and perhaps had not got the information but I regret that we did not get any indication of what shape the amendments contemplated will take. Perhaps some of the points I was going to suggest will be covered by these amendments.  I hope the further amendments will cover points raised by the T.U.C. representatives because the Minister would be very well-advised in all these matters to seek, and as far as possible to implement, the views of the T.U.C. which speaks as the united body for all trade union workers in the country.</P>
    <P>It is the feeling of the Trade Union Congress that Good Friday should be made a public holiday.  We have received the views of the workers on this and each and every representative of the various types of workers, whether distributors, industrial workers, <Col N="1825" /> or various other types of worker have the view that Good Friday is a day on which they should be entitled to a public holiday.  I am sure that point has been made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce by the trade union representatives.  If it is not one of the amendments which the Minister for Industry and Commerce intends to bring in I am quite sure my Party will be putting it forward as an amendment and giving the reasons why the Minister should accept it.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the qualifying period for annual and public holidays.  We believe some of the hours required to qualify should be reduced and that a period of sickness, say for at least eight weeks in the year, should count.  In this Bill we have a wet time maximum of a certain number of weeks.  We believe that sickness of an employee up to a limited period should also count as a qualifying period for the public holidays and for annual holidays.  I am quite sure that the trade union representatives have put forward their views but the Labour Party will be putting forward an amendment to cover that point.  We can discuss a Bill of this sort only in a detailed way.  We shall give various reasons for the figures and hours we put forward.</P>
    <P>Take the question of working on a public holiday.  We appreciate and accept as an improvement that prior to this Bill the Act permitted only time and a quarter for those who had to work on a public holiday.  We appreciate that that has now been increased to double pay.  That has been secured by the trade unions for a long number of years.  Very few employees, except probably unorganised workers, had to work for time and a quarter when they were required to work on a public holiday. Many trade unions have secured treble pay or double pay and a day off.  The Labour Party will be putting forward an amendment that the Bill should at least aim at that.</P>
    <P>We believe that unless it is vitally necessary for an employer to compel a worker to work on a public <Col N="1826" /> holiday, the worker should be permitted to enjoy the same facilities as all the workers around him.  Amusements and events are arranged to fall on public holidays.  If a man must work on a public holiday it means he has to work when all other workers are out enjoying themselves.  He and his family must be absent from notable events on those days. Theoretically, everybody should be free on those days.  If an employer deliberately takes back a man to work on a public holiday, we feel a little more than double pay should be required.</P>
    <P>I have failed to find in the Bill annual holidays for insurance agents working on a commission basis.  I am aware that trade union representatives have put forward to the Minister for Industry and Commerce a suggestion that some type of regulation should be made so as to arrange in some way for a compensatory payment or holiday period for such types of agents, whether they be insurance agents or any other people working on commission.  We feel that because they are working on commission, they should not be deprived of the same rights as nearly all other workers, domestic servants and all the various types of workers have.  We realise there is a difficulty.  We suggest that, with goodwill, some type of scheme could be worked out.  We hope to submit an amendment dealing with that matter if the Minister is unable to indicate that he will bear it in mind and endeavour to meet it.  I trust that the amended Bill will go through this House and will speedily become law.  We welcome its introduction.</P>

      <P>As a person who remembers the time when men, particularly manual workers, worked from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., the time when there was no such thing as even a half-holiday, never mind holidays with pay, I welcome this addition to the better conditions offered to working people, no matter what their grade.  I prefer at any time to see holidays of that description offered rather than reduced hours of work, though I remember when they worked <Col N="1827" /> all day long, all the week long, without holidays or anything else.</P>
      <P>As a person who worked in these conditions I often think there is too much leisure sometimes for the ordinary working man.  It is much better to give the holidays in such a way that they can really be enjoyed. I welcome this Bill.  It is an increased benefit to working people.  We all know that every increase in benefit will be followed, as time passes, by further benefits.  I am happy that during my time in this House very many benefits have been given to the working people by the Party to which I belong.  I am very proud of that fact.

      <P>It is quite correct to say, as Deputy Kyne said &mdash; and Deputy Dillon posed a question with regard to it &mdash; that much that is now being offered is actually in operation in co-operation with the trade union movement and the employers, outside Fianna Fáil or any other Government. We know the difficulty.  It is essential to bring the unorganised workers up to the same level as that of organised workers from the viewpoint of holidays. we welcome this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As mentioned by Deputy Kyne, and perhaps unknown to Deputy Loughman, there are points which we would wish to bring to the notice of the Minister.  The trade union movement have already done so.  One of the points mentioned by the trade union movement in their submission to the Minister, and by Deputy Kyne, is that we believe Good Friday should be declared a public holiday.  It is about time we realised that that is a day that <Col N="1828" /> should be a public holiday.  On Committee Stage, when we shall have more opportunity to discuss it, this matter may be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the possibility of further amendments.  Naturally, at this stage, we do not know what line the Minister may take.  In view of his discussions with the trade union movement, we are not so sure that he is inclined to take the line of declaring Good Friday a public holiday as we think should be done.</P>
    <P>I come now to Section 9.  What about the worker whose work is suspended but not terminated?  I know of employers who, even under existing legislation have been denying the worker his rights because his work has been declared to be suspended.  I think that provision should be made, particularly in the case of the suspension of work, whereby the worker will not lose.  The only way that can be done is by tightening up this Bill before it becomes law and ensuring that, in the case of suspension of employment, the worker concerned will not suffer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne referred to how workers may be affected through illness. Again, that is a matter of great importance.  With the introduction of this Bill, it should not be impossible for the Minister to come to some agreement.  In expressing our views we are expressing the views of the trade union movement.  Undoubtedly, some provision should be made in the year in the case of illness.  Some employers &mdash; decent employers &mdash; have, by agreement, been working on such a basis with their workers.  If that is the position in regard to some individual cases between employers and employees, there is no reason why it should not be made compulsory in the case of those who do not wish to adopt such an attitude.  The one way we can do that is by providing in the Bill the necessary safeguards for such workers.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of those workers who are employed on a commission basis.  So far as we can see, they are not being included.  I think that is unfair.  If we are to look at some of the disputes between employers and workers in this category in the industrial field even over the past couple of <Col N="1829" /> years, it will be found that some of those employers will not be co-operative if they can evade their responsibilities by pointing out that there is no provision in the Bill whereby the benefits provided for others are offered to those employed on a commission basis. If that is not tightened up in the future as in the past, these workers will not get the benefits which we believe should be theirs.</P>
    <P>What about the position of casual workers?  Deputy Kyne drew attention to the number of hours necessary to qualify.  I see from my experience of the building industry the difficulties of the casual workers.  I believe that the present number of hours for qualification are too high.  We know that in the building industry and to a large degree in relation to dockers many people are employed in a casual way.  Unless the number of hours for qualification is reduced somewhat, many of those people will not get the benefits.  Even though Deputy Loughman hopes for much publicity for this Bill &mdash; I do not blame him &mdash; it is essential to let the public and the casual workers know of its provisions.  Unless there is an amendment by the Minister or by others asking the Minister's co-operation, these casual workers will not get the benefits we all hope for.  The reduction of hours for qualification purposes applies perhaps even more in the case of juveniles.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Kyne, I appreciate the fact that this is more of a Committee Bill.  In expressing these views, we know we are expressing the views not only of our own Party but also of the trade union movement.  I would ask the Minister to have these matters considered. Naturally enough, if the Minister brings in amendments, it would be much more helpful to all concerned than if we were to put them down because in the latter event the Minister might take a different view from ours.</P>
    <P>I could not agree with the doubts expressed by Deputy Dillon.  It is non-sensictl to suggest that there might be a danger to the overall economy of this country by offering these workers &mdash;they may not yet get the holidays&mdash; equal rights.  It will not affect the economy of the country in the way <Col N="1830" /> that Deputy Dillon seems to suggest. It will give to these workers a deep sense of satisfaction and a feeling that at least they will be on a par with those who have been enjoying the benefits for some years past.  It may help to make the workers, who will get the benefits, more contented in their own country instead of their being obliged to go abroad to get much more advantageous benefits in the same categories.</P>

      <P>I am prompted to say something when I hear Deputy Loughman come along with what I have been calling in this House for the past month Fianna Fáil clap-trap about the liberal policy of Fianna Fáil towards the workers.</P>
      <P>We all welcome this Bill and why should we not?  We are not a rich people.  Most of us are not so far from the period when our people had to work with their hands.  Anything Dáil Éireann can do to make the lot of the worker in Ireland a better one is desirable. For Deputy Loughman to say that this was only following the liberal policy of Fianna Fáil towards the workers is ridiculous because the record of Fianna Fáil towards the workers is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>They were the Government who were able to impose a standstill Order. They were the Government who were able to baton the teachers of Dublin in the streets.  Only the other day a section of the Minister's Department were able to stand over the lock-out of the busmen.  They are the Government who brushed off the nurses and insulted the doctors.</P>

      <P>It was mentioned by Deputies that Good Friday should be recognised as a holiday.  There is no doubt it should because it commemorates the most solemn occasion in the whole of the world's history.  We, as a Christian and Catholic people, should recognise it as a general holiday in this country.  I am sure that, if and when it is recognised as a general holiday, we will recognise it for the solemn occasion it commemorates.  I listened to a Brains Trust programme from Great Britain a couple of years ago when there was a discussion as to whether it was right or not to play football on Christmas Day and Good Friday.  Every angle of the matter was discussed, but nobody introduced the name of God or mentioned the solemn occasions these two days commemorate. If the Government should decide to make Good Friday a general holiday, we in Ireland would respect that day and use it to commemorate that great occasion.</P>
      <P>I do not withdraw what I said about the policy of Fianna Fáil.  I welcome this Bill because it is a step in the right direction in giving organised workers the opportunity of a holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank Deputies for their constructive and welcoming attitude towards this Bill.  Deputy Dillon asked me to state how far it would affect various groups of workers already within the State. All we know is that the majority of organised workers already receive two weeks' holidays, but beyond that there are no records upon which to base a firm assertion in regard to the percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also referred to the <Col N="1832" /> incidence of costs arising from the increased holiday period on the public and the State in general.  All I can say is that there has been a remarkable increase in productivity in industry during the last few years and that if the right kind of atmosphere can be maintained between employers and workers in dealing with all questions of conditions in industry, wages, hours and so on, and if they can work together for the common good to their mutual advantage, it should be possible to absorb costs of this kind so that the community in general would benefit and not suffer from any disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne made a helpful contribution to that, as did Deputy Dillon, when they said that the workers should feel a sense of confidence that they are getting a proper share of the monetary results of increased productivity. Equally, the workers should feel that the profits of industry are being sufficiently ploughed back into enabling costs of production to be lowered and that they themselves will share adequately in increased profits resulting from increased business.</P>
    <P>I should say &mdash; and I am sure I am speaking for the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; that in relation to the present period through which we are going we do have to exercise the very greatest care in respect of the full and fair exchange of information between employers and workers so that the growth in industrial exports will not be in any way hindered by unwise action in respect of any element of costing.  I am sure, in relation to the effects of the holiday period on industrial costs, both the employers and the workers will take full account of surveys in the foreign markets to which we send our goods, changes in the pattern of trade and changes in the growth of demand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne referred to the questions that have been put forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions relating to this Bill and which have not actually been dealt with in the Bill in one way or another as yet.  I think the best thing I can do to help Deputies is to give an account of the proposals made by the Congress and the attitude of the Minister for <Col N="1833" /> Industry and Commerce towards them. When I say &ldquo;the attitude of the Minister&rdquo; I should state he is considering action on the lines I am going to indicate between now and the Committee Stage.  I cannot absolutely commit the Minister.  He may no doubt have made up his mind on certain changes definitely now.  On the other hand, he may want to consider the proposals of the Congress before the Committee Stage finally comes to the House.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions proposed that the qualifying period for work for entitlement to public and annual holidays be reduced from 150 hours over a four or five week period to 120 hours and, at the other end of the scale, from 1,800 hours to 1,440 hours respectively, to take account of reductions in the working hours since 1939 &mdash; in other words, that there should be further action taken by the Minister to allow for the fact that working hours in general have been reducing and are still reducing.</P>
    <P>The Minister is considering a compromise. He is considering that it might be wise that the qualifying period be reduced to 135 hours and 1,600 hours respectively, as compared with the 120 hours and 1,440 hours proposed by the Congress.  I hope the Deputies in the Labour Party and other Deputies interested will consider that would be a reasonable compromise.  I should add that it is based on a reduction in the working week of from, generally speaking, 48 hours to 44 hours.  On that basis the Minister has made his provisional suggestion for the compromise number of hours.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have raised the question in regard to Good Friday and have suggested it be recognised as a holiday for workers in this Bill.  I understand the Minister is not prepared to accept that suggestion because all present holidays are declared public holidays and the declaration of a public holiday is a matter of significance with implications beyond that of a holiday for workers.  In other words, the question of what constitutes a public holiday goes beyond the question of what constitutes rest periods for workers and is a matter for consideration <Col N="1834" /> apart from this Bill.  It may be possible for the Minister to provide, however, that any day declared by the Government to be a public holiday can be described as one for the purposes of the Bill, so that, should the Government at any time decide to alter the character of public holidays, I think I am right in saying it will not be necessary to amend the Bill.  Deputy Kyne will understand that point.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion put forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is that workers who work on public holidays should get double time plus a day off or triple time.  The Bill provides for double time payment for work on a public holiday, which is surely a substantial advance on the time and a quarter provided in the 1939 Act.  The Minister's view would be that that is, perhaps, going too far. There may be certain types of trades, or trades or occupations in certain areas, where it would be difficult to enforce triple time for workers on public holidays or the alternative of double time plus a day off.  I think it can be recognised that the improvement in the Bill is a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>A further recommendation was that the Minister should take power to make regulations declaring classes of persons to be workers for the purposes of the Bill.  This would enable persons working on a commission basis to come under the aegis of the Bill.  That would apply to insurance agents who are in full time employment. Deputy Kyne suggested certain workers paid on a commission basis be brought specifically within the Bill. I think the Minister's proposal that he can make regulations declaring classes of persons to be workers will cover that matter.</P>
    <P>Another proposal was that the Bill should specify reduced qualifying periods of work applicable to casual workers to be prescribed by the Minister; and an alternative proposal by the trade unions was to give workers, permanent and casual, in the building trade, docks, and permanent industry a special position under the Bill.  The Minister finds that proposal unacceptable at the moment and he thinks that the amendment which he is considering, <Col N="1835" /> recommending a reduction of the qualifying periods for workers generally, will at least partially meet the point with regard to casual workers. If provision is made generally to reduce qualifying hours it will bring within its ambit classes of casual workers, such as those who work broken periods and short periods in the building trade.  The idea is, I think, that the proposals of the Trade Union Congress in some respects are not flexible enough.  Anomalies might arise and one might get certain categories excluded in one way or another. One might create difficulties for the trades concerned.  It is best then to leave certain questions to regulations, such as has been done in the case of the insurance agents, and cover the rest by means of a qualifying period.</P>
    <P>A still further proposal was that sick leave should count as hours worked up to a maximum of one week prior to a public holiday and up to a maximum of eight weeks in a year for annual leave.  Again, the Minister feels that no specific amendment should be introduced on this point and that it would be better to meet the position by an amendment to reduce the qualifying periods in the manner I have already indicated, namely, by reducing them to 135 and 1,600 respectively.</P>
    <P>I have, I think, dealt with all the proposals which have been put forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The Minister is considering them and he has some immediate ideas on them, ideas which I have indicated to the House.  He is not necessarily committed to them, but Deputies now have an opportunity to consider what the Minister has in mind at the moment.</P>

      <P>This Bill marks an <Col N="1836" /> important step forward in the development of our tourist industry.  Bord Fáilte, like many another body, has come in for certain criticism.  It should be remembered that Bord Fáilte was set up to deal with something completely new in this country.  It should also be remembered that tourism is now one of our biggest industries.  I have always been prepared to bear with Bord Fáilte, even if they made a mistake, because of the excellence of their approach in general.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to something that appears to me to be an anomaly.  Loans and grants are available for already existing hotels, but if somebody buys a premises, or owns a premises, suitable for conversion into an hotel or guest house, that person cannot receive any assistance by way of loan or grant from Bord Fáilte.  I think that is a mistake. There are scenic and fishing areas which could be developed if hotels and guest houses were opened in them. Bord Fáilte should be given power to come to the assistance by way of loan and grant of anybody prepared to develop such areas.  The members of this House and the public generally would defer with the most profound respect to the authority that drew my attention to this anomaly.  I ask the Minister to consider the matter.</P>
      <P>The policy now is to attract the British tourist here.  I welcome that because I believe it is our best policy and because I believe these tourists represent the most valuable tourist we can have.  It is comforting to note now that in this year, 1961, we are beginning to recognise that at last. Not so very long ago I heard a member of the Fianna Fáil Party thundering about the ridiculousness of bringing over British tourists to this country; all they were giving us were bits of paper in return for our fine steaks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde referred last night to potential tourist areas which are not being promoted by Bord Fáilte.  He mentioned Duncannon. The scenic area where the three great rivers meet &mdash; the Nore, the Suir and the Blackwater &mdash; is sadly neglected by Bord Fáilte.  It is a magnificent area, but there are no <Col N="1837" /> boats of any kind on these magnificent rivers.  There were boats in years gone by.  I would remind the Minister and the House that this is an important tourist area.  There is the port of Rosslare and the port of Waterford, both bringing in cars on the Great Western.  I am glad to say that these two ports are over-subscribed in the matter of bringing in cars which I consider is a great potential and something to which we should pay a little more care and attention.</P>
    <P>The roads leading from Rosslare should be improved.  While it may be said that is a matter for another Department, I am sure a recommendation from this Department would go a long way towards securing a grant for the improvement of roads for the benefit of tourists bringing cars to this country.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that Waterford gets £5,000 from another Department as a special tourist road grant and Tipperary, Kilkenny and Wexford do not get a penny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The policy of routing as many tourists as possible through Dublin is very bad.  As I mentioned in this House before, I was in a tourist office in England when a man came in and said he wanted to go to Ireland.  Before anybody could say &ldquo;Jack Robinson&rdquo; he was routed to Dublin via Euston and Holyhead.  He was not told that there were alternative entry ports.  He was shot off in that direction at a time when the boats coming to the North Wall and Dún Laoghaire were overcrowded.  It may be said the Minister has no authority to prevent that.  Surely the Minister and Bord Fáilte could make recommendations to British Railways that when they are advertising routes that they should not advertise only the one route.  On the route from Fishguard to Rosslare and also to Cork, the Minister's constituency, there are magnificent boats giving a magnificent service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all welcome the giving of grants and loans to hotels and guest houses. <Col N="1838" /> Our hotels are improving every year. They are becoming better equipped and are doing a splendid job in furnishing and modernising bedrooms, bathrooms and so on.  Nobody could find fault with that except perhaps publicans who are not being considered at all.  Publicans provide great amenities for tourists.  I am not talking so much about publicans in big centres but about those in the small towns and villages all over Ireland who cater for the type of tourist we recognise as our most valuable tourist, the British working man who likes to go to these places.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that some of the owners of licensed premises have improved and extended their premises, and the majority of them would not be rich men.  A great deal more could be done but the public house owners will say to themselves, and rightly so, that they are left out in the cold as far as this Bill is concerned.  Under this Bill the Tourist Board should be given authority, where a person can show his public house could be made a tourist attraction, to assist in improving such premises.</P>
    <P>I wish Bord Fáilte well.  They have done excellent work.  People have criticised them for what they did at Bunratty but the people who criticised them did not know the wonderful thing the Tourist Board had done there.  It published in magazines all over the world pictures of Bunratty and gave its history, stating how convenient it was to the airport and so on.  I commend the Tourist Board for that type of advertisement which is much better than spending tens of thousands of dollars on advertisements in big magazines saying: &ldquo;Come to Ireland&rdquo; which are soon forgotten.</P>
    <P>Other promotions worth while are those like the Wexford, Cork and Waterford festivals.  I have heard it said that the Waterford Festival attracts more tourists than any other festival in the country.  I wish to commend Bord Fáilte again and to thank them in the name of the Waterford Festival Committee for the courageous and forthright manner in which they came forward to help the committee running that festival.  It is in regard to promotions like that that Bord Fáilte <Col N="1839" /> justifies itself and that Bord Fáilte will succeed in increasing our tourist potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Russell who spoke here last night, I question the wisdom of the lump sum of £5 million as against the annual allowance paid to Bord Fáilte.  If we are to give Bord Fáilte the green light by ear-marking so much money, will we be in a position to question the spending of that money in different directions? Unlike Deputy Lynch I am not so impressed by Bord Fáilte and the wonderful pictures in the magazines all over the world.  I have reason to be critical of Bord Fáilte although I have tried to be as fair as possible to them in criticising their activities.  However, looking back over the years and the manner in which some of the Bord Fáilte money has been spent, I am wondering whether it is advisable to earmark this large amount of money for them.</P>
      <P>Speakers here last night questioned the manner in which Bord Fáilte allocations are being spent.  Not long ago representatives of Bord Fáilte attended a local authority meeting in Cork and told of the £200,000 for West Cork.  There is one big problem in that connection, namely, that we have not the least idea when any of the £200,000 will be spent in West Cork, whether it will come out of the lump sum now being offered or whether it will come under a long-term policy.</P>
      <P>The Minister has drawn attention to the question of improvement works at holiday resorts.  I had occasion recently to communicate with Bord Fáilte enquiring what they intended to do for Crosshaven, which is a popular seaside resort, most convenient to the people of Cork City.  Admittedly, they are local residents, not tourists coming by Aer Lingus, but the people of Cork City are entitled to some consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply I received a long letter dated 30th May informing me that they had no money to spend on that resort.  That was bad enough but they also said that they were aware of the need for amenities and had brought it to the <Col N="1840" /> attention of the Department of Local Government.  They sent me a copy of the letter they had sent to the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>The technical experts available to the Department of Local Government are well able to attend to improvements of roads that come under the jurisdiction of Cork County Council and the Department.  However, Bord Fáilte set out what they want done in the way of improvements to main roads and tourist roads and state that instead of the commonly-used chain link fencing, cut stone walls should be provided.  It is preposterous that Bord Fáilte should spend time on these matters. It must involve considerable cost to Bord Fáilte to have officials, not trying to encourage tourists, but telling the Department of Local Government what they should be doing.  The policy of Bord Fáilte in that respect does not display common sense.</P>
    <P>I hear Bord Fáilte being praised here but in the small seaside resort of Fennell's Bay the local people co-operated to improve the approach to the beach and spent their own money in the hope that they would get some assistance from Bord Fáilte only to be told that Bord Fáilte could not give any money towards the project.  They may spend money in Dublin or Waterford or other places but common sense is missing when it comes to Cork County.  It is for that reason that I question the wisdom of passing a Bill to hand over a lump sum to Bord Fáilte, giving them the green light to carry on in their own style for a number of years without having to come back to this House for more money.</P>
    <P>The Minister has directed attention to the importance of providing new offices abroad.  I should like to know if there is any back room in any of our Embassies abroad that could accommodate Bord Fáilte but I suppose Bord Fáilte would not be satisfied with a back room and want luxurious offices.  The money being spent on these buildings and the furnishing of them could be better spent in some other way in connection with tourism.  There are hundreds of thousands of Irish people in England. Many a person is making a fine living out of selling tickets for a certain <Col N="1841" /> sweepstake to these people.  Why not introduce a scheme whereby persons could become promoters for the purpose of bringing tourists to this country and would be given a commission for bringing families living in their neighbourhood or persons whom they might contact at their work to this country?  There are many men from Cork City and County who could help in bringing dozens of English families to this country if they could make a pound or two out of it.  Would it not be much more beneficial to arrange such a scheme rather than to squander money on offices?</P>
    <P>A great deal more could be done to encourage English, Scottish and Welsh people to come to this country. There is a wide-open market there. Irish people who have had to seek employment in those countries could be ambassadors for their country in promoting tourism and at the same time could make a few pounds to help them to pay for their own holidays. If Bord Fáilte were to formulate a scheme on those lines it would have very good results.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the amount of money spent on the building of large hotels.  I shall not elaborate on that subject except to say that I agree with what has been said.  The advertisements issued by Bord Fáilte seem to concentrate on the wonderful amenities we have but one thing is forgotten.  Bord Fáilte may not be able to do anything about it but it may be possible for the Minister to step in. I refer to the charges made by these hotels.  They are preposterous.  If a tourist is charged £2 for bed and breakfast he will let everybody know about it.  We should be more concerned with providing adequate accommodation at a reasonable charge for people coming from the north-eastern counties and from Britain.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Bord Fáilte at any time made overtures to the Hotel Federation to get them to fix fair and reasonable charges.  In many instances tourists are being fleeced by the hotel charges &mdash; not in all cases, thank God.  There should be a special section in Bord Fáilte to deal with over-charging.  They may say that they <Col N="1842" /> have not got many complaints, but the trouble is that people go away and complain when they are at home and say they will not come back again. There should be standardisation of charges.  That would help tourism generally and would help to increase the percentage of tourists from the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Grants are given to local development associations, but there is one grant you are sure of getting, and that is the grant to pay the legal costs of the registration of these companies. The solicitors benefit again.  The legal end is well provided for, up to about £40, I think.  If the local development associations did not do anything afterwards except to meet as mutual admiration societies, the £40 is down the drain because they are registered. Something should be done about that.  It should be checked up on.  Perhaps it might help to save some of the money that goes to Bord Fáilte.  In my opinion the benefits are doubtful.</P>
    <P>Other members of the House drew attention to the conditions prevailing in the hotel training courses.  As a member of a county vocational committee, I am aware of the serious situation confronting us.  The latest report I got was that not many girls of a suitable age are availing of those training courses, because the conditions and remuneration in some hotels are not satisfactory.  The hotels should be made to understand that the girls and boys on these courses are not to be regarded as cheap labour.  They are sent there to improve their knowledge and to help the tourist industry.  To my mind the standards in some hotels are poor enough.  They seem to regard those boys and girls as coolie labour.  That is a matter on which Bord Fáilte could make investigations and report to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not opposing the Bill, but I believe the handing over of a lump sum of money to Bord Fáilte, and giving them a free hand for the next six, seven or ten years, will mean that they will formulate schemes and send letters regretting there is nothing they can do for Crosshaven or Fennell's Bay, but that they are getting wonderful publicity, in the international <Col N="1843" /> magazines.  We must face reality.  If tourism is to be made a success, Bord Fáilte must realise, and be made to realise, that, in future, tourism must flow from the incomes of the ordinary working people who come here for their holidays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that tourism is a very important factor in this nation of ours.  It is so very important that it behoves every Deputy to help the Board and the responsible Minister.  I must say that Deputy Desmond's statement is indeed to be deplored.  It is the duty of members of this House to boost this country, its hotels and its tourist board.  If we do not, what can we expect from our opponents?  All over the world, there are tourist boards and agencies of all kinds trying to get, from every country under God's sun, a proportion of the people who are prepared to leave their own spheres and go on holiday elsewhere.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that Deputy Desmond has not studied tourism because if he had he would not dare to say Bord Fáilte was a failure.  He apparently thinks they are a failure, not because they failed to bring tourists into the country and see that they were treated in a proper manner, but because they did not attend to the needs of one seaside resort in Cork.  They cannot be expected to deal at the one time with every seaside resort to which tourists will go.  Their life has been rather short.  They have not been in existence for very long.</P>
      <P>I say without fear of contradiction &mdash; and I say it from personal experience &mdash;that no board was ever set up by this or any Government which could compare favourably with Bord Fáilte.  The members are business-like men.  They do their work and do not talk about it.  They do not publish long speeches in the local papers.  That would get them nowhere.  In my experience they act when action is called for.  They work quickly and well and they thereby attract tourists from every part of the world to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen some of their work.  It <Col N="1844" /> is difficult work to handle.  I have seen members of Bord Fáilte working up to 12 o'clock at night.  I have seen them in their every-day work.  If I had a grievance it would be that they are always in too big a hurry, that they are too eager to get somewhere else and do more work.  I do not know them personally but I met them on a few occasions and, to my mind, they deserve from this House the greatest tribute possible.  I am certain they have justified their existence up to now, and I have no doubt whatever that if they continue to function, manned as the Board is at present, we can have every confidence in them.</P>
    <P>The work of Bord Fáilte in getting tourists to come here, advertising and bringing this country home to the minds of those who desire to travel, probably will not be fully seen for some years to come.  This is not a small matter.  It is a huge matter.  They are also doing great work in advertising our products, especially Irish whiskey. Deputy Desmond attacked Bord Fáilte but I think he should have access to their records and to the actual facts. Last year we got into this country a record amount of money from tourism. There is no doubt about that.  During the war years it is quite true we did not need Bord Fáilte, because people came in here who would not come in the ordinary way, but in normal times we do need them.  We can speedily see now that the receipts of Bord Fáilte are very satisfactory to the Irish people. I feel certain that every halfpenny of the money they got has been disposed of in a manner in which we can all have every confidence, and in a manner that has been most beneficial to our country in general, and to our seaside resorts in particular.</P>
    <P>It behoves us in this House&mdash;unless we have proof positive that our hotels are not doing their job, or are overcharging&mdash;to boost our hotels and tell the people of the world, as we truthfully can, that the cheapest food in the world is to be got here.  I have travelled in 22 other countries and I should know what I am talking about. The finest food and the finest hotel accommodation are to be got in this country and I am glad to say that I have not found a hotel which has not <Col N="1845" /> acted up to its responsibilities in this country.  I feel very proud of our hotels. Even late at night you can go into them for a meal and you can get a substantial meal at a very reasonable cost.  We have our seaside and other resorts and in addition to tourists we have our own people going there for holidays and they come home full of praise for what they have got.  That has been the experience of our tourists, as I know from foreigners whom I have met.</P>
    <P>It is bad policy to try to throw cold water on these places.  If we do that we will negative the hard work of any board.  There is no advantage to be gained from it.  If I found a hotel which was over-charging I would write to Bord Fáilte and tell them but I would not shout it to the four winds of the world that our hotels were over-charging. When we offer our tourists a céad míle fáilte, we mean it and they will find that there is a céad míle fáilte for them in every hotel.  In regard to the premier monument in Ireland, the Rock of Cashel, where the kings of Munster and the last Ard Rí were crowned, some work was done there which, if the Board had done nothing else for the year, would have justified their existence.  It had perhaps been overdue for the past 30 or 40 years but I give them all credit for doing it. Finally I say that Bord Fáilte have justified their existence and the only thing I regret is that we could not give them sufficient money to do all the work they would like to do.  I should also like to pay tribute to the personnel of the Board for the businesslike manner in which they do their work.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Desmond meant anything against the personnel of the Board or their work but we all have our grievances in various ways in connection with the Board's activities.  I think I come from an area which is regarded as the finest part of this country for tourists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  I will not delay the Minister as I think everything has been covered in this debate and I do not like to delay him because of the number of Bills he has to handle.  In connection with tourism, even before there was any Bord Fáilte, tourists came to this country because of its beauty but during the past 20 years, except during the war period, vast improvements have been made not only in hotels but in the various tourist areas.  In a country like this one can understand the difficulties that there are in regard to finance.  There are so many demands on our finances that something must always suffer.</P>
      <P>This Bill has made some provision for the improvement of tourism and the Minister can feel assured it will receive the approval of the House and that anything that can be done for the advancement of tourism will meet with the approval of the people.  Farmers will ask: &ldquo;What good are tourists to us?&rdquo;  They should realise that, instead of sending our cattle on the hoof to England or exporting other commodities, it is much better to bring the people from other countries to consume these commodities here, apart from the extra employment it will give in the hotels and in various other ways in the tourist areas.  To some extent the whole country is a tourist area even though I can see nothing in the midlands or Tipperary except the Rock of Cashel or the Devil's Bit.  They are very interesting and will attract tourists who will spend money in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go further I want to mention one point and that is if we put down a question on tourism&mdash;as I did last week in an endeavour to get the Iveragh Peninsula regarded as a tourist area so that it would qualify for the <Col N="1847" /> grants&mdash;the Minister states, as he did then, that he has no function in the matter and that one should write to Bord Fáilte.  This matter came before the Kerry County Council.  We have a major tourist area there, including Ballybunion and Killarney.  A resolution was passed unanimously and sent to Bord Fáilte asking them to investigate the possibility of making this peninsula a major tourist area.</P>
    <P>Not only Killarney but the entire Ring of Kerry is one of the most beautiful places in the world.  Places like Kenmare, Waterville, Cahirciveen, Glenbeigh, Killorglin and Valentia Island are awaiting development.  Take the case of the village of Sneem, in which I live but of which I am not a native.  We have asked Bord Fáilte to develop two greens there in order to beautify this village situated within two miles of the C.I.E. Hotel at Parknasilla. In recent years Sneem has become a major tourist area.  We have a grievance because we see certain places, which we consider not so suitable for tourism, receiving development grants.  Places such as those I have mentioned should get special attention.</P>
    <P>Ballybunion, Ballyheigue and other places in North Kerry have always got grants for the improvement of their amenities, and it is time the smaller places were developed.  Even a small grant would be very useful.  A grant of £1,000 was given from the Special Employment Schemes Office for development work at Sneem.  Bórd Fáilte offered £200 for certain works when the development had been done.  Now that Bórd Fáilte have these millions, why would they not try and develop the small places I have mentioned, even by giving small grants every year?  It would be very useful for places in South Kerry such as Cahirciveen where there is much unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  It is strictly a matter for the Minister for Lands and Fisheries but I would just refer to it in passing in the hope that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, responsible for Bórd Fáilte, might see his colleague about it.  It is the question of erecting a dam to make two fresh <Col N="1848" /> water lakes, one at Cahirciveen, about which I have spoken so often here, and one at Kenmare.  Fishing is a very important part of tourism and it is important also for the local people.  There are many things like that which could be done for these remote areas, especially Gaeltacht areas such as South Kerry and the Dingle Peninsula.  You have in Ballinskelligs a really forgotten area with one of the most beautiful strands in Ireland.  It has never been developed.  It would be a lovely place for people wishing to spend a quiet, restful holiday.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern mentioned the countries he travelled as a member of Council of Europe delegations.  I have travelled as such myself recently, and our hotels are entirely different from those on the Continent.  The hotels there are fully equipped with every amenity you could think of, but there is nothing as homely as our Irish hotels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>While tourists, especially American tourists, may have grievances from time to time, I think they all agree that this country is the most restful and loveliest of all. They even like our weather, bad and all as it is at times.  Travelling by train during the tourist season you sometimes find yourself in a compartment with American tourists and it is interesting to hear their comments on our hotels.  I understand there is a C.I.E. regulation by which the heating of trains ceases on the 1st April, or it may be the 1st May, until October. People who come from warm countries, especially the Americans who are used to central heating, like heat. I have heard a lady remark about the bill she got from the C.I.E. Hotel at Killarney and commenting that she had paid a shilling for the electric heating in her bedroom and asking why that should be.  There should be no regulation like that depriving people during the tourist season of having their rooms properly heated. The same thing should apply to trains. You can have a very cold, wet day during the summer months and you can imagine how travellers from warm <Col N="1849" /> countries would feel.  At any time during bad weather the heating should be turned on to make the tourists, and our own travellers, too, more comfortable.</P>
      <P>I do not think anyone can have any grievance about the food and other amenities provided in our hotels. Coming from a remote part of the country I have to spend much time travelling and I have to stay at many hotels.  I never have yet had any grievance.  There is always a lovely bedroom and the best of food and attention.  The only thing I notice is that sometimes the menus, especially in the C.I.E. hotels, are printed in French.  Few of our people have a knowledge of a foreign language.  Why in the name of goodness could the menu not be printed in Irish and English?  Every document we get from the various Government Departments is printed in those two languages, and why not have the same thing with the menus?  Why have French, German or something else? You will see &ldquo;Soup&rdquo;.  You wonder what kind of soup is that, is it the thick soup or the light soup?  You find it is only the ordinary soup.</P>
      <P>It is the very same with &ldquo;Lamb&rdquo; and other meats.  They all have different names.  Why would we not print the menu in a language the people would understand?  I suppose few people come here from France or Germany.  Why not print the menu in Irish and let them try and decipher what it is?  We serve the food of our own country and why not use the language of our country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have met many people who are very interested in bringing American tourists here and they have told me that there is no publicity at all in the United States to advertise our tourist attractions.  It is well-recognised now that our best tourists are the English visitors who come here for their holidays and our own exiles returning home to see their own people.  I do not know what money is being spent in the U.S.A. in order to attract American tourists to our shores, but surely our first responsibility should be to attract and cater for the people who buy our surplus agricultural and industrial produce? <Col N="1850" /> English tourists came here before ever there was a Tourist Board. I remember them coming here when there were no motor cars; they rode bicycles and they went for drives on jaunting cars.  They were always good spenders.</P>
    <P>Generally, this Bill should have the approval of the House and of the people.  It is rather odd that Bills like this should be introduced on the eve of a general election.  However, I suppose better late than never. Tourism is now our second biggest industry: it is second to agriculture only.  Anything that will help to develop it further is to be commended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  Some Deputies have criticised Bord Fáilte.  I think it is unfair to criticise the very excellent work that body is doing.  I compliment them on their work.  In the city of Galway one can see the improvements that have been carried out there.  When the larger cities have been dealt with I hope that Bord Fáilte will extend its operations to the country areas. Everybody realises that when it comes to holiday time most people move out to the country or to the small seaside resorts.  In my constituency there are several small resorts well worth development. A little has been done at Barna.  A little has been done at Furbough.  A little has been done in Spiddal.  Something has been done in Carraroe, but much still remains to be done.  The western end of the county has not been touched at all. There is a very fine strand at Mweenish about three miles from the village of Carna.  There is another very fine strand at Moyrus which offers very safe bathing.  I hope that, when they have finished in Galway, Bord Fáilte will turn their attention to the western seaboard and develop the little places I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of complimenting Bord Fáilte and its officials for the excellent work they are doing.  We should all be proud of them.  I agree with the last speaker that our menus should be in Irish.  That would set a lead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a member of this House who appreciates what the tourist industry is doing for this country more than I do.  It is now our second best industry and one of our best money spinners.  I think tourism is closely linked with prosperity in our agricultural industry because of the market it provides for meat, eggs, vegetables, etc.  I have no objection to money being spent on the tourist industry because any money spent will ultimately pay a dividend.</P>
      <P>This industry is not confined to any particular class.  You have the tourist who books in to the fifteen or twenty guinea hotel.  You have our own people coming home for their holidays from England.  You have civil servants, and others, who seek rest in some of the seaside or inland resorts throughout the country.  They should receive some benefits as a result of the money spent on tourism.  Consider places like Lahinch, Lisdoonvarna and Kilkee.  I know people who have almost gone to extremes renovating their premises to cater for tourists coming into the country and to encourage still more tourists to come.  It is an odd commentary that while you have one Minister anxious to develop the tourist industry you have another Minister interfering with the amenities.  I know that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will pull me up shortly, but I think it is only right to say that there should be fair play for all.  Why should the man who books into the fifteen or twenty guinea hotel enjoy amenities and privileges denied to the ordinary man in the street?</P>

      <P>I feel it is my duty to say a few words on behalf of the people of Sligo-Leitrim whom I represent here because in those two <Col N="1854" /> counties and through the West of Ireland, we have many beauty spots which are neglected.  I have been around a bit and I see the amount of money running into hundreds of thousands of pounds being spent on very short stretches of road.  It would be far more beneficial to spend that money on schemes to provide better facilities in beauty spots throughout the West of Ireland.  As well as drawing tourists to these places, it would provide much-needed employment.  In that area, an appeal was made for a pier at Rosses Point and no money was granted for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it would be from the Tourist Board this money would come.  A group of people made an appeal to the Tourist Board to have a road leading from the main Sligo-Dromahair road down to the lake shore, with a turn-table for cars.  The Tourist Board said they would not consider giving a grant for that, which I as a public representative regard as most disappointing.</P>
      <P>There is another seaside resort at Strandhill which is the same seaside resort since I was a little boy.  Nothing has been done to improve it.  Then there is another place called Lough Melvin which attracts a number of people because it is a centre for fishing. I would ask the Minister to give some consideration to that resort also. Many tourists have made complaints to me about a grant not being given for the road at the Glencar waterfalls about which I have been agitating for a number of years.  I hope the Minister or those in charge of Bord Fáilte will take an interest in that and carry out the work as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask that grants be made available particularly to backward areas where there are places of great interest which would be an attraction to many tourists, instead of spending money on constructing highways leading to big towns.  These big towns will attract the tourist, whether there is a <Col N="1855" /> good road or bad road leading to them. Tourism is a great benefit to the country but unfortunately its importance is not brought home to a number of our people in rural areas because they feel the money brought to this country is of no direct benefit to them.  If a little more attention were paid to the rural areas, these people might have a greater appreciation of the value of tourism.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned the licensing laws and how they affect the tourist trade.  To my mind, they have been detrimental to the tourist trade.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he has received any clarification of the provision of the Rome Treaty concerning agricultural produce which states that the quantities to be covered by the agreements are to be based on the average volume of exchanges in the three-year period prior to the entry into force of the Treaty; and whether this provision, while protecting traditional markets for the respective countries, coincidentally restricts the scope of potential markets for other members of the Common Market.</P>

      <P>The Deputies appear to have in mind the provisions of Article 45 of the Rome Treaty.  This is one of several provisions in the Treaty which were designed to facilitate the expansion of trade between the Member Countries during the transitional period.  The long-term agreements or contracts which the article envisages would cease to operate as soon as the Common Market stage is reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am aware, only one such contract has so far been concluded and it would appear that the Community intend to rely to a greater extent on other measures to increase <Col N="1856" /> intra-Community trade in the transitional period.  It cannot therefore be said that the provisions in question are likely to restrict the scope for increased trade between the Members of the Community.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach say if he feels that the optimism in rural Ireland, particularly in relation to dairy products, is justified in view of the fact that up to the present we have not been able to outsell Denmark in the British Market?  Does he believe that we will be able to expand markets, particularly in dairy products in competition with countries like Denmark, when we have additional transport problems?</P>

I should mention that these claims are by no means identical.</P>
      <P>Claims submitted by two of the organisations on behalf of those of their members who are employed by the Mental Hospital authorities were investigated by the Labour Court on Monday last.

    <P>I have already pointed out in reply to a question by Deputy Corish that the certificates in question cover only a proportion of the cases of blindness or defective vision which occur.  Blind pensions, for instance, are not payable to persons under 21 years nor to persons whose means are such that they would not qualify for a blind pension even if they satisfied the criteria laid down in the Acts in regard to the condition of their eye-sight.  Consequently, there is no occasion for certification in those cases.  There is the additional fact that the degree of defect of vision necessary to qualify for a pension <Col N="1863" /> varies according to the normal occupation of the applicant.  Thus a person following an occupation which requires acute vision could qualify for a pension because of his occupation, whereas a person following an occupation not requiring such acute vision would not qualify.  The certificates, therefore, are not necessarily certificates of blindness but are certificates of impaired vision, of varying degrees, many of them far removed from any reasonable medical definition of blindness.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I do not at present feel that a case has been made for amending the form of certificate now in use, which is adequate for the purpose for which it is intended, a fact which was admitted by the body which advocated the change.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen a press report of the case referred to by the Deputy.  I am not clear, however, as to the purpose of the suggested amendment of the Disabled Persons (Maintenance Allowances) <Col N="1865" /> Regulations.  The investigation carried out by an Inquiry Officer is restricted exclusively to the ascertainment of entitlement or continuing entitlement on grounds of means to an allowance. Any extension of the range of enquiry would be inappropriate in the context of the Regulations, the essential object of which is to assist relatives in maintaining a disabled person at home by affording, regularly, a measure of financial assistance to that person.</P>
    <P>The maximum allowance payable under these Regulations is £1 2s. 6d. a week.  Expenditure on these allowances has increased in recent years and is now approximately £700,000 per annum.  I regret that I am not at present prepared to consider any alteration in the scale of allowances which were increased as recently as 1st January, 1960.  Where, in a particular case, an allowance is considered insufficient, application may be made to the public assistance authority for a home assistance allowance.  The Regulations provide that income from public assistance shall be disregarded in determining the amount of disablement allowance.</P>

Is the Minister satisfied that, in this case, where a woman died of starvation &mdash; acknowledging that she was an afflicted person and probably not in full possession of her mental faculties &mdash; the proper machinery to avert hunger and destitution was functioning in this case? Will he inquire from the local authority how it came about that a woman living in our midst should die of hunger when means were available to avert it if they had been invoked?</P>

      <P>As already announced it has been decided to extend work under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to include, in addition to the larger catchments listed for treatment in the main programme, smaller rivers having independent outfalls to the sea or to large lakes where increased discharge would cause no damage. There are many of these rivers and sufficient information about them is not readily available to enable a priority list to be settled.  Selection of the first catchments to be dealt with has been made on what is known as to the urgency of the need for drainage in the locality, the extent of the land likely to be improved coupled with suitability for speedy treatment and geographical distribution of the work.</P>

      <P>I see little hope, however, of a permanent solution for the acutely dangerous situation to which the Deputy refers as the &ldquo;Berlin question&rdquo; unless it is part of a general solution involving the re-unification of Germany.

      <P>Existing legislation satisfies almost entirely the provisions of the Convention. The Convention has not, however, been ratified by the Government mainly because it contains a prohibition on the practice of permitting workers to forgo holidays.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>Present ownership of shooting rights is not recorded statistically but the following particulars will give a picture of the general position.</P>
      <P>Under Policy laid down in 1933, shooting rights have been reserved to the Land Commission only in respect of large compact areas of undivided mountain or bog.</P>
      <P>Out of a total of 15½ million acres vested under all Land Acts, the total acreage of shooting rights let or for letting by the Land Commission amounts to approximately 692,000 acres or slightly over 4½ per cent. of the total.</P>
      <P>Under Section 45 (2) of the Land Act, 1923, the shooting rights on some 100,000 holdings purchased under that Act have vested in the tenant-purchasers, subject to leases (if any) outstanding at the appointed days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Land Acts, 1903-1909, the shooting rights on 6,089 estates (i.e. two-thirds of the estates dealt with <Col N="1890" /> under those Acts) passed to the tenants. In sum, I believe it would be true to say that about 75 per cent. of all farmers own the sporting rights over their lands.</P>
    <P>Under Section 34 of the Land Act, 1933, and Section 39 of the Land Act, 1936, any tenant-purchaser, who does not own the shooting rights on his land and is prepared to purchase such rights, may apply to the Land Commission to have the reserved shooting rights vested in them for resale to him, at a price to be agreed or fixed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 18, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to extend the privileges of the Bill to newspapers printed and published in Northern Ireland as well as to those printed and published in the State.  The recent English and Northern Ireland Defamation Acts give statutory privilege only to papers printed and published in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Under the Acts of 1881 and 1888 &ldquo;a newspaper&rdquo; means a paper published in England or Ireland.  We now include a newspaper published in any part of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this amendment and to the section, there is, I understand, considerable doubt in certain people's minds as to exactly what constitutes publication.  It arises particularly in relation to newspapers that are printed outside the State and arrive here by air, shall we say, for example, and when they arrive at Collinstown are taken up at Collinstown for circulation through the rest of the country.  I understand there is some grave doubt following a case that was heard some time ago as to what exactly &ldquo;publication&rdquo; means in that respect and that the decision in the case at issue was that the newspaper in question was, in fact, published in Manchester and was only distributed here.  In the circumstances, I should like to know whether or not the Parliamentary Secretary has considered that point and if the information given to me is correct&mdash;I may add that the information was given to me by a legal adviser who had been concerned in the particular case&mdash;then, under what part of the Bill does the publication of a paper printed, say, in Manchester and distributed via Collinstown arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The section clearly defines a newspaper as one which is printed for sale and is published in the State.  For the purpose of this section it must be both printed for sale and published.</P>

      <P>This Act is copied from the British Defamation Act, 1952. I think I am right in saying that in the British Act they have, instead of &ldquo;in the State&rdquo;, &ldquo;in the United Kingdom&rdquo;. Is our position now by putting in &ldquo;the State and Northern Ireland&rdquo; the equivalent of the British Act saying &ldquo;in the United Kingdom&rdquo;?  The English Defamation Act, 1952 is the foundation of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be told if it is not.  The main part of it is surely found in the 1952 British Act. This definition comes entirely from Section 7 of the Act of 1952.  There, naturally, they say &ldquo;printed for sale or published in the United Kingdom&rdquo;. We put in &ldquo;the State&rdquo;.  &ldquo;The State&rdquo; ordinarily means with us the Twenty-Six Counties.  We have now added &ldquo;or <Col N="1904" /> in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  I am asking the simple question: is putting in &ldquo;or in Northern Ireland&rdquo; as an addition to &ldquo;the State&rdquo;, meaning the Twenty-Six Counties, the equivalent from our angle of &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; in the British Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No. What I am concerned with in this amendment is to extend the privileges that this Bill will provide for newspapers to a newspaper whether it is published here or in Northern Ireland.  In other words, no matter in what part of Ireland it is published, it will qualify for the privileges we are extending to newspapers in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the foundation of the thing is printing or publishing somewhere.  We are not merely extending safeguards which occur in certain sections but establishing the obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the main, we are providing in the Bill certain new safeguards, certain new protections for newspapers.  We are providing obligations also but, in the main, we are affording newspapers a new type of protection and that new type of protection will be extended to newspapers no matter in what part of Ireland they are published.  In other words, we are giving Northern Ireland newspapers the same protection as the Bill gives to Twenty-Six County newspapers. That is the effect of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as giving privileges, the Bill is intended to be a consolidating measure in relation to the law of defamation.  In addition, certain obligations are established.  As I understand the situation now, from what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, in respect of any newspaper&mdash;the Manchester edition, say, of one of the British newspapers&mdash;which is printed <Col N="1905" /> outside and comes in here, a party who is aggrieved by any article in such paper will not now have any rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to the obligation contained in the Bill. In its schedule, the Bill repeals certain enactments already existing.  By its repeal of these enactments it lets out, so to speak, these newspapers from the effects of those enactments and at the same time it does not bring them in under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

We want to put all the law in one Bill.  Apart from the position with regard to the <Col N="1906" /> protection of newspapers the existing statute law is being consolidated.  The ordinary law of libel will apply to English newspapers.  The protection which we are giving to newspapers will apply only to our own newspapers and those published and printed in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be better briefed when we come to Section 11. On Section 2, the section is practically copied from the Defamation Act, 1952, except that the word &ldquo;State&rdquo; is not used in the English Act.  The phrase used is &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo;. We have added &ldquo;the State or Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  So far as the replacement of the phrase &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; is concerned, in regard to newspapers we are now dealing with newspapers which are printed, published and for sale either in our area or in the Six Counties.  We will deal with that on Sections 11 and 12 when we come to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in the second paragraph of Section 2, defining &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo;, the statement &ldquo;published in the State either periodically or in parts or numbers at intervals not exceeding thirty-six days.&rdquo;  Section 29 is the section <Col N="1909" /> which deals with the registration obligation under the Registration of Business Names Act.  In that section &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo; means much the same as it does in this definition but it goes on to say: &ldquo;...printed for sale and is published in the State either periodically or in parts or numbers at intervals not exceeding twenty-six days&rdquo;.  Why the difference?  Why is it confined to twenty-six days for registration purposes and thirty-six days in the definition.</P>

      <P>After all, the word &ldquo;proprietor&rdquo; is defined and it follows the definition in the English Act 1952 except that we have added two and a half lines.  I shall quote the full definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;proprietor&rdquo; means, as well as the sole proprietor of any newspaper, in the case of a divided proprietorship, the persons who, as partners or otherwise, represent or are responsible for any share or interest in the newspaper as between themselves and the persons in like manner representing or responsible for the other shares or interests therein, and no other person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As explained in the Explanatory Memorandum, the reason the exception is made from the general scope of the definition of a newspaper is that we do not want to impose on monthly periodicals the duty of registration. Under the old provisions whereby a separate register was kept, 26 days was the period.  Monthly papers were excluded and we want to continue that exclusion.  We are proposing that the owners of these monthly publications <Col N="1910" /> will not have the obligation of registration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been referred to the Explanatory Memorandum and, in the paragraph referring to Section 2, a newspaper is defined so as to include periodicals published at intervals not exceeding 36 days.  The paragraph goes on to say that the effect of this definition is to extend to monthly publications the protection afforded newspapers under the 1880 Act.  Then I go to paragraph 19 of the Memorandum which says:</P>
      <P>A separate registry of newspaper proprietors was established under the Newspaper Libel and Registration Act, 1881, the object of which was to enable the identity of the proprietors to be ascertained.  The 1881 Act did not apply to newspapers owned by companies.  Because of the Registration of Business Names Act, 1916, some unincorporated proprietors of newspapers are registered under both the Act of 1881 and the Act of 1916.  There has been an increase in the number of incorporated proprietors who are registered under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1959.  It is proposed in section 29 to dispense with the maintenance of the separate registry under the Act of 1881 so that all proprietors will be registered either under the Companies Acts or under the Registration of Business Names Act.  As the 1881 Act did not include publications appearing at intervals exceeding 26 days and thus excluded monthly publications, it is not proposed to extend the obligation to register in respect of these publications.  Cp. definition of &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo; in section 2 with the definition in section 29 (3).</P>
      <P>Why is it not proposed to extend it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we do not think it desirable to do so.  We think it would be an onerous obligation on them.  By and large, these publications are artistic, technical or cultural and we consider it undesirable to make them register in this fashion.  It is as simple as that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 is a reenactment of what is known as &ldquo;Fox's Libel Act&rdquo; or the Act similar to that Act passed in the old Irish Parliament in 1793.  Section 4 only is not being re-enacted.  That section dealt with the right of a defendant on conviction to move in arrest of judgment which was the only means, and a severely restricted one, by which an appeal could be taken in former times.  In view of the general power to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal it is quite unnecessary to re-enact the section.  Otherwise, the Act is being re-enacted.  A special verdict is a verdict in terms other than &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; or &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo;, as where the jury state positively facts which they find.  An example is where on a trial for forgery of a bank note, the jury states that they found that the defendant erased and altered the note by changing &ldquo;two&rdquo; into &ldquo;five&rdquo;.  This was held sufficient as a special verdict to warrant a conviction.</P>
      <P>Fox's Act has been held to be declaratory of the common law but it was passed because of the invasion by the judges of the functions of the jury. In civil and criminal proceedings whether the words complained of are defamatory or not is a question of fact for the jury.  The prior question whether the words are capable of a defamatory meaning is for the judge.</P>

      <P>Surely there is more than that to it.  It was discussed, was it not?  It is clear that the phrase had relevance only to criminal libel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>This is the 1888 Act.  It provided that no prosecution should be commenced against a proprietor, publisher, editor, or any person responsible for the publication of a newspaper without first getting leave of the Court.  Notice of the application to the Court must be given to the <Col N="1919" /> person accused, who shall be entitled to contest the application.</P>
      <P>Prosecution on indictment can only be instituted by the Attorney-General, but while no authoritative decision has been given to the contrary, it is our opinion, and the practice has supported it, that any individual can issue a summons and ask a justice to conduct a preliminary investigation into a charge which may be indictable in its character.  It is only when the justice receives informations that no further step can be taken without the direction of the Attorney-General.  This, of course, applies to cases which, while indictable, are also triable summarily and, as Sections 9 and 10 of the Bill show, charges against newspapers may be determined in this way.</P>

      <P>Common law punishment applies to cases of obscene libel and a first offence of blasphemous libel and is unspecified fine and imprisonment. In practice the imprisonment does not exceed two years.  A second offence of blasphemous libel was punishable originally with banishment.</P>
      <P>It is proposed therefore to prescribe a fine up to £500 and for imprisonment up to two years or penal servitude not exceeding seven years for blasphemous and obscene libels in general.  Seditious libel is covered by section 10 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939. The provisions in subsection (2) of this section cover the seizure by an order of the court after conviction in respect of a blasphemous libel of all copies of the libel in the possession of any person named in the order.  Where a conviction is quashed provision is made for the return of any copies seized.  Where appeal is not lodged or is dismissed, the Court may make arrangements for the disposal of such copies.</P>

We have to take our own separate decisions on various matters, influenced very considerably, of course, by the British Act. There again, when we are dealing with the same problems we would first of all look at the solution that had been adopted in the British legislation.

      <P>To delete subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to delete the restriction which prevented a successful plaintiff recovering more costs than damages unless the trial judge granted a certificate, and although the aspersions on the plaintiff's virtue would have been found to have been groundless.  It is conceivable that in such an action an award of damages might fall short of the costs incurred by the successful plaintiff. Deputy Costello mentioned this matter on Second Stage and cited the example of an award of a farthing damages and 6/8d. costs.  The result of the deletion of subsection (2) will be that awards of damages of £2 or <Col N="1934" /> under will not, under the High Court Rules, carry more costs than damages but any larger award will be free from any statutory limitation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole section is to go.  There was some doubt as to whether this section served any useful purpose.  From inquiries and research we have ascertained that rarely if ever is this section used by newspaper defendants.  This section involves the proof of two negatives, namely, that the defendant acted without malice and without gross negligence, and it also requires the lodgment of money in court.  Section 17, which is of general application, enables a defendant to plead an apology in mitigation of damages.  It will be for the jury to say if this is sufficient in any case.  If a defendant is advised to lodge money he can do so under the Rules of Court, with the assurance that, unless the jury award a greater sum than that lodged, the plaintiff will not recover costs after the date of lodgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 18, however, confers the additional advantage of allowing a plaintiff to obtain costs although the <Col N="1936" /> award is less than the amount lodged. It is easy to see why the existing law which the section proposes to re-enact is seldom or ever employed by newspaper defendants.  Having considered this matter carefully I am satisfied that, as was suggested on Second Stage, the section serves no really useful purpose any more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is first of all the question of the station.  As I understand it, the broadcasting from Athlone, to put it in simple terms, of a report of a case in England in relation to the doping of a racehorse sent over from Ireland, would not be privileged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that what we want?  Surely what we want is to provide that the Irish broadcasting station shall be privileged, if it gives a fair and accurate report of proceedings in any court of a country which we recognise, because surely we do not want deliberately to make our news services as insular as we can.  Surely we want to enable the broadcasting station to deal with items of interest wheresoever <Col N="1939" /> they arise, and why should we deliberately make it possible for them to be in difficulty if they publish a fair and accurate report?</P>
      <P>Let me put this case to the Parliamentary Secretary: Athlone broadcasts a report of a case about racehorse doping in England and that obviously is a subject that would be of general interest here, particularly if the horse had been bred in Ireland.  At the end of that case the defendant is acquitted. It is a fair and accurate report.  It is held at the end of the case that there was no doping.  As I understand the situation, because of the manner in which this section is phrased now, Radio Éireann would be liable for damages for libel in respect of that case.  If that is so, I do not think that is what any of us wants.</P>
      <P>I want to be clear about one thing. When I say &ldquo;Radio Éireann&rdquo; I do not want the distinction drawn between the State broadcast there is at the moment and what may be televised because of the method in which we are financing our television programmes.  I want to provide in this Bill&mdash;and I do not mind where it is provided or in which section it is provided, provided it is somewhere provided&mdash;that so long as it is a fair and accurate report of court proceedings in a country whose courts we recognise, and by that I mean with whom we have diplomatic relations, that the broadcasting authority will be entitled to transmit without being caught between the two stools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but is the situation not this?  If there is a case in the English courts which is of great interest to our people here, under the 1952 Act in England if the proceedings are broadcast or televised in any shape or form by an English station and received here, it is absolutely privileged.  But the Irish station cannot give the same coverage as the English station with absolute privilege and can only give the same coverage as would secure qualified privilege.  As <Col N="1940" /> I understand the situation, that puts the Irish station at a disadvantage. Does the Parliamentary Secretary appreciate my point?  First, I am considering a case of proceedings in an English court which are of interest to our own people.</P>

Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree with me that it is highly desirable that an Irish broadcasting station will be able to give the same coverage of a case in England that might interest our people as the B.B.C. can give under the same type of legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear there is a very definite difference between the news that the two stations can cope with.  I do not think that should be there.  I do not think that is the type of matter in respect of which it is necessary to have reciprocity at all.  I can see that in tax matters there must be reciprocity. If it is not a two-way street, the benefits must be all one-way. What I am trying to do in this is not to give any benefits to an English broadcasting station but to give an additional benefit to an Irish station to enable it to be able to compete on exactly the same terms with a British station in respect of anything that may happen in a British court.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is a valid argument for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that he is not prepared to do it because it must be reciprocal.  Whether the British wish to put a British station in the same position to compete with an Irish station as regards privilege or not, does not matter.  That is not our business.  Our business is to concern ourselves with the Irish station.  We are not going to gain anything by the British giving the concession to the British station to cover Irish courts, but we are very definitely going to gain something by ensuring that the Irish station is in a position to report a British case&mdash;a case such as I have referred to dealing, for example, with racing matters, which would be of very general interest not merely to the country as a whole but even to certain Deputies I see listening to me on both sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any reason why we should hamstring the Irish station.  I do not see any reason why we should prevent the Irish station being as international in its reports as it can.  The situation, as it is under this section, provides that the Irish station can report Irish court cases under a different law to that under which it can report court cases in the rest of the world. <Col N="1942" /> In respect of the Irish station, I say what should interest the Irish station is the interest of the court case for the listener, regardless of where it is. Obviously, Irish cases in the main are going to be of far more interest to the Irish listener than a court case in some other part of the world.  But I want to ensure that when in the opinion of those who are running television or sound broadcasting there is a court case in another part of the world which they deem worthy of reference, that they can refer to it under exactly the same law as they would if they were dealing with an Irish court case.</P>
    <P>There is an overwhelming argument in favour of that.  I cannot find anything in the Bill that would permit them to do so.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary admits that if they are reporting proceedings in a court anywhere outside the country, they are in a position of qualified privilege rather than absolute privilege.  Let me give the Parliamentary Secretary one concrete example.  What was the position in respect of the Court of Human Rights decision on the Lawless case?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, I think, general acceptance of the principle enshrined in this Bill.  Any criticisms that have been offered on this measure have been related to the judiciousness, or otherwise, of the way in which Bord Fáilte spend the moneys placed at their disposal.  Our island is endowed with great natural beauty and there is an obligation on us to share that beauty with others.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide greater facilities for tourism and to advertise our country better abroad in order to induce people to come here on holiday.  In bygone years, before ever this State was formed, there were people who appreciated the value of the scenery here and who were prepared to exploit it in the interests of the nation.  They came together voluntarily in order to advertise our scenic attractions. Subsequently Bord Fáilte was set up. It is doing magnificent work.  Its bimonthly publication is a superb production.  It advertises our country abroad and it gives people some idea of the gem of nature we have here for their enjoyment should they honour us.</P>
      <P>Tourism is of immense value.  It helps to correct our balance of payments. The Minister told us that over £42,000,000 was spent last year by tourists here.  That shows how indispensable tourism has now become in relation to our balance of payments.  It is somewhat disappointing to learn that British visitors last year accounted for only one per cent. of the tourists coming here.  It is difficult to understand that position.  Only last Monday in Cork I met two Scotsmen who are touring this country.  They were most impressed.  They had visited Killarney and they were anxious to know what points they should visit on their return journey to Dublin.  It is heartwarming to meet these tourists anxious to pay tribute to our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has been instrumental in inducing people to come here in great numbers for international conferences, conventions and congresses. <Col N="1944" /> The more of these that we can get the better because they help to advertise our country abroad.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us some figures for the number of people from Northern Ireland who take their holidays in the Twenty-Six Counties, if it is possible to disentangle the figures from the general statistics.  Because of the return of austerity there it might be possible to induce large numbers from Northern Ireland to come into the Twenty-Six Counties. Such intercommunication is one of the best means of breaking down prejudices. We should exploit the position to the fullest extent possible and do everything now to encourage visitors from Northern Ireland to take advantage here of the cheaper cost of living, the absence of purchase tax, and so on.  If we put the case well to Bord Fáilte that could be done right away. One of the first essentials would be for Bord Fáilte to provide an office in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I am one with those who criticise the large grants given for luxury hotels.  It is not fair to our traditional hoteliers who have done their best in the past, without any State aid, to provide satisfactory accommodation.  Our first consideration should be these hoteliers who developed their premises gradually down through the years so that their hotels are sufficiently enlarged and modernised to attract any type of tourist.  We should try to cater for the middle class and perhaps the wealthier class and forget about the millionaires in our efforts to attract tourists to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday a number of Opposition speakers were critical of what they said was the emphasis put on Dublin by Bord Fáilte.  I do not think that is fair criticism.  Dublin's development has depended to a large extent on the enterprise of some of its hoteliers and has not received as much assistance from Bord Fáilte as other parts of the country.  For instance, an old sore is the fact that there is not a first-class swimming pool in the capital city.  An approach has been made to the Board with a view to assisting the local authority in the provision of a <Col N="1945" /> swimming pool.  We are now informed that such a pool will be built somewhere in Dún Laoghaire.  I should like to hear from the Minister what stage this proposal has reached.  However, because Dún Laoghaire has been selected as a site for the pool again, the city is being refused this amenity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a pool for Dublin is a matter for Dublin Corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Bord Fáilte are financing the pool in Dún Laoghaire.  In other capital cities even in Douglas, Isle of Man, there are first-class swimming pools provided. It is my view that when tourists come here during the warm weather and go around the city looking at the shops, visiting museums and other places of interest, when they become tired and warm there is nothing they would prefer than to go to a proper swimming pool and refresh themselves.  Such an amenity is provided in the centre of Paris not far from the Place de Concorde.</P>
      <P>As I say, the criticism regarding the amount of money made available by the Board to Dublin is unfair.  There are many schemes that could be put forward that are usually undertaken by the local authorities.  For instance, we had a Deputy from County Dublin speaking about Portmarnock.  The Dublin Corporation had to contribute to building the roads to open up Portmarnock. The Board should seriously consider greater development in the Dublin area because with the airport situated here greater benefits would accrue to the country as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to commend the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in introducing this Bill and giving an increased grant to Bord Fáilte.  In doing so, I imply my congratulation to Bord Fáilte for the work they have done in placing the scenic beauty of Ireland before the eyes of the world.  They have done a magnificent job but they have done it only for certain parts of the country. Coming from Mayo, I will say there is something like resentment amongst the people owning hotels there.  They <Col N="1946" /> believe they do not get a reasonable slice of the cake of publicity and propaganda which I believe they deserve.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Palmer has said, Killarney has its lakes and dells. Mayo too has its own beauty spots, its landscapes, its sea fishing and inland fishing and other amenities such as would attract the tourist from any part of the world.  I should like the Minister in replying to say whether Mayo is getting its fair share of publicity from the Tourist Board.  I say they should get at least 75 per cent. of the share that Killarney, Sneem and Killorglin get.</P>
      <P>The reputation of Ireland as a tourist centre depends not alone upon the beauty of her scenery but upon the inherent hospitality of our people. We have that talent to attract people and in speaking to them we give them that relaxed feeling which they wish to get when they come to a country such as ours.  Even the children who may be working in the hayfields or who may be by the roadsides giving a friendly wave to these people, give better publicity to our country than can be given in any newspaper.  I suggest to the authorities of Bord Fáilte that they should initiate a campaign to encourage the people of Ireland, both children and adults, to do their best, outside their legitimate business, to be congenial with the people who come from abroad.</P>
      <P>I have noticed in other countries when people ask for directions or some kind of guidance they are always treated with respect.  When they ask for some kind of guidance they are always treated with respect, and with that businesslike air that is sometimes lacking in this country.  Tourists who come here are usually from busy industrial centres where the tempo of life is quicker than it is here.  What they really want is relaxation, tranquillity and peace and I would say that outside Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Belfast they will get it all over this country.  They will get it especially in Kerry and Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it.  We have <Col N="1947" /> many organised attractions for the tourists.  Fishing is well developed in most of the counties in the West.  Its attraction has proved to be most beneficial in the counties bordering on the Shannon.  I would like to congratulate the Inland Fisheries Trust for the wonderful advantages they have provided for the tourist in ridding the lakes of predatory fish, and in developing those waters adjacent to the lakes.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that Bord Fáilte should do something similar about shooting, if possible.  Shooting is a sport which occurs during the winter and if we could attract to Ireland during the off-tourist season people interested in shooting we would be doing a very good day's work for the hoteliers and guest houses.  People who shoot and fish do not ask for first class hotel accommodation.  All they wish for is good accommodation, plain food and, when they come back in the evening, a drink in the local tavern.  I think that after a few drinks both fishermen and sportsmen add a lot to their actual experiences and an attraction for the tourists would be to meet the local characters who can outdo them in exaggerated experiences. It would be a pity if those experiences should be cut short.  Unfortunately due probably to the law as it now stands, it appears that facilities will not be offered to the tourists to meet in certain places where they might swop yarns and talk about the big one that got away.  The tourist association give the hoteliers grants for the extension and elaboration of their premises. They do not do that for the local publicans.</P>

      <P>Tourists come here to enjoy themselves&mdash;to enjoy our climate such as it is, to enjoy our food and to enjoy our drink.  On the question of food, there should be a campaign to have the local types of food served in various parts of the country.  When we go to the seaside, let us say any place from Bundoran down along the whole coast even as far as that God-forsaken place called Sneem, the people living in these areas should have some local dish to attract the tourist.  It could be lobster, crayfish, mussels, cockles&mdash;all these things would add up to something that would be original in that particular locality.  I would suggest to Bord Fáilte through the Minister that those local dishes should be on the menu.  On various parts of the Continent a local dish is an attraction that takes tourists there.</P>
      <P>Now let us come to one disadvantage to tourists especially in Dublin.  One notices numerous photographers on the streets, taking photographs both by day and night.  Usually they demand payment on the spot and say that the photograph when finished will be sent to the person whose name they take. I honestly believe, and I know it from my own experience, that some of these photographers are absolute frauds. They never send on the finished picture.  Some kind of licence should be issued to these people before they are allowed to deceive tourists or people from the country who come up here and pay with honest coin of the realm but get no satisfaction out of it. These people should be stopped from operating on the streets.  In conclusion I should like to say that I consider it unjust and unfair that hotels should be given a certain amount of liberty in selling certain commodities outside hours.</P>

      <P>I welcome the announcement that the Tourist Board is to get more money to develop the tourist industry because, as the Minister has said, it is a very important industry in this country.  I should like Bord Fáilte to develop the smaller hotels and guest houses.  If one looks through the book published by the Tourist Board of hotels and guest houses that are registered one notices that in the smaller districts there is neither a hotel nor a guest house.  That is a great pity for the reason that we tend to think of tourists in the mass, as being just tourists who will want to go to the bigger hotels where all the amenities are available.  Tourists have their likes and dislikes.  A great number of them are very intelligent in their ideas.  They want to see the country.  The only proper way of seeing a country is to mix with the people in the country.  They can do that in the smaller hotels and guest houses because the majority of our people cannot afford to stay at the big hotels. Tourists, even though they can afford to go to the bigger hotels, prefer to go to smaller places so that they can meet people and find out things about our country and discuss the differences between our country and theirs.</P>
      <P>Many people in the smaller tourist places would develop their premises into guest houses if they could get grants to help them to do so.  I hope the Tourist Board will concentrate in helping the smaller hotels and guest houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1950" /> Bord Fáilte should also concentrate on improving strands.  There are very beautiful beaches and excellent sandy beaches around the coast that other countries have not got.  Unfortunately there is no place on them to park cars. If tarred car parks were provided they would be of great advantage not only to the tourists but to the local people. That is a task that the Tourist Board should undertake.  They should not expect the local councils to do it.  It is no part of their function but it is part of the Tourist Board's business in order to provide an amenity for tourists.</P>
    <P>Now that angling has become so popular the Tourist Board should concentrate more on making good roads to the lakes.  These roads are not council roads.  They are ordinary accommodation roads.  The county councils cannot spend any money on them unless they take them over.  Generally, there are no houses on these roads. They are purely for the benefit of tourists who want to fish.  Tourists bring their cars along a good tarred council road and then, having seen the road going up to the lake, turn back because they do not like to risk their cars on bad roads.  The Tourist Board have improved a few of these roads and have made a very good job of them but they should do more in that line in order to attract more tourists because there are people who come to this country solely for the fishing.</P>
    <P>The Tourist Board office in London does a very good job in attracting tourists to this country.  In the month of January people enquire at various tourist offices before making up their minds which country they will visit for summer holidays.  If there were more of these offices in various towns, not only in Britain but in other countries, we would get far more tourists than we do.</P>
    <P>One difficulty in this country is that the weather is not always what it should be in the summer.  Take a town like Killarney with its scenic attraction of lakes and mountains. Quite often the weather is so wet that people just cannot leave the hotel or guest house.  Many of them take hotel or guest house accommodation on the basis of bed and breakfast and after <Col N="1951" /> breakfast have to go out and amuse themselves.  Quite often the rain is pouring down and they have nowhere to go.  The Tourist Board should make provision for indoor amusements.  At present we have not got the indoor amusements that are absolutely necessary when the weather is very bad and people cannot go out on jaunting cars or on the lakes.</P>
    <P>It is all right for people with cars who can travel a few miles and perhaps get better weather, but people who cannot afford cars have to wait until perhaps 8.30 at night for the theatre or cinema to open.  There is nothing for them to do during the day. On a week day they can go into the shops but on a Sunday they are just wandering about in mackintoshes looking very miserable and deciding never to come back again.  If the Tourist Board are helped by way of grant or something else they could encourage tourists to stay here even when the weather is bad.  I congratulate the Minister on giving this grant to the Tourist Board, and I am sure when we consider what they did before, with this extra money they will be able to make a good impression on the tourist industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion there are two types of tourist.  There is the tourist Bord Fáilte caters for, the well-to-do elderly tourist who likes quiet and likes to sit in a hotel lounge with whiskey and a cigar.  There is also the type of tourist who does not want quiet and who does not want to die yet.  For every one of the first type there are probably 500 of the working type tourist who want plenty of cheap beer, cigarettes, a swim, a good laugh, and a sing-song.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been to the Isle of Man, I have been to Blackpool, and I have been to Coney Island in the States.  I know what the ordinary people want. Bord Fáilte do not cater for that type of tourist.  We should remember that there are 50 or 60 million people in Great Britain and there must be a tourist potential of about 30 million. They are not catered for here.  They find it difficult to get digs when they <Col N="1952" /> come here.  If they come in the holiday period they cannot get a bed and they are told: &ldquo;We are full up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we had tourist camps built cheaply those people would come here.  They are looking only for a bed. The average worker from England does not even want breakfast.  If he gets a bed he will buy some fish and chips for himself.  If it were known that there were tourist camps here, built cheaply and simply those people might well organise to come here annually.  I am sure that if those camps were properly publicised the English workers would stagger their holidays to come here.  We do not want everyone to come in the month of August.  If they were told of our cheap beer and cigarettes, and that they could get a bed, they would come here because those are the things they want.</P>
    <P>I have often been advised that if I wanted a cheap holiday I should go to Spain.  I was told if I went to Spain I would get 30/- for my £ but if I went to Belgium I would get only about 12/- for my £.  That is the sort of thing that goes around.  If we advertised that people can have a good time here, that beer and cigarettes were cheap, and that they could get a bed in a holiday camp, I am sure they would organise to stagger their holidays. It could develop into a large scale business within a period of six months.</P>
    <P>We do not want them all to come together.  It does not help employment to have everyone working for one month, working half-time for three months, and then not working at all. We should aim at five or six months' work for all the people we hope to engage in this business.  In the Isle of Man there are camps which cater for 500 or 600 people.  There is a fortune to be made in the Isle of Man for at least four or five months of the year. Blackpool is the same&mdash;the Golden Mile.  The owners make so much money that they retire on holidays themselves and sit and smoke cigars for the rest of the year.  My point is that there is a potential of 20 million or 30 million tourists from Britain, and we should cater for them as well <Col N="1953" /> as for the well-to-do elderly gentlemen.</P>
    <P>There is no development in Portmarnock which is nine miles from Dublin.  There is no accommodation there for the type of people to whom I refer.  There is a hotel but it probably charges £10 to £12 a week and that does not interest the worker who has £25 or £30 from his club.  He wants a bed and he will spend the rest on food and drink.  Portmarnock has one of the best strands in Dublin, but most of the year it is like a graveyard.  There is no sewerage on the strand side.  If the caravan tourist trade is to be developed we must have caravan sites in and around seaside resorts with proper sewerage.  The conditions there are very primitive.  Subsidies should be given to the local people for sewerage for these caravan sites.</P>
    <P>Deputy Palmer said that we should ensure that our menus are printed in Irish as well as in English.  I do not know what purpose that would serve.  The type of people we are trying to get to come here will not know a word of Irish.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is wrong. They have a good idea of what certain French words on a menu mean.  They would not know what Irish words meant and the words would be only ornamental.  I know that something like cabbage appears in French on the menu as something like caviar.  The tourist has a fairly good idea that it is only cabbage.  He is not codded.</P>

      <P>I mean no offence but it would serve no purpose.  As we read in this morning's Press, a packet of cigarettes costs 4/6d. and watered <Col N="1954" /> beer costs 1/7d. in Britain.  If we can get those people to realise that we have strong beer and cheaper cigarettes they will come here.  They must consider the prices especially when they have only a limited amount of money to spend.  Excursion rates spread over five or six months should be provided because when people hear that they can travel cheaply they will arrange to travel in May.  If they knew they could travel cheaply and get a bed here they would make a practice of taking their holidays in May.  Our problem is to get those people, the working people of Britain, to spread their holidays over five or six months of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Deputies in paying a tribute to the work being done to encourage the tourist industry.  In the matter of this Bill, however, I have one reservation. The current grant to Bord Fáilte is an annual one but now we have the position where it may be extended beyond the term of one year.  My concern is that in such a situation this House should have an opportunity every year of reviewing the activities of Bord Fáilte.  I want to be assured that, having obtained this sum, Bord Fáilte will still be accountable to the Minister and to this House as to how the money is spent.</P>
      <P>I was interested to read of the attempts being made to make the most of the scenic views of this country which are so many and so varied.  It is to be hoped that the local authorities, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, will make these views more easily accessible and that the high fences and thorn hedges along the roadsides will be lowered.  I know a start has been made on it but we can enlarge upon that work to the great advantage not only of the people who come here but to the people of the areas in which these views are situated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In places of scenic beauty, I suggest that the roads should be widened sufficiently to allow for the parking of cars so that the free flow of traffic would not be impeded.  In those areas a tendency has been growing to park caravans.  That has become a feature of tourism everywhere and it is something <Col N="1955" /> that should be catered for more extensively here by the provision of caravan sites and, if it could be done without undue cost, of water supplies on these sites.</P>
    <P>On the question of our national monuments and places of historical interest, it strikes me that a great many people do not fully appreciate what these monuments stand for.  I suggested on a previous occasion that it would be well worth while to have short accounts of monuments or ruins of historical interest provided on the sites in glass frames so that people could read them easily.  On the Continent one finds at the entrances to all major cities a pillar with a series of maps in revolving cases which can easily be turned about.  Not alone is there a street map of the cities and towns themselves but they also provide information about places of interest within a reasonable distance.  If we could provide such information without undue cost it would help not only tourists who come from abroad but our own people as well.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear Deputy Mrs. Crowley refer to amusement facilities and the need for indoor facilities in wet weather.  Now that we have such a large number of tourists coming from Britain we should become more aware of the fact that they are very given to pastimes which might be made available readily&mdash;bowling greens and hard tennis courts.  The provision of such amenities is a thing in which local effort should be co-ordinated but I do not think it should be left entirely to local effort because it might mean that the amenities would become attached to major hotels in which case the right of admission might be reserved to the people who frequent the hotels as guests.  I would make these facilities available for tourists of all classes and indeed for our own people as well. They would attract both outside tourists and our own people to such centres and would help to keep the people of the locality at home.</P>
    <P>We can readily understand that wealthy tourists may go where they will.  People who have money are not concerned about where they stop.  They can pick and choose, but the middle classes and those with more limited <Col N="1956" /> means are the people we should encourage to come by the provision of grants.  From that point of view I was very glad to hear the suggestions about our smaller hotels and guest houses.  I agree that they should be encouraged by every means possible to provide more accommodation for the type of tourist now coming here.  Deputy Sherwin referred to the Golden Mile. I hope we will never reach that stage here because anyone who has seen the strand at Blackpool will realise that there is not very much relaxation for either mind or body there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain things which we all know militate against the success of our tourist effort.  Public opinion is the only thing that can help here because there is very little either the Minister or Bord Fáilte can do.  I refer to the pestering and importuning of people in our larger towns.  It is something that the Garda are attending to.  There is no doubt that this kind of thing upsets people.  We in this country have a tradition for hospitality and the type of person to whom I refer does little to help us to keep that name.  We want Ireland to remain the land of welcomes.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay a special tribute to the publication of Bord Fáilte.  It is a very well produced document; the photographs are varied and the articles of very high merit. We should try to make it more readily available.  It is something that would help a great deal to make known abroad our natural amenities and the customs of our people.  It is an invitation in itself to visit such places, if one had the time and the money.  I know the Board has had its own film, and it was a very beautiful one indeed.  I would hope it would not stop at one and that, if and when it can provide funds, it would continue to distribute such films or even film strips to be used as widely as possible in countries nearer to us, so as to advertise more freely what we have to offer here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the measure from the point of view of the increased money. <Col N="1957" /> I believe it is a sound investment. Tourism has proved itself to be our second money spinner.  I hope when the Minister is concluding he will give us the assurance that this annual review will take place in the House and that Deputies will have an opportunity of reviewing the activities of Bord Fáilte at the end of the year and how this money has been used.  Everybody will hope it will bring an increased number of tourists to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems obvious from the tone of the debate that the Minister will have no difficulty in getting the House to agree to his further subvention to Bord Fáilte.  I think that can be regarded as a vote of confidence in the working of the Board, and in my opinion the Board are deserving of a vote of confidence.</P>
      <P>It is most gratifying to realise that we have reached the stage for some time past where tourism is no longer the plaything of Party politics.  Everybody realises its tremendous importance in our economic life and most people also realise its potential value. The only regret I have is that we are not able to afford more money for its promotion.  We talk about tourism as being our second biggest industry, but surely there is no comparison between the outlay on it and the outlay on agriculture and other forms of industry? An infinitesimal amount of money is being spent on tourism and the Board are handicapped by want of necessary funds.  Surely we know what it costs to advertise in foreign countries and in various ways to publicise the attractions of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although Deputy Sherwin has his views on the subject of the language and of having attractions like those of Brighton and Blackpool, I think the average Briton, like the average European, if he can afford it, likes to get away and experience something different from what he has at home. He wants to go to a country, whose language he can understand maybe, but which can show him something different from what he sees every day at home.  If the menu were in the Irish language it might be taken home as a souvenir, whereas if it were completely <Col N="1958" /> in English, it might be left on the table.</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to the various other attractions we have, which are not so obvious to ourselves because we live with them but which are quite strange to the person Deputy Jones mentioned who cannot find room to sit down along the &ldquo;Golden Mile&rdquo; of Blackpool.  Such a person would find plenty of room to relax and enjoy himself in Portmarnock, to which Deputy Sherwin referred, if he were properly directed to it and could get a bus there at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>In most parts of the country there is a tremendous lack of accommodation in guest houses.  If we are to attract visitors from across channel we must visualise something other than grade A hotels.  Many of those people want something more modest, and a guest house fills their requirements.  I know that at the moment it is not possible for a tourist to find guest house accommodation in West Cork.  There was a movement started last year, sponsored by Bord Fáilte, to promote &ldquo;living with the people.&rdquo; It had much to recommend it.  I have not heard what happened, except that in Inchigeela it was a very great success indeed.  I do not know of anywhere else it has succeeded. If the private individual could be enticed to take a cross-channel visitor for a fortnight or longer during the summer months, it would meet the situation in some measure.  I can visualise a great number of visitors enjoying such a holiday living with the people and it would be of mutual benefit.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment those associated with the greatly extended and most enjoyable bus tours&mdash;one-day, six-day and ten-day tours&mdash;run by C.I.E. in conjunction with Bord Fáilte. One thing that will develop tremendously in the next five or ten years is caravanning.  That will require the development of caravan sites.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point. Whatever about customs we have here that may seem strange and whatever about the pastimes we have, there is definitely a need for ordinary modern public conveniences in the more populated resorts.  It is just not good <Col N="1959" /> enough at a weekend to have a thousand people in a small seaside resort and no public convenience of any kind available.  We must face up to that problem.  There are difficulties inasmuch as there are not always sewerage facilities.  However, they have overcome that on the Continent.  I feel if Bord Fáilte could make available expert engineering advice to local authorities, they might get the local authorities to provide the necessary money.  At present the local authorities feel the task is beyond them.  They visualise a tremendous scheme, with a very big capital outlay, and are not prepared to face up to it.  But I believe it could be done much more modestly and quite efficiently.  If Bord Fáilte could find that solution and make it available to local authorities, we might get somewhere.</P>
    <P>I was glad Deputy Jones mentioned films, because I can think of no better way of publicising the scenic attractions of the country.  I have seen several films sponsored by Bord Fáilte and they were all admirable.  Much, however, remains to be done and it could be done if the money were available.</P>
    <P>Finally, I shall sound a warning note.  It is true our people generally appreciate the value of the tourist and are kind, courteous and generous to tourists.  But there is a very small percentage, I am sorry to say&mdash;human nature being as it is we must expect it &mdash;who take advantage of the tourist and who try to cash in on him by overcharging or cheating in one way or another.  It should be made clear through all the publicity we can have that such a person has not the support of the people and is not typical of the nation.</P>
    <P>Everything possible should be done to bring to the notice of Bord Fáilte, or the responsible authorities, the case of a person who is cheated or not treated properly.  I think the percentage is very small but nobody should be allowed to go away with a wrong impression of the country because of the manner in which he is treated at a certain guest house or by a certain individual. Taking the long view, that would be a great pity.  I congratulate <Col N="1960" /> Bord Fáilte on what they have done with limited resources in the past.  If the Government now, and in the future, can make more money available that money, as a previous speaker said, will prove a very good investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always held that the British industrial worker is, from the point of view of our tourist industry, much more valuable than the American millionaire.  From my personal knowledge I believe we have fallen down very badly on tourist publicity in Britain.  We are missing a golden opportunity.  In the canteens in the large industrial areas it should be possible to arrange film shows advertising what our country has to offer. That is not being done.  That was brought home forcibly to me in one particular instance in which a propaganda film was borrowed, kept for six months, and nobody asked for it back. People regard the cost of shipping a car overseas as prohibitive and they prefer to go to Scotland or down to Cornwall because they are shy of transporting a car overseas.  If the ease with which cars can be transported here was brought to their attention they would be very glad to spend a holiday in Ireland, a holiday as cheap as any holiday they might spend in Scotland or the south of England.  I urge the Minister to bring these points to the notice of the publicity section of Bord Fáilte.  I have no doubt whatever that, if publicity is given, we will attract these people here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure Deputy Jones at the outset that the Bill before the House is not in any way an attempt to evade responsibility for coming before the Dáil each year and having the policy and purpose of Bord Fáilte debated in this House.  Up to now the practice has been to devote a sum of not more than £500,000 per annum to Bord Fáilte for their ordinary promotional and other activities. The figure of £500,000 was set in the 1955 Act.  Having regard to the change in money values since then it is not unreasonable for Bord Fáilte now to ask the Dáil to vote them an annual sum greater than £500,000.  While £500,000, having regard to the return <Col N="1961" /> on that outlay, may not appear to be a very large sum we have to appreciate that there must be a limit on the amount of promotional moneys we can make available for tourist purposes.</P>
      <P>This Bill has three main purposes. The first is to make available to Bord Fáilte over the next seven years a sum not exceeding £5,000,000 which will mean roughly about £700,000 per annum.  The second is to increase from £3,000,000 to £5,000,000 the amount which Bord Fáilte may guarantee for loans for hotel and tourist resort development.  The third is to remove the limit of £75,000 yearly which represents the sum that Bord Fáilte were permitted to pay by way of interest on loans for hotel improvement and building purposes. Bord Fáilte will have to account to the House in the ordinary way during the course of the Estimates presented under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It has been represented by Bord Fáilte that the next few years will be important in tourist promotion and, if they are given more money now, they may be able to increase the value to our economy of expenditure for tourist purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked whether we are getting a sufficient return for the moneys we are expending.  He compared the increase in tourist income in the different countries in Europe as published by O.E.E.C. recently.  These figures showed that the rate of expansion for Ireland was very low&mdash;12 per cent. in a period of three years from 1955 to 1958, compared with 25 per cent. in Britain and 64 per cent. in West Germany.  He pointed out that Switzerland was only 5 per cent.  The Swiss tourist industry is very highly developed.  Up to some years ago it was the main income for the country. The Swiss used that income to build up their manufacturing industries and these industries have now far out-stripped tourism as a means of national income.  We must not forget that these countries have attractions over and above those we can offer. They are situated on the European mainland and travel is naturally easier overland than it is oversea.  They have certain climatic advantages.  I should <Col N="1962" /> like to point out that our climate is not as bad as some would have us believe.  People who come here take us to task for complaining so much about our weather; they say that our climate is not half as bad as we represent it to be.  The figure of 12 per cent. expansion as representing the increase in tourist income in a three year period is perhaps low.  The purpose of this Bill is to try to increase that rate of income.</P>
    <P>If there was any thought permeating the course of the debate it was that we should concentrate more on the ordinary British tourist than on the more exotic type of tourist from other parts of the world.  Most of the Deputies who spoke seem to have ignored the fact that that was one of the main points of my introductory speech.  I am not claiming any credit for that because Bord Fáilte have long realised the value to this country of the British middle-class tourist and they have made special efforts to attract that type of tourist.  They have established offices in different parts of Britain mainly for that purpose.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there are some 300,000 British tourists coming here every year.  Of the 30,000,000 or so people who leave their homes in Britain to go on holidays, not necessarily abroad of course, it is not unreasonable to hope to attract another 1 per cent. and make the number of these tourists 600,000 as against 300,000.  In order to do that, as many Deputies pointed out, we would require to have the type of accommodation that suits them best.</P>
    <P>As far as Bord Fáilte are concerned there is no question of concentrating on luxury type accommodation.  The grants that are available are standard bedroom grants and reconstruction grants.  Over and above that there are loans which are guaranteed by Bord Fáilte and loans which are available from other sources in respect of both of which Bord Fáilte are prepared for a period of five years to pay the interest.  Therefore, there is no distinction in the facilities afforded by Bord Fáilte for the financing of hotel construction and improvement schemes as between the ordinary and the luxury type accommodation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1963" /> I agree with the many Deputies who made the point that the keystone of our tourist traffic is the ordinary family type hotel.  As long as we can have enough of these situated in sufficiently diversified locations throughout the country then our tourist industry is bound to succeed.  Some Deputies while, in general, congratulating Bord Fáilte on their performance, criticised different aspects of their administration. That is inevitable in the case of any State board.  There must be some defects in their administration as seen by different people.  Deputy Kyne, for example, instanced the case of a man who had procured financial assistance from Bord Fáilte for a particular job and who then embarked upon a more extended operation in his hotel for which he failed to get a grant.  Deputy Kyne suggested therefore that Bord Fáilte had a rule that as long as the due returns for financial assistance on one operation were outstanding, assistance might not be given for a second operation.  That is completely wrong. As long as Bord Fáilte are satisfied that the economics of any scheme are sound they are prepared to assist any undertaking.  For my own part, both as Deputy and as Minister, I have had my knocks, too, from Bord Fáilte.  I have made representations to them in both capacities on behalf of different people and from my own observations I can only conclude they examine all cases objectively.  They try to assess the merits of each scheme put before them and decide on the basis of their assessment what financial assistance they can give.</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to grants for tourist resort development. Under the principal Act a sum of £1,000,000 is being devoted to major resort development.  By the decision of this House it was left to Bord Fáilte to decide what areas would qualify under the Act for development.  Deputy Desmond in the course of his remarks said the resort in which he was most interested, Crosshaven, County Cork, was one that ought to qualify for some assistance under that Act.  If I were given a free hand in the administration of that £1,000,000, Crosshaven would be very high on my list of priorities <Col N="1964" /> because I have a certain attachment to it.  I know it perhaps better than any other holiday resort in the country.  I have certain nostalgic affiliations with it and perhaps it was just as well that Bord Fáilte and not the Minister was given the power to decide to which resorts the major resort development grants were to be given.  I can only conclude that Bord Fáilte in their wisdom and having regard to their special knowledge of the situation make up their minds what areas and what schemes submitted to them are best entitled to assistance.</P>
    <P>There were many points made during the course of the debate to which it would be difficult for me and to which perhaps I would not be expected to reply.  However, I would say the main attraction for tourists to this country is its unspoiled nature.  Deputy Sherwin suggested we should try to develop a &ldquo;golden mile,&rdquo; such as they have in Blackpool, in places like Portmarnock. For my part, as long as I am Minister for Industry and Commerc I hope we never see that type of development.  I hate the hurdy-gurdy type of amenities.</P>

It will be very difficult to keep our tourist resorts unspoiled but in so far as they can remain unspoiled, while being given a due amount of development, that is the kind of tourist amenity I should like to offer to foreign visitors.</P>

They can get that type of entertainment anywhere in Dublin any night of the week, as Deputy Sherwin knows well.  The type of attraction we have to offer is the natural, unspoiled beauty of the countryside that no other country in Europe can offer to the same extent.</P>
      <P>I had the experience once of being on one of West Kerry's beautiful beaches.  There was another group of people on the beach a couple of hundred yards away.  I was delighted to hit a place like this.  Shortly after I arrived there with my group another group, obviously a local group, came along over the sand dunes.  They looked around and saw the two groups of people and they said: &ldquo;This place is too crowded; let us go somewhere else.&rdquo;</P>

It might be some comfort to Deputy McGilligan to know that over the period from 1955 to 1960 that represents a steady increase from about 38 per cent. up to almost 50 per cent. with a slight setback during the 1958 period when certain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings me to Deputy Cosgrave's question which was coined more objectively than Deputy McGilligan's:&mdash;&ldquo;Are we satisfied we are getting value for it?&rdquo; One can never be satisfied one is getting value for promotional activities under all heads.  Publicity costs a lot of money and while one cannot relate the return in any business activity to any particular type of publicity, one has to take the rough with the smooth and one must realise that unless one publicises one's wares one will not get due return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies raised the question of indoor facilities.  I think Deputy Mrs. Crowley in particular raised that question.  She suggested that Bord Fáilte should provide some subvention to either local authorities or private interests to provide these amenities. My answer to that is that the money we are providing here, and have been providing down the years for tourist <Col N="1968" /> promotion, is money which is priming the pump rather than monies which represent capital outlay.  Tourism is a business and one largely from which private enterprise draws profit.  Therefore once the pump has been primed, in many respects by Bord Fáilte, it is up to private interests, whether they be hoteliers, amusement centre owners or others, to provide these indoor amenities that will attract tourists from abroad and will keep them amused when the weather is not so fine.</P>
    <P>Criticism was made, not by very many Deputies but by some, with regard to overcharging in hotels.  I have made several comments since I became Minister for Industry and Commerce on that point.  By and large people who go to hotels in any country like to know exactly what they are likely to spend and when they are charged more than the stated tariff, or when they are charged extras which they have not taken into account, it is an irritant on people generally and is usually something they remember to the point that they return neither to that hotel again nor even to the town or country where that hotel is situated.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has powers for the publication of recognised hotels and guest houses.  These hotels are required to state in advance each year their charges and Bord Fáilte and the general public expect them to adhere to these charges.  If there are any complaints, Bord Fáilte are very glad to hear about them and I, for one, would have no sympathy with any hotel or guest house struck off the register or that would be denied the right to call itself an hotel or guest house by reason of overcharging.</P>
    <P>I know that the number of hotel proprietors who engage in this practice is very limited but nevertheless, a few small examples can create a bad impression. I shall encourage Bord Fáilte on all occasions to be ruthless in dealing with these people.  The good name that we have gained in business and in tourism internationally is one that we ought to treasure and one we should be very jealous of.</P>
    <P>There were very many other minor points raised during the debate that I do not think it necessary to deal with <Col N="1969" /> in detail.  One I should have adverted to was the complaint by some of the Labour Deputies about alleged bad treatment of hotel workers, especially those who have been Bord Fáilte trainees.  That has not been brought officially to my notice.  I have seen comments on it recently in the Press. I doubt if it is widespread to any extent but if there is any complaint I would be glad to receive particulars. In the meantime, I would expect that the trade union, the I.T.G.W.U. which caters for hotel employees, would be well able to redress any grievance that any of these young workers have and, as I said, I believe they are very few.</P>
    <P>I think these are all the points that were raised of a general nature and that I feel called upon to deal with. As I said the minor points that have been raised will be brought to Bord Fáilte's attention although I do not think it will be necessary to bring them to their attention because they are very conscious of these matters generally.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to make one other remark and that is in reference to the statement by Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde that all tourist publicity is directed towards Dublin. I think that is completely untrue.  It may be that private individuals promote Dublin above other parts of the country but reference has been made to the publication &ldquo;Ireland of the Welcomes&rdquo;.  I think everyone will agree that the publicity there is very diversified and that all parts of the country are treated in turn and with due regard to their attractions.  I do not think there is any suggestion that Dublin above any other part of the country receives an undue amount of tourist publicity from Bord Fáilte.  I do not think there is any suggestion that Dublin above any other part of the country can be singled out as having received an undue proportion of publicity from Bord Fáilte.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make it clear to the House exactly what we are doing in this whole matter.  Section 19 is really only a repeat of the existing law with an extension to broadcasting. When the British came to pass their Act of 1952 they changed the situation with regard to reporting Court proceedings.  Prior to the 1952 Act and under the 1888 Act there was no limitation as to where the courts were situated but when they came to pass the 1952 Act they stipulated that the protection would apply only to courts within the United Kingdom.  What we are doing in our Bill is, as it were, following the British precedent in relation to our own situation.  In regard to the absolute privilege that is involved here we are stipulating that a broadcast by an Irish station of reports of court proceedings either here or in Northern Ireland is absolutely privileged. The justification for that is, of course, that our courts are in a special position to us and we want to have regard to that special position and that special importance and in so far as a broadcast by an Irish station of these reports is concerned we afford them absolute privilege.  It is a logical sequence, in view of the position here, to extend that to cover courts in Northern Ireland which are dealing with our own people also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, when we come to courts outside the State and outside Northern Ireland we afford reports of those courts qualified privilege to the extent that if they are reported without malice by a newspaper or a broadcasting station in this country then they are absolutely privileged.  I want to point out to the House that in this regard <Col N="1972" /> these reports come within the ambit of the First Part of the Second Schedule to the Bill, not the Second Part, so that they are privileged without explanation or apology.  In other words, the qualified privilege is absolute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Your heading to the Second Schedule is &ldquo;Newspaper statements having qualified privilege.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have two different sorts of qualified privilege. We divide these things into two Parts in the Second Schedule.  We have Part I and Part II.  The matters in Part I concern what I am calling absolute qualified privilege.  In other words, they have privilege without reference to an explanation or contradiction, whereas the items in Part II have qualified privilege subject to their being prepared to publish an explanation or contradiction if necessary.</P>
      <P>I think we are dealing with the matter very appropriately indeed.  We give this absolute privilege to reports of our own court proceedings when the reports are broadcast by an Irish station and to any other courts when they are broadcast by an Irish station or published by an Irish newspaper subject to the qualified privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, is not what the sections say.  I want to talk only of absolute privilege which is given by Section 19.  The privilege there, I was told before the interruption, was absolute privilege&mdash;no qualified privilege at all about it.  Anything that occurs under Section 25 is a qualified privilege.  This is absolute privilege. To what are we giving absolute privilege?  We are giving absolute privilege to a fair and accurate report &mdash;that is the first condition&mdash;of any proceedings publicly heard before any court established by law and exercising judicial authority within the State or in Northern Ireland.  It must be a fair and accurate report; it must be of judicial proceedings either here or in Northern Ireland.  We give complete privilege to a report published in a newspaper and &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo; means a newspaper which is printed or published here or in Northern Ireland. <Col N="1973" /> When we come to broadcasting, the broadcasting is limited to &ldquo;broadcasting by means of wireless telegraphy as part of any programme or service provided by means of a broadcasting station within the State&rdquo;&mdash;only in the Twenty-six Counties.  I cannot understand why, the overriding thing being a fair and accurate report and the second being judicial proceedings, we should extend the area of judicial proceedings. Deputy Sweetman's argument was different from mine.  My argument is that if judicial proceedings are conducted here or in Northern Ireland and they are published in a newspaper printed and published here or in Northern Ireland that is all right, but when it comes to broadcasting absolute privilege attaches where it is broadcast from the station within the State.  I do not understand what differentiation is being made.</P>

      <P>I did not hear any reason that appealed to me.  Deputy Sweetman has a different point, but let me limit myself to absolute privilege. As I say a newspaper report of judicial proceedings has complete privilege but we are limiting the privilege of the broadcast report only to such broadcast as occurs from our own station.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan's argument is that we are extending this privilege to newspapers which are <Col N="1974" /> printed and published in Northern Ireland, but that we do not extend to broadcasting stations in Northern Ireland the same privilege.  He asks why do we differentiate between the newspapers printed and published in Northern Ireland and the broadcasts from Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A broadcasting station outside the State&mdash;it does not matter if it is in Northern Ireland, Great Britain or Honolulu&mdash;does not qualify for privilege under this section. The reason we are excluding the Northern Ireland broadcasting station is that Northern Ireland newspapers are Irish in the real sense of the word. The broadcasting stations as we understand are nothing more than extensions of the British broadcasting station.  If we wanted to include a Northern Ireland broadcasting station we should be logical and include all British broadcasting stations, which we are not prepared to do.  There is that simple logical consistency about what we are doing.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(6) Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section shall not apply where the party aggrieved proves that he has suffered special damage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that the provision in the earlier part of the section will not operate in a case where special damage is proved.  The amendment is to delete subsection (6) of this section. The advantage will be that the offer of amends will not be a defence where a plaintiff proves he has suffered pecuniary loss.  The whole of Section 22 will accordingly not apply if a person can prove he suffered pecuniary loss.</P>

But in the case of the second part, in regard to any of the items in the second part, they are only privileged if the publisher, having been asked to publish an explanation, has done so.

      <P>Quite clearly the Parliamentary Secretary does not understand the difference between absolute privilege and qualified privilege.

Anything in the first part of the Second Schedule is qualified privilege, because if malice is proved the &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; is ruled out.</P>

      <P>Earlier on, I was saying, for want of a better term and in order to distinguish between the items in Part I and Part II of the Second Schedule, the items in Part I have qualified privilege absolutely whereas the items in Part II have only a restricted qualified privilege.  By that I meant that the items in Part I had the qualified privilege without any qualification as to apology, correction or explanation, whereas the items in Part II only had that qualified privilege subject to explanation, apology or correction.  It was in that sense that I distinguished between Part I and Part II.  Part I had what I call absolute qualified privilege and Part II had merely qualified privilege.</P>

      <P>Deputy Booth might go and read <i>Focus</i>.  I believe he is on the editorial board.  There was a good deal of malice in certain phrases that were used about the 1916 men in the journal called <i>Focus</i>, in connection with which publication Deputy Booth is on the editorial board.  Statements made in this House are absolutely privileged and no question of malice can dislodge that position.  Judicial statements are privileged absolutely and no question of malice arises.  When one comes to qualified privilege, there is a certain protection in regard to people who speak or write in certain ways, but that can be dislodged if malice can be shown.  There is a certain amount of confusion here about privilege that may be absolute but which can be removed from that category. The Second Schedule to which Section 25 refers has as a heading <Col N="1986" /> newspaper statements having qualified privilege, and that is the beginning and end of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter to which reference was made earlier on in relation to another section, but I think it is apposite to bring the matter up again here.  We are giving a certain amount of protection here to newspapers in relation to certain types of reports.  There was a discussion as to the nature of that protection.  It is a protection we give to newspapers published here and in Northern Ireland.  I think we should be very clear that this protection is not given to newspapers published in England.  We are now enacting a piece of legislation which will, in fact, discriminate in favour of Irish newspapers&mdash;newspapers published in Northern Ireland are included &mdash;as against newspapers published in England and elsewhere.  I question whether that is a very wise thing to do. If, in fact, we have this right to give certain protection to Irish papers, I wonder would it not also be right to give similar protection to newspapers which may circulate here but which are printed elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not give it to our papers.  The British do not give these privileges to Irish newspapers circulating in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point to which I was coming.  It seems to me that this is something which could easily be taken up between the two Governments in order to see if there could be some fair agreement as to the type of protection that will be given.  It should be pointed out that it would be desirable if the type of protection which it is proposed to give to newspapers printed in this country were <Col N="1987" /> extended elsewhere.  We all know there is a great deal of interchange in newspapers as between the two countries. Probably the flow is greater than it is out.</P>
      <P>It seems to me it would be worthwhile for the Government to take the matter up with the British Government. There seems to be some principle involved.  If it is just that this type of defence should be allowed&mdash;it is a section which should be enacted&mdash; I feel this protection should also be given to the proprietors of other newspapers whose papers may be circulating here.  This particular type of qualified privilege is something which is long overdue.  Justice demands that we should endeavour to extend it to newspapers published elsewhere and circulating here.  Surely it should be possible to get a reciprocal agreement to protect our newspapers elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say there is no such reciprocity.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary the Act of 1952? The Schedule says &ldquo;In relation to the following countries and territories the provisions of the Schedule shall have effect in Her Majesty's Dominions&rdquo; and the Republic of Ireland is included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to find out why not.  The Schedule to the British Act is the same as our Schedule and the Republic of Ireland is included in the interpretation section of the Schedule as if the Republic of Ireland were one of Her Majesty's Dominions. It is the last clause.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of some importance.  The Parliamentary Secretary should look into it.  This Schedule would indicate that, whilst the British have proceeded to legislate for themselves and the other countries listed in the Schedule, they have also given the protection of this qualified privilege to newspapers emanating from this country.  If that is so, I do not think we should pass a piece of legislation which would discriminate against them.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would look into it and let us know what the position is on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is a copy of the English section it is possible that with the experience which has been referred to by Deputy McGilligan, the wording of this section could be improved in order to bring about the desired effect.  We use the expression &ldquo;giving evidence in mitigation of damages.&rdquo; I wonder would it be more wise to consider using a different form of phraseology to permit a reference <Col N="1994" /> being made to the fact that damages had been recovered or sought if it were agreed between the parties?  The phrase &ldquo;giving evidence in mitigation&rdquo; means presumably putting someone in the witness box to prove the fact which might actually be a notorious fact and it might be well to phrase the section in such a way as to permit an agreed statement to be read by counsel.</P>
      <P>Another drafting amendment that may be considered is that it should be provided that this claim for mitigation of damages should be specifically pleaded in the defence.  In some of the branches of the law of libel, it is specifically provided that a special plea must be put into the defence if mitigation of damages is claimed&mdash;for example, where an apology has been inserted.  It seems to me that it might be desirable to put in a similar subsection requiring that this plea for mitigation of damages should be raised on the pleadings.  I think of course if such a section is put in, there should be a saver put in for any extraordinary occurrence such as an action commencing after the pleadings had been closed in the first action.  I think generally it might be desirable to have this section as fool-proof as possible.  I anticipate that, as it stands at the moment, it may well raise a certain difficulty.  This section may not be pleaded specially as a defence. The question may subsequently arise if a section can be relied on if it has not been specifically pleaded and while the arguments may arise both ways it should be our job to have the matter as clear as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought it was perfectly clear.  First with regard to the pleading, I should think the section could only be read to mean &ldquo;may give evidence in mitigation&rdquo;. But I have not a full knowledge of the case that took place in Britain.  It could be that the jury in the second case were prepared to award £200,000 and mitigated it to the amount awarded.  I do not know. I would have to find out more about it.  But I am certainly always prepared to accept the suggestion that we should have a look at it again with a view to making it clearer if possible. <Col N="1995" /> I would have thought it was absolutely clear but, once a suggestion has been made that it is not, I shall be glad to re-examine it.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to delete Section 28 because of the Civil Liability Bill which has been through Special Committee.  Report Stage will, we hope, be taken to-night.  The Civil Liability Bill provides for this matter in a better fashion.  The 1888 Act section is unsatisfactory and difficult to interpret.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Section 28 is I think in the 1952 British Bill.  A thing I do not understand at all is what is intended to be the difference in the law of defamation between the provisions of Section 27 and Section 28.  It seems to me that in relation to the law of defamation the appropriate way, for example, of putting the case we were discussing before would have been under Section 28&mdash;under Consolidation. The position in respect of Section 27 would take into account all the facts where the wording was slightly different.  I do not quite understand what the difference is.  The Parliamentary Secretary is taking it out here purely because he prefers to have it in the Civil Liability Bill but, when he is having his second look at Section 27, he will want to have a second look at Section 27 in the light of the contribution provisions of the Civil Liability Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 11 (4) of the Civil Liability Bill says:</P>
      <P>Where there is a joint libel in circumstances normally protected by the defences of qualified privilege or fair comment upon a matter of public interest, the malice of one person shall not defeat the defence for the other, unless that other is vicariously liable for the malice of the first.</P>
      <P>That has a bearing on it too.  Subsection (5) deals with the case where there is the same or substantially the same libel or slander or injurious falsehood published by different persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">

      <P>Subsection (4) of Section 11 says:</P>
      <P>Where there is a joint libel in circumstances normally protected by the defences of qualified privilege or fair comment upon a matter of public interest, the malice of one person shall not defeat the defence for the other, unless that other is vicariously liable for the malice of the first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That subsection deals with vicarious liability but subsection (5) says that where the same or substantially the same libel or slander or injurious falsehood is published by different persons, the court shall take into consideration the extent to which it is probable that the statement in question was published directly or indirectly to the same persons.  That has nothing to do with the consolidation of actions.  What we <Col N="1997" /> are discussing is Section 28, the side heading of which says:</P>
    <P>Consolidation of actions.</P>
    <P>[Re-enactment with extension of 1888 (c. 64) s. 5]</P>
    <P>The section provides that upon an application by or on behalf of two or more defendants the actions may be consolidated and that the jury shall assess the whole amount of the damages in one sum.  That is very different from Section 11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a re-enactment with extension of Section 5 of the 1888 Act which we are repealing, so that there will be nothing there then dealing specifically with it and it does not seem to be covered by the subsections suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I would think, in any event, that it would be advisable to have it in this Defamation Bill. There is a special clause in the Civil Liability Bill dealing with libel and slander.  It would be much better to have it in the Defamation Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking Section 11 as a whole.  Section 28 specifically refers to two or more defendants in actions in respect of the same or substantially the same libel or slander.  On their application, the court makes an order to consolidate the actions and have them tried together and then the defendants in any new <Col N="1998" /> actions instituted in respect of the same or substantially the same cause of action shall also be entitled to be joined in a common action upon a joint application being made.  Then under subsection (2), in a consolidatec action under the section, the jury shall assess the whole amount of the damages in one sum and then there is a way of splitting it up.  Section 11 of the Civil Liability Bill has nothing to do with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points here that have to be considered. The first is that it does seem to me that Section 28 of the Bill we are discussing is something which is not covered, as the Parliamentary Secretary suggests it is covered, by Section 11 of the Civil Liability Bill.  It may be covered indeed&mdash;I have not gone into detail&mdash;in the various sections in the Civil Liability Bill but it certainly does not appear to be covered by either subsection (4) or subsection (5) of Section 11 of the Civil Liability Bill.</P>
      <P>In any event, it seems to me to be desirable to have it in this Bill just as it seems to me to be desirable to have in this Bill subsections (4) and (5) of Section 11 of the Civil Liability Bill. These are two matters that are dealing with libel and slander specifically in the Civil Liability Bill and we are trying&mdash;which is a very desirable aim&mdash; to have a Consolidated Bill dealing with libel and slander.  Here is a certain aspect of it in regard to which already we are starting to branch out into separate pieces of legislation.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, first of all, subsections (4) and (5) of Section 11 of the Civil Liability Bill be brought into this Bill and, if necessary, re-enacted, but also that he consider again whether, in fact, by knocking out Section 28, as it is proposed, he is doing away with something which was considered desirable when the Bill was drafted and has not replaced it by a suitable provision in the Civil Liability Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a moot point as to whether or not the provisions of Section 11 subsections (4) and (5) of the Civil Liability Bill should not be included in this Bill.  Admittedly, they <Col N="1999" /> deal with libel.  On the other hand, they deal with concurrent libel and the Civil Liability Bill sets out to codify and amend the law with regard to concurrent wrong-doers generally.  From that point of view, the provisions should be included in the Civil Liability Bill.  On the other hand, as they are dealing with libel, I suppose there is an argument for putting them in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything against putting it in both Bills&mdash;re-enacting it twice?  Is there any drafting difficulty in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it should be in either one or the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, that is arguable. Section 11 subsection (5) of the Civil Liability Bill enables the court in this sort of case, where the same or substantially the same libel or slander or injurious falsehood is published by different persons, to take into consideration the extent to which it is probable that the statement in question was published to the same persons and to that extent may find the wrong-doers to be concurrent wrongdoers. The other provisions of the Civil Liability Bill in relation to such wrong-doers then come into play.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <P>As I understand the position, and I speak very much subject to correction, the question of consolidation of actions arose as a result of the rules which were passed in the Act of 1905.  Certain limited powers to consolidate were given, but in respect of that power to consolidate there were special powers given in respect of libel and slander.  I have not got the High Court Rules with me but it seems to me that the power here which is being given in Section 28 covers other matters than the matters that are covered by the High Court Rules.  I think it is very desirable to have those other matters covered by legislation, and I think we should keep it in the Bill and not depend, as we are depending now, on the very limited powers in the High Court Rules.</P>

      <P>In any event in 1952 the English legislating body decided to put in Section 13 which really was Section 5 of the 1888 Act. The Section reads:</P>
      <P>Section five of the Law of Libel Amendment Act, 1888 which provides for the consolidation, on the application of the defendants, of two or more actions for libel by the same plaintiff shall apply to actions for slander and to actions for slander of title, slander of goods or other malicious falsehood as it applies to actions for libel.</P>
      <P>I take it that means that under the 1888 Act there was statutory power to get a consolidated action in connection with libel uttered by different persons, but there was not power to get a consolidated action in respect of slander.  I am not very sure of their Rules of Court but they are probably not very different from ours.  They have made substantial progress and we are making substantial progress in Section 28.

      <P>In relation to this section, I am rather inclined to feel that when a newspaper that is printed outside the State is circulated in the State&mdash;I avoid the word &ldquo;published&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;the State ought to have nominated a person to be responsible at least for the service of notice of proceedings in the way a person is nominated by a company whose headquarters are outside the State.  I think it is unnecessary and wasteful to have a continuous list of applications for leave to serve outside the jurisdiction in the matter of a paper printed outside but circulated here.</P>
      <P>When the whole question of newspapers is being considered, would it not be better that the circulation of a newspaper, which is a monthly or less, in general circulation here, should be treated something akin to the provision in the Companies Act?  At the moment I cannot remember the section of that Act which deals with that matter but there is a system there under which any foreign country which carries on business here must name a person within the State on whom proceedings can be served.  This section refers to a place of business and my suggestion is that there should be not only a place of business but the act of carrying on business.</P>

      <P>When we adjourned the debate on this section I was speaking about the age of retirement of district justices.  I take it that in repealing the relevant section of the Act of 1949 it was decided to hold the conditions that then operated &mdash;that the retirement age would be 65 save in the case of district justices <Col N="2006" /> in the Dublin Metropolitan area and in Cork.  Apart from those cases, the retiring age for justices was 65, subject to the proviso that there was a committee set up consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General.  As each district justice, outside the two areas specified came to the age of 65, he had to appear before that committee and if that committee thought a justice was sufficiently vigorous and in good mental health to carry on office they reported accordingly.</P>
      <P>District justices were required afterwards to go before the committee each year, up to the age of 70 and they were allowed to carry on on a yearly basis on provision of a medical certificate.  The end of it was that subject to good health and that they were not suffering from infirmities of mind, district justices really had a tenure of office until 70.  I objected to that because I thought district justices should be allowed to stay in office up to the age of 70.  In fact, they have got it.</P>
      <P>When we discussed this last the rather ancient old argument was brought out that district justices have to do a tremendous amount of travelling.  That is in comparison with circuit court judges and definitely in comparison with High Court and Supreme Court judges.  It was brought forward here as an argument that the amount of travelling district justices would do would wear them out more quickly.  That is an argument so hoary that it should be made to hide its head.  The answer to that is that in my experience I doubt if there is a single case of a district justice who failed to get brought forward from 65 to 70 with all the hard work and tramping around it is said they have to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that a lot of this dates away back to 1924 and later amendments of the legislation.  In those days, when people were being tried out and there were experimental conditions, certain things were included in the legislation which certainly might be left out on a more mature point of view.  This is a point at which a more mature point of view should emerge. I should like to get some statistics on <Col N="2007" /> the matter.  Has there been a single district justice who has been made to come up for his examination by these three laymen and who failed to get through that examination?  I doubt if there has been a single case.</P>
    <P>If one takes the turnover in district justices over the years and goes back to 1924 and the period when this provision applied, it seems to me the facts completely beat the argument about travelling.  In addition, there are quite a number of other people who have to travel.  Deputies do a good deal of travelling.  People in different walks of life do a good deal of travelling.  I do not know of any business or other avocation, where in the ordinary run of things a man is retired at 65 or 70, where that period of active life is cut down because the person has to do a fair amount of travelling.  That is a completely artificial argument.</P>
    <P>I should like to urge on this section that the age of retirement of district justices should no longer be subject to this peculiar business about being examined at the age of 65 years by this lay committee, but they should be all allowed to go on to 70.  Remember we have in the legislation considerable power to investigate the mental and physical health of a district justice and to have him caused to retire if his physique is not up to the strain.  But for the odd possibility of some district justice here and there failing in his powers, mental or physical, because of his age, it is absurd to keep this regulation applying to the whole lot of them&mdash;that as each reaches the age of 65 he must come up on this pilgrimage on the anniversary of his birth date to find out what three lay people think of him.  I am reinforcing my argument by the fact that in my own experience I have never known one justice to fail to pass that test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, as Deputy McGilligan says, that there has never been any case of a justice who has failed to pass.  But apart from the question of travelling, there is this other factor.  The district court is a court expected to get through a considerable volume of work.  It is <Col N="2008" /> completely different from the High Court and even from the circuit court, where judicial considerations and deliberations are far more important. In the district court the number of cases coming forward for trial is very considerable and the ability to despatch them quickly is important.  A mental alertness and a certain degree of activity is important in the despatch of business, apart altogether from the question of travelling.</P>
      <P>Although Deputy McGilligan is right in saying that no district justice has failed in this test, nevertheless it is important to keep this provision because it might be required at some time.  The fact that it has not yet ever been necessary to avail of it and retire a district justice who fails to satisfy the committee does not argue we need not have it.  It is important to keep it there.</P>

      <P>I should like to say one thing on this section.  It falls in with my general view of this kind of legislation.  I understand the way Deputy McGilligan has put it and I agree with him.  My objection to this form of procedure, whereby a district justice may be carried on more or less as a sort of yearly tenant of his office for five years after reaching the age of 65, is that it is wrong in principle. It is wrong that a person appointed to a judicial office should be dependent on the pleasure of the Executive for the continuance of his appointment. There is no good in the Parliamentary Secretary waving his finger at me.  In effect, that is what happens.</P>

If in fact no justice has been found unfit to go on to the age of 70, I think it is much wiser and better to lay down the age as being 70 rather than to have them carried on under a provision of this kind.  The idea of keeping district justices on as yearly tenants after 65 is objectionable in principle and I have never heard any argument to justify it.</P>

We were not going to upset it just because we disagreed with it, and we have continued it.  We are certainly not going to make it mandatory now to have district justices go to 70.

      <P>Whilst there has been this provision for a number of years whereunder a distinction is made as between district justices and circuit <Col N="2011" /> court judges, the experience over the years has been that district justices have in fact got the yearly extension and have been kept on to 70.  I do not think it can be said that a district justice's life is any harder than that of a circuit court judge.  I know there may be individual justices who may think they have a harder life than individual circuit court judges.  If they were told they could be kept on until 70 on a permanent basis they might not, perhaps, hold that view quite so strongly.  It is not a very desirable system to put a district justice who has reached the age of 65 in the rather invidious position of having to petition each year to have himself kept on a bit longer.  The experience has been that none of the district justices certainly wish to retire at that age.  We have decided that the retiring age for circuit court judges should be 70.  In the light of experience over the years I think we would be fully justified in deciding that district justices should be kept on until they reach 70 years of age.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal of argument about all the work a district justice has to do.  It is not merely a question of travelling.  He has to be alert and active.  Justice in this country means the District Court. To many people in Dublin and Cork it also means the Circuit Court.  It does not mean the High Court and the Supreme Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Insurance companies and big business can afford to go to the High Court and the Supreme Court.  So can the pauperised person because he has nothing to lose.  Anybody else would be sunk financially if he were unsuccessful in the High Court or the Supreme Court.  Justice means the district court.  In Dublin and Cork it has a relationship possibly, too, to the Circuit Court.  To the ordinary person justice means the district court.  Over the years not one single justice has failed to fulfil the requirements of alertness and capacity <Col N="2012" /> to do his work.  The 1955 Act made provision whereby a justice approaching 65 could, if he satisfied the committee&mdash;the committee is constituted of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General&mdash;that he was not suffering from any disability which would render him unfit to discharge the duties of his office efficiently, he could be kept on a yearly basis until 70.  The real test is the efficient discharge of his duties.  The point at issue is his age.  Everything else is rolled into that&mdash;travelling up and down the country, attending to the multitudinous variety of his work and satisfactorily discharging the duties of his office.  He has to appear year by year before this committee.  The committee may, if they so think proper, after consultation with the Minister for Justice continue him for another year.  That surely brings in the Executive.  I always thought that meant that, if the Minister did not agree, the district justice would walk the plank.  That Act was passed in 1949.  It was an improvement on what had been there before.  In the 1946 Act the rule was 65, and no more.  This 65 plus year by year under the supervision of this committee until the justice reaches 70 was an advance then, but I do not regard it any longer as an advance. It was an advance then on a district justice having to leave at 65.  I think we should make a further advance now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience has shown that district justices can stand up to the work until they reach 70.  I think we should accept 70 and make 70 the retiring age now.  It is rather humiliating to have these people coming along.  I had experience of interviewing a few of them. One felt the committee was rather apologetic and said more or less this was a statutory duty that had to be performed.  As far as I was concerned it was perfunctorily performed.  What one really was attentive to was any criticism as to how a district justice was carrying out his duties.  That was the beginning and end of it.  There are various ways under various statutes of bringing a justice to book if his mental or physical condition is such <Col N="2013" /> that he is not able to carry out the duties of his office.  He can be dismissed on the ground that he is infirm, and he can have a pension attaching to him.  The State is protected against district justices who become infirm remaining on in office when they are past their best.  This provision adds nothing to the situation.  It is a humiliation to the district justice.  It operates in respect of no other court. It is a bad thing to have it operating in respect of the court that means justice to the majority of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again there is a discrimination&mdash;it is carried forward here&mdash;with regard to pensions.  There are certain limitations.  A judge must serve a certain number of years before he can be allowed to retire.  There are certain pension rates.  I think it is still the position that the pensions of judges are calculated, according to choice, at so many fortieths or sixtieths.  There is a lesser fraction as far as district justices are concerned, not merely in salary but also in pension.  Supposing a person got the same fraction on a lower salary, that would still be a disadvantage. I think a district justice gets a lesser calculation as compared with judges.  I think that is wrong.</P>

That whole matter was dealt with by the Courts of Justice Act, 1953 and certain decisions were made.  This measure is a Supplemental Provisions Bill designed to cover any matters which will necessarily arise out of the establishment and constitution of the courts and only these matters are dealt with in this Bill in that context.  If there is some case, and I do not agree there is, for altering the conditions referred to, it is not for this Bill to do it.</P>

      <P>I may have another look at this on another stage.  Subsection (2) of Section 31 reads:</P>
      <P>Where a justice of the district court is removed from office on account of incapacity, he shall be deemed for the purpose of pension to have vacated his office owing to permanent infirmity.</P>
      <P>As I said, we could get rid of a justice either for stated misbehaviour or incapacity.  This means, where a person is removed because of incapacity, that to get pension rights for him we deem him to have vacated office owing to permanent infirmity. I do not see why we should consider a justice who could resign if he came to a point where he was incapable of carrying out his duties and who will not resign.  We are told this is to meet a case of a person who would be so infirm that he could not resign.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of that we are making this provision to cover <Col N="2015" /> justices whether they are capable of resigning or not.  If this provision is to meet special circumstances it should be limited to those circumstances and not be put in the wide terms in which it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the same as the case dealt with in connection with the other judges.  We want to provide that in the case of a district justice who by the nature of his incapacity cannot resign, his position will be protected.  I find it strange that on one section Deputy McGilligan is arguing for more rights and privileges for district justices and when we give them what is a reasonably generous provision by protecting their interests statutorily in the event of certain things happening, Deputy McGilligan opposes it.  He should at least have some consistency in his approach.</P>

Let us not forget you can have the sort of district justice about whom Deputy McGilligan has been talking who is competent and reliable in every way, but there is no knowing that he may not tomorrow or next year become the sort of district justice we have in mind here.  We want to protect him if this tragedy should befall him and we want him to know that he will be protected in that event.  As to altering the provision or narrowing it down in some way, I am not prepared to do that because the more you look at it the more difficult and complex it becomes.  The simple thing to do is to make a broad provision so that every district justice knows where he stands.  He will know that if such a tragedy befalls him the Oireachtas has protected his rights in an Act of Parliament.</P>

    <P>I do not see why Deputy McGilligan should feel that a district justice who does not resign is doing so out of malice.  It is more likely he is doing it <Col N="2017" /> out of a sense of duty.  Very often a person who is becoming incapable is the last person to become aware of it himself.  I do not feel it is fair of Mr. McGilligan to suggest that there is some protection being given to some person who out of malice is refusing to hand in his resignation.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan's fears are unrealistic in this matter. May I appeal to Deputy Dillon who took a reasonable view of the matter when we discussed it before?  We are all agreed that a man who suffers from incapacity that is of such a nature that he is incapable of resigning should be dealt with.  Deputy McGilligan is concerned only with the man who is fit and capable of taking a decision. He suggests that such a man, having <Col N="2020" /> the option of going quietly, would put himself into the embarrassing position of being removed by an Act of this Oireachtas with the whole panoply of having him removed from office for misbehaviour.  He suggests that that man would deliberately subject himself to that embarrassment.  No sane man will do that.</P>

      <P>My recollection is that the Parliamentary Secretary told us that this provision was necessary for the case of a district justice who was not capable of making an act of resignation. It was designed only to meet the case of a man who was physically unable to resign.  As I understand it, that is the case put by Deputy McGilligan.  Deputy Booth is disposed to talk now of getting the record.  If he gets the record I think he will find that Deputy McGilligan's recollection of the case is accurate.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary must remember informing the House that he had that in mind.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking before I made it clear that there could be a variety of that sort of case.  There could be a whole range of incapacity, different types of incapacity.  Insanity is one.  There could be many others which would have that effect.  That is the explanation of it.</P>

      <P>I agree that it is wider.  In order to do what we want to do, we make it wider than would seem to be absolutely necessary.  It is impossible to do it by having a narrower provision.  We get into trouble if we have a narrower provision.  We get into complications.  I have fully considered it and have tried to envisage various sorts of provisions and all of them led me into difficulties.  I am quite satisfied with it because, even though it is wide, and wide enough to cover what we want, there are the other cases which it does bring in inadvertently, as it were, but that will <Col N="2021" /> not create any trouble.

The same trouble has arisen in America with regard to the difference between the President and the Vice-President and they are agitated&mdash; unfortunately they had some examples of Presidents being in bad health&mdash;that a case might arise of a President being in such a state of health that he could not possibly send in his resignation. But it was completely and entirely related to that point.  Now we are getting into a wider area where it is now being put forward as just a matter that any justice of the district court whom we have to remove for incapacity is deemed to be worthy of his pension.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>When these amendments are taken together they do for actions founded on credit sales what the Hire Purchase Act did for actions founded on hire purchase agreements, that is, they give the circuit court and the district court increased jurisdiction and provide that proceedings must be taken in the district in which the defendant ordinarily resides, and allow the High Court, on its own motion, to transfer an action pending in the High Court to the circuit court or district court when it considers it could be dealt with in either of these courts. The increased jurisdiction given in the circuit court by amendment No. 88 is £1,000 and that given in the district court by this amendment is £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for providing that all credit sale proceedings must be taken in the local courts is that it is more convenient for defendants to have actions heard locally and, moreover, the dispersal of these actions throughout the various courts in the country <Col N="2023" /> will prevent the present concentration of these actions in the Dublin courts. Amendment 81 enables the High Court to transfer an action pending in the High Court which is founded on a credit sale agreement without an application being made by the defendant, that is, of its own motion.  There is some doubt as to whether the High Court can do this at the moment.  A similar provision was enacted for hire purchase agreements actions by Section 26 of the Hire Purchase (Amendment) Act, 1960 and the form of amendment 81 is to apply Section 26 of that Act to actions founded on credit sale agreements.  It is just doing for credit sale agreements what the Hire Purchase Act has done for hire purchase agreements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already had some discussion on this matter in connection with an earlier amendment. The purpose of amendment No. 59 is to allow either of the parties in the district court in a case in respect of which the maximum penalty provided is more than five years to apply to have the case transferred to the Central Criminal Court.  The House will recall that earlier we were discussing transferring cases from the circuit criminal court to the Central Criminal Court. At that stage I mentioned that we were going to provide that, at the district court level and when the case was being returned for trial, either of the parties would have an absolute right to demand that the case would be transferred to the Central Criminal Court provided the maximum penalty involved was more than five years.  This is where we are giving effect to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recall all the discussions we had earlier.  The proposed new section applies only to the case where the maximum penalty of penal servitude is in excess of five years.  In those circumstances now, the accused or the Attorney General shall be entitled to have the case sent forward for trial to the Central Criminal Court.  I think that is not a sound test.  The test here is the length of sentence.  That seems to ignore the fact that the very charge itself, irrespective of the sentence involved, may be a matter of the utmost gravity to the individual.  At the moment any person sent forward for trial on an indictable offence to the circuit criminal court has the right to transfer to the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a valued right, and to remove it and substitute in its place a provision whereby the particular length of penal servitude is the only test ignores the fact that to many people the mere bringing of a charge is such a serious matter that the question of the sentence likely to be imposed does not concern them unduly at the time the charge is preferred.  I can only repeat what I said before.  I can understand <Col N="2026" /> that procedure may have been irksome and have operated in an irritating way in the past, but it would be preferable to leave the provision as it is at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say in the original provision in the Bill the right would not survive in the Attorney General but was restricted to the defendant.  We argued strongly that a criminal matter, even though it was well known that certain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was at the circuit court level.  It is at the district court level now.  The case is being returned for trial.  They have the right to apply for transfer to the Central Criminal Court at the discretion of the judge.  We made them both equal.  The Deputy may recall the argument between himself and Deputy de Valera on that point.  When a case is in the circuit court, either party, the Attorney General or the accused, may apply for a transfer to the Central Criminal Court at the discretion of the judge. We cut the Attorney General down, so to speak, to the same level as the accused.  This is different.  We are at district court level where the case is about to be returned for trial.  At that point, either party is absolutely equal and can apply for the case to be transferred to the circuit criminal court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is a reasonable suggestion.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree&mdash;it does not apply so much in the city; where a person is brought to the circuit court or the Central Criminal Court, the venue is virtually identical&mdash;that if a charge is brought against a person in rural Ireland, he is returned to the local court and there is the ordeal of the allegation being made against him and all the paraphernalia of criminal proceedings in the presence of his immediate neighbours.  He may be profoundly convinced that in a fair trial he can successfully rebut the charge brought against him.</P>
      <P>We can imagine the case in which a person will say: &ldquo;I want to be tried here in the presence of my neighbours. I want them to hear the evidence, hear my defence and witness my vindication.&rdquo; On the other hand, the charge may be of a character the nature of which is so distressing and disgraceful that no matter how conscious he is of his innocence and the inevitability of his vindication, he recoils from the thought of having that disgraceful charge laid against him investigated in the presence of his neighbours.  It is a human thing to provide that in that case the defendant has the absolute right to choose his venue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the case here before, and the Parliamentary Secretary heard it with sympathy, that when a just or an unjust man falls, he is already under such appalling stress, as a result of having to be brought face to face with criminal jurisdiction, that anything we can do to mitigate his ordeal, short of frustrating the operation of the law, is a good thing.  This, I think, is an existing right which we should not take away.  The only argument in favour of taking it away is to tidy things up and avoid improper delay in the <Col N="2028" /> administration of the law.  We have got to face that and recognise what I believe is well known to practitioners &mdash;that you may get an experienced old criminal who, for some reason, in the hope of protracting his remand, will unreasonably seek a change of venue. Everybody well knows that he has nothing else in mind but to delay the due course of the law.  But that is a hardship we must undertake in order to provide that an inordinate burden of woe is not added to what a man has already to bear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a discussion on an earlier section on the right of the accused to choose his venue, having been returned for trial to the circuit criminal court.  It is proposed to take away that right now and substitute for it a qualified right on the date of the trial or at the venue of the trial, and an unqualified right at the time of his return for trial.  I feel the test applied to a maximum penalty is unsound and that it should apply to any offence in respect of which a person is returned for trial at the time the person is returned for trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not invariably, but very frequently, a person may not be professionally represented at the taking of depositions and it may well be that an accused person might understand he had a right to select a venue because he is charged with an offence, but he <Col N="2029" /> might very well not be aware that the particular offence with which he was charged was an offence which came within the section as it stands at the moment.  If his right is to depend upon the maximum period of penal servitude to which he might be sentenced, it is an unsound test, and if we are to qualify the existing right certainly we should substitute something for it which is reasonably similar to what is there at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already undertaken to have another look into this whole matter.  Deputy Dillon, of course, has a very persuasive way of putting a case and the trouble one finds oneself in is that one might be inclined to allow oneself to become overwhelmed by his oratory.  We must realise it is important we do not lean over backwards in these matters.  We must not go too far in favour of the accused.  The general run is that most of these cases should be tried in the circuit court which can be relied upon to dispense justice.  It is only on a rare occasion that the circumstances would be such that a transfer should rightly be made to the Central Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>I should point out that in most of these cases somebody has been injured and the right of society must be asserted. We must be fair and just but we do not want to be just sentimental.  We must decide what is to be the yardstick. We have settled on this particular one of five years' penal servitude but there is nothing final or conclusive about it and I would be prepared to consider some alternative.  This idea of deciding it in relation to the length of the sentence that may be applied to an offence is not a new departure by any means.  It is in an earlier Act. These are my views in relation to the points that have been raised.  We are considering two aspects&mdash;the transfer of a case which is actually in the circuit court to the Central Criminal Court and the case which is in the district court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I do not agree with the Parliamentary Secretary on this matter of sentiment.  I think we must lean backwards in the case <Col N="2030" /> of accused persons because under our system of law the accused person is deemed to be innocent until the State has proved him guilty and the greatest mistake we could fall into is to accept the Continental practice, the <i>Code Napoleon</i>, where from the moment the man is accused the duty devolves on him to prove himself innocent.  That would be a complete abandonment of our judicial tradition.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say he favoured the <i>Code Napoleon</i>.  I repeat I do agree with him that we must not lean backwards.  We must lean as far backwards as equilibrium will allow us for the benefit of an accused person because, remember, an accused person under our system of law is deemed to be innocent until the State has proved him guilty, and if the State should fail to prove him guilty beyond all the reasonable doubt of twelve men and women, he is entitled to go free.</P>

But up to that time we should treat him with the consideration due to an innocent man and nothing would be more disastrous than to allow the impression to grow on our minds that the moment the police point a finger at a man he is guilty.</P>

There is always the danger of irresponsible applications for a transfer to the Central Criminal Court. I see Deputy O'Higgins's point.  We do not want to restrict it unduly, but I can see some restriction on the right so that we do not find that the criminal jurisdiction of the circuit court is not being availed of and that too many cases are being referred to the Central Criminal Court to the detriment of the discharge of business in that court.</P>

      <P>It would not be in order for us, and I do not think it really was in order for Deputy Booth, to deal with the question of the present position and the right of an accused person at the moment.  In the section we have already passed we have debated that and passed from it.  The House has decided that no longer, when a person has been returned for trial to the circuit criminal court, has that person the unqualified right, as he has at the moment, to go to the Central Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>We are discussing now what is proposed to take the place of the present right.  Of course, I say it is at least half a loaf and is better than no bread.  But certainly we should, as Deputy Dillon said, in dealing with this section, have regard to the fact that not only are we dealing with a person presumably innocent but we are also dealing with a person who at the moment has quite a valuable right in relation to the venue for his trial and we should not restrict it unduly.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary has agreed to reconsider, reflect and ponder upon not only this provision but the earlier and associated provisions we have already discussed.  I should like to ask him in framing these new provisions, is it assumed, on the basis of the decision already given, that the Attorney-General no longer has the right to return for trial?  Is the Bill framed on the basis that that right, in fact, does not exist?  I appreciate that the matter may be <i>sub judice</i>, but quite obviously if we were to provide, at the return for trial stage, for an unqualified right to select a venue and the Attorney-General himself had after the taking of depositions the right to return for trial, which up to recently he certainly purported to exercise, the sanction against his return for trial to the Circuit Criminal Court was the unqualified right of the accused person to say: &ldquo;I will not be tried here.  I will be tried in the Central Criminal Court.&rdquo;  Under this Bill we have taken away that unqualified right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2033" /> I appreciate it is a difficult matter for anyone in this House to express an opinion upon.  But if the Attorney-General in the future is held to have the right to return a person to a designated court and that person, having been returned on the direction of the Attorney-General, has not the unqualified right to select a venue, then there may undoubtedly be a considerable injustice done.  I would suggest, if the Parliamentary Secretary is considering these provisions between this and Report, he might also consider that facet and point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall indeed.  The Deputy will realise that, in the event of the Attorney-General returning an accused person for trial to the Central Criminal Court, it would be a very real factor for the accused person to be in a position to say to the Circuit Court Judge: &ldquo;If I had been returned for trial by the district justice I would have had the right, as of right, to go to the Central Criminal Court.&rdquo;  I do not think a circuit court judge could resist that argument if it were put up to him.</P>

Presumably he would say: &ldquo;If the district justice had decided to return me, I had the right to tell the district justice I would go to the Central Criminal Court, the reason being that I would only get a fair trial in the Central Criminal Court.&rdquo; That is the purpose of the whole idea of the venue.  Either the Attorney General or the accused person seeks justice.  In these circumstances&mdash; probably they will not arise; probably they are purely imaginary&mdash;an accused person is put in the invidious position of arguing to a judge, possibly, about to empanel a jury to try him, that in that court and before that jury he is not going to get a fair trial.  I certainly would feel, if that application were made to me, and being an ordinary, average human being, my reaction would be to say: &ldquo;This is amounting almost to an insult to the judge on the bench.&rdquo;  I have little hesitation in prophesying that the vast majority of these applications will be unsuccessful and, in fact, an applicant will be held by the circuit judge to be bound to have his trial in that court and, therefore, in making the application, he will undoubtedly offend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

Deputy O'Higgins is more experienced in the criminal <Col N="2035" /> courts than either the Parliamentary Secretary or myself, but I should be astonished if a defendant returned for trial to the circuit criminal court by the Attorney General, after the district justice had refused to transfer his trial, would not have the right to get up and say: &ldquo;If I had been returned by the district justice, I would have had an absolute right to go to the Central Criminal Court and, without further argument, I am simply asking the court to accord to me the same privilege as I would have had if the district justice had returned me&rdquo;.  I should be astonished if, in those circumstances, the circuit court judge would reply: &ldquo;That is not a good reason&rdquo;.  Deputy O'Higgins has a much larger experience of criminal court practice than either the Parliamentary Secretary or I.</P>

        <i>Cela va sans dire</i>.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a little sensitive. If he endeavours to strike sparks, then he ought not to be so sensitive.  However, let us pass that by.  This issue goes back to the previous section; the real root of the evil is leaving it to the discretion of the court.  That is the root of the trouble where a defendant gets up and says: &ldquo;I wish to be transferred to the Central Criminal Court&rdquo;, and the circuit court judge says: &ldquo;This is contempt of court because you are now asuming I will not give you a fair trial&rdquo;.  I still feel the Parliamentary Secretary is creating a most astonishing situation in bringing about that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot help feeling&mdash;I do not see why I should not say so; I have very little doubt in the matter&mdash;that the Supreme Court will sustain the President <Col N="2036" /> of the High Court against the outrageous proposition that the Attorney General should exercise judicial functions.  I am entitled to say that, so long as that is the judgment of the court, I do not think the contingency Deputy O'Higgins raises is likely to arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But, if it does arise, I think it certainly would be very wrong to create a situation in which a right which we are obviously anxious to vest in an accused person could be frustrated by an oversight, and it would be an oversight if we did not provide against the contingency to which Deputy O'Higgins refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge that that contingency should be better adverted to.  Since this amendment was put in our hands, we have had the judgment of the High Court in connection with the sending forward by the Attorney General of a person for trial where the district justice had refused informations. That has been held to be a breach of the Constitution; it is an administration of criminal justice by a person who is not a judge or a body that is not a court established under the Constitution.  A person is brought before a court and the machinery of the law is put in motion.  Under the Constitution, nobody except a judge can deal with him after that.</P>
      <P>The President of the High Court has ruled that an Attorney General, sitting in his office, not being a judge or a court, has no power to decide to overrule what a district justice has done and send a man forward for trial when informations have been refused.  Such an action is <i>ultra vires</i>.  They lost on that test in the Supreme Court.  Surely that is a matter for consideration.  Here we have a person brought before a district justice and he decides to send him forward for trial.  Being a case within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, that person will be sent forward for trial in the ordinary circuit court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Into that again comes an interfering Attorney General.  He says: &ldquo;I do not want you sent to the circuit court. I think you ought to go to the Central <Col N="2037" /> Criminal Court.&rdquo;  That is tantamount to saying to a district justice: &ldquo;I am not going to mind your refusing informations.  I am going to send this man forward for trial on my own.&rdquo; That is a very definite step to be taken by a person who is not a judge. In the ordinary course, a person is brought before the ordinary court and preliminary investigations take place. If the matter is inside the jurisdiction of the circuit court, clearly the person must be returned to the circuit court. It is an interference for the Attorney General to come in and say that that person will not go to the circuit court but will go, rather, to the Central Criminal Court.  There is a difference in the degree of gravity.</P>
    <P>I am sure these amendments were drafted before the President of the High Court gave judgment and I think this matter ought now to be reconsidered and some attention paid to that judgment and to the basis upon which the judgment was laid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get the position of the district justices clarified. I do not know where we are going.  We have already accepted an amendment, amendment No. 30, and that is now embodied in this piece <Col N="2038" /> of legislation.  It is a fact that where the Chief Justice is of opinion that the conduct of a justice of the district court has been such as to bring the administration of justice into disrepute, the Chief Justice may interview the justice privately and inform him of such opinion.  The Chief Justice can call a district justice in and tell him off, so to speak.</P>
      <P>We come then to this new official&mdash; the President of the District Court. Under Section 36, it is proposed that &ldquo;Where it appears to the President of the District Court that the conduct of a justice of the District Court is prejudicial to the prompt and efficient discharge of the business of that court, he shall inquire into the matter...&rdquo; That has been changed by a few amendments; the word &ldquo;investigate&rdquo; is used instead of &ldquo;inquire.&rdquo;  At any rate, the President of the District Court is given the right to investigate the conduct of a justice where he thinks it is prejudicial to the prompt and efficient discharge of the business of the Court.  He is to consult the justice concerned.</P>
      <P>In addition, the President of the District Court is empowered to convene meetings for the purpose of discussing matters relating to the discharge of the business of the District Court &ldquo;including, in particular, such matters as uniformity in the exercise by the justices of the jurisdiction of that court and the general level of fines and other penalties.&rdquo;  Every justice will be bound to attend such meetings unless he has a suitable excuse, such as illness, or something else.  The President of the High Court can investigate and call attention to whatever the district justice is doing.</P>
      <P>Section 21 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946 reads:</P>
      <P>Whenever the Minister requests the Chief Justice to appoint a judge to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  investigate the condition of health, either physical or mental, of a Justice, or</P>
      <P>(b)  to inquire into the conduct (whether in the execution of his office or otherwise) of a Justice, either generally or on a particular occasion ....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2039" /> It goes on to say that certain provisions shall have effect, that the Judge appointed to conduct an investigation may do so in such manner as he thinks proper and that upon the conclusion of the investigation he shall report the result to the Minister, the reason for that being that justices were given the same tenure as the judges in the Supreme Court and the High Court which meant they were consolidated in their position save for stated misbehaviour or incapacity.  It was always understood that the reason why the Chief Justice appointed a judge to inquire into such matters and to report to the Minister was to enable the Minister to have evidence so that he could come before the Dáil and the Seanad with a resolution about misbehaviour and incapacity.</P>
    <P>In addition to all that there is the Courts of Justice Act of 1936 under which there was a very good procedure set up by the establishment of various committees of the courts.  These committees were given certain powers; in fact they had certain duties imposed upon them to do certain things and to send in certain reports.  Under Section 71 there is established the District Courts Rules Committee.  The personnel of that committee was to consist of two ex-officio members and seven nominated members.  Subsection (3) reads:</P>
    <P>The ex-officio members of the said committee shall be&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that one of the justices of the District Court for the time being assigned to the district which comprises or includes the county borough of Dublin ....</P>
    <P>(b)  the District Courts clerk for the district ....</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that four of the nominated members of the said committee shall be justices of the district court nominated by the Minister for Justice, one other of the said nominated members is to be a practising barrister and two others are to be solicitors nominated by the Council of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.  That committee <Col N="2040" /> was established as the rule making authority for the district court. Section 75 provides:</P>
    <P>(1)  The secretary of each of the several committees established by this Part of this Act shall summon a meeting of such committee once at least in every year on such day as may be fixed by the chairman of such committee, for the purpose of the general consideration by such committee of the practice, procedure and administration of the court in relation to which such committee is constituted and the law affecting or administered by such court...</P>
    <P>(2)  as soon as conveniently may be after every meeting of any such committee in pursuance of this section, such committee shall report to the Minister whether any and if so what amendments or alterations should, in the opinion of such committee, be made in the practice, procedure, or administration of the court in relation to which such committee is constituted or in the law affecting or administered by such court with a view to the improvement of the administration of justice...</P>
    <P>Is it intended to continue to have four groups of people looking in on the district court?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would imagine these are all the things that could come in the ordinary course before the District Court Rules Committee.  There is provision made by the Act of 1936 for this and although these duties were laid by statute on the different committees these committees did not bother their <Col N="2041" /> heads about the Act.  I asked the Minister for Justice for the first time in 1958, I think it was, again in 1959 and again last year how many reports had been received from any of these committees and the answer was that there were practically none.  There has been no attempt by the committees to obey the statute.  They could easily have sent in a report that they did not think any amendments were required but they did not even bother to say that.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice, of course, is the member of the Superior Courts Committee&mdash;I think he is the chairman of it.  It is the duty of the chairman to call at least one meeting every year. I do not know whether they ever met but certainly the meetings they had did not fructify in any reports because the replies I received to questions I put down indicate there were no suggestions made to the Minister for Justice in regard to an improvement in the law.  That is a pity because the procedure that was laid down in the Act of 1936 was pretty good but it has been brought to naught.  Either these committees have not met or, if they have met, they have not reported. At least the questions I have put down have brought me that information.</P>
    <P>I had objected at the start to what amendment 30 became a substitute for. <Col N="2042" /> The President of the High Court was to interview a justice privately.  I was not here when amendment 30 was dealt with.  I do not know what argument was used but I would like to have asked this question: How is the Chief Justice to get his opinion formed about the conduct of a justice of the district court, that it is such as to bring the court into disrepute?  I presume that was brought before the House.  I am still unaware of the machinery.  Is it solicitors who will report about the conduct of district justices or is it clients?  At any rate in some way or other the Chief Justice is to be put in the position of forming an opinion that the conduct of a justice is such as to bring the court into disrepute.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
