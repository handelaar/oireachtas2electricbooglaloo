      <P>I am not in a position to say when the Food Advisory Committee may submit to me a report regarding the desirability or otherwise of limiting by regulation the amount of fluorine in foodstuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the reason for the delay is that the Food Advisory Committee have discovered that it is virtually impossible to control the fluorine content of foodstuffs where fluoridated water is used in their manufacture?  Is he further aware that it has recently been discovered in America&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you will bear with me, you will appreciate that I am not.  I am not that type.  I want to know is the Minister aware that it was recently discovered in America that where fluoridated water was used in the manufacture of breakfast cereals the fluorine content was increased from .05 in the raw state to over six parts per million in the finished state.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question arising out of that is, will the Minister warn the public that if any person begins the day by consuming breakfast cereals in <Col N="3" /> connection with which fluoridated water has been used the person will be in danger of death from toxic poisoning?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the amount of the margin that will be effective at each rate in <Col N="4" /> respect of the principal value of the estate as provided by the Second Schedule to the Finance Bill, 1961.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably what the Deputy has in mind is the extent to which marginal relief under Section 13 (1) of the Finance Act, 1914, will operate by reference to the scale of rates of Estate Duty set out in the Second Schedule to the Finance Bill, 1961.  As the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the roads in the area referred to are in the condition alleged by the Deputy.  I understand that repair works are in progress at present on the first road and that sections of the other two roads are listed for improvement this year out of the county road improvement grant.  It is a matter for the county council, when considering their annual road works schemes, to consider the claims of particular roads <Col N="15" /> for repair or improvement out of funds provided from rates or with the aid of the grants available from the Road Fund.  These grants have been substantially increased in each of the past two years.  For 1961-62 they include the main road improvement grant of £34,800 and a county road improvement grant of £59,700.</P>

I have not yet received the audited accounts of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the year ended 31st March, 1961, but the published accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1960, show that there was a loss of £6,325 on ice plants in that year after charging £2,377 for depreciation and £1,461 for interest paid to the Exchequer.  To encourage the use of ice a grant of £6,000 was paid from the Fisheries Vote towards that loss so that the ice produced by the Board could be sold at £4 a ton. I might mention that the Board are at present selling ice at £2 a ton to fishermen who take it to sea.  As the output of ice increases the cost of production per ton will, of course, be reduced.</P>

      <P>Before the Adjournment last week I answered Deputies who had protested against the use of the Irish language as a teaching medium in our schools and who stated that the education of the children was being interfered with.  Having dealt with that attitude of Deputies from the other side, with regard to the Irish language, I came to address myself to the problem posed by Deputy Mulcahy, also from the opposite benches, in relation to what he called the problem that parents in Dublin face when they want to have their children taught through the medium of Irish in the national schools.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy early on expressed anxiety about the future of Scoil Mhuire.  Let me say at the outset that any person who has caused him to have anxiety in this regard was not dealing with facts.  It is nonsense to suggest that the Department of Education would interfere with Scoil Mhuire. There are some national schools available to parents which are working within our system very successfully. In relation, however, to the general question of all-Irish schools I would like to explain the position.  If in any area there is a sufficiently large number of parents who wish to have their children receive primary education through Irish in a school conducted in accordance with our national school system I can assure them that in their effort to achieve this no obstacle will be placed in their way by any of the authorities connected with the running of national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies expressed satisfaction at the rate of progress now being made in regard to school building.  There was a certain amount of dissatisfaction <Col N="23" /> expressed at the toilet facilities in many of our schools.  As I have already stated on a number of occasions in this House, it is the policy of my Department, when a new school is being built or an existing school being reconstructed, to have, where at all possible, water flushed sanitation installed in the school.  In pursuance of that policy, 300 schools have been provided with such sanitation in the past three years.  I must go further now and say that irrespective of any scheme of general reconstruction I intend to press forward so that, in every case where the sanitary arrangements existing are unsatisfactory, the position will be remedied at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>With that in mind I propose to take all the necessary steps to bring home to the interested parties how essential it is to put the necessary arrangements in train.  I might point out in this connection that when announcing a grant for the painting of schools I did say that the giving of the grant to the manager of the school will depend not alone on his painting of the school but on the general maintenance, and that grants will not be given where painting alone is done and other works in the school are neglected.  I hope this will encourage those managers who have done their duty and spur on negligent managers to do what is their duty. Some Deputy asked me how often these grants for painting will be available. It is the intention that for external painting they will be available every four years and for internal painting every eight years.</P>
    <P>In regard to the curriculum of the primary schools, everybody interested in education can think of many subjects to add to the curriculum.  One of our problems in introducing subjects is that the curriculum is already fairly crowded.  However, one of the subjects which many Deputies seemed interested in having taught is civics.  While the curriculum is overcrowded I think it would be possible to allow a certain time, perhaps an hour a month to the teaching of civics in schools.  How best to teach it is another problem.  Text <Col N="24" /> books are not available.  Part of the instruction already on the curriculum lends itself to the teaching of civics, as the teaching of history and religious instruction, and indeed the departmental regulations point out to the teachers the desirability of instructing the children on these matters.</P>
    <P>I have recently seen a voluntary movement, the Trees for Ireland movement, whose aim it is to go to the schools and encourage the children to plant a tree in the hope they will develop a more constructive attitude towards trees, both ornamental and those of our forests which need to be protected from the carelessness of picnic makers and others who may cause fires.  I discussed this type of training with people from other countries with their own educational system and their experience seemed to be that more benefit is derived from group interest and group activity among children rather than from any formal teaching within the school.  In many places the children are encouraged to form a group, to follow up a particular interest, to go to various public people and learn from them direct what the duties of the public man are and how he conducts his affairs.  I am told that is a much more satisfactory way of teaching children than having a formal course.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties I found in regard to civics, having a special interest in a subject, was the fact that there was no book available, but I have been promised by some people interested in the same line that they will prepare such a book and present it to the Department of Education for scrutiny.  They are already working on that book.  Many of the things children should know in regard to our Constitution, how to respect the flag and so on, should be taught in the schools, but a great deal must be left to the teacher.  As I say, there are many opportunities for the good teacher to teach civics in the course of the teaching of other subjects.  If necessary, we shall try to provide a special place in the curriculum, even though it is overcrowded.</P>
    <P>When some Deputies mentioned the <Col N="25" /> teaching of history they became quite agitated about the method used in our schools.  I read one of the books used in the schools quite recently again and I found nothing in it but history. I think that what is agitating the Deputies may be particular beliefs or bias of the teacher.  We depend on the teacher to give a slant on history which will stimulate our young people to efforts along the proper lines for their country in the future.  I found nothing in any of the books to support what the Deputies said.</P>
    <P>I believe a great deal can be achieved by teaching local history in our various schools.  I have tried from time to time to interest teachers in learning something of the local history in which almost every area in the country is very rich.  I found a fairly good response from teachers.  Apart from linking up the wider history of the nation, it develops a love of the land in the young person which grows into a very desirable patriotism.</P>
    <P>The Deputies who praised the C.I.E. educational tours were on the right lines.  They have done a great deal to teach our children something of our country and its history.  I am disappointed that the traffic seems to be all in the one direction.  The country schools are coming on tours to the city of Dublin, which is a very good thing. The children are learning a great deal about the Dáil, the Museum and the factories.  I should like to see the teachers in the city turn the eyes of their pupils to the countryside.  Not alone would that help them to understand better their brethren from the country but our two main industries, agriculture and tourism, derive from the country.  Therefore, pupils can be taught both history and modern general knowledge on tours from the city to the country.  I would very much commend the teachers in the city to take the children back to the land on educational tours where many of them can see where their immediate ancestors came from.</P>
    <P>A question which interests many Deputies and which interests myself is physical education in our schools. Physical education is an optional subject on the curriculum of national <Col N="26" /> schools.  Many of the schools make provision for it.  It has a wider connotation now than even in my own time at school when physical education was a series of physical jerks which might not always be very good, as Deputy Sherwin said, for the child who was not quite able for the effort.</P>
    <P>However, in recent times, physical education has become a wider subject comprising, apart from better posture and better movement, a learning of the fundamentals of movement, which can be applied to all games, a learning of hygiene and, a very important matter to my mind, safety education.  Considering the number of deaths from accidents in the schools age groups, I think safety education must take a very prominent part in our physical education. I believe it is accepted as part of the education in every country.</P>
    <P>Physical education, as it should be taught, will require a very special training in teaching.  Not all our teachers have that special training. Last year, a highly-qualified professor of physical training and games master was appointed to the training college for men at Drumcondra, St. Patrick's Training College.  Therefore, national teachers leaving the training college in future will be equipped to give instruction in physical training, to organise games, to help the child according to his physical abilities, to say something about hygiene and to teach the children about safety.  That is just starting.  To get quicker results, a series of summer courses for teachers who graduated before this professor was appointed has been arranged.  The first of these courses is being held this year for national teachers.  From all appearances, it will be a success. I hope it will continue through the years until we have a satisfactory teaching of physical education as distinct from &ldquo;P.T.&rdquo; which is, if it is any part of it at all, a very small part.</P>
    <P>The question of the Coiste Taighde was raised.  The Coiste Taighde, a research committee in the Department of Education, has had a minute examination of &ldquo;Notes for Teachers&rdquo; carried out.  This is something more complex than the name would give <Col N="27" /> one to understand.  It is a <i>vade mecum</i> which teachers find very useful. For the first time since 1934, these notes are having complete revision.</P>
    <P>The research committee has also been examining the readers in Irish, a problem many teachers brought to my notice two years ago.  The readers have been subject to criticism by the teachers on the ground that there is a general absence of planning for each series of readers, that they are not effectively graded by lesson or by standard and that in many cases they are too difficult for the standard for which they are intended.  The committee has formulated revised instructions to publishers in regard to the grading and the standard of readers and is at present investigating, in consultation with the national teachers and inspectors, the vocabulary appropriate to a reader, say, for Standard 1.  When all this work is done and the examination is complete&mdash;when the suggestions as to vocabulary, subject matter, and so on, have been received &mdash;instructions will be sent to the publishers to be used in conjunction with the revised instructions in the preparation of the new readers.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to handicapped children.  It may be worth while pointing out that there is more than one type of handicap.  There is quite a range, varying from the child suffering from a prolonged illness, such as primary tuberculosis, but who is otherwise not limited in any way in his capacity to learn, to children who are limited in their capacity to learn either by reason of defects of the ears or eyes or by reason of limited intelligence. The total number of schools for these is about 30.  I have heard very great praise for these special schools from visitors to this country.  It has been brought home to me that we are getting from the dedicated people running these schools very great value indeed for the money we are spending.</P>
    <P>In an institution where children are kept for a long time because of illness, birth injury or congenital deformity, if <Col N="28" /> there are a sufficient number of children in the school to receive primary education, then the head of the institution can become a school manager and seek recognition from the Department of Education to have a national school in the institution.  That is how the Department of Education come to deal with defective children.  We are not responsible for providing accommodation or nursing for them&mdash;that is a matter for the Department of Health &mdash;but when there are a sufficient number of children in these institutions to benefit from primary education, then the Department of Education will recognise a school there and pay the teachers.</P>
    <P>Apart from handicapped children in these institutions, there is the problem of children who are slow.  Many of these children suffer from lack of attention when doing their lessons.  The two main problems are: large classes, making it difficult for the teacher to give such children special attention, and the absence of trained personnel. As I said when introducing the Estimate, the ratio between teachers and pupils has been improved four times in the past four years.  So far as we are able to get trained teachers, we are improving that ratio.  The question of teachers trained to give special instruction has been taken up this year.  As announced, a special course for trained teachers to enable them get the instruction necessary to deal with retarded children will be run at St. Patrick's Training College.  That course will be carried on each year in future, so that we will have a supply of teachers capable of taking care of these classes. It is hoped that by giving special training to inspectors and teachers, we will be able to pick out of classes the children who can benefit from special treatment.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked me where were all the institutions I mentioned.  I shall not name all the 30 institutions which deal with the blind, deaf and dumb and so on, but I shall mention those for mentally retarded children.  They are, for boys: St. Augustine's, Blackrock; Our Lady of Good Counsel, Cork; St. Bernadette's, Cork; and for girls: <Col N="29" /> St. Teresa's, Temple Hill, Blackrock; St. Michael's (Holy Angels), Glenmaroon; St. Mary's, Delvin; Queen of Angels, Cork; and mixed: Sunbeam House, Bray.  Recently a new school for girls has been opened at Limerick. There is a centre also at St. Michael's House day centre, Dublin.  The position about the special schools for retarded children is that we have more accommodation than is being used, but not nearly as much as we would need if all the children who could benefit sought accommodation.  That is school accommodation and not hospital accommodation, which is another problem.  I believe the hospital accommodation is filled.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that whenever we speak about the teaching of history, civics, the educational care of retarded and handicapped children, and so on, we always come back to the problem of the teacher.  The person mainly concerned in carrying out what we would all like to see done is the teacher.  For that reason, and many others, I resented it very much when, not in this House but outside it, some people created the impression that this Government had established a new situation in relation to teachers' salaries.  Because of that and because of references by Deputies during the debate, I think I should say something about the Committee on Teachers' Salaries.</P>
    <P>The reports of this Committee were published recently.  A certain amount of dissatisfaction was expressed with the outcome of the Committee's deliberations.  The Committee was set up in December, 1958.  As Deputies are aware, there are three classes of teachers: national, secondary and vocational. They have separate schemes of conciliation and arbitration dealing with salary claims.  The three schemes function completely independently of each other.  In 1955, the national teachers through their scheme formulated a claim that trained national teachers should have parity of scale salaries with secondary and vocational teachers.  This claim was discussed by the National Teachers Conciliation Council; and since it was not possible to reach agreement, it was referred to <Col N="30" /> the National Teachers Arbitration Board.  The board heard their case and argued for three days in public and, later, for a further three days in private.  The claim was rejected by the Arbitration Board.  An award was made by the board, however, which had the object of restoring as far as possible the differential which existed between national teachers and secondary teachers in 1946.</P>
    <P>The national teachers' salary claim was submitted again through their conciliation and arbitration scheme in August, 1957, in the light of what their organisation considered a change in circumstances.  In view of the financial position at that time, the Government requested the co-operation of all bodies having conciliation and arbitration schemes to exercise restraint and not to press claims other than those for the rectification of small anomalies.  The Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance had discussions with representatives of the national teachers in September and December, 1957.  At the instance of the representatives of the teachers, the Ministers undertook to consider the question of causing the principles governing the salaries of the various groups of teachers paid out of public funds to be examined, and a conference was set up for that purpose.  In consideration for that undertaking, the representatives of the national teachers undertook not to proceed, for the present, with a renewed parity claim.</P>
    <P>It was in those circumstances that the Salary Committee was set up by my predecessor in office.  The Committee commenced its deliberations in January, 1959.  Its proposed terms of reference had been communicated to the three groups of teachers in March, 1958.  They had been invited to nominate two representatives, each, to sit on the Committee. At no time were any reservations expressed by the national teachers organisation in relation to the proposed terms of reference, or to the personnel of the Committee, representative of school managers, business interests and the Ministers for Education and Finance, as well <Col N="31" /> as the two representatives from each of the teachers' organisations.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference were: to examine and report on principles which might guide the Minister for Education in determining the relationship between the remuneration payable to trained national teachers, recognised secondary teachers and permanent whole-time vocational teachers.  It might be emphasised that the Committee was not asked to determine scales of salary for any group of teachers. That point was being dealt with under an independent scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  That independent scheme still continues to function.</P>
    <P>It was expected, however, that the finding of the Committee would make a significant contribution towards a solution of the general problem of the relationship which might exist between the remuneration of the three groups. The reports of the Committee were presented to me on 29th July, 1960. The report of the majority&mdash;that is, all the members of the Committee with the exception of the two representatives of the national teachers&mdash;and the reservations in the minority report of the representatives of the national teachers, were carefully considered by the Departments concerned, and by the Government, between that date, 29th July, 1960, and the date on which the reports were released to the Press, 6th March, 1961.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from those two dates that, contrary to what unfortunately has been suggested, there was no indecent haste on the part of the Government to publish those reports.  I hope that disposes of that suggestion.  I should like to repeat that the Committee was asked to report on the principles and not on salary scales.  I fail to see how there could be any question of a responsible Government setting up a special committee and ignoring its findings, as some people seem to think the Government should have done.  I have no doubt the matter will be thrashed out again at conciliation and arbitration.  As a matter of fact, a claim is going through the machinery at the moment.  For that reason, I do not think I could, <Col N="32" /> with propriety, pursue the matter any further, except perhaps to say that I would commend to the goodwill of all parties the suggestion that they should co-operate in establishing a common scheme of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>The question of vocational guidance was raised.  I presume that means a formal system of vocational guidance. As most parents know, the heads of schools and the teachers have been working a system of vocational guidance for many years, and consultation between teachers and parents has been very useful in that regard.  There is, to some extent, formal examination in the case of teachers.  We have introduced interviews for the selection of candidates for the teaching profession, but on the question of a formal attempt to place students in a particular vocation, I would point out to Deputies that that is a most delicate matter which requires very special trained personnel.</P>
    <P>The City of Dublin Vocational Educational Committee, in fact, have had a man trained by University College. He has now completed his course and has established a scheme among his fellow teachers, comprising the fundamentals of the type of work concerned.  While it would be a case of fools rushing madly in to try to guide everyone in their vocation, I would say this scheme will extend as properly trained personnel becomes available. We must always remember that this is a very delicate area of activity for any outsider.</P>
    <P>In regard to post-primary education, it is about time that people stopped saying the majority of our children do not go further than the national school. Over a number of years, well over half of the children have been going on to post-primary education in the form of secondary school education, vocational school education or secondary tops in national schools.  That brings me to the question of scholarships.  Deputies were disappointed because I had not referred to the scholarship scheme.  I should like to tell the House now that a Bill is being drafted which will provide for the introduction of a very much enlarged scheme of post-primary scholarships and university scholarships.  I hope to introduce that Bill later in the <Col N="33" /> session.  Deputy Mulcahy suggested there should be a scheme of scholarships to secondary schools in the Gaeltacht.  I understand that such a scheme, administered by the Department of the Gaeltacht, is already in existence.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of scholarships, another point raised in regard to secondary schools was the issue of capitation grants.  I should like to say that, on the issue of capitation grants to secondary schools, only in relation to scholarships in such schools and not in relation to grants, could the Department of Education hold itself responsible for the cost of boarding in or near the school.  The cost of boarding generally is quite a separate matter.  If the Department were to hold itself responsible for the boarding of children in any school, secondary, vocational or primary, it could lead eventually only to selection by the State, or a means test of some kind, because of the cost.</P>
    <P>I have no evidence that the annual income of any secondary school is inadequate to meet the school's annual commitments.  The allegation is sometimes made that we do not give grants towards the building and maintenance of secondary schools.  The State provision in that regard was partly included in arriving at the rate of capitation grants.  Where the State makes direct provision for the building of national or vocational schools, it does not pay these capitation grants.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education does not specify headings under which capitation grants are paid.  If some of these moneys are for building it is not, perhaps, fair for those who receive the grants to pretend that they get nothing for building.  If they continue to do so it may well be necessary for the Department to earmark some of these capitation moneys in the future for building and the maintenance of buildings.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked how our schools are doing.  Since I have been dealing with secondary schools I should, I think, refer here to the response in recent years to what appear to be the needs of modern society.  Our schools are doing a bit more science and more modern languages.  As I have already <Col N="34" /> announced, we have set up a fund, which will be administered by the Department, to promote the teaching of science in our secondary schools. There is another arrangement in relation to incremental salary scales which is calculated to promote the teaching of modern languages.</P>
    <P>The National Library and the National Gallery were mentioned.  A fear was expressed by one speaker that the Shaw Bequest would be used, because of outside influence, in some way other than the Governors would desire.  I am telling the House now that it is the intention that the money from the Shaw Bequest will be available only for the purposes decided upon by the Governors of the Gallery and not by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The problem of space in the Library is part of a larger problem comprising accommodation for the National Museum, the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Library itself.  It is a problem of such dimensions that it cannot be solved simply.  The whole matter is under active consideration at the moment.  Preliminary plans for the extension of the National Gallery have been prepared.  I do not know whether it is necessary to remind Deputies that under the Copyright Act the National Library must be furnished <i>gratis</i> by publishers with one copy of every book published in Ireland.  I think one Deputy said the Library was not getting enough books.</P>
    <P>A question relating to the publication of a dictionary of national biography was raised by Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde.  That is a work of enormous dimensions.  During the past four years the following sources of information have been indexed: all the books and pamphlets written by or about Irishmen in the National Library collections and in the published catalogues of the British Museum have been traced.  The former source yielded 70,000 items, the latter an additional 20,000.  Biographical notices of, and articles written by, Irishmen have been indexed in 700 volumes of periodicals. About another 900 volumes need to be examined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> In the absence of parish registers, wills and other such sources for the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, the genealogical manuscripts in the Genealogical Office are one of the basic sources of Irish biographical details. The contents of 140 of these manuscripts have been indexed by family name.  About 300 more manuscripts remain to be done.  About 7,000 manuscripts have been indexed for biographical material.  All the material relating to Irishmen in the 84 published volumes of the Historical Manuscripts Commission has been indexed.  Parish registers of 14 Catholic dioceses have been microfilmed.  Deputies will understand the enormity of the task.  A great deal of work has been done, but I do not see any hope of completion in a shorter time than four or five years because it is such an enormous task.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones asked how we stand in our educational system.  First of all, the educational system of any country is a reflection of the background from which it comes.  It would be a foolish person who would say that any one system is better than another.  All we can go by is what people who have seen other systems tell us.  Recently I was talking to the Provincial of an Order which has houses all over the world and he is of the opinion that our system is second to none.  If we are to judge by the way in which our University graduates are snapped up by overseas businessmen, industrialists and organisations, I think we have a very good indication of the high standards achieved by our system.</P>
    <P>We have in our system many things that people in other parts of the world would give a great deal to have. Catholic, Protestant and Jew have their own State-aided schools.  At all levels we have a highly qualified corps of teachers.  In comparison with most other countries we are very well off from the point of view of the teachers we have.  Our system does not usurp the rights of parents by, for example, taking any particular age group and telling one boy he should follow one particular stream and another boy that he should follow some other stream <Col N="36" /> which will have the result of putting him into a lower social level.</P>
    <P>Secondary and vocational schools provide a good broad level of education. Our vocational schools are gearing themselves to go even further on the broad basis of continuation education. We have, I think, a great deal to be thankful for in our system.  If there are sometimes disadvantages we should weigh the advantages against them.  Parents have the main right in education here.  The manager represents the parents.  No parent has any right over the children of any other parent and the nearest we can go to a representative of all the parents is the manager who belongs to the religion to which the parents belong.  He is a clergyman of their particular religious denomination.  He represents all the parents.</P>
    <P>As I say, no parent or group of parents can claim rights over the children of other parents.  Under our system the manager has the right to appoint the teacher.  He can appoint whomsoever he wishes provided the teacher is qualified up to the level required by the Department of Education.  It is well to understand this in view of the present dispute or controversy going on in Ballina in which the teachers state that it is not the right of the manager to make the appointment which is being questioned but the manner in which the right was exercised. The teachers' appeal is not to me but to the bar of public opinion in this matter.  Therefore, apart from other fundamental considerations, there is no place at the present moment for any action on my part.  I think that much may help Deputies to understand what the position of the State is in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the last few years the country has seen increasing prosperity.  It may be interesting for the House to know that the teachers have their share in this prosperity to the extent which I shall list.  The following are increases in teachers' salaries sanctioned since 1958: national teachers&mdash;1st September, 1958, cost of living, £460,000; 1st January, 1960, cost of living, £415,000; 1st July, 1959, children's allowances, £85,000; 1st April, 1961, untrained teachers, <Col N="37" /> £30,000 and 1st April, 1961, principals' allowances etc., £200,000.  Accordingly, the national teachers have gained £1,190,000 since 1958 as their share.</P>
    <P>Secondary teachers had a cost of living increase of £115,000 from 1st September, 1958.  On 1st February, 1960 they had a cost of living increase of £95,000 and in July, 1959, children's allowances amounted to £20,000.  That is a total of £230,000 from the State.</P>
    <P>From 1st April, 1958, vocational teachers had a cost of living increase of £35,000; on 1st March, 1960, they had a cost of living increase of £85,000. On 1st June, 1959, they had a status claim of £70,000.  On 1st July, 1959 there was an increase in children's allowances of £16,000 and on 1st April, 1961, they had headmasters' allowances of £14,000, making a total of £220,000 since 1958 for the vocational teachers. The total to the profession is £1,650,000 in that period.  As I say, they have had their share of increased prosperity.  I do not grudge it to them.  I wish them good luck.</P>
    <P>When talking about how we stand, I thought it might interest Deputies to know some of the improvements which have taken place.  This is not putting us in comparison with other countries except in the case of our international vocational training competitions. Students from our vocational schools entered these competitions with students from other countries at Barcelona in 1960 and in Italy in 1959. Last year we had 18 competitors.  Two students got first place in carpentry, senior and junior.  Two students got second place in plumbing and brickwork. Two got third place in cabinet making.  Eight got fourth place; two got fifth place and two got sixth place. The year before we had 14 competitors. Four students got first place: cabinet making, joinery, silversmiths and brickwork.  Three got second place: fitting and electrical installation; two got third place: joinery and fitting; three got fourth place and two got fifth place, so that these students can hold their own among very much bigger numbers from the other countries.</P>
    <P>In our national schools we can point to improvements.  First of all, there is the improved staffing in two teacher schools.  There is improved <Col N="38" /> staffing also in three, four, five, and six-teacher schools.  There is improved staffing in industrial schools and in capitation schools.  The removal of the marriage ban and increased training facilities resulted in putting this country in the almost unique position of not having to recruit untrained teachers.  We ceased to recruit untrained teachers last year.  We have had improvements in the system of inspection and there is the abolition of the merit mark and other things of that kind which brought about a better relationship between the inspectorate and the teachers.</P>
    <P>We have improvements in the methods of selecting teachers by interview apart from competition at the academic level, which I think is a very good advance.  The abolition of the preparatory college system, I regard as an improvement.  Instead of that, as I already mentioned in my introductory speech, there is the plan to subsidise one month in each of three years for training teachers in the Gaeltacht before they do their oral examination.  That will apply to teachers coming out from this on.</P>
    <P>The building programme has been vastly accelerated and we have met the claim of the pre-1950 pensioned teachers.  The present position of the pre-1934 convent and monastery lay teachers has been rectified and there is also a very big advance in the provision for mentally and physically retarded children.  All accommodation has not yet been fully availed of and if claims were made we would not have sufficient to meet all we need.</P>
    <P>There is a huge increase in the facilities for secondary education.  In 1924-25 there were 25,000 secondary school pupils and now there are 76,000.  There is an all-round improvement in the qualifications of our secondary teachers.  In fact, we are very well off at the level of qualifications for secondary teachers which we are recruiting. This year we decided to add the money in the probationary period to tempt them to stay at home.  We set up a fund for giving special grants for the furnishing of science laboratories and we introduced in the Leaving Certificate the oral test in Irish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> Vocational education has extended to 26,000 pupils.  When the Vocational Education Act was passed in 1930, there were only 1,500 pupils.  We have a vast increase in the school building provision accordingly.  We have very useful developments in our vocational schools.  There are the winter farm schools which are a co-operative effort and there is the rural building scheme. There is also development on the technician and technological side.  We have provided £400,000 for Bolton Street for a building which is virtually completed.  There is a £1 million scheme for Kevin Street.  Between them I hope these will provide for the modern demands of industry.</P>
    <P>Our vocational system has adapted itself in all parts of the country so as to provide technicians and operatives to meet the needs of the variety of industries which are developing in various parts of the country.  Most of the improvements have been due to the fact that we have been able to spend more money on education.  If we look forward to improving still further, we must expect to spend still more.  From the tenor of the debate, I think all Deputies agree with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Brennan) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to follow the practice of previous years by taking Votes 8 and 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> Vote 8 speaks for itself.  It covers the salaries and expenses of the various staffs needed to deal with a large number of services provided for in Vote 9. The increase in the Estimate is due in large measure to provision for the recruitment of extra architectural and engineering staff required to undertake some large building and harbour construction projects which will be commenced during the year.</P>
    <P>The various services covered by Vote 9 fall into two main catagories, viz. architectural and engineering.  The architectural work comprises in the main the erection of new Government Offices, national schools, Garda stations, post offices and telephone exchanges, agricultural buildings, etc., and the repair and maintenance of Government premises throughout the country.</P>
    <P>New architectural and engineering works are provided for in Subhead B of Vote 9.  The total for the subhead is £2,500,000 which is an increase of £330,000 over the amount provided last year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies have been furnished with a statement setting out the particulars making up the bulk provision, it will not be necessary for me to go into detail.  A few items, however, merit special mention.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the Estimate last year, I referred to the fact that it had long been recognised by all Parties in the House that the accommodation for Ministers and the members and staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas was altogether inadequate and that it was imperative that improvement be effected.  The only practical way to ease the situation is to erect a new building as an extension of Leinster House.  The planning of the new structure has reached an advanced stage and it is hoped that construction work will commence before the close of the year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be pleased to learn that it is proposed to proceed with the erection of a statue of Thomas Davis. The foundation stone for the statue was laid in College Green in 1945 but due to a variety of circumstances, the project was in abeyance until recently.  An <Col N="43" /> artist has now been selected in consultation with An Chomhairle Ealaion and it is hoped that the statue will be erected before the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Many of the buildings which are being used as Government offices are suffering from the defects of age, and the stage has been reached at which the provision of new buildings can no longer be deferred.  The situation at Dublin Castle is particularly bad&mdash; in recent years, several of the buildings there have had to be vacated because they were no longer safe for occupation. A start has now been made on reconstruction work by the placing of a contract for the rebuilding of the block between the Upper and Lower Yards.</P>
    <P>Work on the Garden of Remembrance at Parnell Square has started. The contract now in hands covers the construction of the Garden and should be completed in about two years.  A separate contract will be placed for the statuary as soon as the design has been finally settled.  There may be some change in the design of the statuary as outlined by me here last year.</P>
    <P>Improvements to the Mail Boat Pier at Dún Laoghaire, which have been proceeding for some time past, will be continued during the year.  We have already improved the east approach road and provided covered accommodation for queues at the root of the Pier.  A high level platform has been built all along the east side, around the nose and along part of the west side. It will be continued shoreward.  The works in progress include better toilet accommodation, left luggage facilities and some other improvements.  We are also providing cranes, one on each side, to handle motor cars.  The works already done have contributed greatly to the convenience of the travelling public and have been much appreciated.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Government's decision to adapt part of the McCann Military Barracks at Templemore as a training centre for Garda recruits, a provision of £150,000 has been made for the work.  In addition we are embarking on a comprehensive <Col N="44" /> programme for the building of new Garda stations and the improvement of existing stations.  It is expected that that programme for this year will cost over £100,000.  The rate of acceleration of the programme depends on our being able to recruit the necessary additional technical staff.  This problem of technical staff applies to all our increasing activities in the architectural and engineering fields.</P>
    <P>Progress with the national school building programme is encouraging. Since the establishment of the State over 1,400 new schools have been erected and improvements to some 1,500 have been carried out at a total State cost of £16,000,000.  In the eight years ended the 31st March, 1961, 536 new schools to accommodate 88,000 pupils and 286 major improvement schemes affecting 73,000 pupils were completed at a cost of £10,000,000 approximately.  Last year 84 new schools providing accommodation for almost 11,000 pupils were erected and extensions to 16 schools to give classroom accommodation to 1,200 extra pupils were completed.  In addition, major works to give improved amenities were carried out at 22 schools housing 4,600 pupils.  Thus it will be seen that some 17,000 pupils were served by school building works in 1960-61.</P>
    <P>The expenditure in the year was £1.26 millions.  These figures for 1960/ 61 are better than was hoped having regard to the bad weather we had over a great part of the year and to the general shortage of skilled labour which extended its effects to school building. For 1961/62 we are again providing £1.6 million.  We have made a good start on this year's work.  The expenditure in the first two months i.e. April and May, has been over £300,000, the highest ever reached in the first two months of any year.  Work is on hands at present on some 100 new schools and 50 major improvement schemes and we hope that at least 130 new contracts will be placed during the year.  There is still a large number of unsatisfactory schools in the country, but we are tackling the problem in a planned manner and it is expected that the programme will have been reduced to one of normal replacement in the next ten years or so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> A provision of £120,000 has been made for work at the five sites selected for development as major fishery harbours, viz. Castletownbere, Galway, Howth, Killybegs and Passage East.  A considerable amount of preliminary work in the nature of boring surveys, soil analysis, etc. is necessary before final plans and specifications can be drawn up but there will be no avoidable delay in proceeding with the schemes. At the moment the progress and plans are being worked out with due regard for the Government's desire that the works be completed as early as possible.</P>
    <P>There are provisions for a large number of works in agricultural interests including the provision of new residential school buildings at Athenry and Clonakilty schools.  Construction work has begun at Athenry and a contract will shortly be placed for the Clonakilty job.  Deputies will see that provision is also made for works at other places associated with agricultural development such as the Veterinary College, Abbotstown, Ballyhaise and the Munster Institute.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made for the laying of a new water main from the mainland to Haulbowline Island. The work of laying the main requires suitable tides and good weather conditions. There will be six separate 2in. pipes and they are being laid at present. The job will be completed in a month or two.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government have decided to proceed with the erection of a new headquarters building for the staffs of the Departments of Social Welfare and Health on a site at Haddington Road.  Aras Mhic Dhiarmada, the present headquarters of the Department of Social Welfare, will be handed back to Coras Iompair Eireann when the new building is ready for occupation.  Planning is proceeding and the project will be pushed ahead as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>Arterial drainage construction works continue to expand and progress has been very satisfactory.  Schemes completed to date have brought benefit to 110,000 acres of land and opened the way for development of 40,000 acres <Col N="46" /> of bog.  Works are in hands in six catchments and on one embankment scheme.  During the past year, schemes for two new major catchments were commenced&mdash;the Moy and the Inny&mdash; which are expected to benefit 48,000 and 39,000 acres of land respectively, and 24,000 acres of bog.  The total cost of these schemes will be nearly £14 million.</P>
    <P>During 1961/62, work is expected to be commenced on two further schemes, the Broadmeadow, Counties Dublin and Meath in a matter of weeks and the Killimor, in County Galway, later on in the year.  Under the arrangements introduced about a year ago for intermediate river drainage, work will be started on four of the smaller catchment areas this year.  A survey and design work is proceeding in a number of other schemes which are at various stages of investigation.  With the start last year of a survey of the Suir, we have come half-way on the list of 28 major catchments, and the end of the arterial drainage problem is now in sight.  I can see that it will be virtually solved in the next 15 years or so.</P>
    <P>While the remaining Subheads do not, I think, call for any special comment, it will be noted that there is an increase of £30,000 under subhead C, Maintenance and Supplies, from which is met the cost of maintaining State buildings, parks, harbours and national monuments.  I am conscious that our expenditure on national monuments has not been as great as we would like it to be.  Owing mainly to shortage of staff, our outlay on this service has not kept pace with the extension of our activities in other directions.  We are aware of the interest throughout the country in national monuments and their importance in promoting the tourist industry.  We are at present looking into the matter and hope to be able to arrange for increased work and expenditure in the field on this service.</P>
    <P>There are increases in Subheads E&mdash; Rents, Rates etc., and F&mdash;Fuel, Light, Water, Cleaning, etc., due mainly to increased accommodation requirements of various Departments.</P>
    <P>Provision is thus being made this year for a general expansion of both <Col N="47" /> architectural and engineering works particularly in relation to school building, arterial drainage work, and harbour development projects and it is hoped that the level of expansion aimed at will be maintained for several years to come.</P>
    <P>That is a pretty general summary of the main duties of the Office.  If Deputies should require further details, I shall do my best to facilitate them, as is the usual custom, when replying to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I do so mainly because I am a Munsterman or, shall I say, because I come from the south-east of Ireland. What I have noticed about Votes for the Board of Works for many years is that it seems as if the people of south-east Ireland are not tax-payers or that they belong to a conquered portion of the country and that the Government of the day are applying reconstruction to them as the United States Government applied it to the Southern States after the Civil War.</P>
      <P>I am especially concerned about Passage East.  Passage East was mentioned in the Minister's speech today and mentioned last among the fishing ports.  I want to know who authorises the works that are being done or that will be done on fishing ports by the Board of Works?  Is the recommendation made by the Minister for Finance to the Board of Works or by the Minister or the Department of Lands, or is this a matter for the Board of Works themselves?  I have not yet been able to get an answer to that question. It seems to me that the Board of Works are prepared to spend any money on any kind of port in which fish are not caught.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of what is being done or about to be done at these fishing ports.  He gave no details and they are not in the Estimate.  I should like to know how much of the money earmarked for fishing ports will be spent in Passage East?  I am entitled to know that.  The total for the subhead is £2,500,000, an increase of £330,000 over the amount provided last year and I want to know how much will be spent on Passage East in the coming year.  I should also like to know how much will be spent on other harbours mentioned here.  I am seeking information about them because they are put before the fishing harbours in the estuary of the Suir.  When that is the case, I suspect that we may be passed over again.  Provision of £120,000 has been made for work at five sites selected for development, Castletownbere, Galway, Howth, Killybegs and Passage East.  We know the position in Castletownbere, Galway and Killybegs where factories have been put up and have been closed.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have it on record twice.  Thank you very much, Sir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount of preliminary <Col N="49" /> work in the nature of boring surveys&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>these surveys bore me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>soil analysis, etc., is necessary before final plans and specifications can be drawn up but there will be no avoidable delay in proceeding with the schemes.</P>
    <P>I am quoting now from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech.</P>
    <P>At the moment the progress and plans are being worked out with due regard for the Government's desire that the works be completed as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to know how much is to be spent in the estuary of Waterford this year?  As far as schools are concerned, this is an open and shut business about providing schools. I suppose the direction comes to the Board of Works from another Minister but let me say to the Board of Works&mdash;I am sure they would have had something to do with this&mdash;that I have seen a few schools opened recently in which there were some very fine pieces of sculpture, done by Irish sculptors in limestone and other Irish stone, which portrayed the patron Saint of the school, or perhaps Our Lady, or the founder of the school. That is to be commended.  Instead of putting up the same type of school everywhere it is a good thing that there should be some relief by having these good, original sculptures done by some of our Irish artists.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see three schools are being built in Waterford at present. That is to be commended also.  I do not think they would have been built were it not for the fact that two of the buildings fell and the children had to be put in the free Library, or somewhere else, while the schools were being built.</P>
    <P>There is another matter here on which I wish to express a personal opinion; it would not be the opinion of my Party.  The Parliamentary Secretary's speech says:</P>
    <P>Arterial Drainage Construction Works continue to expand and progress has been very satisfactory. <Col N="50" /> Schemes completed to date have brought benefit to 110,000 acres of land and opened the way for development of 40,000 acres of bog. Works are in hands in six catchments and on one embankment scheme. During the past year, schemes for two new major catchments were commenced&mdash;the Moy and the Inny, which are expected to benefit 48,000 and 39,000 acres of land respectively and 24,000 acres of bog.  The total cost of these schemes will be nearly £14,000,000.</P>
    <P>It would be just as well for us to know are these schemes development work?  Does the Government think they are development work or are they solely to give employment for vote catching purposes?  I should like to know the answer to that.  Fourteen million pounds for 110,000 acres of land&mdash;what kind of land will it be? Will it be good land, or will it be land of the kind of which you would require 35 acres to keep a goat?</P>
    <P>I have here the Official Report for the 8th March, 1961.  At Column 165 the Parliamentary Secretary answered a question of mine in which he gave me the priority list for arterial drainage of the major catchments of 100,000 acres.  They are as follows: the Brosna, the Glyde and Dee, Feale, Corrib, Maine, Moy, Inny, Suck, Boyne, Erne, Little Brosna, Deel, Boyle, Maigue and then we come to the Suir.  The Slaney, for the information of the Deputy from Wexford, is No. 28, the last in the list, and the Suir is No. 15. I know the land in the various areas and in the great catchment of the Suir; I know the land around Portlaw where the banks are maintained by the people themselves, and it is great land. The land around the Nore and the Barrow is also great land but nobody bothers about it; nobody cares about it.</P>
    <P>We have spent £14,000,000 of the taxpayers' money reclaiming land which is of doubtful value compared with the land I mention around the Suir, Nore and Barrow.  I notice that the Barrow is No. 23 and the Nore is No. 18 on this list.  This question should <Col N="51" /> be examined and the Parliamentary Secretary should tell the House whether this scheme of arterial drainage is for development work or to give employment for vote-catching purposes.  I expect we will only have to wait but at the same time, if it is for development, I would draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary and the House to the fact that we should drain the catchments which contain the best land especially when the work is costing us so much money.</P>
    <P>In regard to the State parks, State buildings and national monuments, I want to compliment the small staff in the Board of Works who deal with these aspects of the Vote, on the great work they have done.  They have done magnificent work in Jerpoint and in Dunbrody.  I am sure the Board of Works had something to do with the work carried out at Bunratty, or their advice was taken.  That was great work.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment them on it.  It is a wonderful job and a worthwhile job.  I would say to the Parliamentary Secretary that that section of the Department is worthy of a better Vote.  In regard to the extension of Leinster House, I am sure we are all very glad that they are to try to do something with our Parliament House.  I hope that the architects and the heating engineer especially, will look after the heating, lighting and ventilation of this House.  I have said before, and I want to repeat, that if this building were owned by a private concern and 147 people were working in it, just as we have 147 Deputies coming in here, and an inspection was carried out by an inspector under the Factories Act for ventilation, whoever was responsible would be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to No. 5 in the Estimates, Busts and Portraits of National Leaders, I think we should bring to an end the buying of pictures of political leaders who are still alive.  If such pictures are to be bought and exhibited in public buildings in Ireland they should be bought by the subscriptions of the supporters of these political <Col N="52" /> leaders.  If any unsuitable pictures are brought here, whether they are bought with the taxpayers' money or otherwise&mdash;and if they are bought with the taxpayers' money and are not works of art it is a shame&mdash;they should not be hung in public buildings here.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to the Parliamentary Secretary that he read a story written by the late O. Henry which I quoted here last week &ldquo;Art and the Broncho.&rdquo;  There is always the danger when politicians are still alive that there will be pressure brought on people like the Parliamentary Secretary to buy pictures like &ldquo;The Man Who.&rdquo;&ldquo;The Man Who&rdquo; mentioned in this story happened to be the grandfather of an artist.  One senator who looked at the picture said: &ldquo;I would not give six bits for it.&rdquo;  The other senator says: &ldquo;We must buy it.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well&rdquo; the other man said, &ldquo;I suppose it is all right.  We have plenty of attics and plenty of cellars in which to put it.&rdquo; I want to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that there is no room in the attics or in the cellars in the National Gallery.  But such atrocities are bought and some of them are appearing on the market at very high prices at the present time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Fisheries Branch there is a provision of £5,000 for the erection of the Galway Fisheries Research Station.  Surely it is not intended to spend another £5,000?</P>

      <P>There is a provision here in respect of works of economic development for other fishery harbours, £35,000.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take a note of No. 37 <Col N="53" /> here in respect of Harbours.  Last year I asked what harbours the money was being spent on and I discovered one of the harbours was Greencastle on which a sum of £50,000 was being spent although only 2,000 boxes of fish had been caught in the place.  I had to skim through page after page of this Vote to see was my constituency mentioned in it at all.  There are various figures of £200,000, £10,000, £18,000, £41,000 and £329,000 in respect of other constituencies but in County Waterford for Ballymacarbery a sum of £8,500 is provided.  This is one of the things I have to protest against constantly, that it would appear that my constituency is not in this State at all as far as the Board of Works is concerned.</P>
      <P>I have here the amount of money spent on fishing ports by the Board of Works.  It shows that the Fisheries Branch are not directing the money into the places where the fish are caught.  In reply to a question at Column 323, Volume 182 of the Dáil Debates of the 31st May, 1960, I received the information that the Board of Works spent £102,865 at Killybegs, £67,000 at Galway, £36,000 at Schull, £21,000 at Dingle, £21,000 at Baltimore and £19,000 at Dunmore East.  When will the Board of Works and the Fisheries Branch get some sense?</P>
      <P>I see here that very late in the day we are going to erect a statue to Thomas Davis.  I am glad we remember there is a history of that period, that it is worth commemorating, that Davis is worth commemorating and the people who were associated with Davis are worth commemorating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision of £150,000 to adapt part of the McCann Military Barracks at Templemore as a training centre for Garda recruits.  Is it not a good thing that we are decentralising something?  It is good that there is a barracks there in Templemore to which to send them, that it was not burned.  I note also the present headquarters of the Department of Social Welfare will be handed over to Córas Iompair Éireann when the new building is ready for occupation. I do not really understand what all <Col N="54" /> this is about.  Apparently the new headquarters of the Department of Social Welfare is on a site at Haddington Road.  Is this a cheap way for C.I.E. to have offices built for them?  What did C.I.E. pay for the construction of this building? Has it appeared in their balance sheet?  Is the taxpayer going to pay for it?  Will this be brought into the balance sheet of C.I.E. as a debit, as capital expenditure or as an outlay?</P>
    <P>On previous occasions the Parliamentary Secretary has done me the courtesy of replying to questions I have asked.  I have specifically asked him several questions regarding these Votes and I hope he will answer these questions when he is closing the debate.</P>

      <P>In the programme of the Board of Works there is no greater demand for increased activity than in connection with new schools, the reconstruction of some of the old schools that are structurally sound and the provision of amenities in all cases including an adequate water supply.  Where it is decided that some of the old schools will ultimately be reconstructed, water supply and toilet facilities should get very early attention in the interests of public health and also to provide hygienic training and proper facilities for the students.  It would not cost a great amount of money.  Very often, public water supplies pass near the schools. I am sure that the amount of money to bring that service into the school would not be very great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel sure that the Parliamentary Secretary and his department will use all their efforts to keep pace with the amount of money provided for school building in the coming year. There is a great public demand for it.  In many parts of the country, there is agitation and protest against delay. The programme was so immense that it was very hard to tackle all phases of it.  It takes time to plan and to provide.  What is being done is excellent.  We must only hope that the progress will be accelerated.  Of all public buildings, these are needed <Col N="55" /> most and will serve the greatest number of people.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that there should be a drainage unit in each county.  The catchments are very big problems requiring long periods of survey and engineering accuracy.  In consequence, they take many years to plan. There are primary streams, going direct to the sea, where there is no danger of flooding farms or holdings lower down by starting at the river mouth and working upwards.  Many acres of land could be reclaimed in a very short time.</P>
    <P>Some of these schemes have been done already.  One was done at Minane Bridge during the term of office of the late Seán Moylan.  It saved many acres that by now would be subjected to flooding.  It reclaimed some of the very best land which had been submerged by the tides.  That type of work can be done pretty speedily.  Modern machinery can be secured by contract in the various counties to do a lot of that work.  There is very pressing demand for it.  We should not concentrate entirely on big catchment areas and, in that way, leave very many acres that could be reclaimed in a short time still growing rushes, and so on for certain months of the year.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department will take into account the best propositions in relation to the number of acres reclaimed and the cost.  Some schemes undoubtedly will result in a fairly high cost per acre.  In other schemes it is known that the cost per acre is not at all great and the proposition would be a financial success from that viewpoint.  Primary streams should, therefore, get very early priority.</P>
    <P>I mentioned again and again the River Owenabue which flows through a valley.  The county council put up a scheme on one occasion for the expenditure of even a few thousand pounds which engineers of vast experience thought would be of lasting benefit but the Office of Public Works did not approve.  They did not think those schemes would be of permanent utility. <Col N="56" /> The cost would be comparatively light even if the Office of Public Works decided on a bigger scheme for that river and I am sure for very many others in various parts of the country. Also, it would help to give employment in the rural areas.  Day by day we hear of the flight from rural areas.  That is a scheme of a productive nature which would help in that regard.  I feel sure that attention will be given to it.</P>
    <P>As far as the provision of major and secondary fishery boards is concerned it is about time our fisheries were tackled in a big way so as to gather some of the wealth from the sea.  We must all approve of that.  I think experts were appointed to survey these ports and their potentialities.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department acted on the advice of these experts.  I suggest that landing places around our coasts should not be neglected.  The county councils concerned and the Office of Public Works should, together, help isolated fishermen so far as landing facilities for themselves and their catches are concerned. Furthermore, security for their boats will ensure a continuance of interest in fishing.  If we neglect the local places here and there, it may subsequently be difficult to get sufficient people interested in fishing and to risk their lives on the angry waves.</P>
    <P>I am glad that an interest is now being taken in our national monuments. They are a great record of our history. When we visit other lands we see monuments to the memory of their great men.  The same tradition should prevail here.  If we neglect these things, we are not giving cognisance to features of our history that help to perpetuate the spirit of the past and that serve to interest and enlighten the present and future generations.  Our ancient castles are part of the scenic attractions of many localities.  If these castles are allowed go into decay, the localities lose something of their history.  Whatever is to be done should be attended to without delay or these ancient monuments may become irreparable before action is taken.  There is a monuments advisory committee attached to every county council for which a token vote is passed each year.  Funds are so <Col N="57" /> sparse, however, that very little can be done.  Therefore, it would be very desirable if the Board of Works and Bord Fáilte would come to their aid. I am glad a monument is being erected to Thomas Davis.  He was typical of his period of history.  His work amongst the various sections of our people perpetuated much that is valuable and inspired many later patriots to work for our freedom and culture.  Davis himself paid great attention to history and culture.  &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;remember you have a country.&rdquo;  He built everything on that.  He inspired the coming generation and showed them the path to follow.  He was gentle of nature and attracted to him those previously neglectful of such matters. A statue to his memory is only a small tribute to one who did so much for our nation.</P>

      <P>I am glad to think of any honour being paid to the memory of Thomas Davis.  But I often wonder, however, if the erection of statues to these memories is the most appropriate method of recording our past glory? Thomas Davis was the man who said that &ldquo;righteous men must make our land a nation once again.&rdquo;  Perhaps the most enduring memorial we could erect to his memory is to keep that precept of his in mind and operate, in public life at least, in accordance with his precept.  It would be a source of much greater satisfaction to me to think that that sort of memorial were envisaged for Thomas Davis rather than a statue. I often feel that, once we have erected the statue, we think we have done all we think is necessary to be done.  Of course that is a mistake.</P>

      <P>I am happy to recall that I was present at the unveiling of a memorial to him in the house in Mallow where he was born and lived.  I commend to the Deputy the inscription which appears there.  He spoke of men turning their backs on the opportunity of advancement and preferment because they were too proud to sell their integrity for personal advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> I do not think it is expedient or desirable to spend too much Parliamentary time discussing every Estimate which comes before the House, because certain Estimates are necessary and do not contain any very revolutionary proposals.  They are Estimates for the maintenance of work that has to go on whatever Government are in office.  That is very largely the case in respect of the Office of Public Works. But there are two or three matters to which I should like to refer which relate to the policy of the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>Arterial drainage is, in my opinion, most important.  I do not agree with Deputy Lynch in that.  As Deputy Lynch said, he expressed a personal opinion on it.  I regard it as a most important work.  I believe arterial drainage is work that ought to be got on with as quickly as possible.  I have often thought we could get on much better with arterial drainage without the Board of Works superstition that you cannot do arterial drainage without doing the whole catchment area at the same time.</P>
    <P>I believe that is wholly wrong.  I quite agree that, if you want to do arterial drainage, you must survey the whole catchment area and get the picture of the average annual flow of water which the main channel of the arterial catchment area will ultimately have to carry when the catchment area has been exhaustively drained.  I have always believed that, when you make a survey of a catchment area, determine that the capacity of the main channel must be so many thousand cubic feet per hour and provide against flash flooding and every other peril to effective drainage, it would be well worth while to add an arbitrary five per cent. or 10 per cent. to the estimated necessary capacity of the main channel and then proceed to drain that main channel right up to its source with the estimated capacity plus 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>That would leave all the tributary rivers flowing as they now are&mdash;some of them adequately; some of them inadequately&mdash;but in respect of all of them the clearance of the main channel would provide a very substantial relief. We could then tackle the tributary <Col N="59" /> rivers piecemeal, as convenience and economic considerations suggested.  I have always felt that, if we did that, we would get two immediate and substantial advantages.  One is that the relative rapidity with which we could deal with the main channel would provide a large measure of immediate relief in the tributary rivers.  But, over and above that, we would leave behind us in every arterial drainage basin a large reservoir of public work that waited to be done and which we could undertake as local employment circumstances indicated might be necessary.</P>
    <P>Having cleared the main channel of the Suir and the Boyne, in subsequent years, when we came to consider the Vote for the Office of Public Works, if a temporary unemployment situation arose from some fortuitous circumstances in the Tipperary area, we could direct a considerable sum of money to work on draining the tributary rivers draining into the Suir, whereas, in another year, if there were some fortuitous circumstances in the Louth-Meath area, which is drained by the Boyne, we could concentrate the bulk of our effort on that area and deal with the tributary rivers going into the Boyne, in the knowledge that the Suir and the Boyne were in a position to carry whatever water we released from the tributary rivers draining into them.</P>
    <P>The present situation, as Deputy Lynch pointed out, is that nothing is to be done for the Suir until 27 other rivers are dealt with.  From that point of view, I think it is a bad idea.  I have argued this repeatedly with engineers from the Board of Works.  So far as I can make out, the Board of Works engineers have been wedded to the idea in the past that you cannot do the main channel without doing the whole catchment area.  I think that is an illusion, an illusion borne of an old reluctance.  The arterial drainage engineers, when asked to drain sections of the main channel, have always resisted that idea, and they were right to resist it.  They said: &ldquo;There is no use in our draining a block half way down stream, stopping a couple of miles from the estuary and then travelling <Col N="60" /> from one part to another.  If you want us to do a main arterial river, let us start at the estuary and go all the way up.&rdquo; Up to that point I agree with them.</P>
    <P>But they say: &ldquo;If you want us to drain a big river, let us do the whole catchment area.  Let us start at the estuary and come up the main channel, but if we come to a tributary river, either to the right or to the left, you must let us follow that all the way until we finish it.  When we finish the one on the right, we will do the one on the left, and then we will resume upon the main channel.&rdquo; When asked why, they say: &ldquo;Because that is the only way correctly to estimate what the capacity of the main channel must be. Once we have done the work, we cannot change it because the spoil on each side makes it impossible for the machinery to go back on the main channel, if we make a mistake as to what the capacity of the main channel ought to be.&rdquo;  I think that is all rot. If they make a survey estimate and add five per cent., that will give them ample scope to carry off all the water that in any circumstances can be carried.</P>
    <P>Another argument was: &ldquo;If we were to do all these main rivers, we would have to tie up the machinery.&rdquo;  That is all nonsense, too.  They could do the main channels of all the rivers two or three times as fast as they do them at present, and still have ample time to tail off their operations and to see that they were not left with a vast surplus of unusable machinery which is of use only on main channels.  If they did ten main channels in the first group, seven in the next, five in the next, and three in the last, they could, in that way, economically taper off their operations and use all their heavy machinery to the limit of its usefulness.</P>
    <P>I see we are to spend £150,000 converting Templemore Barracks into a headquarters for the Garda.  I fully appreciate that a decision about the Garda is a matter for the Minister for Justice and not the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  The decision the Minister for Justice takes is: &ldquo;I want accommodation for the Garda as a training headquarters.&rdquo;  It <Col N="61" /> is the Board of Works who decide what the accommodation should be and someone thought up the brilliant idea of going to Templemore Barracks and reconditioning it.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the House of the danger I see in that.  I have seen it happen time and time again.  On both occasions when I was Minister for Agriculture, someone thought up a lovely idea: &ldquo;Let us buy an old house and convert it.&rdquo;  I never saw a case of that being undertaken that we did not end up by spending from two to three times as much as it would have cost us to pull down the old house and rebuild it from the foundations up.  The end result was that we always had a relatively inconvenient premises, whereas if we had torn the old building down, started from the basement up and built according to the requirements of the new institution, we would have had an up-to-date and modern building and we would have had it for less money than ultimately we had to spend.</P>
    <P>I find that these stories have to be told repeatedly before anyone will listen to them.  We were left a property in Wexford called Johnstown Castle. We converted it into a research station for soil testing and experimental work. One of the conditions in the deed of gift to the nation was that we must preserve the fabric of the residence&mdash; God knows why, because it was a very ugly old house built in the middle of the last century as a false Gothic castle. But there the provision was, and when we proceeded to convert the building, it was discovered that there was dry rot in it.  We spent over £120,000 on that structure, and when we were finished, we had this ridiculous mid-Victorian pseudo-Gothic structure, now structurally sound, but grossly inconvenient and ludicrous to look at.  For a little more than half of what we spent, we could have had as fine a headquarters as there is to be found in Europe.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister for Lands, my colleague, bought another place for a forestry school.  Of course, as soon as we got into it, dry rot was found. I believe we spent three times the <Col N="62" /> value of that house on reconstruction. I want to put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he is not committed to the reconstruction of Templemore Barracks which, indeed, is not an architectural gem, would he not consider forgetting about it and building a new Garda headquarters at Templemore or wherever else it is deemed expedient to build it?  I guarantee that if he builds a brand-new building, he will have a much better building at the end and have it for substantially less than it will cost to reconstruct Templemore Barracks.</P>
    <P>Why should we be wedded to an 18th Century barracks in Templemore, the only part of which we can possibly use is the four walls?  The whole interior will have to come out. It would be much cheaper to build from the bottom up.  I suggest that unless the Parliamentary Secretary is irrevocably committed, he should consider the proposal I now make.  If it is desirable that it should be in Templemore, let it be in Templemore, but let us employ a good architect, erect a decent building which we can be proud to look at and which our neighbours can be proud to look at.</P>
    <P>All over the world&mdash;America, Great Britain and everywhere else&mdash;you read of beautiful new contemporary buildings planned by the young architects of today.  Why, in the name of Providence, do we choose to restrict our major construction enterprises within the four walls of hideous old structures, which are put up without any regard to architectural considerations, or anything else, are reminiscent of the occupation of the country, and have little else to commend them?  There are plenty of good young architects in this country who would be glad of an opportunity to show what they are capable of.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that whenever there are buildings to be done hereafter, instead of reconstructing ancient barracks, he should employ young architects, hold competitions if necessary, and let us see what the rising school of architecture in Ireland can produce.</P>
    <P>I see the Parliamentary Secretary is going to build new schools in Athenry <Col N="63" /> and Clonakilty.  I was going to do that, too, but one of the difficulties in Athenry was we never could make up our minds on which side of the railway we should build.  That was the problem with which we were faced.  I take it that problem has been resolved.  The farm in Athenry is bisected by the railway and the railway cuts off the school buildings from the rest of the farm.  Are we going to move the school buildings across the railway?  How will that problem be resolved?  If it is the intention to build in Athenry, I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary ought seriously to consider making these buildings the subject of architectural competitions.  Let us do something to put up that which reflects the best we have to offer by way of architectural design in this, our generation.  Let us bear in mind that in the old days there were patrons who were able to provide the arts and crafts in the society in which they grew with an opportunity for self-expression.</P>
    <P>In this modern day and age individuals to provide that opportunity seem to have disappeared and there now only remains the State and the wealthy corporations.  The Minister speaks here of a variety of buildings that the State has in contemplation.  Surely we ought to give some of the young architects of the country an opportunity of showing what they can do.  I think the best way to do that would be to put the buildings out to competition.  In the biggest enterprises it might be expedient to have international competitions, but for buildings such as the schools in Athenry, Clonakilty and Templemore Barracks, sufficient scope would be provided, I think, for the young graduates of our own architectural schools.  It would provide them with a very welcome opportunity of demonstrating what their capacity is. There are very few other places where they can get such an opportunity in the early stages of their professional life.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of his desire to attend to public monuments as soon as circumstances will allow.  Let justice be done even though the heavens fall.  I drew the Parliamentary <Col N="64" /> Secretary's attention to one interesting public monument in Roscommon, which was in danger of being extinguished through neglect.  It was, I think, the traditional coronation place of the O'Connors in ancient times.  The Parliamentary Secretary promptly took measures to bring the site under the protection of the Board of Works and I think it is now effectively preserved. I should like to think that every public monument to which the attention of the Board of Works was directed should be given the same measure of protection.  Adequate staff should be made available in the Board of Works to make that possible.  It is not, I suppose, possible to attend to all the public monuments as fast as we would wish to do, but I think we ought to take precautions as quickly as may be.  It is a matter of a technical staff to locate these monuments, to identify them and to schedule them for attention as soon as opportunity offers.  I do not think that could be done without an adequate aerial survey of the country.</P>
    <P>I sometimes feel like a voice crying in the wilderness.  Unless I am greatly mistaken, as a result of our history, this island on which we live is the greatest archaeological treasure house in Europe.  That is a remarkable affirmation, but I believe it to be true. The reason why we are a treasure house is because we have been relatively remote from the vast industrial revolution, not to speak of more recent wars. But the vast bulk of the archaeological remains that lie hidden under the surface of this country cannot be distinguished in the peripatetic survey of the Ordnance Survey because, if you are walking over sites, however vigilantly, it is impossible to detect them, whereas the same area photographed from the air throws up a clear profile of these sites which can then be identified and marked for future excavation, or determined as being of no archaeological significance and, therefore, requiring no measure of preservation. Though I am reluctant to repeat annually representations of this kind there is no other way in which I can hope to get attention drawn to this.</P>
    <P>I had an aerial survey made of the Hill of Craughan when I was Minister <Col N="65" /> for Agriculture.  That was the traditional home of the kings and queens of Connacht.  On the peripatetic survey of the Hill of Craughan, made and kept up to date, there are marked only seven archaeological sites.  On the aerial survey of the same area there are no fewer than 35.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to verify that he will find the relevant file in the Department of Agriculture, showing the peripatetic survey, and super imposed upon it a transparency indicating the sites revealed by the aerial survey.  That situation obtains all round.  If the work of preserving the ancient monuments of the country is to be done that aerial survey ought to be made.  Quite a number of these sites are being inadvertently destroyed in the course of agricultural operations carried out with heavy machinery.  In the past people did not plough an archaeological site because it was impossible to get a pair of horses to draw a plough through such a site with its plethora of stone, and so these places were marked and we all know them&mdash;certainly in the North of Ireland&mdash;by the description of &ldquo;Gentle Places.&rdquo;  There grew up a tradition that you did not plough a &ldquo;gentle place&rdquo; and you often saw them isolated in the middle of a field. In fact, they were avoided originally probably because they were too stony to plough.  Then they became associated in people's minds with an area which had a sacred quality, an area it was not thought prudent to plough. So they became the &ldquo;Gentle Places&rdquo; but, with the advent of machinery, a great many such archaeological sites have simply been swept away because it was quite easy to pass heavy machinery through them.</P>
    <P>I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to press upon his colleagues that he cannot properly discharge his responsibility regarding the archaeological monuments without that aerial survey to guide him.  It is not a very costly operation.  It could be done by the Army Air Corps or by a commercial firm specialising in aerial photography who would do it for a stipulated fee. It must be done in winter, for the simple reason that, at other periods, the leaves of the trees obscure too much <Col N="66" /> of the ground.  It must be done in daylight between certain hours so that the sun will not be too low on the horizon when the survey proceeds in order to get the right reflections to give the appropriate indications on the aerial map of where these sites lie.</P>
    <P>There are a variety of other utilitarian uses to which such an aerial survey could be turned.  It ought to be of value to the Geological Office.  It certainly would be of value to the Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Institute as well, but what is everybody's business is nobody's business.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should make it his business.  I guarantee that he will get support from the Department of Agriculture.  I do not doubt he will get support from the Agricultural Research Institute and I am pretty sure that the Geological Office will help him also.  Between them all, I cannot doubt that the Minister for Finance would make the money available and thus there would be a sure foundation upon which to build up an adequate protective service for the archaeological monuments of the country.  That is the main question.</P>
    <P>There are a number of archaeological monuments in the form of buildings.  Heretofore, I have been speaking mainly of subterranean monuments which belong mainly to the prehistoric period of our country. There are a number of buildings, structures and famous sites which are known to be historical and which archaeological authorities wish to have preserved.  I think it is right to repeat what Deputy Lynch said in regard to Bunratty Castle.  A beautiful job has been done there.  I am sure there are certain utilitarian people who will raise their eyebrows and query the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues for having done this.  He was prefectly right.  I think it is a beautiful thing.</P>
    <P>I defy anybody to go into the main hall on the first floor without being staggered by the beauty of the room, if it never had anything in it.  It is, in fact, furnished with a good deal of medieval furniture about which some misunderstanding has arisen which I <Col N="67" /> do not propose to foment, because I believe it would be thoroughly evil to do that.  There are a number of people who have the idea that there ought to be in a medieval castle of that kind no furnishings that are not of Irish provenance. That is quite nonsensical.</P>
    <P>The whole social pattern of our people living in such homes at that time was based on the commerce that passed between these areas and areas on the Continent of Europe.  It was common practice for the McNamaras or those who succeeded them in places like Bunratty Castle to send out wool, textiles or whatever else they had to sell abroad and bring back to the great houses Continental craftwork, many contemporary examples of which now decorate the rooms of Bunratty Castle and properly decorate them.  It would be quite illusory to imagine that to exclude such furnishings from Bunratty Castle would in any way contribute to the true reproduction of the atmosphere that obtained there when the Castle was in occupation of the McNamaras or those who succeeded them.</P>
    <P>It is a beautiful thing.  It is an imaginative thing to do and I commend the Board of Works for having undertaken it and carried it so far.  It could not have been undertaken without the collaboration of Lord Gort.  It was a splendid thing that this help was forthcoming and that his generous benefactions to that historic monument have made it as admirable as it is.  We can only hope that others will be as public-spirited as he.  It would help to add to the furnishings and decorations of the Castle.  It will be done with the discrimination and the care that has characterised all the work carried out there so far.  It would be wrong also if the fullest tribute were not paid to the Board of Works for the quality of the work they have done there and the care and distinction of the processes of restoration they carried out.  It must have been extremely difficult to do it as it has been done and it reflects great credit on those responsible for it.</P>
    <P>I think we make a great mistake in not marking the historic and archaeological <Col N="68" /> sites more explicitly than we have done heretofore.  I think the Tourist Board, which is amply endowed, should examine the matter. There is not much use having historic and archaeological sites if nobody knows what they are historic for.  I think the practice of putting up a plaque with a short descriptive piece upon it cannot be too highly commended. I have repeatedly directed the attention of the House to my own personal experience on the field of Gettysburg in America.  In that area, the matter has been carried to extraordinary lengths.  It is now possible for almost anybody, whether with professional knowledge or not, to travel the whole field of Gettysburg and identify every site upon it with every great event that transpired during the course of that battle.</P>
    <P>We can travel the roads of Ireland and pass hundreds of intensely interesting and significant sites without having the faintest notion of what significance they have.  How many Deputies can point to where the home of Queen Meadhbh and Ailill was or where the Táin Bó Cuailgne started and where it ended?  Yet anyone passing along the road from Dublin to Ballaghaderreen passes right through it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not every Deputy goes that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but a great many people pass that road.  I do not believe that one in a thousand realises that the archaeological remains through which they are passing are the background of the Táin Bó.  I feel sure that every member of the Deputy's Party is familiar with the Táin Bó, both in the original and in Miss Hull's translation. A plaque containing that sort of description would greatly add to the amenities of the countryside and would provide a distinct tourist attraction.  It would be work which could very properly be sponsored by the Parliamentary Secretary as part of his general duty of preserving ancient monuments. Evidence of the desirability of doing it is readily available to us by the example set by the Tourist Board when <Col N="69" /> they started putting up plaques marking rivers by name.  I like to know the name of a river I am crossing and all of us must have had the experience that outside our own immediate area we would not know what river we were crossing until these plaques were put up giving the name of the river.</P>
      <P>The same should be done in regard to these sites.  I am certain that if it were done, it would evoke a large measure of local co-operation in their preservation, whereas unless these sites are marked, there is great danger of their being frittered away either by having stones removed from them for building or by obliteration in the course of agricultural operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be true that the Minister for Education has primary responsibility for the erection of national schools but that is not the whole of the story.  I remember in 1948 it was decided that an energetic effort should be made to build new national schools and I look back with pride and satisfaction on the figures to which we can refer in Volume 186, of the Official Report for 23rd February 1961, where the number of new schools built and the number of enlargements and major improvements carried out since the year 1931-32 are given.  That period covers the war years and also the years before.  I imagine the average number of national schools built per annum was about 30 in the pre-war years. Naturally, during the war years, the figure fell much lower than that for the want of materials with which to build schools.  But, when you come to 1948, you find that there were 21 new schools provided and that there were six schools enlarged; in 1949, there were 44 new schools built and 11 enlarged; in 1950, 46 new schools built and 22 enlarged; in 1951, 47 built, 21 enlarged; in 1952, 50 built, 17 enlarged; in 1953, 31 built, 17 enlarged; in 1954, 70 built, 34 enlarged; in 1955, 56 built, 27 enlarged; in 1956, 46 built, 24 enlarged; in 1957, 64 built, 40 enlarged; in 1958, 45 built, 16 enlarged; in 1959, 92 built, 62 <Col N="70" /> enlarged; in 1960, 85 built, 51 enlarged and from 31st March, 1960, to 31st December 1960, 68 built, and 24 enlarged.  Those years which were started off in 1948 show an improvement on past performance but I do not think that is work which can be excessively expedited.</P>
    <P>I saw recently an article congratulating this Government on having switched its capital programme from housing and the building of schools on to more productive capital work. That I regard as one of the most pointless and revolting intellectual victories for the fools who do not understand the purpose for which money is made.  There can be a philosophy in this world that the only purpose money can serve is to make more money and when that is carried to its logical conclusion under the Soviet socialist communist regime, you grind down humanity to the lowest level on which life can be sustained in order that more and more wealth can be produced in the service of greater and greater power and nobody stops to ask himself the question, for what?</P>
    <P>I very much prefer the philosophy which deliberately looks at capital expenditure with a balanced view and appropriates what is right and prudent to what is commonly described by economists as productive but reserves an ample section of the annual national product for the provision for our people of the amenities of decency.</P>
    <P>There is grave danger that the very success that has attended our efforts in the past to wipe out the slums and to do away with condemned housing throughout the country may blind our eyes to the urgent necessity of continuing to appropriate a proper share of the gross national product to the things that really matter in the long run.  The highest priority, of course, was housing, to lift our people out of the loathsome housing conditions in which they had sweltered for so long, and we have substantially done that.  There are bits and pieces to be tidied up still but we are getting on with that job.  The second charge <Col N="71" /> upon us was to provide the hospitals and sanatoria necessary to protect the people's health.  We have done that job substantially.  the great danger is now that those who did all in their power to prevent us undertaking that work, who warned us that it was improvident, foolish and dangerous to do it, will now get the bit between their teeth again and say: &ldquo;You did too much in the past and do not ever perpetrate that folly again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I glory in the fact that we taxed our resources to their limit to take our people out of the slums and to provide for those who could not provide for themselves the hospitals and sanatoria requisite to protect them, to preserve their health and to restore sick children cured to their parents.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about money not being provided.  I am talking about getting the job done and I am long enough in this business, which officials do not understand, to know that the Board of Works is the instrument by which you stop building.  No Minister comes in here and says: &ldquo;I will not provide money&rdquo;.  The tactic is to provide the money and then to tell the Board of Works not to spend it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is on the records.  When we were Ministers of State, the officials were not allowed to do that.  We made no difference when we had turned our capital programme away from social services.  The Deputy seems to overlook the fact that he is <Col N="72" /> being duped into deriding us that we spent too much on houses, too much on schools, too much on hospitals and sanatoria.  We did not let that happen and the figures show it because, we said, the primary charge upon the national product of this country is the welfare of the people.  We do not believe in saving money and letting the sick die and the young emigrate and soothing ourselves that the deposits in our financial institutions appear to rise or that our external assets continue to pyramid.  The Parliamentary Secretary should resist most strenuously any pressure from any quarter which may be brought upon him to prevent him not only from completing whatever programme for national schools is offered to him, but he should seek, in his turn, to be in a position to say to the Minister for Education: &ldquo;The programme for this year that you committed to my care is completed and I am prepared to do more if you will ask me to do it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This works both ways.  If the Parliamentary Secretary does not complete the programme, the Minister for Education has a perfect alibi but if the Parliamentary Secretary completes the programme in November that was supposed to keep him busy until March and puts on the desk of the Minister for Education a notice to that effect, the Minister for Education will have to answer the question when his Estimate comes before the House in the following May or June: &ldquo;Why did you not give the Parliamentary Secretary leave to go on?  Was it that you did not think, or that your colleagues in the Government did not think, that it was desirable to build more schools?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he could do a great public service in speeding up the programme of schoolbuilding by demonstrating to the Minister for Education that if he were given the job he could build many more schools than we are at present building.  I also suggest that he should not play altogether so neutral a role as it is suggested he must play.  I regard the Parliamentary Secretary as the architectural adviser in some degree to every Department of State and I want <Col N="73" /> him to offer the Minister for Education this advice: instead of pouring out money to build seven small inadequate schools in one parish, none of which can hope to have sufficient children to justify the employment of more than one teacher and perhaps one J.A.M., the Minister for Education should in co-operation with the parish priest offer instead to build one parish school in which the Parliamentary Secretary could undertake to provide amenities that would be quite impossible for him to consider in several scattered schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not urging the Parliamentary Secretary to appropriate more money for schools.  That is not within his functions but he is the architectural adviser.  I am suggesting to him that he should impress on the Minister for Education that you cannot provide reasonable amenities in seven schools none of which has sufficient children to occupy more than the principal teacher and a J.A.M. whereas if you concentrate them into one parish school and employ six or seven teachers you can have vast rooms in which you can segregate the children in first, second, third, fourth and fifth books&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What about transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  If I go into the question of transport the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be upset again.  There is not a school in the United States that has not got a school bus.  All you have to do is to hire some lad in rural Ireland and all he does is to go round the seven schools where you would have seven shelters.  He picks up the children there in the mornings <Col N="74" /> and takes them to school.  In the afternoons they are picked up at the school and he leaves them back at the shelters and they make their way home. There is not a rural area in the United States where that is not being done for the past 50 years.  The result is that you have rural schools worth looking at.</P>
      <P>This is one of the things which, being everybody's business, is nobody's business. The Minister for Education says: &ldquo;That's a matter for the Board of Works.&rdquo;  The Board of Work says: &ldquo;That is a matter for the Department of Education.&rdquo;  If you get the two of them together they say: &ldquo;That is not our business at all; it is the parish priest's business.&rdquo;  I have been round this circle continually.  Some day I want to meet a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister who will say: &ldquo;Find me a parish priest who will agree to have his parish served in that way and we will provide the services.&rdquo;  If the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary does that I will find the parish priest. Is that not a fair division of labour? If we do not face that prospect, we shall go on building a very large number of schools&mdash;and it is right to build them&mdash;but I think we are building them in the wrong way and the longer we go on doing that, the more difficult it will be ultimately to get the tangle straightened out.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to refer to the announcement that we are going to erect Government buildings here.  That decision has been taken.  We are going to extend these buildings, retain this debating chamber, which I think is a very good one, and, inasmuch as we have used it since the establishment of the State, it is acquiring a certain aura of venerableness, which it is appropriate to associate with the growth and history of the State of which we form part.  You remember all the abuse we used get because we scrapped the Fianna Fáil Government's plan to move to Phoenix Park?</P>

      <P>No, but some of the old buildings on the way out to Upper Merrion Street, the old buildings associated, I think, with the Museum, are to be demolished and an annexe is to be erected in exchange, I think, for portion of the Opposition building, which is to be incorporated in the Museum.  I think there is some general plan of that kind, some switching of the existing building into the National Museum and a section of the National Museum containing the ornithological section will be levelled and a suitable annexe to this building erected on the site.  That is probably a right decision and the Phoenix Park will still be there for the people to enjoy and we shall have all the accommodation we require where we are.</P>

      <P>In 1947, we had £50,000,000 sterling to spend on the poor of Dublin; we had countless millions to spend on sanatoria and we had countless millions to spend on hospitals which we urgently needed and we determined that it was right to house the poor and to heal the sick before we built a new Parliament in Phoenix Park.  I wonder were we wrong?  I do not think we were.  That is the decision I would make again in similar circumstances, if I had to do it.  As I walk the streets of Dublin now, and of Limerick and <Col N="76" /> Cork, and see the kind of flats in which the people are living, remembering the kind of houses from which we took them, I am proud we did not build the Parliament House in Phoenix Park until we lifted them out of the slums and provided the hospitals and sanatoria to heal the sick.  Now we find that we have been proved right.  Are not the follies of which we have cured Fianna Fáil in our time wonderful and how little credit we get for it.</P>

I am glad that it is now being found possible to provide on this site adequate services for us all, without withdrawing from the Phoenix Park a large part of the amenities which our people have become accustomed to enjoy.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will bear in mind the matters I have mentioned.  I want to thank him again, this time for the last time, for having started the clock.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Votes Nos. 8 and 9 are being taken together. One deals with drainage and the other with building.  Drainage in general is a big problem and one that has been tackled fairly well.  My anxiety in regard to drainage at present is that where it was being carried out, and where surveys have been completed in rivers and drains which were to be done, the Department are now moving away and they are not completing the job.  If our engineers decided at the start to do pegging and put down marks on drains and rivers, they must have decided that they had a bearing on drainage one way or another.  Drains and rivers on both sides of the Corrib have been pegged and the drainage is now nearing completion.  The area in particular from Newcastle in Galway, taking in the parishes of Moycullen, Killanin, Oughterard, Glan and part <Col N="77" /> of Cornamona, has been pegged, but, at the moment, I am afraid it is being by-passed.  The Parliamentary Secretary, coming from a county such as Donegal, in which arable land is very scarce, must realise that it was necessary to have the pegs put down so as to relieve flooding of arable land.  It is very necessary that that should be done in the poorer areas before moving away from them.  I hope he will carry out an investigation on that part of the Corrib which was pegged and which has not been done, to see what is wrong.</P>
      <P>The building of new schools is a tedious matter.  From time to time, one hears people complaining that the water tanks on these new schools are unsightly and should be discontinued. I do not agree with that because in every country district these water tanks are essential.  I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy MacCarthy that we should have sewage and water facilities in every national school.  These facilities are an essential contribution to the health of our children today.  There are several national schools which have piped water supplies near them on the main roads but which have not yet had this facility installed.  It is a job which should be done.</P>

      <P>The improvement of small harbours, slips and piers comes under this Vote.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department will not lose sight of the smaller piers and slips in the West.  Much more essential is that the harbours and piers at present being reconstructed are, in the majority, crying out for the provision of guiding lights so as to enable fishermen to land their catches.  They have been installed in the Donegal area but Galway is lagging behind. It is a couple of years since the problem of guiding lights was mooted for the entrance to Killeany Harbour, Aran Islands, but so far nothing has been done.  The approach is very rocky and dangerous at night <Col N="78" /> time and even if only one light were provided, it might save the lives of many fishermen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch spoke as if to suggest that so long as money was spent in Waterford, it did not matter about anywhere else.  I do not agree with that.  Finally, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will have an investigation carried out on the Corrib, where as I said, drains and rivers have been pegged and his staff at present seem to be moving away and leaving the position as it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice an increase under practically all of the headings in these Votes.  What I have noticed most is the increase for the reconstruction of Government Departments. I thought we had a policy whereby we were to have a certain degree of decentralisation.  Such a policy is not given effect to in this Vote in so far as the amount of money earmarked for the building and the retention of these departments in Dublin is concerned.  I know dozens of civil servants, some of them from Galway, who would like to get home in the event of a Department being decentralised.  Of course that is higher policy than that for which the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible.</P>
      <P>The question of the amount of money for different fishing harbours was raised.  Would the Minister indicate what amount is earmarked for Galway and whether that amount is included in the sum for the proposed harbour scheme for Galway in respect of which a certain figure has been mentioned?  I should like to know what proportion of that figure is to be used for fishery purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk in the past year or two about the transportation of horses to Belgium.  That is not the Parliamentary Secretary's responsibility but I wish to direct his attention to the conditions that prevail in regard to the loading of cattle from the Aran Islands.  It is primitive and constitutes a hazard to both man and beast.  It is about time the Board of Works remedied this situation.  What I have in mind is the extension of the piers at both Inishmaan and Inishere. <Col N="79" /> The present position is unfair both to the islanders and the tourist.</P>
    <P>In regard to tourists, I would press for expedition in the extension of the pier at Kilronan, Aran Islands.  For some years I have been asking to have this pier extended and any time I inquired I have been told it is under active consideration.  I suppose one can write that off as one of the typical phrases of the Board of Works in relation to its activities.</P>
    <P>I regret to note the small amount of money being spent on the Aran Islands. This is an up and coming tourist centre and one that is worthy of greater expenditure on repairs to roads.  If and when a road is done in these islands there should be a certain amount of tarring.  It is not very nice for the islanders or for visitors to have dust blowing up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Another matter to which I wish to direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention is the condition of the mill race embankments in Galway City.  This seems to be nobody's baby.  I raised this matter here before and I shall keep raising it until something is done by the only people whose responsibility it is, the Board of Works.  There was a Mill Race Committee but that Committee has gone by the board.  The embankments have deteriorated rapidly.  It should also be a matter for the Board of Works to cleanse some of the rivers around the same area.  Other Deputies mentioned the question of amenities.  The Board of Works should provide ball alleys in urban areas.  Where there are, say, housing schemes it is a very worthy expenditure.</P>

      <P>The difficulty about speaking on the Estimate for the Board of Works is that they are contractors for so many different Departments and have no direct responsibility. We are invariably ruled out of order but I shall do my best to keep within the confines of the debate.</P>
      <P>One of the most important activities in this country is drainage.  The difficulty in getting a proper drainage scheme is that so much drainage depends on main drainage.  The scheme the Parliamentary Secretary has put before us in his opening address covers only about four catchment areas.  I hasten to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that Wexford appears to be totally excluded from any form of drainage.  My colleague, Deputy Lynch, was kind enough to supply me with a list the other day in which I note the River Slaney is at the heel of the hunt.  I also note the Minister hopes to have the main catchment areas dealt with in 15 years' time. I would point out that, as the normal span of the life of Parliament in Ireland is five years, three Dála will have come and gone before Wexford can hope to have any satisfaction with regard to its flooding problems, because it is absolutely true to say that you cannot institute any drainage unless you deal with main drainage first of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty a Deputy must face is that numerous applications are made to him by people and by groups of farmers in different areas to have certain work carried out.  There is a river <Col N="81" /> whose name escapes me at the moment but which is in the vicinity of Wexford town and is due for drainage.  A great quantity of land is involved and the livelihood of many farmers is at stake. Since all main drainage in County Wexford, as in other counties, is dependent on the main drainage there does not appear to be any prospect of the Slaney being done for 15 years.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for a Parliamentary Secretary to tell us that four schemes of main drainage are to be initiated within the next 12 months. He may very well say he has not the staff or the material at his disposal.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with him in his difficulty because he is only a Parliamentary Secretary at the head of a section of what I consider to be a very important Department and he would not have the say that a Minister in control of a Department would have.  At the same time I do not see, and I have never been able to see, why the Board of Works should confine itself to main drainage. One of the functions of the Office of Public Works is to deal with flooding. If they confine themselves to main drainage, I do not see how they can possibly cope with the situation fully. Drainage comes under four or five different Departments.  The Department in control of main drainage should be in complete control of drainage.  They should have the final say on whether drainage should be done.  If a Deputy wants a job attended to, he must go to the Office of Public Works where he may be fobbed off and told it is not a main drainage job and that he should apply to the local authority.  The local authority then tell him they have no funds for it and that it is a matter for the Office of Public Works.  The Office of Public Works stand fast on the statement that they are obliged to do main drainage and no other form of drainage.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take another look at the whole question of drainage and consider whether it is not possible to have an over-riding scheme in his Department, even if it be necessary to sub-let some of the work to other people.</P>
    <P>If the Office of Public Works are responsible for the construction of <Col N="82" /> schools, of all Government buildings and of every type and condition of building, they can sub-let a contract to other people concerned with that trade. Why can they not do the same with drainage?  Why can they not sub-let it, where necessary?  In that way, we would have continuity in drainage work.  We would not have five or six different Departments trying to cope with drainage, with the net result that the water is drained off one farm and runs back to another farm.  Millions of pounds are wasted without achieving a final satisfactory result.</P>
    <P>The only person who can do that is the Parliamentary Secretary.  He can initiate a national scheme.  He must have the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  I hope that when he gets such sanction, my county will come in for some consideration and will not continue to be at the end of the list so far as everything of benefit that happens in this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is always the risk when you talk of Garda barracks that you may be ruled out of order.  The Minister for Justice generally answers questions on that matter.  The answer is almost always the same&mdash;that the barracks are under active consideration and that the question has been referred to the contractors for consideration.  I submit that on this occasion the contractors and the people responsible for constructing the Garda barracks are the Office of Public Works.  I do not like to blame the Office of Public Works directly for delays that may take place.  I very much appreciate that they are the Cinderella of the bureaucracy of this country.  They get the dirty end of the stick in most cases.  They are asked to do most of the jobs when the people concerned are ready to pass them over.</P>
    <P>I understand that a barracks in Enniscorthy has been handed over to the Office of Public Works for reconstruction. It is only a matter of time before the job is started.  I hope it will be completed as soon as possible.  That barracks has to be seen to be believed.  It is situated in a district with a population of 5,000. Talk about Dublin Castle falling down!  I hope it will not fall down <Col N="83" /> to-night.  That would be disastrous, as many Deputies might come to an untimely end at the reception.  The barracks in Enniscorthy is liable to fall down at any moment.  It is located in an important tourist centre. It is a living monument to inefficiency. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give immediate attention to the matter, always provided the Department of Justice have passed it over, as I understand is the case.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says we shall have a new Department of Social Welfare.  That puzzles me.  It is one of these grandiose schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Department will be newly housed.  Some years ago, the building in Store Street was erected and shared between C.I.E. and the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department of Social Welfare, which was scattered all over Dublin, was gathered into one place. What has happened since?  They must all be shifted.  What is the cause of that and what will the new building cost?  There is no mention of the cost in the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement.  If it is anything on the lines of the cost of the building in Store Street&mdash;and judging by the increase in social welfare work, it looks as if it will be a pretty sizable building&mdash;the cost will run into hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Is it necessary to do this?  Have C.I.E. specifically demanded that the Department of Social Welfare should get out of the building in which the Department is now housed?  Do they want the premises concerned?  It is not as if the Department of Social Welfare were housed in an out-of-date building. It is housed in one of the most modern buildings in the city.  The building has air conditioning, lifts and every modern contrivance.</P>

      <P>I was substantiating my case by saying the building in Store Street is eminently satisfactory.  One might argue that the Custom House is not a modern building. One has to climb to the fourth or fifth floor, without a lift and one does not know if one is in the Department of Health or in the Department of Local Government.  This new project is a grandiose scheme.  The money could be put to more profitable use.  I assume the money will come out of the Vote for the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Recently a group of Europeans visited this country.  They were impressed by our wealth of ancient castles and monuments.  They said we were singularly fortunate in that regard because we had not gone through the great upheavals so many other European countries have experienced. In the past 30 years other countries suffered a major conflict and many such monuments were destroyed.  We have had practically no upheaval since the days of Cromwell except an odd bit of fighting among ourselves now and again which was trivial.  They could not understand why we did not expend more money preserving these historic shrines we have here.</P>
      <P>Again, I know I am pushing an open door when I talk to the Parliamentary Secretary on this subject.  I know he feels himself rather restricted in that he has not at his disposal the money to do what he wants to do.  It is only right that Deputies should make that point.  We are, perhaps, far behind anybody else in the preservation of the historic monuments which mean so much to every country.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will have the support of Deputies from all sides if he makes a strong case for a much bigger Vote next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of harbours is a difficult one.  I see the Chair looking anxiously at me again when I mention <Col N="85" /> harbours.  The difficulty about harbours is that if a person wants to say anything about them on the Fishery Estimate, he is ruled out of order because the Board of Works propose the construction of harbours but the Fisheries Department decide where the harbours are to be.  The Parliamentary Secretary himself mentioned harbours in his opening statement.  Although we have quite considerable fishing in Wexford and although Kilmore Harbour has been crying out for some sort of protection for the fishing boats there&mdash;in fact, so much so that many of the fishermen have had to give up fishing and emigrate&mdash;there is not a word about it in this Estimate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch complained about his constituency as well.  I agree, but at least he has got some little thing for Passage East, which is in Waterford, but we have got nothing at all.  There are more fishing boats in that area than anywhere else.  If there is to be cohesion between the different Departments and if there is to be a successful development of harbours for the purpose of expanding the fishing industry, you have got to build harbours where the fish are.  The actual harbours mentioned here for development as major fishery harbours are: Castletownbere, Galway, Howth, Killybegs and Passage East.</P>

      <P>This Estimate covers a great many fields.  Speaking on it last year, I mentioned that I thought a good deal of our failure to do the things we had to do was due to shortage of staff.  I said I had in mind the question of trained personnel, both engineering and architectural.  I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary in his opening remarks referred to the provision of extra architectural and engineering staff.  He said that, as a result, it was hoped there would be a more rapid progress in respect of the programme of work for which the Office was catering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later on, in regard to subhead C., reference is made to a shortage of staff to deal with the work in that section. <Col N="87" /> I take it the same supervisory staff operate in this instance as operate in respect of public works and buildings, particularly schools and Garda stations?  The Minister for Education mentioned a target of approximately 100 new schools per year.  Education is one sphere in which the Office of Public Works plays a large part, because the building of schools is dealt with, in the main, by that Office.</P>
    <P>In connection with the school building programme, two figures are given for reference.  One is that, since the establishment of the State, over 1,400 new schools have been erected and improvements carried out to 1,500. The second figure relates to an eight-year period ending on the 31st March this year and shows that 536 new schools were built.  In one case, you have an average of 56 new schools per year since the establishment of the State and then, in the eight-year period of recent times from 1953 to 1961, the average is something like 61 new schools.  That leaves quite a considerable gap between the average <Col N="88" /> attained and the target set of 100 new schools per year.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says we will have caught up in ten years' time. In previous debates, we have held on to this business of a ten-year period. It is to be sincerely hoped that the target of the Minister for Education of 100 schools per year will be attained.  In the provision of school buildings, we are dealing with the generation of young people who, in ten years, will have passed from the benefits that could be conferred on them by proper building, proper surroundings and proper sanitary conditions.</P>
