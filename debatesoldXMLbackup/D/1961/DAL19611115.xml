    <Title>National Loan, 1961. - Statement by Minister for Finance.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that a new National Loan to be known as Exchequer Stock will open for subscription on Monday next, 20th November. The Loan will be for £17½ million, but £3½ million of the stock is being allotted to certain life assurance offices so that the amount available for public subscription will be £14 million which will be underwritten jointly by the Banks and the Government.</P>
      <P>The rate of interest will be 6 per cent. per annum and the price £97 for each £100 of stock purchased, so that the annual return on each £100 of cash invested in the Stock will be £6 3s. 8d.  The Stock will be redeemed at par not later than 1985 and may be redeemed at any time from December, 1980.  As the issue is being made at a discount, there will be a capital gain of £3 per cent. on redemption and this will be tax-free to the ordinary investor.  The yield of the Stock to final redemption in 1985, taking this capital gain into account, will be £6 4s. 9d. per cent.</P>
      <P>As the Loan will carry the same terms as to interest and redemption as the 6 per cent.  Exchequer Stock issued last year, it will be amalgamated with last year's issue after the first interest payment is made next June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The usual provision is made in the Prospectus whereby only 10 per cent. of the purchase price need be paid on application, the remainder being paid <Col N="134" /> in three further instalments spread over the period until late January.  This should facilitate investors in taking up stock.  On the other hand, those who wish to pay the full amount on application next week, or to complete their subscription on allotment in December, will be entitled to discount equivalent to an interest rate of 6 per cent. on the advance payments.</P>
    <P>The tax privileges attached to recent National Loans are again included. Interest will be paid without deduction of income tax at source, but, of course, holders will, if ordinarily resident in the State, be liable for whatever tax on the interest is appropriate to their respective incomes.  Stock of the issue will be accepted at its nominal value as the equivalent of cash in satisfaction of death duties on properties of which it formed a part.  The stock and the interest on it will be exempt from all Irish taxation, present and future, if owned by a person neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <P>The issue is being made under the authority of the Appropriation Act, 1961, and other statutes.  Both principal and interest will be a charge on the Central Fund.  The attractive interest rate it carries, its status as a trustee security, the concession whereby it will be accepted in payment of death duties and the substantial sinking fund allocations should ensure that the stock will always have a high market value. The Government stockbroker will at all times be prepared to buy and sell reasonable amounts of the stock, and this will help to maintain an active market in it.</P>
    <P>The 3¼% National Security Loan, 1956-61, is due for redemption on 1st December next.  There is £4.7 million of that stock outstanding and I am giving holders an option of converting into the present issue.  This is a very attractive offer and I hope it will be availed of to a large extent.  Stock of the new loan issued under this conversion arrangement will be additional to the stock issued for cash.</P>
    <P>£2½ million of the stock will also be issued to Departmental Funds in conversion of Ways and Means Advances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> The Loan is required to assist in the financing of State capital outlay on agriculture and industry; on housing, sanitary services and schools; on afforestation and fuel resources; on transport and on other development schemes in pursuance of the Programme for Economic Expansion outlined in the Government White Paper published in November, 1958.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are well aware, the main source of capital for economic expansion must continue to be the people's savings.  It is only by applying the maximum amount of resources to productive purposes at home that we can increase employment and raise living standards.  I should like, therefore, to emphasise once again the importance of a high level of savings. The new Loan gives an excellent opportunity for the investment of savings and subscribers to it will be doing their part to promote the development of the national economy while at the same time securing for themselves a safe investment and a very attractive return on their capital.</P>
    <P>The Prospectus of the issue will be published in tomorrow morning's newspapers.  Copies of the Prospectus with the application form for cash subscriptions attached will also be available as from tomorrow from any bank, stockbroker or post office.  The lists will close not later than Friday, 24th November.</P>
    <P>I confidently ask for the full and active support of every Deputy in the House for the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of a National Loan is a matter of national importance and one, therefore, which, no matter what differences there may be between the various Parties, should not be considered on a Party basis. Certainly we shall not so consider it on this occasion nor, indeed, have we ever done so on any occasion.  We support wholeheartedly the appeal of the Minister for Finance for support for this loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the Minister's statement, the loan is in fact an issue of £20 million with £2½ million being <Col N="136" /> taken up by Departmental Funds leaving £17½ million for the public, of which some portion is being taken up otherwise, so that about £14 million is the amount which the public is being asked to subscribe.  That subscription is being requested at a rate which, if not the highest, is one of the highest that ever has been offered.  Six per cent at 97 is a very generous return even with present day market returns and certainly is one that should draw very substantial support from those who have funds to invest.  The effective yield as it is at £6 3s. 8d. for income purposes with £3 capital redemption is one that everyone must appreciate is well worth while.  We support the loan seeing, as the Minister has said, that it is for productive purposes.</P>
    <P>On many occasions before we have made it clear from this side of the House that we are in favour of a high capital productive programme, in fact, in the words I think we used on many occasions before, the highest capital productive programme that the people will support.  This is one of the occasions upon which the people, therefore, are being asked to support a capital development programme for purposes which the Minister has outlined, which capital programme, no matter by what Government it is introduced, is the only method by which we can improve living standards for the community as a whole.  We will have to depend on our own efforts, on our own exertions and on our own development based on and supported by, as we in Fine Gael have said on many occasions and are glad to say again, the response of our own people from their savings to national productive loans when they are announced by whoever may be Minister at the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I want to welcome this loan and to commend its terms to potential investors.  The terms of the loan are attractive, not merely to large investors but to small investors as well and I trust their collective sense of acumen and their degree of sagacity will ensure that the loan will be fully subscribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> It is a truism to say that the best way of financing national development is by reliance on the savings of our own people and every country that has attained a commendable status in the world has had to travel that road and has travelled it profitably. A national loan financed by the savings of our own people promotes national morale and it helps to develop in our own people a sturdy sense of independence and security.  It does something more than that.  It avoids the undesirable complications which can arise from time to time in the case of countries which engage in heavy overseas borrowing.  If we are to attain and maintain here the standards of a first-class nation then national development must go on to the uttermost limits of the capacity of the people and the nation generally.</P>
    <P>I think all Parties in the House will vie with one another in commending schemes of capital development which will enrich the national estate, on the one hand, and raise the living standards of the people on the other hand. Therefore whatever political differences there may be between Parties in this House or on the hustings, there is no difference when it comes to recognising the fundamental necessity for continued national development on the highest possible scale.  I commend this loan to potential investors and I hope it will be fully subscribed very shortly after the subscription lists have been opened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>On a previous occasion when a loan was floated I heard quite a number of complaints from small investors in distant parts of the country that they did not have a chance to subscribe to the loan.  Very often their applications are turned down because the list is over subscribed by the time their applications are received. While giving support to the Minister in the floating of this loan, particularly having regard to the objects he has outlined, I would ask him to make some provision for the smaller investors and also to take account of the fact that people in distant parts of the country may not be able to make arrangements with the banks where they have their savings lodged to have them transferred into the loan as quickly as those near <Col N="138" /> the bigger centres of population such as Dublin and other cities.</P>
      <P>I should also like to suggest to the Minister and the Government that they should utilise this loan for the purpose of giving employment in the poorer areas where there is a good deal of emigration because there is no employment to fill in the spare time of the small farmers.  A lot of development work could be undertaken.  I did notice the Minister omitted to mention that this money would be used for drainage. Perhaps the Government would reconsider that and give some employment in these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we go on to Questions I should like to draw to the attention of the House the fact that there is a very large number of questions listed.  Under the Rules of the House only one hour may be allowed for Questions today and I think it would be generally regarded as desirable that we should agree to suspend that Rule so that two hours may be given to Questions today, the balance of them to be taken tomorrow.  Subject to the progress we make today it may be desirable to order Questions at 2 p.m. tomorrow instead of 3 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the proposal suggested by the Taoiseach that two hours be given to Questions today if that is acceptable to the House.  The Taoiseach suggests that Questions should be taken at 2 p.m. tomorrow instead of 3 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the normal practice is to take them at 3 p.m. If the Taoiseach would leave that proposal until we see what agreement we can reach having devoted two hours to Questions today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is agreed <Col N="139" /> to devote two hours to Questions to-day. May I direct the attention of Members to the fact that, though the time for Questions is extended to two hours, there is an abnormally high number of Questions to be disposed of in that period.  I would therefore request Members to be as economical as possible in their use of supplementary questions.  Standing Orders provide that the Chair may determine the number of supplementaries but the Chair at all times prefers Members to restrict themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is correct to say I gave the Deputy an <Col N="140" /> undertaking.  I gave the Deputy the Commission's estimate as to when it might produce its report.  This is, of course, a voluntary commission and cannot be dragooned by the Government. There is this to be said, that I found on inquiry the Commission were handicapped in the drafting of the report by the fact that their Secretary had been taken for other duties in connection with his official position in the Civil Service.

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he proposes to publish a further White Paper expanding, correcting (where necessary) and bringing up to date the material in the White Paper already published in connection with the Common Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the White Paper on the European Economic Community presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas on 30th June last, it was indicated that, if significant amendments to the information contained therein proved to be necessary, they would be brought to notice in later Government statements.  I do not consider that the extent of the revision required would warrant the preparation of a further White Paper at this juncture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> As soon as negotiations arising out of our application for membership of the Community have been brought to a stage at which draft terms of accession can be outlined, arrangements will be made to make available to Deputies all necessary information as a basis for discussion by the Dáil of the decision proposed by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the appendices to the White Paper contain some information that is clearly inaccurate now?  In regard to the comparison of prices here and prices in the various countries of the Six, certain things have not been compared like with like.  In relation to sugar, for example, there has not been the same comparison as regards the terms of obtaining pulp, wet or dry, and as regards the terms of transport. Would it not be desirable now that, instead of the hurried product which was then made, there would be a more mature and considered White Paper circulated so that the House and the country would be in a position, after January, to have informed information ready for that discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that prices fluctuate from time to time.  If any Deputy wishes to get the available information regarding the price of any commodity he will certainly be facilitated by means of Parliamentary Questions.  With regard to the development of the arrangements of the European Economic Community, there has been no change of substance since the White Paper was published which would justify the preparation of another White Paper now. By and large, the information in the White Paper is still accurate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The suggestion implicit in Deputy Sweetman's question that there has hitherto been some failure to recognise that the European Economic Community has political as well as economic aims is not correct.  I have directed the attention of Deputies to these political aspects on a number of occasions both in this House and elsewhere and would refer the Deputy particularly to what I said here on the 5th July and the 2nd August last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these and other statements I have tried to make it clear that the founders of the European Economic Community have set themselves the wider aim of fostering European unity and that they regarded the Rome Treaty as a step towards this end.  This aim is defined only in vague terms in the Preamble to the Treaty of Rome, in which the signatories declare their resolve to establish the foundations of an ever-closer union among the European peoples and, by combining <Col N="143" /> their resources, to strengthen the safeguards of peace and liberty, and in which they call upon other European peoples who share their ideal to join their efforts.  There is no doubt, however, that the member countries of the Community regard it as essential that all applicants for membership should be willing to co-operate with them without qualification for the attainment of these wider objectives.  In our application for membership, we stated our acceptance of the ideals which inspired the Rome Treaty and of its aims.</P>
    <P>As to the precise political implications of membership of the Community, it is not possible to be definitive at the present moment.  Deputies will, however, be aware from the declaration issued after the Bonn meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the Six on the 18th July last that they then decided to give statutory form to their co-operation in political and other fields.  That instrument is at present being negotiated, and it is not yet possible to say what exactly it may contain. It is already clear, however, that it will provide for close consultation and co-operation between its signatories over a wide field, including foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The question has frequently been raised in the House as to whether membership of NATO is a condition of membership of the European Economic Community.  We have no reason whatever to think that this is so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that his undertaking that we would co-operate without qualification for the achievement of certain political objectives concerned with foreign policy, could imply our cession of bases here for NATO, if that is asked from us by the NATO powers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach give me an undertaking that if, at any time during the negotiations in regard to the Common Market, it is made clear to him that association with or <Col N="144" /> membership of the Common Market would mean that we must accept any undertaking in regard to NATO alliance, he would first tell the Dáil that that clear implication was there and that he will allow the country to decide for itself whether it wanted to accept any such implications, before the Government take a final decision in the matter?</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in view of the widespread belief that certain European countries were hostile to the application of this country to join the European Economic Community on account of its policy of neutrality, he considers that pressure will be put on Ireland to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation as a condition of full membership of the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions numbers 8, 9 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen no indication of any public anxiety about the possible effect of full membership of the European Economic Community on our present <Col N="145" /> foreign policy.  As to the extent to which that policy might be affected by the political implications of joining the Community, it would not be possible to say anything definite until we know more precisely what these implications are.  On this point and on the question of joining NATO, I would refer the Deputies to my reply today to Questions numbers 5, 6 and 7.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some press reports have suggested that certain member countries of the Community were hostile to our application for membership. According to the information available to me, however, these reports were not correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, from what the Taoiseach said in reply to the previous questions, that the political objectives or aims of the Common Market countries are pretty general and, one might say, vague.  I think it would be right to assume that if this country becomes a member of what has been termed the Common Market group we will also have a say in the framing of policy in respect of what we describe as the political objectives or aims of the Common Market countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That raises a very wide question.  The position, as I understand it, is that the meeting of the Six in Bonn, to which I have referred and which took place in July last, discussed the preparation of a statement which would express these objectives.  A committee, which was set up for that purpose, is still functioning.  According to press reports it has not made very great progress as yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it as clear as it is possible to make it.  There is no foundation for the suggestion that I am aware of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I am making it quite clear that membership of the European Economic Community implies acceptance of certain political objectives.  These political objectives have not yet been precisely defined and nobody is in a position to state authoritatively what they are.  I think it is extremely likely that they will be defined in a more precise form before we have to take a final decision on membership of EEC.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach what steps are being taken (1) to prepare the economy for this country's entry into the Common Market, and (2) to deal with the problems which may arise as a result of its adherence to the Common Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions numbers 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>The White Paper published at the end of June last gave the public an outline of the provisions of the Treaty of Rome and of the proposals for a common agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the arrangements which I announced in the Dáil on the 5th July last, the Committee on Industrial Organisation, on which are represented the Department of Finance, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Federation of Irish Industries, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers, is carrying out a comprehensive survey of the industrial sector directed towards an examination of the difficulties that may be created for industry as a result of our entry into the Common Market and the formulation of positive measures of adjustment and adaptation.  A similar survey is being arranged for those industries which are directly based on agriculture and which would have to operate in conditions somewhat different from those prevailing in the industrial sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other aspects of the Common Market, including the proposals for a common agricultural policy, are the subject of continuous study by the Departments concerned in the light of <Col N="148" /> the progress being made towards the implementation of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce has frequent meetings with individual firms, with groups of firms and with industrial organisations to discuss the general and particular implications of membership of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture has had discussions with representatives of agricultural organisations on the subject of the EEC Commission's proposals for a common agricultural policy, and arrangements are being made, in co-operation with those organisations and with the processing and marketing interests concerned, for detailed studies on a product-by-product basis of the implications of that policy.</P>
    <P>In addition, the revision of the Programme for Economic Expansion which has been put in hands will take account of the new environment in which the economy will have to operate in the event of our becoming a member of the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, does it not strike him as somewhat incongruous, with all these alleged consultations proceeding, that one body which does not seem to have the benefit of any such consultations or sources of information is Oireachtas Éireann which, in the last analysis, must take the final decision? Does the Taoiseach realise that, while the process of Parliamentary Question and answer does elicit certain information, the necessity for Deputies generally to be informed of all the implications of a fluid and developing situation is growing daily more urgent if this House and the Seanad are to give an intelligent consideration to any proposals that the Government may ultimately formulate in regard to Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy has in mind.  In so far as his question relates to the investigations and inquiries which are going on about the measures that might be needed to adapt the national economy to the new situation, it is not possible yet to give <Col N="149" /> the Oireachtas any information because these inquiries are in progress.  It is certainly intended that the outcome of these inquiries will be publicised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I had in mind was this: in view of the exhaustive nature of the consultations that ought to be taking place, and that may be taking place for all I know, with the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Agriculture and the other appropriate Departments and the various interests concerned, would it not be eminently desirable that there should be some committee representative of the Oireachtas which, from time to time, could inform itself in a more detailed way than is practicable by Parliamentary Question and answer, through having the power to send for administrative heads of Departments or Ministers and discussing specific aspects of the discussions to which the Taoiseach refers?  I give a case in point.  A committee of this House, if it could get detailed information of the implications for agriculture, could approach the whole question, when the Government wish to have it discussed exhaustively in Dáil Éireann, in a more intelligent way than if they are speculating on what the real prospects are. I would suggest to the Taoiseach that he might consider the possibility or practicability of a joint committee of this House and the Seanad to act as a liaison with the negotiations that are proceeding so that all may be fully informed in preparation for the occasion when a final decision must be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the course suggested by the Deputy requires very careful consideration because it has some doubtful implications but, in so far as agriculture is concerned, the Deputy will appreciate that the definition of the Common Agricultural Policy of the Community is by no means complete.  Indeed, the Council of the Community is, I think, meeting now to try to resolve certain disagreements which have arisen in that regard, and when it will be possible to give the House a more precise definition of the Community's policy it is impossible to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach <Col N="150" /> if he would indicate what procedure should be adopted by the trade union or by the individual firm which has views in respect of the impact of the Common Market on a particular industry to bring these views to the notice of this Committee on Industrial Organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That has all been arranged.  I met the representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and arranged a procedure which will ensure that individual trade unions as well as the Congress can be brought fully into consultation whenever it appears that their interests are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach say &ldquo;is being arranged&rdquo; or &ldquo;has been arranged&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Has been arranged and, indeed, there was a press announcement regarding this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a firm which is not in an industrial group what does it do?  Can it transmit its views to anybody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These investigations are proceeding in respect of a number of industries at present but it will be some time before all the industries that require examination will have been covered, but as each industry is made subject to survey and as proposals relating to it are being formulated, the particular trade unions that are concerned with that industry will be given a full opportunity to express their views in regard to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this not highlight the need for some liaison body between this Oireachtas and the departmental machinery to know what is going on when a leading member of the Labour Party is not fully informed as to the facilities available to trade unions to communicate with the committee to which the Taoiseach has referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out to Deputy Norton, these arrangements were fully publicised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will now <Col N="151" /> realise that as far as myself, deeply concerned for agriculture, and Deputy Norton intimately associated with trade union business, are concerned, a situation can arise that both of us, giving as much attention to the problems as we can, can find ourselves without the information which I think is indispensable to reasonable consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it expected that a general conclusion of these arrangements will have taken place before the Taoiseach enters into negotiations in January?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As far as industry is concerned, the investigations are likely to take a considerable time, although I gather the first reports may be available in a matter of some weeks.  So far as agriculture is concerned, the position is, as I have explained to Deputy Dillon, that there is still a great deal of doubt as to what form the common agricultural policy of the Community may finally take in respect of a number of commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if in the event of Ireland being admitted to the European Economic Community any constitutional changes or amendments will be necessary; and, if so, if he will indicate generally the nature of the proposed changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the reply which I gave to a question addressed to me in this House on the 2nd August last, I indicated that the implications of the Rome Treaty from the point of view of the Constitution were being considered.  A full study has been made of the text of the Treaty, but, before a final opinion can be arrived at, it will be necessary to have more information about the way in which certain of its provisions are to be implemented. I am not at present satisfied that the Treaty cannot be operated within the framework of the Constitution as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the negotiations which we anticipate will arise out of our application for membership of the European Economic Community, the nature and extent of our obligations <Col N="152" /> under the Rome Treaty will be ascertained, and, if it is found that any of these obligations are in conflict with the Constitution as it stands, consideration must be given to effecting any necessary amendment of the Constitution. It is too early to indicate, even in a general way, the nature of possible amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it if one of the conditions turns out to be association with, or membership of, NATO, or any obligations to NATO as a pre-condition of membership, the Dáil will be told of this fact as soon as the Government become aware of it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that certain left wing papers in Britain are propagating the view that the European Economic Community is merely an economic development of the NATO alliance.  I think the people of this country know full well the purpose behind that suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach let us know&mdash;yes or no&mdash;whether we become members of NATO because we are members of the Common Market? That is a simple question, requiring a simple answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am accepting that as a reply to an earlier question but what I want to know now is: will the Taoiseach inform the Dáil as soon as he becomes aware that that is such a pre-condition?  Is it not a fact that the only use we have as an undeveloped and underdeveloped society after 40 years of mis-government is merely as a base for the NATO alliance? Is that not a fact?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement regarding Ireland's application for admission to the European Common Market with special reference as to when the conditions of admission are likely to be known; whether the information at present available to the Government is such that Ireland may be offered admission as a full member or as an associate member; and, if so, what are the Government's views on such proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have applied for membership under Article 237 of the Rome Treaty, which states that &ldquo;any European State may apply to become a member of the Community.&rdquo; In accord with the provisions of the Treaty, the Council of Ministers, on receiving our application, asked the European Commission for its opinion on it.  While we have not seen the precise text of their comment, we understand that the Commission, while adverting to the obligations of the Treaty, expressed much the same view in regard to our application as in the case of the applications from Britain and Denmark, which was to the effect that they could not pronounce on the applications on the data available.  The Council of Ministers have since proposed a meeting with the Irish Government in January to exchange views on the special problems raised by our application and the consequences to be drawn therefrom and also to discuss certain questions of procedure, this meeting to be followed by negotiations proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of these negotiations is to determine, in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 237 of the Rome Treaty, the conditions of admission and the adaptations required in the Treaty.  I expect that we shall have a better idea of the conditions of admission after the meeting which we are to have in Brussels with representatives of the Six Member Governments in <Col N="154" /> January, but we shall not, of course, know the precise conditions until the negotiations proper, which are to follow that meeting, have been completed. In view of the important position that Britain holds in our external trade, the conditions of membership to be accorded to Britain will be of major concern to us, and, indeed, our terms of accession can hardly be put in final shape&mdash;nor would we want them to be&mdash;until information is available about Britain's terms, which, it is thought, are not likely to be known until well into 1962.  We will, of course, endeavour to ensure that our negotiations will be so arranged that our entrance into the Community can take place simultaneously with Britain.</P>
    <P>As regards the concluding parts of the Deputy's question, I would point out that the Treaty provides for membership on the part of European countries or for association between any country and the Community.  The Government decided to apply for membership, and we, naturally, hope that we shall secure it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have already expressed the view that the questions were likely to relate to our capacity to accept the obligations of membership without being, as a member, an impediment to the development of the economic aims of the Community.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certain&mdash;and I have so stated on many occasions in public&mdash;that the abolition of import tariffs could create difficulties for some existing industries.  On the other hand, access on a tariff-free basis to wider markets in Europe can assist the growth and encourage the establishment of other industries.  While the difficulties of the transition period will be substantial, it is not accepted that the rate of industrialisation will necessarily be reduced.  In the case of those industries for which protection is important, investigations are at present in progress to determine the measures which may be needed to enable them to adapt themselves to the eventual withdrawal of tariffs.</P>

      <P>The approach to the Member Governments of the E.E.C. of which I informed the Dáil on 5th July was not in any sense an application for membership of the Community. It was designed primarily to inform the individual Governments concerned that we were considering applying for membership of the Community in the event of Britain deciding to do so, and, at the same time, to draw attention to certain aspects of our economic position, in the hope, as I then said, that it would get us &ldquo;a clearer view of the realities of the situation and the specific implications for Ireland of membership of the Community&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>At the suggestion of the Irish Government, consideration of our application for accession to the GATT has been deferred for the present.  There are problems common to this application and to our application for membership of the European Economic Community, and we feel that it would be advisable to await developments on the latter application before resuming negotiations with the GATT.</P>

      <P>The particular difficulty in our accession to GATT is the existence of a preferential system of trading here.  Obviously that is also involved in the discussions with the European Economic Community. There is the further practical consideration that the personnel available to deal with all these negotiations is fully extended at the present time.</P>

      <P>It is estimated on the basis of the retail price index numbers that £1 at mid-August, 1961 (the latest date for which the index is calculated) would purchase the same quantum of goods and services at retail prices as would 7/1 in the year 1930, 8/6 in the year 1940 and 13/5 in the year 1950.  The appropriate index numbers are not available for the years 1910 and 1920 and corresponding estimates for these years cannot therefore be made.  The information available suggests that retail prices rose by about 4 per cent. between 1910 and 1914 (the base year for the first series of retail price index numbers) and by about 150 per cent. between 1914 and 1920.  On the assumption that these figures are correct the relevant estimates for 1910 and 1920 would be 4/- and 10/5 respectively.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report, a statement showing (a) the national average retail prices of certain items of food in mid-February, 1957 and mid-August, 1961 (the latest available date), and the difference between them, and (b) the percentage change in prices of all items entering into the Consumer Price Index between the two periods.  In the case of items, other than certain food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful.  The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive enquiries.  Price quotations <Col N="159" /> in respect of some items of food are not available from all centres at each enquiry and the figures for the percentage changes in these prices as given in (b), computed in such a way as to eliminate the effect of differences in coverage, may differ slightly from <Col N="160" /> the percentages calculated from (a).  In comparing prices at mid-February and mid-August, it must be remembered that prices of certain food items fluctuate seasonally and that allowance must be made for this factor.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)  National Average Retail Prices of Food at mid-February, 1957 and mid-August, 1961 and the difference between them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the ultimate success of the United Nations mission in the Congo the two outstanding events since the 1st August were, firstly, the re-establishment of the Central Government with the participation of the two break-away Provinces of Orientale and Kasai; secondly, the address by Mr. Tshombe on the 28th August in which he said &ldquo;In implementation of the Security Council's resolutions of 21 February 1961, the United Nations is at present engaged in withdrawing military personnel of foreign nationality serving in the Katanga <i>gendarmerie.</i> The government bows to the decisions of the United Nations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A detailed account of the events which took place since 1st August will be found in the &ldquo;Report of the Officer-in-charge of the U.N. operation in Congo and the addenda thereto&rdquo; which I have placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Corish's request for an outline of the present position, I may say it appears to be more hopeful than at any time in the last sixteen months.  It now appears likely that the Congolese leaders are convinced of the necessity of negotiating a peaceful solution to the problems of unity and co-operation. The foreign support which was behind the Orientale and Kasai Provinces in declaring their independence of the Central Government seems to have been practically eliminated. <Col N="168" /> The foreign mercenaries which were the principal support of the Katanga break-away seem likely to leave before long, as many of the influences which supported their interference in Congolese affairs now see that the only hope of democratic government and peaceful progress in the Congo is reconciliation and unity.</P>
    <P>In view of the lack of administrative experience and of internal antagonisms, I have no doubt there will be setbacks on the road to peace and unity even in the absence of the foreign influences which hitherto supported disunity. Having regard, however, to what has already been achieved, I am more than ever convinced, despite all the difficulties which still confront the Congolese people, that if the United Nations efforts to eliminate foreign intervention are firmly supported by the States who wish to seek peace, order and democratic government, unity and co-operation can be obtained through the peaceful reconciliation of all sections of the Congolese leaders.  To help create the conditions for this reconciliation has always been the sole aim of the United Nations, and its representatives are at present endeavouring to bring about a meeting between Premier Adoula and Mr. Tshombe and are hopeful of success.</P>
    <P>As the Dáil has discussed and approved the sending of military contingents to the Congo, I see no reason for another discussion before the departure of the contingents which are going to replace those who are due to return in the next few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all reiterate what the Minister has said about the universal desire to see peace and order in the Congo.  However, the Minister will appreciate the concern of the people of this country for the Irish soldiers out there, especially their concern at the events that took place there at the beginning of September.  I am sure the Minister himself would be the first to admit that only very sketchy information trickled into this country in regard to the welfare of the Irish soldiers.  It was for that reason that I asked him in the second part of my Question to make a statement with <Col N="169" /> particular reference to the Irish troops at present serving in the Congo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is good enough.  We would all be glad to see the majority of them home. What we are concerned about are the events in the first weeks of September, why there was such a trickle of information at that period and why it was necessary for the Minister to travel 6,000 or 7,000 miles to find out what was happening, especially in view of the fact that it was suggested from these Benches on one occasion to the Minister that there should be a liaison officer between the troops in the Congo and the Government to keep them abreast of the information available. We did not seem to have that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that the Irish people were kept fully informed of what was happening to the Irish troops so far as casualties and so on were concerned, but they were being bombarded by a vicious propaganda which tried to make out they were all slaughtered.  The people were being told that 67 were supposed to have been slaughtered in Jadotville. We told the Irish people that only five had been wounded, but this propaganda was repeated day after day and many people said there could not be all this smoke without a great deal of fire.</P>
      <P>As to the details of the events in the Congo, I refer the Deputy and the other Deputies to the reports of the UN Special Representative in the Congo, which are in the Library.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister intends to suggest, or that anyone accepts, that the type of propaganda which he speaks about was engaged in by Irish newspapers, but they did report, maybe in vague terms, heavy casualties in the Congo. If my memory serves me correctly, there was also some announcement by Radio Eireann to the effect that there had been heavy casualties.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply and before emphasising the aspect of his reply dealing with approving the sending of military contingents to the Congo&mdash;I appreciate that the Government have provided as much information as it was possible for them to provide and I do not propose to deal with that now&mdash;I want to ask the Minister this question, arising out of the general matter that has been raised: can he reassure this House that, in the heel of the hunt, we shall not be faced with the situation that a representative of the Cominform, in the person of Mr. Gizenga, has taken over with our help and will then be vested with authority to slit the throat of anyone who is not prepared to carry the hammer and sickle on his standard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that there was a particular situation in Orientale, of which Stanleyville is the capital, where Mr. Gizenga was the local Prime Minister. He associated himself with Kasai, another breakaway province.  However, both joined in the setting up of the Central Government.  As I understand it, he has since gone back to Stanleyville instead of taking over Leopoldville. I hope that is only temporary and that he and all the other break-away provinces will co-operate in the establishment of a government of unity in the Congo.  That would be the greatest success for democracy and peace that could be won.</P>

      <P>I have been in consultation with the British Government as to the extent to which the proposed legislation will apply in practice to immigration from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the exceptional situation <Col N="173" /> which arose out of the last war, there has always been complete freedom of movement of persons between the two countries.  As this means that there is no immigration restriction on persons, whatever their nationality, traveling from one country to the other, the system requires uniformity in the control of immigration to each country from third countries.</P>
    <P>The present freedom of movement between the two countries is to their mutual advantage and I hope that the consultations taking place will lead to its being maintained.  Its maintenance would, of course, require the introduction of legislation here in order to preserve uniformity of control.</P>

      <P>Since the injury to health caused by radio-active fallout depends upon the total weight rather than on the number of nuclear explosions, I may say that the latest estimate I have seen of the weight of nuclear bombs exploded by the various powers was issued by the U.S. Government on 30th October.

    <P>In regard to the second part of the Deputies' question the United Nations protest did not, as Deputies are aware, stop the U.S.S.R. from exploding <Col N="175" /> the 50 megaton bomb and other bombs and there is of course the danger that other countries may feel themselves constrained to conduct further tests in order to ensure that they are not outdistanced in technical development of nuclear weapons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the reference to &ldquo;guardians' tickets&rdquo; is to directions issued by authorised persons under Article 16 of the General Medical Services Regulations, 1954.  These directions are normally intended to enable persons in the lower income group who have not provided themselves with medical cards to avail themselves of the services of the district medical officer immediately the need arises if the persons concerned cannot wait until the health authority have decided on their eligibility for a card.</P>
      <P>As the information requested in the first two parts of the question is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The table shows that while, in the period mentioned, no directions were issued in Kinsale, Bandon or Macroom districts, only a few in the Youghal and Midleton districts and relatively few in the Cork City area, the number in Cobh, at 151, was exceptionally high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> The situation in Cobh was exceptional also in the respect that it was only in that area that the doctors to whom the directions were issued referred them back to the Health Authority for investigation.  Of the 151 directions issued in the area, no less than 111 were so referred back.</P>
    <P>The Health Authority investigated the means of the persons to whom the tickets were issued and decided that, in relation to 20 of the tickets, the persons to whom they were issued were not entitled to general medical services. These tickets were cancelled and the district medical officers and authorised persons concerned were notified accordingly.</P>
    <P>In October, 1960, the health authority wrote to two of the authorised persons in the Cobh area requesting them to exercise care in the issue of tickets.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Wexford County Council that on 1st October, 1961, the latest date for which information is available, there were 9,875 medical service cards current in County Wexford; these covered 32,550 persons whose names were included in the general medical services register.  I am further informed that no cards have been withdrawn since 4th October, 1961.  Incidentally, the percentage of persons covered by cards in the county, on 1st October last, at 39.1%, is approximately one-third more than the national average.</P>
      <P>So that there may be no misunderstanding, I should explain that the health authority completed an annual review of the general medical services register, as required by Article 13 of the General Medical Services Regulations, 1954, on the 30th September, 1961.  As a result of this review 470 medical cards were cancelled&mdash; 123 as the holders had died, 139 as the holders were no longer residing in the health authority's area, and 208 as the holders, by reason of improved circumstances, were no longer considered eligible for general medical services on the grounds of means.</P>
      <P>The holders of the 208 cards cancelled on the grounds of means were notified accordingly during the first two weeks of October.  These cards covered 754 persons including holders and dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" /> The figures I have quoted for 1st October, 1961, take account of the cancellations referred to.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>As the boundaries of the Dublin North-West Constituency are not coterminous with the boundaries of dispensary districts and as the statistics kept by the Dublin Health Authority relate to such districts, that Authority is not in a position to furnish completely accurate information regarding medical cards in the constituency.  I am assured, however, that the figures which I shall give to the Deputy are substantially accurate.</P>
      <P>On 3rd November, 1961, the latest date for which information is available about 2,800 current medical cards were held by persons resident in the constituency; these cards covered about 12,000 persons, that is, holders and dependants.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Dublin Health Authority that only a handful of cards were withdrawn since 4th October, 1961, from persons resident in the constituency.  These cards were withdrawn where evidence became available that the holder has ceased to be, or never was, entitled to have a card.  I regret that I have been unable to ascertain the precise number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that there may be no misunderstanding, it is as well, perhaps, that <Col N="179" /> I should explain the system adopted by the Health Authority for revision of its general medical services register.</P>
    <P>Every six months or so, the health authority displays notices in its dispensaries, clinics, etc., indicating that cards bearing certain numbers (which are those of cards issued 9-15 months previously) will cease to be current after a date about three months ahead, and inviting holders of such cards to apply for fresh cards if they wish to do so.  All such applications are decided on their merits in the light of the then current circumstances of the applicant.</P>
    <P>The health authority caused to be displayed in July last notices indicating that the &ldquo;J&rdquo; series of medical cards would be automatically cancelled on 1st October, 1961.  Persons holding these cards were invited to re-apply for cards if they considered that they were still eligible for general medical services and wished to hold a medical card.</P>
    <P>The number of &ldquo;J&rdquo; series medical cards held by persons resident in the Dublin North-West Constituency involved in this automatic cancellation by the effluxion of time announced in July and effective from 1st October was approximately 1,500.  These covered about 4,400 persons.  The Health Authority has informed me that without a great deal of detailed examination it would not be possible for them to state in how many of these cases fresh applications were made and new cards issued, but, as already stated, about 122,000 persons in the Constituency were covered by medical cards on 3rd November last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions 31, 32 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The immediate possible danger from the recent nuclear tests, or from a continuance of such tests, lies in the deposit of radioactive iodine (Iodine 131) in quantities which would lead to a dangerous concentration of this substance in the thyroid gland.  Iodine 131 deposited in the fall-out of nuclear explosions can find its way into milk and thus be ingested by humans. Obviously, with milk the vehicle for its transmission, the danger of excessive concentrations of this substance is greatest with babies fed almost entirely on milk.  Radioactivity from Iodine 131 does not, however, remain a danger for very long after a nuclear explosion.</P>
      <P>A longer-term danger from nuclear tests lies in the deposit of radioactive substances which do not decay rapidly, such as Strontium 90, Caesium 137 and Carbon 14.  Of these Strontium 90 presents the most serious possibility of danger as it also may become a constituent of milk and be thus absorbed by humans.  When ingested, Strontium may be laid down in the human bone. If this were to happen on a sufficient scale, serious harm could result, but this has not happened up to the present, nor does it appear that it will. The position, however, is being kept under review.  Further tests at this stage would not be revealing since several months must elapse before Strontium from the recent nuclear tests reach our atmosphere.  Testing will be resumed, if necessary, at the appropriate time.  While the other two elements are potentially dangerous, there is at present no indication that they constitute a proximate danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> The tests for radioactivity arranged by the authorities in this country are of two kinds.  In the first place, routine measurements of air, rainwater and tapwater are continuously carried out by the Meteorological Service of the Department of Transport and Power. The object of these tests is to provide warning of any increase in total radio-activity.</P>
    <P>The second type of test is designed to assess the content in milk of the potentially dangerous constituents, Strontium 90 and Iodine 131.  Tests for Strontium 90 were carried out in 1960 and showed that the amount of that substance in milk was nowhere near the internationally recognised danger level.</P>
    <P>At present, tests for Iodine 131 are being conducted.  The results of the first set of these tests, which I published last week, showed that no danger existed for any section of the community. I again reassured mothers that there was no cause to change the feeding of infants.  Further samples are being tested, but it is expected that a marked decrease in the level of iodine 131 will be apparent unless there is more large-scale testing of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>In arranging for these tests for Strontium and Iodine I was glad to avail myself of the kind co-operation of the British Agricultural Research Council and have the tests carried out in the Council's Radiobiological Laboratory in Berkshire.  This ensured comparability of the results with those from similar tests on British milk.  I should like to take this opportunity to express to the House my appreciation of the co-operation of the British authorities in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate from what I have said that there is no indication that any special measures are likely to be called for because of the levels of radio-activity resulting from recent tests.  In the event of a future large-scale extension of nuclear testing, the Government is fully alive to the precautions which might be necessary and will advise the public on them should it become clear that they should be taken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>From the data available, it is not possible to reply to the Deputies' questions.</P>
      <P>Tests for specific radioactive elements in the milk supplies of this country were carried out only for Strontium 90 last year and for Iodine 131 in the current series of tests which commenced recently.</P>
      <P>In relation to British milk supplies, I have been unable to trace that any tests for Carbon 14 have been carried out; tests for Iodine 131 from the &ldquo;fall-out&rdquo; of nuclear explosions do not appear to have been carried out before the current year; and the only tests for Caesium 137 of which I have any record are those carried out, on a limited scale, in 1960.</P>
      <P>I have not seen any published figures for the results of tests for Strontium 90 in respect of any year prior to 1958.  The published figures indicate that the Strontium 90 content reached its maximum in 1959 but the full effects in this respect of recent testing of nuclear weapons have not yet been felt.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Ardkeen Hospital is now primarily a general medical, surgical and maternity hospital serving Waterford City and County, and no more than 100 beds are available there for the treatment of tuberculosis patients.  The Ardkeen Tuberculosis Unit has been fairly fully taken up in catering for the area at present served and it would not be feasible without extension of the Unit to provide in full the sanatorium accommodation needed for South Tipperary patients who number about 50.  While I appreciate that the treatment of these patients in Dublin sanatoria involves some inconvenience, the primary consideration is that they should have the benefit of the full range of specialist facilities in order that they may be speedily restored to health.  I can assure the Deputy that every resource of skill and experience is at the disposal of these patients and any inconvenience that arises should not be magnified to the extent that that great advantage is overlooked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that.  I am afraid I could not do that because such an arrangement would necessarily have to be at the expense of the provision of beds for general patients.  We have to organise this matter on a national basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they are fully taken up, or reasonably fully taken up; 97 out of 100 beds is a fairly full occupancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the fact that so many people are transported so far from South Tipperary to Dublin is hindering the work of the health authority in that area in relation to the early diagnosis and prevention of tuberculosis?  People are reluctant to accept treatment because of the fear of being transported so far from their friends and their families. Transporting patients from South Tipperary to Dublin is a radical change for such patients.  Ardkeen is less than 30 miles from South Tipperary. It is much more convenient. I would ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude towards this problem.  It is the unanimous wish of the Tipperary County Council that accommodation for tuberculosis patients be made available in Ardkeen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must appreciate that the Minister for Health must consider a problem like this as a whole.  After all, he has to make provision for patients who are suffering from diseases other than tuberculosis. Our great problem is that we have not enough beds for everyone and we have, therefore, to utilise beds in the most economical way possible.  Any inconvenience experienced by people who have to send relatives or friends to a hospital at some distance for proper treatment is minimal by comparison with the fact that the fullest facilities and most experienced personnel are available to treat such patients whereever they are sent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I cannot.  Do not take me now as shutting my mind in a matter of this sort, but the problem is that we have to treat Ardkeen as a general medical and surgical hospital.  The provision for the treatment of tuberculosis in that hospital is subsidiary and we cannot increase the number of beds available for tuberculosis patients in Ardkeen at the expense of those beds which should be available for the general hospital.  That is the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should remind the Deputy that it has been stated that the differences referred to in his questions are due to the fact that, like all my predecessors, I found it necessary to attach to certain posts in the local authority health services a condition that the holders thereof should furnish, on request, in certain circumstances, information in relation to patients who were or had been under their care. Because such information may be necessary in order to ensure that the Minister for Health for the time being will be able to fulfil his responsibilities to this House for all who avail themselves of the services provided under the Health Acts, the obligation to furnish it in the stated and restricted circumstances cannot be waived. Accordingly, the issue whether such an obligation should attach to the posts to which I have referred is not arbitrable.  However, the phraseology in which the obligation is defined is not sacrosanct, and if the Irish Medical Association wishes to discuss it and puts me in a position to receive a deputation for that purpose, I shall be glad to do so.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Rydell Report, a joint committee was set up consisting of representatives of my Office and the Electricity Supply Board and the agreed report dated 6th June, 1961, on the first stage of the investigations of the Shannon flood problem concludes that the proposed diversion would not be economic.  The agreed report further recommends that works on tributaries of the Shannon should not be done independently but should be accompanied by works on the main stem of the Shannon.  In other words, this joint body, the Commissioners of Public Works and the E.S.B., came to the conclusion that the problem would be aggravated if the tributaries were dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary has not grasped my point.  An application was made by about 200 farmers for a rural improvement scheme for minor drainage, as happens in many areas, for the three upper portions that join.  It is really only a minor drainage problem but it is a very serious one for a big number of farmers there.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would look into it and get the Special Employment Schemes Office to accept the rural improvement scheme that has been sent in whereunder the tenants are willing to contribute a portion of the cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fane river is No. 20 on the accepted priority list of minor catchment areas to be dealt with under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, and therefore it will be some years yet before it can be reached in the programme.  The Dromore river is part of the Erne catchment area, the survey of which has just been completed. Design work and the preparation of a scheme is proceeding but at this stage I could not say when actual drainage works can be commenced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary gives an indication of when he intends to deal with the Fane.  Can he give any estimate of when it is proposed to take the Dromore?  He has already in his Office an interim scheme for the relief of the urgent flooding in this Dromore river area which would get over the worst difficulties until the main catchment scheme can be undertaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be, in my opinion, early 1965 before the works could commence.  The suggestion that an interim report be made was initiated, I think, at the behest of Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture, through the Minister for Finance, and evidently the idea was that that would be done under the Land Reclamation Act of 1949.  As the Deputy will be aware, there is no means under that Act of maintaining the work thereafter and the position is that that interim scheme was not undertaken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether his attention has been drawn to an article prepared by the National Land Reclamation Association stating that £5 million of the amount granted towards the development of land under the Land Project Scheme has not been taken up owing to a lack of available capital to the farming community and the difficulty in getting long-term credit through the Agricultural Credit Corporation; and whether he will take steps, either by introducing long-term credit loans or by some other means, to enable these Land Projects grants to be availed of by farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the article referred to but I cannot agree that it states the position correctly.  In fact, the proportion of approved applications not proceeded with is now much less than it was in the earlier years of the Project.  I do not see any necessity for the provision of credit facilities over and above those that are available from such sources as the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the suppression of Part B of the Land Project has virtually withdrawn all credit facilities from applicants under the Land Project Scheme for the rehabilitation of their land and, in view of that fact, is it not manifest that a great deal of desirable work is not being done because farmers cannot raise the capital to pay cash for their part of the contribution for the reclamation of their land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that and I am not aware that such is the position in any substantial number of cases.  I say the loan facilities that are <Col N="213" /> there should be adequate to meet the requirements of farmers who are serious about improving the condition of their land.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I never expected and I never do expect to see the time when an individual can walk into a lending institution, be it the Agricultural Credit Corporation or a bank, and just say, &ldquo;I want so much money&rdquo; and have it in his pocket going out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but given that the farmer submits a scheme to the Department and in consultation with the Department submits a scheme which has Departmental approbation, does the Minister believe that that farmer can get from the Agricultural Credit Corporation the capital sum requisite to pay his share of the job, whereas, while Part B of the Land Project was in operation, any scheme approved by the Department's officers carried with it the credit necessary to get it done? Does the Minister not realise that that credit facility has gone?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is provision under existing legislation for the fixing of minimum rates of wages for agricultural workers and for the granting to them of annual holidays and weekly half-holidays. There has also been an improvement in working conditions.  It is to be hoped that joining the Common Market would ultimately be to the advantage of all sections of the community and that, in agriculture, the gradual evolution of a better system of European markets, coupled with our own hard work and efficiency, would lead to that higher standard of living for those on the land which is one of the important objectives of the Rome Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that it is perfectly obvious that there has been a progressive exodus of agricultural labourers from rural Ireland, principally to Britain, partly to the larger towns and to the Six Counties, due mainly to the fact that they are badly paid and have longer hours than the people in the city and in industry, and is he not also aware that they are probably the only section of the Irish population now who have no such thing as a retirement pension provided for them and that they and the farmers are the most important section of the Irish population, to whose praises we are tired listening in this House?  In the light of that, surely, it is not just good enough to say that there is the Agricultural Wages Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I recently received a recommendation from the Pigs and Bacon Commission that what is known as the &ldquo;Rise Clause&rdquo; should be accepted in respect of exports of Irish bacon to Britain sold there by the import agents against Standing Orders. Having ascertained the views of the Commission on the financial and other implications of the recommendation, I have agreed to accept it subject to certain conditions including utilisation of the system of Standing Orders to strengthen as far as possible the price position of Irish bacon in Britain and a direct part being assumed by the Commission in the arrangements for the export of bacon against Standing Order Contracts in pursuance of the aim of centralisation of bacon exports to Britain by the reorganised Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The position about the 1961 wheat crop is as follows:</P>
      <P>(1) More than 70% of the crop&mdash; over a quarter of a million tons&mdash;has already been accepted as millable and paid for on that basis.</P>
      <P>(2) The main object of the changes made in the 1961 Wheat Order was to emphasise the need for producing and marketing wheat in good millable condition.</P>
      <P>(3) Wheat which is not up to millable standards can be used only for feed purposes, and payment for such wheat on a millable basis would represent much more than its value.</P>
      <P>(4) No farm crop or other farm product carries a guarantee against losses due to weather conditions, and it would not be equitable to single out wheat for special retrospective treatment in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5) It would be detrimental to the future of wheat growing to guarantee to growers the same return on their <Col N="219" /> crop irrespective of the condition in which it is marketed.</P>
    <P>It was in the light of all these considerations that the Government reached their decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Government's belief that the interests of wheat growing farmers are best looked after by <Col N="220" /> agents and millers, or is it the belief that the Minister for Agriculture has some function himself to protect the interests of the wheat growing farmers against the agents and millers?  May I ask the Minister, if he calls on the farmers as a national duty to sow and grow wheat, has he not some corresponding obligation to say to these farmers: &ldquo;If, for reasons over which you have no control, such as storm or flood, your wheat deteriorates to the point where it is unsaleable for milling, I will see that some help is given to you to protect you against losses&rdquo;, which in this year have crippled several small farmers who took the Minister's advice and acted on the Government's request and planted wheat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £172,990 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This sum covers, in effect, two Estimates: One is the anticipated cost of recoupment in the year ending on March 31st, 1962, of <i>ex gratia</i> payments by Dundalk Engineering Works, Ltd., to former Great Northern Railway Board employees at the Board's Dundalk workshops who had to be laid off, temporarily or permanently, because the new group of companies were unable to find suitable employment for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> The other is the anticipated cost of repayable advances to Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta in the year ending on 31st March, 1962.  It will provide for the preliminary expenses of the company, including the acquisition of office premises, the administrative expenses of running the company until the end of the present financial year, the cost of sites surveys and other services in connection with the selection of the actual site for the factory, and the cost of possible purchases from St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd.</P>
    <P>I shall deal first with the Dundalk Engineering Works Ltd.  In the financial year 1958/59, a sum of £50,000 was voted to cover the anticipated cost of <i>ex gratia</i> payments by this company to former Great Northern Railway Board employees at the Board's Dundalk workshops who had to be laid off, but actual expenditure was only £8,607, the balance being surrendered to the Exchequer.  In the year 1959/60 a total of £104,010 was voted and expenditure came to £96,957.  In the year 1960/61 a sum of £190,000 was provided and expenditure came to £149,424.  For the current year, owing to the impossibility, at the time the Estimates were being prepared, of anticipating what sum would be required, a token provision of £10 was made.  It can now be estimated that a sum of £73,000 will be required to meet payments under the scheme.  It is thus estimated that total payments under the <i>ex gratia</i> payments scheme will come to about £327,989.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that declarations of permanent redundancy had to be withheld, in order to avoid making unjustified payments, in all cases where there existed a possibility that suitable work would be found.  It is due to this cause that in the uncertain employment situation of the new companies, the termination of the scheme has had to be deferred until now.</P>
    <P>Between December, 1959, and 31st March, 1960, 167 workers were declared permanently redundant, a further 116 in August, 1960, and 109 in March, 1961, not the anticipated 218 that was mentioned in the debate on 2nd March, 1961.  A final group <Col N="228" /> numbering 123 are now seen to be permanently redundant and it is proposed so to declare them, and give them <i>ex gratia</i> payments in accordance with the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the principals of the company that they now feel that suitable employment of a reasonably stable kind can be provided for the workers who will remain in their employment after this last group.  As I pointed out to the House during the debate of 2nd March, 1961, on this subject the companies must operate on ordinary commercial principles and the position of the workers will, in general, be no different from the position of workers engaged in the same field of industrial activity.</P>
    <P>I now turn to Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta.  As has recently been announced, the Government has approved the setting up of a company to negotiate binding tenders for a nitrogenous fertiliser factory to be located at Arklow, based on the use of fuel oil and Avoca pyrites.  This company, Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, has now been incorporated under the Companies Acts and it is the intention to promote legislation at the appropriate time to provide a statutory basis for the company.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, the possibility of establishing a nitrogenous fertiliser factory has been under active examination for many years.  The present proposal is, therefore, the outcome of fullest consideration of all factors involved and has taken cognisance of the latest technological developments in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the economics of using all possible raw materials at alternative locations in this country has been fully considered and that a nitrogenous fertiliser factory operated by a State Company at Arklow could produce nitrogenous fertilisers for sale without subsidisation at prices in line with prevailing import prices.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed with this project marks a most important advance in the implementation of the programme for economic expansion, and will, I am sure, commend itself to Deputies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> I recommend that the House should approve of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to the proposals announced by the Minister.  I note from the figures he has given in connection with the Dundalk Engineering Works that a total of over 500 men have been found to be redundant.  I wonder could the Minister indicate, when he is replying, what was the total number of persons employed in the Dundalk Engineering Works before it was closed down, and how many are now employed in the various projects which have been started there.</P>
      <P>I understand that some of the persons employed in the new projects were not formerly employed and that naturally some of those formerly employed were not found suitable, for one reason or another, for employment in the new undertakings.  I think it is generally recognised that compensation should be paid to those who are found redundant.  This proposal follows up the proposal made earlier to provide for the additional numbers who have since been found redundant.</P>
      <P>The other proposal which is mentioned here in connection with the establishment of a nitrogenous fertiliser factory is of considerable interest.  As is generally known, this matter has been the subject of consideration and investigation over a lengthy period.  It came indeed somewhat as a surprise that the final decision to establish this factory was taken in favour of a site at Arklow, but, on reflection, it seems that the available raw materials in the locality, based on Avoca pyrites, justified the decision to establish the factory there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially, this factory was considered for location in different places and, indeed, some time ago an announcement was made that it was proposed to establish a factory for this purpose based on bogland.  This recent decision which was announced some short time ago indicates apparently a change in attitude on the latest technological and scientific developments.  As I understand it, the earlier proposal was for the manufacture of phosphatic manures from pyrites.  The proposal now before us indicates that it is a <Col N="230" /> decision to provide nitrogenous fertiliser by the use of pyrites which are readily available at Avoca.</P>
    <P>I think that decision will be generally welcomed, once the Minister is able to give an assurance that there will be no increase in the price charged for the manufactured commodity, nitrogenous fertiliser, to farmers.  This decision to use pyrites justifies not merely the decision initially taken to develop the Avoca mines, but is in itself satisfactory. With the great development which has taken place under the direction of the St. Patrick's Coppermines, it means that now it is a decision not merely to develop the copper ore there but also to use the pyrites which are readily available in quite considerable quantities.</P>
    <P>Many years ago, one of the problems at Avoca was the difficulty of disentangling or segregating the various ores, particularly copper and pyrites, and, in fact, a considerable amount of the expense involved in the whole operation was due to that technical problem.  I understand that recent developments have improved the technique and capacity to segregate these various ores and that St. Patrick's Coppermines have over a period been developing the output there, with the result that it will now be possible, as the Minister says, to have pyrites available in readily accessible and sufficient quantities for the manufacture of nitrogenous fertiliser.</P>
    <P>This decision to utilise both products, copper and pyrites, will be generally welcomed because it means that it will be possible to extract the fullest possible benefit and make the maximum utilisation of the supply of ore at present in Avoca.  The work which St. Patrick's Coppermines have done and the employment which has been provided there highlight the industrial expansion in recent years. Indeed, the decision to establish St. Patrick's Coppermines in Avoca is one that time has proved was amply justified.  We welcome the announcement this evening which indicates the possibility of further development at Avoca and that the new factory at Arklow will provide for that whole area, as well as providing supplies of nitrogenous fertiliser.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> I should be glad to hear from the Minister what is the capital of the proposed new company.  I understand that legislation will be introduced later and discussion on that aspect of it may be postponed until then, but it would be interesting to hear what the capital is, and, if the Minister is in a position to indicate them, the names of the directors.  As I understand it, the Minister's statement indicates that it is proposed to provide nitrogenous fertiliser for sale here without subsidisation, at a price comparable with that prevailing at present for imported fertiliser. If it is possible for the Minister to indicate the cost of that, I should be glad to hear it with the other details, when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Generally, this proposal marks a considerable step in the development of the nitrogenous fertiliser industry here, and we shall be interested to hear of its progress in the future and to know that the technical decision now being taken is justified on the basis of the latest scientific and technological information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If one is to judge by the Minister's speech, the provision made here for the recoupment to the Dundalk Engineering Works of sums of money paid out by that company to members of the staff of the former Great Northern Railway Board brings to an end, I gather, the lifelong operation of helping people, who are not likely to get jobs in the new companies, to get compensation in respect of their past services from the Great Northern Railway Board in recognition of the fact that they could not be absorbed into the new company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood the company have now satisfied themselves there would be no further redundancies and that those who have so far survived will be regarded as ordinary members of the staffs, that their employment will be permanent, subject, of course, to fluctuations in trade.  In other words, has the redundancy aspect now been separated from the aspect of permanent employment and can we say that all the redundancies have been cleared, that compensation has been paid to <Col N="232" /> the redundant officers and that those who have survived redundancy can regard themselves as being employed by the new company?</P>
    <P>I gather from the Minister's speech that 515 persons have been rendered redundant.  Could the Minister give us an idea of what number survived to take up employment in the new company&mdash;that is, survived from their previous employment with the Great Northern Railway?  I understand there are new staffs in the new company but how many of the old Great Northern Railway staff survive and are now regularly employed in the new company? I think the Minister might, seeing that State capital is invested, have availed of this opportunity to give us a picture of the outlook in so far as the Dundalk Engineering Works is concerned. One of the five companies operating there was a company exploiting the production of the Heinkel small car, but I understand they have ceased to produce it and that that portion of its activities has closed down.</P>
    <P>Are we to take it that, as far as that activity is concerned, that unit has ceased production entirely, or is it intended it should, at some later stage, come back into production either in the assembly of small cars or some other activity?  Is it, in fact, still limping along at the moment?</P>
    <P>Then there are others engaged in light engineering, steel foundries, the tractor business and some other activity which I do not recall at the moment.  How are these doing?  Does it look as if they have a satisfactory foothold either in the home market or the export market?  It was believed, when this group of companies was set up, that after a time it would be possible for them to do fairly well on the equipment available there and in sight of the indigenous skill in Dundalk. What are the prospects now?  Are they bright or, at some later stage, particularly with the advent of the Common Market, are we likely to find that more rescue operations will be necessary there?</P>
    <P>It might be well if the Minister gave us some such indication.  I do not complain about what is being done.  I think there was what might be regarded as <Col N="233" /> a bold endeavour made to try to retain staff in employment at a date when the prospect of their employment was swept away by the abolition of the Great Northern Railway workshops. At the same time, because it was so bold a step, it deserves to succeed.  I should like to hear from the Minister what the outlook is as far as these firms in Dundalk are concerned and what assurance of regular employment, with stability, is available for the staff now employed under the Dundalk Engineering Works, even though their employment may be operated over four or five separate industries.</P>
    <P>On the question of the establishment of the nitrogenous fertiliser factory, this is a problem which has been before Governments from time to time and has been examined by Departmental committees.  The views of the Departmental committees reflected very substantially the flow of thought on the whole question as to what is the best type of fertiliser to produce, what fertiliser gives the best results, what type of fertiliser is the farmer most familiar with and could we get him to use nitrogenous fertilisers when he has been using other types?  All that medley of viewpoint was confounded by the fact that, up to a few years ago, all the estimates were that to establish a nitrogenous fertiliser industry here would necessitate charging a much higher price for the nitrogenous fertiliser than when that commodity was available from the import market.  It was believed the effect of establishing a nitrogenous fertiliser industry here would be to impose a burden on Irish agriculture and I think that was recognised because the present Government adopted a certain pattern in the matter of establishing the industry.  That pattern followed two trains of thought: (1) what were the best ingredients for the fertiliser, and (2) what were the prospects that the price would be such as not to impose a burden on the agricultural industry here?</P>
    <P>We must, of course, never forget that in so far as we charge high prices for fertilisers, we inevitably raise the price of the raw materials of the agricultural industry and we have got to <Col N="234" /> sell our agricultural produce in a highly competitive British market and later in a still more competitive European market.  I should like the Minister to give us some idea as to what price it is hoped to sell this fertiliser at.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in his speech that he thinks the fertiliser can be sold at a price which is not substantially different from the prevailing import prices.  It must be remembered that nitrogenous fertilisers imported here may be advantageously sold at a low price because of the circumstances of the producers.  It is the same with other fertilisers sold here at a lesser price than in the country of origin because the producer can take the profit from the main source of supply and can sell the surplus at a lesser price.</P>
    <P>It was the export from certain European countries of other types of fertilisers which made it difficult for the Irish fertiliser industry to make progress against that type of dumping. When the Minister says he hopes we can sell the Arklow fertiliser without subsidisation in competition with imported fertilisers, does he mean&mdash;and does he believe&mdash;that can be done over a period of years and that he is not taking the present import prices as a medium of comparison with the price of Irish fertilisers?  It is reassuring, if the Minister can take a long term view, that by and large nitrogenous fertiliser produced here can be sold at no higher price than the price at which the same fertiliser can be bought on the world market and sold here.  If, however, we are to take for purposes of comparison a specially low or a specially high import price here and say that that is the basis, that could prove unreliable in the long run.</P>
    <P>There were hopes that this fertiliser would be based on turf.  Some members of the Government Party indicated in Offaly the precise place where the fertiliser factory would be located.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has such a lily-white mind politically that he would not think any of his Party members would do such a thing.  He would not credit that anyone would point to a certain location and state that that was where the fertiliser factory would be established, and that same individual was not unduly shy in claiming that it was through his and others' herculean exertions that that particular spot had been selected.  However, the die has now been cast.  I understand Arklow will be the site of this factory.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister will this factory be an entirely State capitalised factory?  Will the State hold the entire capital?  Will the staff, from top level management down, be State recruited?  Is there any question at this stage that the undertaking will be run jointly by the State and an existing large firm in the fertiliser industry? This is a highly technical process.  We could spend a great deal of money.  We could lose a great deal of money on the basis of trial and error.  I should like to know whether this factory is to be entirely State-owned or State and privately owned? Will the personnel be State servants or will people be brought in from some other group to manage the factory for the State?  The Minister might also tell us what capital will be necessary for the establishment of this undertaking. I should also like to know whether any export of this fertiliser is contemplated?  One of the difficulties in making a project economic is getting its production consumed here.  A certain minimum quantity would have to be produced and consumed in order to make the price economic or bring the product within the reach of farmers. Is it anticipated that the entire production will be consumed by the agricultural industry here?  Is it visualised that there will be exports to the Six Counties, Britain, or elsewhere?  In what way will the factory be balanced so far as home consumption and export are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> I agree many of these matters could be more properly raised on a Bill to provide for the setting up of the company but we are now entering upon new and uncharted seas and it is good public policy and good public relations for the Government to make their explanation as to what is intended so that people will be fully informed and, at the same time, misunderstandings about costs and other features corrected. Misunderstandings arise very largely because of insufficient information on the basis of a project or in relation to the background in which it is framed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows of old my views on the projects in Dundalk.  I want to restate them now. The Minister stated that the Dundalk companies must operate on commercial principles.  Does that statement relate to the future or is it intended also to cover the past?  If he means it to include the past, then the statement is manifestly untrue and grossly misleading.  The facts are entirely at variance if it is intended to cover the past.  If the statement is intended to apply only to the future then I can understand the Minister making the statement, but the Minister should make quite clear exactly what he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be perfectly clear so that I will not be misrepresented.  An attempt was made by one of the Minister's colleagues to misrepresent me in relation to the Dundalk Engineering Works.  Let me put the position quite clearly.  The Government were faced with a problem in relation to employment in Dundalk because of the closing down of the Great Northern Railway Works.  Being faced with that problem, they properly&mdash;I repeat &ldquo;properly&rdquo;&mdash;had to take steps to meet it.  They did take steps.  What I object to is the attempt that has been made all along to suggest that what was done in relation to Dundalk was an ordinary commercial transaction.  It was not.  It was a rescue operation taken by the Government because of the particular difficulties that arose on the termination of the Great Northern Railway Works in Dundalk.  To suggest, as the Minister once suggested, that it was an ordinary commercial <Col N="237" /> transaction and that there was no Government money involved was untrue and misleading.</P>
    <P>The fact is the Government gave a direction to the Industrial Credit Company to make funds available to the Dundalk group of factories.  The moneys issued.  I suggest to the Minister&mdash;it is, perhaps, more a matter for his colleague, the Minister for Finance &mdash;that there should be a difference between ordinary commercial transactions operated by the Industrial Credit Company and the type of rescue operation undertaken at the request of the Government; they should not be bulked together in the Company's accounts for the purpose of presenting a misleading picture.  The Industrial Credit Company is operating on public money and there is a bounden duty on all concerned to present the fullest picture possible in the most correct light possible.</P>
    <P>I am not going to be misrepresented again in relation to this because an attempt was made to misrepresent me before.  I am not challenging the wisdom of the rescue operation&mdash;I think it had to be undertaken&mdash;but I am challenging, and will continue to challenge, the attempt to suggest that no public money was involved.  Of course it is entirely public money and the losses incurred in relation to these companies are losses in terms of public money.</P>
    <P>I have before me at the moment the losses up to 31st December, 1959.  I do not know whether the balance as at 31st December, 1960 has been filed &mdash;I am sure it has.  The Minister and I had some discussions in relation to that file before and, in fact, he may have assured me since that the balance sheets were filed after that.  I cannot remember that, but on 31st December, 1959, as Deputy Norton has raised the question, let me make it clear that Dundalk Engineering Works had lost £173,000; Irish Cabin Scooters had a loss of £111,000; Dealgan Steel Founders had lost £36,000; Frank Bonser had lost £1,700; and Commercial Road Vehicles, £830, making a total of £324,000, while the parent company had lost £26,000, making a total of £350,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> If, in the subsequent period any of those losses have been cut down, nobody will be more happy than I.  It was entirely desirable that the rescue operation should be undertaken and I hope that through the change in direction rather than in the directorate there, in the top executive management, that took place some time ago, the initial mistake made by the Minister's predecessor in getting a certain person already discredited to go in there, has been overcome.  If a person of the calibre of the present executive directorate had been there from the beginning, some of that public money might not have been lost.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister might tell us the amount of public money.  I suppose I could find out by looking in the company's office the amount of public money involved at the moment.  My information&mdash;and the Minister will no doubt correct me if I am wrong&mdash;is that there is a sum of about £2 million of public money involved in this and that on 31st December, 1959, as far as I can understand from the balance sheet, the Industrial Credit Company had made available £1,348,398 and since that time, I think approximately another £650,000&mdash;that may not have been all paid out in cash, so to speak, but arrangements were filed in the company's office to show that such sum was being made available.  In the circumstances in which £2 million from the Industrial Credit Company is sunk in Dundalk, it is nonsense to suggest that it is an ordinary commercial transaction, or that public money, taxpayers' money, is not involved, and it would be far better for everybody if we were quite frank and honest about the matter and made it clear that a rescue operation was undertaken by the Government and that such a rescue undertaking was necessary, the tragedy of it being that the wrong man was put by the Government in charge of it at the beginning. I can only hope that it is now in charge of a directorate who will make a better shot at it and, in consequence, save the employment for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I also made it clear to the Minister on a previous occasion, and I want to make clear now, that public money <Col N="239" /> should have been made available for the purpose of ensuring that employment would be retained for these people who had suffered loss of employment through the closing down of the Dundalk Engineering Works. Unfortunately, it was not used entirely for that purpose; some of it was used for the purpose of enticing employees from industries in other parts of the country.  That does not seem to be good business or to be in accord with the rescue operation which, as I say, was not merely undertaken but should have been undertaken.</P>
    <P>So far as the nitrogenous fertiliser factory is concerned, I want to ask the Minister some specific questions before discussing the matter in general.  I see in the Supplementary Estimate itself a reference to the note on page 5 of the original Volume of Estimates.  I take it that is intended to refer to the fact that this is a grant-in-aid in respect of which the original details will not be vouched for to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If I am right in that respect, can the Minister tell me whether it is usual in a Supplementary Estimate, before legislation is introduced, to give such a grant-in-aid?  We all understand that a grant-in-aid is the method by which the House gives to a body already established with the consent of the House funds for the purpose of their being expended by that body without its having to account to the House in the normal meticulous fashion, if I may so term the procedure in regard to the expenditure of Departmental funds.  It seems unusual that a grant-in-aid should be given in advance of the legislation.  Frankly, I am only depending on memory in regard to that and my memory may not be quite right, but I should like the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I had looked up that part.  As far as I can recollect, this is a precedent and I am not at all sure that it is a good one.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I should like to have some indication from the Minister as to when he anticipates the legislation in regard to this will come before us. Obviously the discussion we would have on the matter would be considerably tempered by the consideration as to whether the legislation was immediate or remote.  I think the Minister should have given us that information in his opening speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We anticipate that it will be during the next financial year&mdash;probably towards the end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is not treating the House as it should be treated.  When the legislation is as far away as that, the House should have been given considerably more information than in this&mdash;I was about to say &ldquo;contemptuously brief statement&rdquo; but I do not think the Minister meant it to be contemptuous and therefore I shall withdraw that word, having used it&mdash;hopelessly brief statement as he introduced the Estimate.  I know statements were made during the general election campaign with regard to this matter and announcements were made but the House as such is entitled to a proper explanation and Parliamentary procedure demands that, when a Minister comes in and, for the first time, asks for moneys for an item of this sort, he should give the House, give Parliament, his reasons in proper detail for the project as a whole.  I could excuse the Minister if the position were to arise in which the Bill itself would be brought before the House within a matter of months, say, this session or the first day of next session.  Then I could understand the Minister saying that as the matter was going to be discussed at such length on the Bill itself within such a short time, there was no necessity to say anything about it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> He says that is not the position and it is all wrong that the Minister should dismiss the proposal and dismiss the suggestion that he has not come to this House merely for a sum of money that is measurable purely in terms of £100,000, though that is enough; on his own admission by the time he comes back to the House there will be a firm Government commitment in which the honour of the State will be involved for very substantial sums and, for that, four brief paragraphs are provided. I do not think I would be offensive to the Minister when I say that they are paragraphs of utterly vague generalities with nothing concrete at all in the nature of a proposal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government have been converted from their previous idea of endeavouring to produce a nitrogenous plant here for something that could not have produced the fertiliser at anything like a reasonable cost.  I hope that the estimates forecast in relation to the production of the fertiliser will be justified in practice, that fertilisers can be produced for sale without subsidisation at prices in line with prevailing import prices.  By prevailing import prices I mean long term prevailing import prices.  I do not mean to compare them with low dumping prices at any one time or to compare them with high scarcity prices just because something happens to have gone wrong at another time.  In fact, under the Common Market if it is not an all-round proposition the position certainly will be that in the long run we shall not be able to compete against the production from Germany which I think at the present time supplies most of the nitrogen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>I shall explain that in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And I shall be delighted to hear the Minister explain it although I feel he should have explained all this in his introductory speech, having regard to the fact that the Bill is not coming for such a long time.  Be that as it may, this product arises out of a method of utilisation of the by-product from Avoca and it can therefore be taken to be, and should be taken to be, an extension, if you like, of the position arising in Avoca and arising by reason of the fact that the last Government were sufficiently awake to the position then existing to take advantage of the then international price of copper to get people interested at that time.  Everybody will tell the Minister that, if they had not been got into the business at that time, it would not have been possible at all at a later stage to get them interested to the same degree.  Therefore this is a by-product of the other.</P>
      <P>Pyrites is one of the by-products of the extrusions out of copper concentrate after the copper has been crushed and washed out.  In that respect I should like the Minister to give us some indication of what the production of pyrites will be in Avoca and in addition to that what the consumption of pyrites is likely to be in this new factory.  I accept, of course, that must depend to some extent on the output and on the sales but I understand that usually in most copper mines of that sort, with the marginal percentage of copper such as Avoca, it is the favourable utilisation of a by-product that makes the difference between profit and loss on the transaction as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can understand from what the Minister has said in relation to this, it would be entirely Avoca pyrites that will be used.  I believe at present pyrites from Avoca are being sold abroad to some extent and being built up and that there are stocks of the secondary extrusions from copper <Col N="243" /> there on the spot which could be used for the purpose of being converted into further pyrites.  That conversion, I understand, is a matter of some expense but, as I understand the proposal and the facts as they are at present, Avoca are shipping their pyrites abroad because there is nobody here who has any use for the pyrites. However, this new company when it starts its operations will have to import pyrites in the beginning to ensure that it can carry on and, having imported pyrites in the beginning, I suppose an ordinary flow as between one and the other will take effect.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be a rather nonsensical procedure.  There is to be a procedure by which double transport costs would be completely thrown away.  We have at present the transport costs of the pyrites that is being sold abroad and when I say that I am talking in terms of the cost to our international balance of payments.  We have to pay or somebody has to pay the cost of transporting that new pyrites abroad and when the new factory starts we shall have to pay the cost of importing the pyrites until we can get into the proper even flow in relation to Avoca.</P>
    <P>I understand further that the position in relation to the other big I.C.I. works which make nitrogenous fertiliser in this way is that they have a very large Government stockpile so that, at any particular time, there is margin there to carry on.  Therefore if the flow of the raw material is in any way impeded for any reason at any time, there is a sufficiently large stockpile to ensure that production at the plant itself shall not be interrupted.</P>
    <P>That seems to be a sound proposition. I do not know what the cost is &mdash;I know nothing about costings in relation to this matter.  It seems to me that there are double transport losses to the nation by sending pyrites out and then having to take them back again after the inception of the factory. It would be better tactics and a better proposition to follow the example in relation to the other plant and have a standby stockpile which could be built up gradually over the period between <Col N="244" /> now and when the factory came into operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told us either when it is anticipated that the factory will come into operation.  It may be difficult for him to give a date in that respect but I think an approximate forecast should be given, when we are asked to produce the money.  In addition to that, I think we should be given some idea today of the total sum of money which has to be put up out of public moneys through the Industrial Credit Company or by legislation, as the case may be.  I do not expect the Minister at this stage to differentiate between the Industrial Credit Company advance or the amount going in through legislation.  That is a matter that will probably be left until the last minute when the total cost of the plant and the project is more accurately known.  We must have an idea of the amount involved.  It is desirable that the House should be told something of that at this stage.</P>
    <P>As I understand the Minister's intention, it is that the entire project will be a State-owned concern.  I should like to have that confirmed.  I understand also&mdash;and here I speak with some reservation because what I speak of is not based on knowledge I have got of the truth of which I can assure the House but on what I have heard by way of rumour which goes round the town&mdash;that at least one other concern, one private enterprise concern, offered to put up such a factory. It spent a very considerable sum of its own money on making investigations as to whether this project was feasible or not.  It made it quite clear to the Government that it was not going to ask for any Governmental concession or any Governmental funds, that the funds would be made available otherwise.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether that is correct or not.  If it is correct, I should like to know why it was the decision was taken in the way it has been taken. There have been many suggestions from time to time that we were finding it difficult to provide not merely the technical know-how in relation to projects ourselves but that we were <Col N="245" /> finding it difficult to find the risk capital.  If there was a proposal by certain people that they would themselves provide all the risk capital and produce the article on exactly the same terms as the Minister suggests, then I think that is a matter which should be disclosed to the House so that the House may be in a position to take its decision.  When I say &ldquo;disclosed to the House&rdquo;, it may be that the Minister is not able, or does not feel it would be proper, to disclose it at this stage.  If so, then it is a matter which would fall for consideration on the introduction of the legislation itself, but it is a matter about which we are entitled to have some information.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister suggests that this proposal is one that will operate entirely under what I shall call Common Market conditions; in other words, that there will be no restriction by way of either import or quota, regardless of whether or not we have a period of grace under the Common Market.  I should like the Minister to make that clear when he is replying.  I think that from his statement there would be neither tariff nor quota from the beginning.  I think it desirable that that should be confirmed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked the Minister to give us an outline in relation to the company directors and so forth. The company has been incorporated. There are directors at present.  Whether those are more than <i>ad interim</i> directors or not is another matter which I think should be cleared up.  Has there been any firm arrangement made as to the capital structure of the company? I think that also is a matter that should be ventilated by the Minister in the House at this stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I inquire from the Minister whether he estimates that this is the last grant-in-aid made to the company before the legislation or whether he estimates it will be necessary to make another grant before legislation in the latter half of the next financial year&mdash;I think he said &ldquo;financial year&rdquo;?  That is a period of another 15 months ahead.  Will this £100,000 keep them going until then or does he estimate that he will be <Col N="246" /> coming to the House again for a second interim advance?  We should be told that at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Estimate. Part of my constituency has been selected for a very important industry.  As a trade unionist, I can only offer the Minister every support I possibly can to make a success of the St. Patrick's Copper Mines.  It will have a two-fold object. It will, in the first instance, give greater security to employees in the St. Patrick's Copper Mines when they know that the product will be purchased very convenient to their own site when the factory is erected.  It will also give employment to many of the men in the rural areas convenient to Arklow town.  The Minister can rest assured that there will be sufficient labour available in the area.  They will be employed in that industry.</P>
      <P>As an old trade unionist having an interest in the development of the industries of this country and especially those in my own county, I can assure the Minister that all concerned will give him every possible support to make this industry a success.  I only hope that the Minister will proceed with his work as soon as possible.  All these other points will be considered afterwards. The statement made by the Minister officially in the Dáil will help to create an atmosphere of security.  I was not worried about statements made outside the House, especially during election times.  I am very pleased now that it has been made.  I congratulate the Minister and I hope the enterprise will be a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Everett in welcoming the proposal to establish the fertiliser factory in Arklow.  As Deputy Everett has pointed out, there has been a certain amount of talk about this, particularly during the election and particularly from election platforms in Arklow, and it is good to have it made official by the Minister here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Sweetman that the Minister at this stage should give the House some more information than is contained in the brief opening statement which he <Col N="247" /> read to the House.  When this matter was spoken about in Arklow and elsewhere in County Wicklow during the election, there seemed to be a very great fund of information available and the House, and certainly the people who will be concerned in Arklow, would welcome that type of information from the Minister now.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the proposal to establish the factory in Arklow.  I am aware of the fact that there were sites elsewhere in the country considered and under discussion. It should be taken as a tribute, not only to the good sense of the Minister's advisers, but in a very particular way to the inter-Party Government who preceded the previous Fianna Fáil Government, that it is possible to establish this factory in Arklow and to utilise the by-products of the Avoca mines for the purpose of operating it.  I think&mdash;and I am sure the Minister will not be slow in saying it&mdash;it is a tribute to the foresight and vision of those who set about getting the Avoca mines into operation that this factory can now be contemplated in Arklow.  It is right that both sides of the House should get the honour and the tribute that is due to them for the development which is now taking place.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, when replying, to give the House some idea as to what it is hoped will be the employment content when the factory is in operation.  I should like, and I am sure Deputy Everett would also like, to have some assurance from the Minister that the labour content in the factory will be of the type which can be drawn locally and that it will not be a question of specialised work and the importation of operatives to run the factory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the question of directors and the company board.  I imagine the Minister would feel that it is too early to go into that matter in any great detail but it would be proper to urge on the Minister that when an important undertaking of this sort is being established in Arklow, he should have regard to the desirability of ensuring that there is some type <Col N="248" /> of local representation on whatever board is established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the other speakers in welcoming this Supplementary Estimate, especially that part of it which will be devoted to the establishment of the nitrogenous fertiliser factory.  It is some months since a public announcement was made in the Press that such an industry was to be established in or near Arklow.  Naturally, those interested in the county were very pleased.</P>
      <P>It is very wrong for any Deputy to suggest that there was a great deal of propaganda made out of this matter during the election campaign.  Were it not for the fact that Deputy O'Higgins made that reference, I doubt very much if I would have intervened in the debate.  I was one of the people who campaigned in Wicklow and I do not think Deputy O'Higgins or anybody else can say that I referred to this development once from a political platform in Arklow or anywhere else.  It was something that was announced by the Government and we accepted it as something that was going to happen.  I am glad that the Minister has come to the House for the money to establish this fertiliser industry.</P>
      <P>The matter was mentioned from a political platform during the election. It was mentioned by the Taoiseach when he spoke in Arklow some days before the election.  He was very fair, I thought.  I remember him simply saying that the people of County Wicklow would not give the Government any credit for its being situated in or around Arklow; that it was just that the commission set up to deal with this matter had recommended Arklow because it would be more economical to produce the fertiliser in Arklow and that was the reason it was being established in Arklow.  I thought it was a very fair statement because political Parties are inclined to use every weapon they have during an election but that weapon was not overused, as far as my recollection goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that this stage has been reached.  I should like to ask the Minister whether the company that <Col N="249" /> has been established are negotiating for sites and whether the site will be in the vicinity of Arklow harbour or nearer to Avoca.  If the Minister can give that information, I should like to have it.  I should also like to know if there is any likelihood of additional trade for Arklow harbour as a result of the establishment of this industry. What exports can we expect?  If there is an export trade, will the exports go through Arklow harbour?  That is important for the port because any additional trade will help to solve the financial problem of the port authorities. I should be very grateful if the Minister would be kind enough to give me information on these matters.</P>
    <P>The question of labour has been mentioned.  I sincerely hope the vast majority of the people employed in the industry will be Wicklow people.  I am not particularly concerned whether they are from Wicklow or Avoca because at the moment there is no great problem of unemployment in that particular area.  I hope the unemployment problem will be solved in County Wicklow generally.  I sincerely hope the people employed in the factory will be Wicklow people.  That is the only interest I have in it.</P>
    <P>I should like again to congratulate the Minister and the Government on the decision they have taken to establish this industry and on their first move in that direction.  I hope it will not be very long until we have the industry in full production in Arklow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first, to deal with the portion of the Supplementary Estimate which refers to severance payments to Dundalk Engineering Works employees.  This matter of severance payments is one that exercised my mind as far back as January, 1958, when I put down a motion in the Seanad in regard to it.  The severance payments being made are on a par with the severance payments made to C.I.E. and G.N.R. employees rendered redundant by the closing of lines, and so on.  We have now reached the stage when the Minister states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A final group numbering 123 are now seen to be permanently redundant and it is proposed so to declare <Col N="250" /> them, and give them <i>ex gratia</i> payments in accordance with the scheme.</P>
    <P>First of all, I should like to say that if one is to take the situation in <i>globo</i>, while it may be called an <i>ex gratia</i> payment, it is not really an <i>ex gratia</i> payment because the C.I.E. redundancy payments were covered by legislation and these redundancy payments are on an absolute parallel.</P>
    <P>Of course the people who are being compensated are the old G.N.R. workers who became redundant not, perhaps, because of the voluntary action of this Government or its predecessor, but because of the action in Northern Ireland.  However, the point which I first wish to discuss is the statement by the Minister that a final group, numbering 123, are now to be declared redundant.  Only on Monday night last a man spoke to me who said he had 34 years with the G.N.R. and with the Dundalk Engineering Works. He said he felt there was a danger that he could become redundant in the future and he also felt that this final Supplementary Estimate might mean that if he did become redundant this day six months, or this day twelve months, he would receive no payment.</P>
    <P>As I understand the Minister's statement when he speaks of a final group, the man was correct in his interpretation of the situation.  I am not criticising the Minister or the Government in any way, because what has been described as a rescue operation in Dundalk is very meritorious and one welcomed by the people of Dundalk and of Louth.  We on this side of the House sided with the Government and voted with them when they decided to carry out this rescue operation. Only today Deputy Sweetman, the former Minister for Finance, confirmed that view and confirmed the view that the rescue operation should and would have been carried out had we been in the position in which the Government found themselves on the vital occasion when the decision was taken by the Northern Ireland Government. As a Deputy for Louth, it is my duty now to examine what can happen if this is to be a final payment.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to refer to the losses <Col N="251" /> of these companies because my hope, as a local Deputy, is to see them progress. At the same time, we have heard Deputy Sweetman's list of losses. He said that he had got these from the Companies' Office in 1959.  I got the same figures from the Office today, so that no losses have been filed since then and we do not know whether there have or have not been any losses in the meantime.  However, it takes a lifetime to build up a business and in the initial stages ten years is a very short time.</P>
    <P>In the modern world of commerce it is true to say that most businesses started are expected to work at a loss for some years.  Like Deputy Sweetman I hope the change in the top executive which has taken place will make a difference and that these companies will prosper as a result.  I know that the people of Dundalk appreciate the change.  They now see that there is a difference and that these companies are being better managed under the able direction of those appointed as directors and that this better management will result in improved financial returns at the end of succeeding years.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I must discuss the position of the man who spoke to me on Monday night last.  There are 200 or 300 men in a similar position.  He is in the position of not being in the final group, and he is very glad that he is not, but he finds himself in the position that if his employment vanishes because the company in which he works finds him redundant, he could look forward, after 34 years with the G.N.R. and the Dundalk Engineering Works, to no compensation.  I do not think the Minister or the Government desires that situation to develop.  When replying I should like the Minister to tell me does he really mean that this is a final group of 123 and that after that there will be no more severance payments.</P>
    <P>If there are to be no more severance payments he must assure the House, the country, the people of Dundalk, and the employees, that the position is that he is going to see that anyone who becomes redundant in the future in any one of these companies through, <Col N="252" /> perhaps, the failure of the company, will be placed elsewhere and his job will continue in one of the sister companies.</P>
    <P>That may be a difficult undertaking to give but if the Minister does not give it he is in fact producing a final group and absolute finality regarding severance payment which could affect those who, happily, have kept their jobs but could yet be described as workers engaged in the same field of industrial activity.  They cannot be described as being in the same position because of the losses of the companies which we now hope will become profits.  I would ask the Minister to consider them in his reply and define exactly what is the position.  I hope it is not the situation which I have described and which seems, on the face of the Minister's statement on the position of the employees, to be the factual position at the moment.</P>
    <P>There are also certain other matters which arise with regard to severance payments.  One is that there are a few men whose jobs did not vanish and who were not redundant but whose services were disposed of by the G.N.R. Company, as it then was, shortly before the company ceased to exist and was assimilated into C.I.E.  There are only two or three of these men.  One of them had made arrangements to go to work in a locomotive shop in Edinburgh. If he had done so before he reached the age of 65 he could have worked for five years and then, when he reached the age of 70, he could have gained all the British retirement pensions and social services which exist.</P>
    <P>This man continued with the G.N.R. without a guarantee from day to day. As a result he passed the age of 65 and was dispensed with a few months before the G.N.R. Board ceased to exist.  He finds himself with no severance payment and no opportunity to go to work in Britain with a view to gaining British pensions and so on, at the age of 70.  He is at the moment living on the old age pension.  I intend to write to the Minister to bring to his notice the position of these two or three men and I know he will view it with his customary good sense and sympathy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the nitrogenous fertiliser <Col N="253" /> factory I would be very keen to see employment given as a result of the use of nitrates for our farm lands and the industry at Arklow should achieve that.  I want to make sure, however, that we do not do it at the expense of the farms.  The indication which I see that such will not be the case is that the new fertiliser factory, as distinct from the old one which was mooted, seems to be on an entirely new basis, being for the manufacture of nitrates through the use of copper pyrites.  It was well known that the previous project would have resulted in dearer nitrogen.  As has been pointed out, in introducing this Estimate the Minister did not give an explicit guarantee that the fertiliser would be available at world prices.  In trade circles it is well known at the moment that there are as many as six nitrogen factories in Europe.  These factories are cutting each others' throats trying to dispose of nitrogen.</P>
    <P>While one could not describe their nitrogen as an absolute by-product, it is tied up entirely with the production of chemicals and plastics.  These companies must produce nitrogen.  What they sell it at is not a figure related to their costs of production but related to what they can get for it.  That is the explanation for the large quantities of dumped nitrogen that have been available for the past few years.  In face of that it is difficult to see what guarantee the Minister can give.  But if what can almost be described as a waste product of Saint Patrick's Copper Mines is being utilised, it gives us a completely new concept of the whole matter.  If the facts and figures had been produced by the Minister at the outset, we would all be a great deal happier.  However, they were not produced and we must ask the Minister to do a little more work when replying.</P>
    <P>There was one other point made by everybody who discussed the nitrogen factory with me, and that was that no matter where it was and no matter what raw materials were used&mdash;the chief raw material being the air we breathe&mdash;the level of employment in nitrogen factories in relation to the amount of capital expended on their construction, was relatively low.  I have heard figures quoted outside this House <Col N="254" />&mdash;in fact at meetings held in Arklow during the election campaign&mdash;about the employment potential in the factory. I should like to hear the Minister within the House give us his view on what the employment potential will be.</P>

We would like to know whether or not he is convinced this nitrogen can be provided for the farmers at present prices and in competition at all times with prices on the Continental market.  I hope the nitrogen factory will be a success.  I do not want to damn it with faint praise or to say that I know everything about it.  I should like to hear the Minister replying in detail, not only on the nitrogen factory but on the specific problems I put to him in regard to the workers at the Dundalk Engineering Works and its sister companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to join in welcoming this proposal to establish the basic elements of a fertiliser industry here.  It is a matter that has been talked about for years and, as the matter was being discussed, the economic situation has been changing.  Anybody who considers it will feel that the decision ultimately come to by the Government in that connection is right, especially the decision to base the process of fixation on the oil process, as I might call it. As the scheme evolves the soundness of it becomes more apparent.  The fact that the factory is to be located in Arklow and that it is to be related, on the one hand, to the Cork refinery and, on the other, to the Avoca mines indicates the type of scheme it is, that it is a coherent one and one tied in with our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder is it realised how big this project is?  Although it has been given to us in sizable mouthfuls, it should be realised this is a very big and important development and that not only are we laying the foundation for an important industry that will supply much of our agricultural wants in this field, but that we are also, probably, <Col N="255" /> laying the foundation for such chemical industry as we shall need in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>This is not the time to speculate about the economic situation as the Common Market develops but the situation is such now as to justify the decision in the first instance to depend on oil for the fixation of nitrogen. Through the oil refinery we will be able to have a factory which will be able to fix nitrogen and from that product we shall be immediately able to produce either ammonium sulphate or ammonium nitrate as the basic fertilisers.  To complete that scheme however the production of sulphuric acid comes into the picture.  That is where, I take it, pyrites from Avoca will come in.</P>
    <P>Here, then, we have two of the relatively few material essentials of a chemical industry: ammonium or nitric acid products and sulphuric acid products.  I look forward to the time when, perhaps, in addition to fertilisers, we will be able to supply certain other chemical needs as well. I would hasten to add that as the economic situation develops and if we are to be integrated with Europe as a whole, the extent to which such industries may develop here and the extent to which there may be reciprocal relations in imports and exports, are matters which I should not like to prophesy about too closely.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention another point for the Minister's consideration. Quite clearly, if we are manufacturing sulphuric acid from the pyrites produced from the Wicklow sources, it seems we will not be able to absorb or to use at home all that potential for the production of sulphuric acid.  I presume, therefore, an export industry in pyrites is important to us but there is another possibility which I am sure has not been lost sight of, namely, the making of superphosphates, in which sulphuric acid plays a very large part.</P>
    <P>I take it the production of sulphuric acid in an Irish chemical works would not be limited simply to the production of ammonium sulphate, and if acid production could be expanded, it would logically be expanded to the point <Col N="256" /> where it could supply the acid needed for the production of superphosphates and other chemical needs.</P>
    <P>As regards phosphates themselves, I presume we shall still have to import them but, again, it might be worth having another look at the Clare deposits.  I know that in the ordinary way the deposits are small, and I am in no way suggesting that there are concentrated deposits there which would be economic to develop.  What I do suggest is that perhaps there is a very low grade wide distribution of phosphates over Clare and that there are modern processes that might justify a re-examination of the Clare situation, either from the point of view of a reserve or a supplemental supply.  If that element were in the picture, we would be very well on our way to establishing the fertiliser industry which many people have advocated ever since the war, and well on the way to establishing a basic chemical industry here.</P>
    <P>I should like the magnitude of this development to be realised.  It is not a matter to be passed by as just the establishment of another industry.  I think it is one of the biggest decisions the Government have made and that it is likely to bring very great benefit to the country in its development.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the precise development of the scheme will depend on the economic environment but there are none of us here who are in a position individually to make any very firm statement on that subject.  The Minister, the Government and the officials who have the full services of information available to them alone can deal with that, but on the evidence as shown to us in the disclosure of this development, we can be confident that this economic aspect of the situation is being taken into account.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan seemed to have some apprehensions about the costings and the price of the product.  My own impression is that such an undertaking would not be pressed to this stage unless the matter had been gone into very carefully indeed, and that we should take it as the considered opinion of the experts who have studied the matter, both economically and technically, that <Col N="257" /> it will be of real benefit to the country. I think we can take that for granted on this occasion.  If that were not so, I do not think the project would be before us now.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that other projects were examined even to the point where recommendations might have been made, but caution compelled a revision in the light of changing circumstances. The fact that the plunge has been taken now is clear evidence that there is a very solid reason and justification for this scheme.  I do not think, therefore, that the fears that have been voiced by the Deputy on the opposite side are well founded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should perhaps deal first with the part of the Supplementary Estimate relating to the payments to be made to the redundant workers in Dundalk.  I do not want to disagree in any way with what Deputy Sweetman has said, except in degree.  I am glad to note that the action taken by the Government at that time in 1958 was so fully supported by members on the Opposition side of the House, and that the efforts and arrangements made since have enjoyed the same measure of support.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on an earlier occasion, it was a trenmendous undertaking at the time to try to contain 960 men, most of them skilled, and very specialised skills at that, and to retain for the nation that cadre of high skill.  It was inevitable that there would be certain redundancy because some of the skills in Dundalk were old and not readily adaptable ones.  That, in the main, is the reason many redundancies have taken place.  The number of redundancies has perhaps exceeded the number originally envisaged because it was impossible then to realise or envisage in any way how the new venture would work out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, the position was that the parent company called the Industrial Engineering Company Limited was set up.  It established, as it went on, five subsidiaries.  One of them, unfortunately, did not succeed but that was not by reason of limitation of management or otherwise, but because the principal market it had procured for itself was closed, mainly because of political considerations.  I refer of course to the <Col N="258" /> Heinkel or &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; car manufacture. The main market was in the Argentine and for the export of cars in a completely knocked-down condition, that market became unavailable, largely because of political considerations in that country.</P>
    <P>They next had to turn to Britain as being the main export outlet, but by reason of credit restrictions and other factors that arose subsequently, and the re-establishment in Britain of competition with the Heinkel bubble cars, the British market eventually tapered off considerably, so that except for the home market which was far too small to maintain a viable car-manufacturing process in Dundalk, there was no reasonable outlet for the manufacture of Heinkel cars.  Therefore, ultimately Heinkel manufacturing ceased; the Dundalk Company sold the goodwill, and sold whatever parts they had on hand at the time.  However, there are four companies still surviving.  One of them is the Bonzar, which is subject to going into another line of production. It is doing well, though not finding the going very easy.  It did not expect it would find it easy at the beginning because of its being such a new company in a new area.  It is expected that that company will now do much better. There is also the foundry, which is now getting on its feet and it, too, has very good prospects.  Commercial Road Vehicles, the third company, is doing very well.  It undertakes work for different companies, for example, C.I.E., and there are substantial contracts in hand.  Then there is the Dundalk Engineering Works which does a variety of contract engineering work for a variety of firms.  It, also, is doing very well and expects to continue to do well.</P>
    <P>I mention these as an indication that the company has come to the stage when it feels the redundancies it experienced in the past are not likely to recur and that the time has come when the severance payments ought to be ended.  I was only a short time in the Department of Industry and Commerce when I met the combined unions representing the workers, who pressed me to bring this severance payments scheme to an end at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> Overall, of the 967 workers there at the change-over, there are now a total of 789.  It would be wrong simply to subtract that total from the 967, leaving roughly 200, and to assume there have been only 200 redundancies. The fact is that there were many new workers taken on with new skills which were not there before.  They amount roughly to 200.  In the course of the period there was normal wastage through death, retirement and to people leaving Dundalk in any event. About 61 represents the picture in that respect.  In effect, the number of redundancies that had to be provided for by the way of severance payments was about 500.  The prospect now is of continued employment.  The prospects of the company are equally good and the necessity for maintaining this severance and stand-off pay scheme no longer exists.  The company advised me&mdash;and it is the company's responsibility to manage these payments&mdash; that they would be no longer necessary and that they proposed to terminate them by the end of November.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fertiliser project it was not my intention to keep information from the House.  However, the House will realise that the company which has been set up and for whose use the £100,000 represented in this Supplementary Estimate is being made available, will have to carry out long, detailed and in many cases delicate negotiations about inviting, getting and accepting tenders for the building of this factory.  It would be wrong for me to bind them in any way or to disclose information in advance that would embarrass them in any way.  Therefore, the information I was able to give the House was necessarily limited.</P>
    <P>As the House is well aware&mdash;in fact I am personally surprised at the extent of the knowledge of this matter among Deputies&mdash;this is an undertaking that was under review for a very long number of years, going as far back as before the last war.  It was seen then, as it is now, as a very substantial undertaking but I am glad to say that even though it was substantial, we decided to undertake it and we believe that we in Ireland, using our own raw <Col N="260" /> material, can make a good job of it. I need only go back to the immediate past to bring the House up to date on the project.</P>
    <P>A committee was set up to investigate the possibility of producing nitrogenous fertilisers at a competitive price based on milled peat, one of the raw materials to produce ammonia. For that purpose the Blackwater bog in Offaly was reserved.  Bord na Móna said they had the bog almost ready for development and wanted to know what the Government's view was&mdash; whether it would be required for turf production <i>simpliciter,</i> or for electric generation or other uses.  That examination was brought to finality and when, at that stage, the prices of imported nitrogenous fertilisers dropped considerably&mdash;below the prevailing prices and below the prices fertilisers were sold on the markets of the countries of origin&mdash;there was a standstill.</P>
    <P>Our farmers were continuing to enjoy the benefits of these very low prices and the Government decided not to proceed with the plans then proposed but appointed another committee to keep the matter under review and to bring the plans to the stage when the building of the factory could be undertaken if, and when, the prices of imported nitrogenous fertilisers increased to the point of being in excess of the prices for which we could produce them at home.</P>
    <P>During the course of the second committee's deliberations it became obvious that nitrogenous fertilisers produced from a combination of the gasification of fuel oil and the sulphur content of Avoca pyrites would be a very economic undertaking because the prices would compare very favourably with the low prices of imported nitrogenous fertilisers.  We now have the position that, after the most detailed examination, and in consultation with the world-wide and world-famed organisations who are well equipped to advise and who are able, technically and otherwise, to construct factories for the production of nitrogenous fertilisers, the committee examining it are unanimously satisfied that to produce nitrogenous fertilisers <Col N="261" /> based on fuel oil and Avoca pyrites is a good economic proposition, one which would ensure the availability of these fertilisers for our farmers without subsidisation of any kind and at prices comparing favourably with those prevailing.</P>
    <P>In order to get the matter under way, it was found necessary to establish a company.  That company was recently incorporated and the appropriate announcement was made and the names of the members of the company published.  Deputy Cosgrave asked me for the names.  It obviously escaped his attention that there had been publication of the names.</P>

      <P>A Company entitled Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta is being incorporated under the Companies Acts, in pursuance of the decision of the Government, to negotiate binding tenders for a nitrogenous fertiliser factory to be located at Arklow and using fuel oil and Avoca pyrites. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has named the following persons as the first Directors of the Company:</P>
      <P>J. Murphy, Assistant Secretary, Department of Industry and Commerce, who will be Chairman.</P>
      <P>C. J. Byrnes, Principal, Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>J. B. Hynes, Principal, Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In naming Mr. Finegan as Director of the Company, the Minister has taken into account the representations made to him by the National Farmers' Association as to the desirability of having regard to the <Col N="262" /> special interest of the farming community in the factory products.</P>
    <P>There are on the board four civil servants and one representative&mdash;not a nominee&mdash;of the National Farmers' Association.  The function of the board will be to negotiate by tenders with the companies which have already approached them with regard to the setting up of the factory.  These individuals will not necessarily be members of the company which will ultimately operate the factory and which will be set up by subsequent legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  There will be no association with outside manufacturers. At least, that is not envisaged at the moment.  There was a suggestion earlier that a State company <Col N="263" /> would confine itself to the production of ammonia and existing fertiliser manufacturers would buy that ammonia and use it for the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia in their own sulphuric acid plants.  It was not certain, however, that that combined operation would be able to produce the fertiliser at a rate as favourable as the method now proposed.  In any event, the companies did not pursue that matter; they dropped out of the scene.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion some time ago that some private enterprise group might undertake this operation.  Sites were surveyed.  Those interested were not an English company and sites in other countries, including Britain, were also surveyed.  Ultimately, without any regard to the examination in progress by the Irish company as to the possibility of establishing a nitrogenous fertiliser factory here, that company decided to locate their factory in Britain.</P>

      <P>The location, of course, did have regard to the availability of pyrites.  I cannot at this stage indicate&mdash;I am advised by the company that it might embarrass them&mdash; the extent to which they may use pyrites.  The fact is pyrites are being produced at Avoca in excess of the quantity that will be required by the company, but the company will certainly provide a very useful and profitable outlet for the sulphur content of Avoca pyrites.  When pyrites are processed for the production of sulphur, there is another valuable product, sinter or cinter&mdash;I have seen it spelled both ways&mdash;and that is a valuable raw material for the manufacture of steel. The nitrogenous fertiliser company will be interested only in the sulphur content.  It is hoped there will be another outlet for the sinter product.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the production of phosphatic <Col N="265" /> fertilisers.  The State never contemplated production of phosphatic fertilisers because of the ample production of them by private enterprise within the State at the present time.  There is therefore no question whatever of this factory going into competition with private enterprise concerned with producing phosphatic fertilisers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £325,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other Services administered by that Office, and for payment of Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was introducing the Estimate for my Department in May last I said that it contained no provision for payments <Col N="267" /> in respect of television licence fees or for any change in the sound licence fee.  I also said that extra revenue from licence fees could be made available to the Broadcasting Authority only by Vote of this House and that if the television service opened towards the end of this year a Supplementary Estimate would be needed to pay over the proceeds of a television licence fee.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that provision was made in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, that the Authority might be paid in respect of each of the first five years of its existence:</P>
    <P>(a)  a grant equal to the total of the receipts in that year from Broadcasting licence fees less the expenses incurred in collecting those fees and in preventing interference with reception</P>
    <P Just="Center">and</P>
    <P>(b)  a further grant subject to a limit of £500,000 for the five years.</P>
    <P>The latter grant was intended to help the Sound Broadcasting Service to balance income and expenditure during the initial years after the change-over from direct State operation.  Already £278,400 of the total subsidy of £500,000 which may be paid in respect of the period ending 31st March, 1965, has been made available to the Authority.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware the Broadcasting Authority announced several months ago that they expected to commence a regular television service from the Kippure transmitter about the end of December.  It was accordingly decided that holders of television sets would be required to obtain a special television licence as from the 1st January, 1962, and as announced by my Department on the 11th August last this special licence will cover sound as well as television and the fee will be £4 a year.</P>
    <P>Costs of sound broadcasting have been rising and it was therefore necessary to increase the fee for an ordinary radio licence from the figure of 17s. 6d. which was fixed in 1953 to £1 as from 1st September last.  The extra receipts from this source will not make <Col N="268" /> the Sound Broadcasting Service self-supporting but they will help to keep down the draw on the subsidy provision.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the present Supplementary Estimate is to enable my Department to pay over to the Broadcasting Authority the television licence fees which will be collected during the current financial year together with the additional sum resulting from the increase in sound licence fees less, of course, the estimated cost of collection in both cases.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate will not result in any extra charge on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Accurate figures of receipts from licence fees and expenses of collection for the current year will not be available until after the 31st March.  Accordingly the payment to the Authority under Sub-Head K 1 will have to be an estimated figure and an adjustment will have to be made in a subsequent year when precise figures are available.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the special £4 television licence which will come into operation on 1st January next.  A new form of licence costing £1 per annum for Sound Broadcasting will be introduced as from the same date but existing licences will continue in force in respect of Radio sets only until the normal date of expiry.  Television licences and the new Sound licences will be on sale at all Post Offices as from the 1st January, 1962.  Persons who buy a television licence for the first time will normally possess a current licence for sound reception and it has been arranged that such licences may be used in part payment for television licences.  Any person who hands in his existing sound licence at the time of purchase will be allowed a reduction in respect of each month or part of a month which his licence has to run to the date of expiry.</P>
    <P>The reduction will be at the rate of 1s. 6d. or 1s. 8d. per month depending upon whether the unexpired licence costs 17s. 6d. or £1.  For example a person who buys a television licence on 1st January and who surrenders a sound licence which is due to expire on 31st October, 1962 will pay a net £3 3s. 4d.  If a person pays the full £4 <Col N="269" /> fee for a television licence at the time of purchase it will be possible for him to get a cash refund calculated in the same manner but in that case he will have to make a special application to the Head Postmaster of his district and enclose his old unexpired licence.  The more convenient course is to hand up the unexpired sound licence when one is purchasing a Television licence.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Estimate in May last, I mentioned that I had invited certain persons to become members of the Interference Advisory Committee which is provided for in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  The Committee met for the first time in June and it has since been giving the most careful study to the ways and means by which interference with reception may be brought within tolerable limits.  It is a very big question. The sources giving rise to interference are practically endless and it is my intention to limit those sources in so far as it will come within my power to do so.  I understand from the Committee that it should be possible to introduce the first set of regulations towards the end of this year.  Deputies will welcome this positive step but I would emphasise that in making provision for reducing interference the problem is so extensive that progress will necessarily be slow.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the day to day operation of the Sound Broadcasting Service, Radio Éireann has been pressing ahead with all possible speed on the establishment and development of the Television Service.  I shall not go into any details regarding the work involved but I would like to say that the progress made has been quite remarkable and augurs well for the future of Irish television.</P>
    <P>My responsibility for the services Radio Éireann provides is limited to matters specified in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, and I shall not, therefore, treat of matters which are now solely the concern of the Authority.  In this connection I would again ask Deputies seeking information on questions falling within the competence of the Broadcasting Authority to seek that information direct from the Authority.  I am sure that they will find the <Col N="270" /> Director General most anxious to help them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must comment at once on the last sentence of the Minister's statement as being not good enough.  The Minister is asking us to vote moneys for him today and it is not good enough on his part to direct the Members of this House to the Television Authority for information on general principles that are involved. One of the safeguards in relation to State companies, so far as this House is concerned, is that where these companies get certain voted moneys and when the Minister concerned comes into the House to ask for these moneys to be voted, there is an opportunity for the House to review the work involved in that State company.  It was made perfectly clear on the passage of the Broadcasting Authority Bill that in relation to their initial years the House would have the opportunity of reviewing the work of the Authority. Merely because this is a Grant-in-Aid under the terms of the Act and sub-head K.1 of the original Estimates is no reason why the Minister should neglect to fulfil his proper functions in relation to the House.  The House and the people outside are very much in the dark in relation to the working of the Television Authority and this is an opportunity the Minister should have availed of to give some information to the House and, through the House, to the country at large.</P>
      <P>Before I go on to mention some of the information that the Minister should have given, may I ask him to make one thing clear in relation to this question?  On the first of January next a television licence fee of £4 is being introduced.  If a person has a television set in his house and has also a sound broadcasting receiver is it clear beyond question, as I hope it is, that the one £4 fee covers both instruments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was but I have heard some people say they were not clear about it and I think it is desirable to clarify it.  We are all agreed in the House that television will have the biggest impact on our way <Col N="271" /> of life that we have known for a very considerable time.  Some people consider that impact will be of great benefit but there are some things in relation to it we must know and the House has a right to know before it is asked to vote this money.</P>
      <P>Times have changed very considerably since the initial estimates were made in relation to commercial television, in relation to the cost of it, in relation to the expenditure on it and in relation to the revenue that is likely to be received from it.  The Minister should give the House the latest information available in respect of that. In the last six years, for example, the revenue from British commercial television has grown from £5,000,000 a year to £80,000,000 a year.  The Television Commission's report is now quite substantially out of date and I should like to know whether in view of the great rise in commercial television revenue in Britain, the Minister has now got, as he should have, more up-to-date estimates in relation to what revenue is likely to be here.</P>
      <P>I should like to know also, as the position has changed very much since the time of the Television Commission's report, what is the present estimate of the amount of money that will be involved from the Television Authority's point of view in installations, studios, transmitters, and so forth, and what estimate is made of the amount of money that is involved at the present time in the matter of television sets already in operation in the country. I am sure the Minister must have a modern estimate of how many television receivers there are here and the House should be given that number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister also tell us how existing receivers which have been established for what I would call fringe reception are to be converted for purposes of Irish television, whether that involves scrapping the existing receivers or, if not, what the cost of adaptation to Irish standards will be. We are entitled to have some indication of that.  We are entitled to know, for example, whether as from the 1st January the new service which will operate will include a service from <Col N="272" /> Eurovision right from the beginning. Particularly in view of our Common Market discussions, it is vital to know whether we will get the Eurovision link from the very beginning.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what rules have been laid down by the Television Authority in relation to advertising home produced articles and foreign produced articles and whether there is any differentiation between rates for home produced articles and foreign produced articles using the term &ldquo;foreign produced&rdquo; in two different senses: in one sense in relation to those countries with whom we hope to be associated in the Common Market and, in the other sense, in relation to those countries which will be outside the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister also let us know what plans the Television Authority have for utilising the service for the purpose of increasing productivity? The visual means is perhaps the most important educating element in that connection there can possibly be.  We all accept that, unless we are able to increase productivity, we shall find it difficult in the short time available to us to meet the competition that under Common Market conditions we may have to meet.  We should be told what arrangements have been made in co-operation with vocational bodies to ensure that the Television Authority will be utilised to the best advantage, with farming organisations in relation to agriculture and industrial organisations, perhaps, in relation to other matters.  It certainly seems to me that the impact of television can be one that can be used to tremendous advantage in relation to improving our competitive position abroad.</P>
    <P>We have been told that in the beginning there will be approximately a five-hour distribution.  I understand there will be approximately five hours' viewing time.  I should like to know how much of that five hour viewing time will be in respect of live material and how much will be in respect of recorded material.  I should like to know what is proposed in relation to the methods of the utilisation of advertising time.  Let me assure the Minister that I am not the only person <Col N="273" /> who finds that the Television Authority is trying to hide its light under a bushel and not to disclose any of these matters.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Times</i> of November 9th carried a report of a paper read by an advertising firm to an advertising Press meeting at which that person, skilled in his own profession, complained bitterly about the lack of information available and described the situation as being one in which advertisers were being asked to take a pig in a poke.  I think it is fair for the House to expect that we should be given some indication by the Minister before we give a blank cheque in this respect because this is a blank cheque in the sense that it is a grant-in-aid. It will not be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It will be paid over to the company.</P>
    <P>Neither do I know what system the Television Authority has been working in relation to the allocation of its advertising or what is proposed.  That no one in this House knows is also borne out by this gentleman in the advertising service.  It seems to me that the Television Authority has been doing its utmost to try to cloak its activities and prevent people discovering what it proposes.  I cannot see for the life of me what the reason for that is.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, talking as an ignorant outsider in relation to the knowledge of advertising, that the more one publicises the medium that one proposes to adopt and the more one publicises the line of country one proposes to take, the greater will be the chance of getting a satisfactory type of advertiser to take time.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any viewer rating system has been adopted.  I think that is one thing that we should know about.  I do not know whether in relation to the booster stations round the country it is proposed that there will be any regional facilities for advertising or whether an advertiser from Sligo advertising from the Sligo booster station will advertise at a different rate when his advertising would not be any use in the general scheme for viewing in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> I do not know what plans there are for publishing research into viewer rating.  I think we should have been told now also how the programmes will be balanced.  What is proposed in relation to what I understand are called heavy programmes, symphony orchestras and so on?  How are they going to be balanced with &ldquo;Wild West&rdquo; features?  Is it going to be all one or all the other?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the House is entitled to some information on these matters before it votes money under the Act.  Of course, as I said already in the beginning, it is one of these things that was visualised when the Act was being introduced.  More than anything else, I am particularly interested to know what is the position in relation to advertising.  What has been done to make the possibility of people taking time an open competitive matter?</P>
    <P>I want to know whether that has been thrown open to advertisement.  I want to know whether the time made available to advertisers has been offered to all or whether it has only been offered to a select few.  I want to know whether that select few have been selected because of the fact that they got an opportunity to quote before others got such an opportuniy.  I want to know whether some firms got the same opportunity as others to quote at lower prices, as was certainly visualised at an earlier stage, or whether they did not.</P>
    <P>I want to make this perfectly clear. I look at television regularly on a Sunday. I am afraid it is only on a Sunday.  The only programme that I ever really look at and enjoy is a programme on which the Chairman of the Television Authority appears.</P>
    <P>I have for him as an actor in that programme and as a producer of that programme the very highest and greatest admiration and he is welcome to the free advertisement, if he wants it, that that is the programme I enjoy most on television.  But, being a first-class actor and a first-class producer is not at all to say that he is a first-class chairman of a television authority.  That is an entirely different <Col N="275" /> thing.  It is a job that requires administrative as well as acting and producing experience.  The fact that the public have been left so much in the dark and that there is such tremendous complaint amongst the public and amongst the professional people who will be involved, such as advertisers, shows that he is not a good administrator of a television authority.</P>
    <P>Of course, I have said before in this House, and I repeat, that it is not the person concerned whom I blame but the Minister and his Government, that it was a cardinal blunder, a cardinal mistake, to appoint as the Chairman of the Television Authority a person who at one moment would be acting as the buyer of programmes and at another, as the vendor of programmes to that Authority.  No man can serve two masters and neither he nor the other member of the Authority, who, I understand, is doing the same thing, who is acting as a member of the Authority, on the one hand, and, on the other, is producing programmes which he is selling to the Authority through another company, can do so.  That is not the way to get the best value out of the Authority.  I do not blame that other member because the headline was set, not by him, but by the Minister and the Government when they appointed a Chairman of the Television Authority who would act in two different capacities.  It is an entirely wrong and rotten principle and one which the Government should not have countenanced for a minute.</P>
    <P>The sooner the cold light of day and the searchlight of public opinion is let in on the method of allotment of advertising contracts with the Television Authority, the better it will be for everybody concerned and, most certainly, the better it will be for the good name of the Authority itself.</P>
    <P>Nobody is clearer than I am that the attitude some people adopt of sneering at those in politices is a disgusting attitude.  I am proud of being in politics and everybody else should be proud of being a politician.  I do not attack the other director concerned because he is well known as a politician, but I do say that it is very bad <Col N="276" /> indeed that the Chairman and another director should in this way be on two sides of the fence and that advertisers should find it so difficult to get proper information about the essential facts of the development of the new service on 1st January.</P>
    <P>I criticised in the previous Dáil the method by which certain appointments had been made by the Authority.  I criticise them again.  In regard to some things, it would be entirely wrong to say anything but some things and some appointments that have been made by the Authority have done us no credit and the Minister, notwithstanding the terms of the Broadcasting Authority Act, would have been wiser to come to the House and have made good the deficiencies of the Authority up to date. To have had that clear, frank disclosure to this House would have shown that he appreciated his responsibilities under the Act and it would have done a great deal, I believe, to dispel much of the bad feeling that is at present abroad and that will inevitably operate against the success of the service when it starts on 1st January next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to avail of the opportunity afforded by this Supplementary Estimate to pass a few bouquets to the Television Authority and, at the same time, a few brickbats to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker when he says that we must repudiate the implication of the Minister's concluding remarks in his statement here tonight that we should not call him to task to answer for the broad principles upon which the Television Authority is administered.  Those principles, by and large, have been laid down by the Minister himself.  In respect of one of them, I had a Parliamentary Question down here some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in all our semi-State bodies a well-established principle that contracts for work should be put out to public tender.  That principle has not been adhered to by the Television Authority in it entirety and I suggest to the Minister that that is most regrettable and unfortunate.  The headquarters of the Television Authority at present being built at considerable expense out of public moneys, at Montrose <Col N="277" /> in Donnybrook, were not advertised for public tender and it would appear that the consultant architect who is acting for the Television Authority invited three or four building contractors to submit tenders for that contract.  That was not good practice where public moneys are concerned, although it may be sound commercial practice.</P>
    <P>It is up to us in this House to impress upon those administering Irish Television, who may be impatient with the established methods laid down for the administration of public bodies and who may consider that there is too much red tape, that it is not possible for them to reach their target in setting up the service at an early date if they adhere to these principles which I am speaking of, that we in this House want to see to it that where public moneys are concerned, it must be made manifest that work is being given to those who submit the lowest tender and to those who are best equipped to do it.</P>
    <P>In respect of the contracts which have been advertised by the Authority I have heard that in some cases they gave a very short period, a deadline which would make it impracticable for people in the ordinary course of business to submit tenders.  That also is something which I deplore.  I hope it is only necessary to refer to these matters in the House to ensure that we shall have no further grounds for complaint.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am very hopeful for the future of Irish television.  All the implications are that we may expect first-class programmes from the Television Authority.  I say that because it is apparent to a lay person like myself, merely reading the newspapers, that the Authority has gone to pains to secure a first-rate staff, a staff which is technically competent and equipped to provide us with a good television service. I say that I am hopeful for the future of Irish television because the Director General of the Television Authority has made it clear that he is a man of considerable courage and ability.</P>
    <P>I refer in particular to the manner in which he stood up to an unfair and low attack made on him some time ago by the lunatic fringe of the Gaelic <Col N="278" /> revival movement, people who wrote to him and demanded he should give a certain undertaking regarding the knowledge of Irish of the staff he was about to employ.  He replied to their letter in a courageous and forthright manner and did so in the English language.  Because he did so, they had the ill manners to reply to him suggesting that he should have replied in a language which he did not know.</P>
    <P>I admire the manner in which the Director General stood up to these people.  I should like to see more of that attitude manifested by people in similar positions and I believe in the future we will see it.  If we are to reach the stage where persons appointed to the Television Authority are to be subjected to the same farcical tests regarding their knowledge of Irish as operate in other places and State services, then we can throw up our hands for the future of Irish television. We want in the service persons who are technically competent and technically equipped to give us the best possible service.  For my part, I am not at all concerned with whether or not those people can carry out their work through the medium of Irish, provided they do it efficiently and competently.  I would qualify my optimistic hopes for the future of Irish television programmes by this reservation. If we get as much so-called Gaelic culture on the television programmes as we got in the past from Radio Éireann, then there is a pretty poor look-out for us.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that at some of the peak listening periods we have from Radio Éireann Irish programmes to which nobody listens.  The listeners' survey carried out by Radio Éireann some time ago, and published so tardily, makes that manifest.  Deputy Sweetman has raised a few queries about which he would like some further information. I should like to ask the Minister if he can tell us whether the Television Authority has any plans for educational programmes.  In other countries, television is being widely used for educational purposes and is proving to be a splendid aid to modern teaching techniques.  Perhaps it is early yet to start thinking about school programmes for Irish television, but <Col N="279" /> the Authority should be planning on these lines, in consultation with the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the problem regarding the line standard of our television service has been resolved to everybody's satisfaction.  In that connection, I congratulate the Minister and the Authority for the very sensible solution which appears to have been arrived at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the secrecy about television is.  I always thought it was a very forthright, exposed medium of expression and that the secret of television was that it could be seen.  What we have succeeded in getting out of the Government ever since television came into vogue has been nothing but evasion after evasion of any factual statement about the nature of the programmes or the problem.  I am beginning to wonder is there something slightly esoteric in the whole background to the launching of television because it is staggering to discover that the advertising community are completely in the dark about what time will be available and about the manner in which they can tender for or make representations to get periods for their advertisements on the programmes.</P>
      <P>I do not think that we should be on the eve of initiating our television service without having some effective outline available to us regarding the nature and format of the programme.  I listened to my colleague, Deputy Sweetman, talking about the heavy programme as balanced against the light.  I am more worrierd, and I think the public are, too, as to how many siamsa ceoil or rinnce ceoil we are going to have during the course of the day.  They are far more concerned to know what is the nature and balance of the programme and whether we are to have spinning wheels for half the day and knitting needles for the other half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are well aware of the fact that there is a completely distorted balance in sound broadcasting at the moment and there is a genuine concern throughout the country about what we are to <Col N="280" /> get for the £4 which is to be levied on us for the new television licence.  The time has come for the Minister to come from behind whatever screen he is going to use and tell us what is to be put on the screen.  He should tell us whether we are to have a programme in which we will continue to have profiles of embryonic or junior Ministers cast about for the edification of the hard-pressed people in rural Ireland, or whether we are to have a programme of fol-de-dols or fol-de-lals, or a hotch-potch of re-runs of programmes which have appeared elsewhere, or the back end of out-of-date syndicated programmes.</P>
    <P>What is the need for all this secrecy?  Is the Television Authority not something for which there should be a common goodwill?  Is it not something that we want to develop in an effective way?  Is it not something in respect of which the people who, possibly, will have to suffer the ordeal of watching it, should be given some say in the kind of programmes that should be designed?  I feel that in the circumstances surrounding this Television Authority, there has been far too much secrecy and far too much patronage and privilege used in the allocation of posts within it.  I am saying that in a positive, deliberate and responsible way.</P>
    <P>Grave doubt is being created in the minds of the people by the continued secrecy about the administrative end of television, the availability of time, the nature of the advertising programmes, the concept of the serious programmes and, in fact, the general format of the programmes.  I will not say that some of the people connected with the Authority are not people of proven worth and skill in television, but I agree thoroughly that when we are asking this House for a blank cheque, returnable to nobody in the form of accountancy to the Comptroller and Audtior General, we are entitled to know the real purpose.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to get an assurance from the Minister on many things.  We have never been able to hear Radio Éireann in West Cork.  I want an assurance from the Minister that if we are to have television in Ireland, we <Col N="281" /> will be able to see some of it in West Cork.  We are getting no real information at all.  All we see is an occasional snippet in the papers that So-and-So has been appointed to such-and-such a position.  We have no knowledge of how many of the minor positions, the general factotum positions, have been filled.  I believe the reason we have not that knowledge is that the Authority is being used as a ready medium of placing disgruntled and disconsolate supporters who have not been able to get jobs elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not want this type of suspicion to grow, it is time he came out on the screen to tell us what the television programmes are to be, how much time in the day will be devoted to Irish, how much to educational subjects, how much chamber music we are to have, how much will be devoted to children's programmes &mdash;in fact, how much time will be devoted to each type of programme the public will require?  Why does the Minister not tell us?  Surely, if television is to come into operation in January, somebody has the programme format by now?  How much advertising time has already been allotted, in what circumstances and at what prices?  I know the Minister knows that it is generally known that much of the time has already been allocated and that certain people have received preference in the allotment.  Why not tell us why they got into this privileged position?  If it is because of their loyal political background, tell us so; but do not keep us in the dark.</P>
    <P>The Minister ultimately hopes that the revenue from licences will maintain his television authority.  It will not do so if the programmes are not designed in consultation with the people who have to pay the licences and for their entertainment.  I think I am entitled to ask the Minister when are we to get a detailed, specific outline of the type of programmes and their duration. It is time the people who will have to pay the piper, either in advertising fees or in licence fees, were let into the picture.  Why be so secretive about it? Is it that the particular appointments of chairman and directors have involved the Authority in an executive command not already available to the <Col N="282" /> Authority at all and that the busy commercial lives of these people, their own busy participation in other forms of television, has left them without the time to get down to the detail and administration of a programme meant to commence in January?</P>
    <P>I hope this continued hiding of the real nature of the programmes will not militate in any way against the success of television.  I want to see, and always wanted to see, Irish television a conspicuous success.  I have always said that we have here all the necessary ingredients to produce a magnificent television programme: a wide range of able and skilled actors, musicians, narrators and comedians. We have a wealth of traditional dances and songs and we have various natural beauty spots&mdash;all ingredients of a comprehensive and effective programme. Now, on the very eve of the launching of this programme, we are unable to tell anybody what the programme will be.  If we are asked the question; &ldquo;How can you get time on the programme?&rdquo;, you cannot give an answer to it.  I am not going to tell them to see if they can get it by joining a Fianna Fáil cumann.  That seems to be one of the easiest ways to get advertising time with the Television Authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to answer the questions posed.  He will have to give assurances as to what the nature of the programme will be and what the reception will be, particularly in the more remote parts of the country, what we can expect to get for the £4 we will have to pay for the licence&mdash;a licence at the moment, apparently, to look in the dark.  Everybody seems to be afraid to tell us what the future of television will be.  It is farcical that in respect of this most effective medium of advertising and entertainment, the programme format has not been broken down and we are unable to say whether we are to have proper programmes in respect of education, music, language or anything else you like.</P>
    <P>We do not know what programme we will have in relation to sport.  We do not know what type of coverage the various games will get.  We do not <Col N="283" /> know what the design of the whole television programme in general will be.  In those circumstances, we are still asked to vote this large sum of money blindly.  I am making an earnest appeal to the Minister to give this Authority a chance by letting us have a preview of the conception and design of the programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words of a different kind from what has been said in the form of criticism. We cannot expect to know very much about the programmes at this stage. When we see them we will know all about them and know what to criticise. For anyone to say that they should be this and they should be that is nonsense.  I have a family and they all differ and so do the public differ.  My girls want to hear Elvis Presley and no one else.  I have a son who wants to hear only the classics and turns the radio off when he hears Elvis Presley. The kids like to see a cowboy programme. I like Bing Crosby and others like him.  I took my wife to see Macbeth and she hated it and wanted to leave.  I had to hold her there.</P>
      <P>To say what the programmes should consist of is all nonsense.  There will have to be a balance.  We may not like half of it but there will be people who will not like the other half and who will hate what we like.  I am prepared to wait and see the programmes before I criticise them and I think everyone should do the same.  I am satisfied that we have men with experience who know what the public want.  The people who spend money on advertising know what the public want and they know who listens to their programmes by the sales of their goods.  The people who will be running the television service have some experience and they will know.  We will then be free to say what we like when we have seen the programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, I want to say to the Minister that it is a great pity that we cannot have our own television, say, a week in advance of the 1st January. Many people would like to have it over the Christmas.  There will be thousands who would buy a television <Col N="284" /> set for Christmas if they had a few shillings to spare.  They would enjoy seeing the programmes and it is a great pity that it cannot be advanced by at least a week.  I do not know whether or not that could be done but that is my view and the view of many more people.</P>
    <P>With regard to the £4 for the licence, the Minister knows how hard it is to get £1, never mind £4.  There will be a lot of dodging and the Minister knows that too.  Many poor people will find it hard to collect £4. Some people say, &ldquo;They can afford a television set,&rdquo; but I know that many people get one on the family budget. The mother contributes 5/-, the father another few shillings, and one or two sons who are working put up another 2/6d.  That is the answer to people who criticise Corporation tenants for having television sets.  Those people say nothing if they have a few &ldquo;jars&rdquo; but because they get a television set one would swear they were millionaires.</P>
    <P>Asking people to pay £4 is asking too much.  I would suggest to the Minister to make it possible for them to pay it in two sums and not £4 down. The Minister will have plenty of trouble and expense in collecting the £4.  Therefore I would ask him not to have a lump payment of £4, but to break it into two sums of £2 every six months or something like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said when concluding my introductory statement must have been unheard or greatly misunderstood by Deputy Sweetman and another Deputy or two.  I should like to repeat what I did say:</P>
      <P>In this connection I would again ask Deputies seeking information on questions falling within the competence of the Broadcasting Authority to seek that information direct from the Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister is asking the House to vote money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not in any circumstances say that matters of broad policy could not be raised in this House on this Estimate.  If Deputies would think longer over this <Col N="285" /> matter they would, in fact, create a better understanding between themselves and the Authority, and they would become more familiar with its work if they sought information in relation to the daily operations of the Authority from the Authority itself.  I thought that I should direct their attention to the matter.  I feel that, this being a new Authority dealing with television which, it is admitted, is bound to have a tremendous effect upon the public mind and the public character, the Government were very wise in their decision to establish an independent Authority to carry out this work.</P>
      <P>Deputies, and particularly new Deputies, may not fully understand that my powers, as Minister, to interfere with the daily operations of the Authority are limited under the Act passed here by the Oireachtas, and that I, as Minister, have endeavoured since this Authority was established to lay down a code of conduct between the Authority, the Department and myself.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise, as strongly as I possibly can, the good that will flow from a better understanding of the relations that should exist between the Authority, the Minister and the Oireachtas.  My authority to intervene is limited.  The Minister's power to interfere or to intervene in the affairs of the Authority are restricted under the Act.  When the Bill was going through the Oireachtas I said I would endeavour, in establishing the Authority, to give it full freedom of action in making its decisions regarding the administration of the service which would be placed under its control. I told the House that I had no authority whatsoever to intervene in the day-to-day administration of the broadcasting service, that the Authority was being given a particular job to do, and that I did not intend to interfere unnecessarily by asking for detailed information unless I had some very good reasons for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand Deputies complaining here that they are in the dark in relation to the affairs of the Authority.  The Director General gave a Press Conference and made public statements on several occasions in regard to what he hoped the Authority <Col N="286" /> would achieve.  In my opinion he gave a clear indication to the public as to the job he had on hand, how he proposed to proceed with the business of establishing this new Authority and to carry out the work with which he is charged under the Broadcasting Authority Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked me about the accounts of this Authority.  I would remind him that the accounts of the Authority for the ten months ended March, 31st last must be furnished by the Authority under Section 25 (2) of the Act.  The section says that the accounts shall be audited within 90 days of the end of the period or such time as the Minister may allow after that.  The accounts of the Authority this year have not been laid on the Table of the Houses of the Oireachtas because there was a delay in having them prepared, but I can tell the House that the accounts will be presented very soon and the Dáil will have every opportunity of examining them.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say, as Deputy Sweetman said, that money has been paid over and no account rendered of how it has been spent.  The Authority is obliged to make a report each year to the Minister, in addition to giving its accounts.  Section 26 of the Act directs the Authority to make to the Minister a report of its proceedings during the preceding year and that the Minister shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The Authority proposes, with my agreement, to give a report of its proceedings for the ten months up to March 31st, 1961, at the same time as it furnishes the accounts for the same period.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I do not see how any Deputy could think, or how anybody else could think, that we are being kept in the dark in relation to the affairs of this Authority.  In its appointments, the Authority must follow the procedure laid down in the Act and it therefore is not true to say, as Deputy Seán Collins alleged, that persons were being appointed because of their political affiliations.  I want to deny that emphatically.  Advertisements appear in the daily papers regularly <Col N="287" /> for staff.  The Authority, of course, took over the staff of Radio Éireann as it stood and then proceeded to advertise in order to get a competent staff for television.  I am quite satisfied that the Authority has been following the terms of the Act in the employment of staff.</P>
    <P>A complaint was made that advertisers were kept in the dark in relation to advertising time and advertising terms.  There were allegations that certain people were getting preferential treatment in relation to advertising time on the service.  I would point out that this is all laid down on the rate card which was circulated to all advertising agencies.  It carries the full details of the method of application, the rates charged, the time allocated, the preferential rate that is applicable to Irish advertisers, and it gives all the information necessary for any person interested in having his goods advertised.  Beyond that, I think the charge that advertisers have been kept in the dark is unfounded and uncalled for.  I do not know why such an allegation should have been made.</P>
    <P>The service is a new one which, in its establishment, involved many difficulties.  A new Bill had to be introduced; authority had to be given to the Government to establish an independent body; and we naturally had to look around in order to get people who knew something about television to supplement the information already available in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the senior officers of which had made a detailed study of television over a number of years and were, accordingly, in a position to advise the Government.</P>
    <P>It was quite natural for the Government to select as Chairman a man of the standard and calibre of Éamonn Andrews.  I am not making any apology to the House or to anybody else for his appointment.  I believe the general public agree that the Government did the proper thing in that respect, that they were well advised to seek the assistance of someone like Éamonn Andrews and to appoint him as Chairman of the authority.  I do not think the Chairman of the Authority <Col N="288" /> wishes me to defend him in this House. He is quite capable of defending himself, but it is a recognised procedure in the House that persons who are not here to defend themselves cannot properly be charged in the House with misdemeanours or with making use of official time to benefit themselves. I am surprised that such tactics were adopted here by members of the Opposition in relation to the Chairman of the Authority and to another member of it.</P>
    <P>In so far as the capital expenditure is concerned, I was asked if the estimates circulated at the time the Bill was being passed were those upon which the Authority was now working and whether they were sound or otherwise. I should like to say, for the benefit of new Deputies particularly, that provision is contained in the Act for making repayable advances not exceeding £2 million in the aggregate for capital purposes, including working capital.  It was felt at the time that £1,500,000 would be sufficient for establishing the service, including the erection of the five transmitters, and that the balance of £500,000 would be used for other capital services.  Present indications are, however, that capital expenditure before transmissions commence will be somewhat higher than the original estimate of £1,500,000 and may, indeed, exhaust the full amount of £2 million.  Estimates of current expenditure are offset by the £4 licence fees which we hope will apply to 94,000 sets.</P>
    <P>With regard to the programme, I agree with Deputy Sherwin that it is better to wait and see.  It is too early yet to know what the Authority can put on.  A great deal will depend on the financial success, or otherwise, of the venture.  A great deal will depend then on the income of the Authority from television licence fees and commercial advertising.  It is my wish, and the wish of the Government, that the programmes should be of a very high standard and generally acceptable.  We are establishing an Irish television service and it would be my wish that we should have a live programme acceptable to all our viewers.  We are, however, limited in our resources and limited in our population in regard to <Col N="289" /> the provision of entertainment.  In essence, this programme will be one of entertainment.  We also intend to have an educational programme to induce our people to greater effort in the national endeavour to increase productivity. That, too, will be conditioned by the amount of money available.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Act for the establishment of advisory committees and it is my intention, after consultation with the Authority, to set up these committees.  It is unfair to speculate.  We must wait before passing judgment on the programmes. Next year, on the Estimate, we will be in a better position to evaluate the work of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy S. Collins asked if West Cork would get reception.  A transmitter is being erected at Bally-vourney. Until the transmitter is in operation, it will not be possible to find out what particular pockets of the country are blind.  That problem will be one for the engineers and the technical side of the service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin suggested that the licence fee should be collected by instalments.  I wish that could be done. Unfortunately, the cost of collection is very high, and the collection of the fee by instalments would have the effect of increasing the collection costs which are already high.  I cannot, therefore, subscribe to the Deputy's proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that housing legislation should be reviewed with particular reference to the following matters: (a) the hardship caused by the operation of the differential renting system by Dublin Corporation; (b) the need for a scheme of rates remission for S.D.A. house purchasers which will ease their burden for a period of not less than eighteen years; and (c) the need for continued maintenance of county council cottages during the periord when tenants are purchasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is something of a coincidence that almost exactly ten years ago, on 31st October, 1951, I moved a motion in somewhat similar terms.  It dealt with the differential rent scheme applicable to the tenants in the Ballyfermot area. Since then, not much change has taken place, except that the position of these tenants, so far as the differential renting system operated by the Dublin Corporation is concerned, has, if anything, worsened.  In the course of that debate my chief antagonist was Deputy Briscoe, the Lord Mayor of Dublin.  I am sorry he is not here tonight. I understand he is interviewing <Col N="291" /> the Mayor of Southbend, Indiana, and possibly will go on to Moosejaw in Nebraska.  We here must consider the problems of our people in Ireland and one which concerns upwards of 50,000 people living in Dublin City.</P>
    <P>There are some 18,000 houses rented by Dublin Corporation under the differential rent system.  I am sure that in most counties throughout the country there is some form of differential rents or a graded rent scheme so that Deputies will be aware of what is meant in general terms by &ldquo;differential rent.&rdquo;  The idea of differential rent originated in progressive minds, notably in the mind of one of the greatest men this country has ever seen, the late James Larkin.  I think it was he who first propagated the idea, with which any reasonable man would agree, that a tenant living in a local authority house whether under Dublin Corporation or any other local authority who was in difficulties, who was ill, unemployed or an old age pensioner or a widow, should not be required to pay as high a rent as a tenant who was employed and whose income could be said to be fairly substantial.</P>
    <P>That was the basic concept underlying the proposal of differential rent. But that concept has been corrupted and twisted out of recognition so that we have to-day in Ballyfermot&mdash;which is the largest housing area in Ireland, North or South, 5,000 Corporation houses and a population of some 40,000 to 50,000 men, women and children&mdash; a differential rent system which has come to be hated by every person in that scheme.</P>
    <P>It may be said that on previous occasions when I was associated with the official Labour Party that I defended&mdash;as I did&mdash;the principle of differential rent but the principle I sought to defend&mdash;and I am sure others also &mdash;when we were first trying to implement it was that to which I have adverted, the simple idea that persons who are needy or badly hit should not be required to meet the same charges in respect of housing as persons in better circumstances.  But over the years it has developed in such a fashion that it has been manipulated by those represented in Dublin Corporation as <Col N="292" /> they are represented in every local authority throughout Ireland whose sole concern is not the overriding drive or thought to house the working people at the lowest possible rents but whose sole concern is entirely different&mdash;to maintain rates at as low a level as possible. This differential rent system has been developed in such a way that the working class people of Dublin, in that huge reservoir of labour which keeps the wheels of industry turning in this city, that huge mass of workers living in Ballyfermot, are literally suffering as a result of this system.</P>
    <P>What are the main objections to it? The first is the inquisition that the system entails.  The tenant who applies to Dublin Corporation for a house&mdash; if he qualifies for it and gets it after the long and difficult period through which he must go&mdash;before qualifying must have a certain number in family, be living in a slum or in overcrowded conditions or be eligible on health grounds or in some other way.  He is provided with a form which he fills in and he must undertake in signing that form that he will do either of two things&mdash;pay the maximum rent or tell the Corporation every single detail of every halfpenny that he earns and that every member of his family earns. That is the inquisition and that is what goads and troubles the people.</P>
    <P>In my view there is something unconstitutional about it.  There is something about the whole idea of probing into the very innermost secrets of family income that savours&mdash;smells, I should say&mdash;of invasion of privacy and if our Constitution does not protect the privacy of the home and the individual it is of little use to us.  But that is a matter which I hope soon to test outside this House.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to Deputies who may be interested in this problem an undesirable situation that can be created by the operation of this system. The Corporation system is based principally upon the assessment of rent in the first instance on the income of the principal earner or, as he is described in Corporation documents, &ldquo;the income-producer.&rdquo;  I should like to quote, with your permission, the <Col N="293" /> following passage from this circular which was issued to tenants by the Corporation:</P>
    <P>Within the maximum and minimum limits rent will be assessed at one-sixth of the combined family income and will be rounded off to the nearest threepence in every case. The rents of tenants who have been allotted dwellings under the Newly-Weds-Scheme will be assessed at one-fifth and rounded off to the nearest threepence.</P>
    <P>The combined family income is arrived at by taking that of the principal income-producer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is a point I should like Deputies to examine</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;(whether father, mother, son, daughter, etc.) and reducing it by 10s.  To this is added the income of every other member of the household, ignoring the first 5s. in each case, and subject to a maximum of £2 in each case.  State and other allowances, with the exception of Children's Allowances, are taken into the calculation.</P>
    <P>I do not expect Deputies, who have not had an opportunity to examine that in detail, to grasp how it works out in the ultimate.  The mere summary that I have given of how the assessment is arrived at shows the stage of perplexity to which the system has developed but I should like to stress the point that the principal income-producer may be father, mother, son, daughter, etc.  It could even be somebody who is a brother-in-law or sister-in-law living in the house.  I want Deputies to visualise the unbalance of family authority such a situation can create and to my personal knowledge has created in Ballyfermot at any rate, where the father of a family falls sick and becomes unemployed.</P>
    <P>Say the father is a labourer earning about £8 or £9 a week and the son a tradesman earning £10 or £12 a week, the son becomes the principal income-producer and thereby the head as it were of the household, or it might be the daughter.  That situation can, as any reasonable person will very well appreciate, lead to difficulties, family disturbances and unpleasantness.  These <Col N="294" /> are things for which no Dáil, no Parliament and no authority can ever legislate to determine.  The Constitution says the family is the principal social unit upon which the State is built but here Dublin Corporation, or any other authority which is similarly trying to operate such a scheme, is creating a situation whereby the traditional authority of the parent may be subordinated or upset and families may have difficulty and do, in fact, have difficulty and trouble thereby.</P>
    <P>The time has come for Dublin Corporation to examine this whole scheme and take into account the hundreds of complaints which they have received since they first introduced it.  I have been forced to the conclusion, from contacts with people and from their explanations and complaints to me and I am sure to other Members, as to how this scheme works, that it is anathema and hateful to them and must end.</P>
    <P>Take another aspect of it.  For a four-roomed house the maximum rent charged is 33/- a week.  For a five-roomed house it is 36/6d. and for a six-roomed house 40/-.  The 40/- rent applies to a very limited number. The 36/6 rent applies to not so large a number but the rent of 33/- which is the average maximum, if I may use that expression, applies to a very large number.  How is that rent arrived at? Coming up to Christmas time, many firms in the city have developed a custom of paying Christmas bonuses to their workers.  It may be a production bonus or it may be something in the nature of an expression of appreciation of the service given by workers to their employers.  At any rate, a number of workers get what are known as Christmas bonuses in order to help them and their families over Christmas.  They do not amount to a whole lot.  It may be £10, £20 or £30.  You can imagine that, while they are welcome, these bonuses do not go very far towards creating a too joyful spirit for, say, a man, his wife and five or six children.</P>
    <P>These bonuses are a help but what do Dublin Corporation do?  One would think if normally under the differential rents scheme a man's rent <Col N="295" /> was based on one-sixth, that after all these actuarial calculations, and so on, are made, and when the rent is normally 25/-, Dublin Corporation would be content to say during Christmas week when the man gets the bonus: &ldquo;We will put your rent up to the maximum of 33/-&rdquo; They do not do that.  They say: &ldquo;We will average it over the year and we will put it up to the maximum for so many weeks as we can average it out for.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have a communication from Dublin Corporation.  I sought to inquire from the Corporation what standard they used in this business of averaging Christmas bonuses, production bonuses or overtime.  The man may earn overtime for one, two or three weeks in the year and the Corporation say that wherever possible tenants are assessed on their total annual income expressed as a weekly average.  Some tenants are on quarterly or half-yearly averages in accordance with their individual circumstances.  In other words, if a man earns overtime for one month in the year and if it suits the Corporation they will average out the overtime to ensure that they receive from that man a maximum rent.</P>
    <P>Let me take an example of what the differential rent means, and this is not by any means a bad example.  It is just a typical one of a father who is earning £10:13:10 as a tradesman, who has served five years in order to learn his trade and who is married with six children of whom the eldest is fourteen years.  He pays £1:9:0 a week rent.  He pays 17/- a week in travelling by bus from Ballyfermot to his work in Blackrock.  It takes no account of the bus fares paid for his children if they have to go to school into the city or bus fares paid by his wife if she wishes to go into the city to shop where she will get things cheaper than in the suburb of Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>The document which the Corporation provides gives information as to how much it costs to build houses.  I notice the figure of £1,500 is mentioned as the cost of a house.  There are many hundreds of tenants in Ballyfermot paying the maximum rent of 33/- and in twenty years they will have paid <Col N="296" /> almost £1,700 without any ownership rights, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>I want to put this point to those economists who worry about wage increases and who accuse the workers of creating all sorts of trouble by looking for wage increases.  For every pound a worker in Ballyfermot receives he must pay 3/4d. in rent.  Is it not reasonable to think that workers in that area, when they go to their union meetings and consider wage increases or wage demands, will try to get the maximum amount having in mind that they must pay that amount at the beginning before they can get a shilling to benefit their families?  In other words the system, as it is operated, has an inflationary tendency.  It may be a side effect but it definitely creates an inflationary effect and, from that point of view, can be criticised as well.</P>
    <P>These tenants are not even in the position of tenants in council cottages who at least are given the right to purchase. After a certain number of years, they can be said to have established a certain interest in their cottages which may be saleable.  That does not apply at all to the tenants in Ballyfermot, Finglas, Rathfarnham or anywhere else.  It does not seem that the Corporation have any plans in that connection.  In the particular debate of ten years ago to which I refer, Deputy Briscoe suggested that the Corporation were taking steps to enable tenants to purchase.  It has not been done.  Ten years have elapsed; the rent has increased; and nothing has been done. The Corporation maintain that if the tenants own the houses, they would have to maintain them.  I have the case of a man who asked to have a maintenance job done two and a half years ago.  Each year he reapplied to have the job done but it still remains undone.  The position as far as maintenance in the Corporation is concerned is behindhand.  It may well be that this is due to an inadequacy of staff. But the problem is there, anyway.  The point is that while tenants are paying these high rents, they have not the compensation of a speedy and adequate maintenance section.</P>
    <P>It is interesting, too, to consider that, in 1960, the housing estate of Dublin <Col N="297" /> Corporation, by which is meant all the houses from which Dublin Corporation receives income, contributed almost £2,000,000.  One would think that, having regard to that huge amount of revenue, some consideration might be given to the unfortunate people who live so far away from the centre of the city in this huge concentration of working-class dwellings. Every effort should be made to try to make life as easy for them as possible. That does not seem to be the attitude. The attitude seems to be to get as much as possible from the tenants.</P>
    <P>What I ask for in so far as this section of my motion is concerned is that this House should look upon the matter sympathetically.  When differential renting was first introduced, it was introduced with the best possible intentions and by well-intentioned people.  The city manager, Mr. Mahony, is one man who contributed more to the solution of housing in this country than any other man, with the exception of the late Deputy T. J. Murphy.  It is being administered with the best intentions.  The time has come when we should review, as I ask in this motion, housing legislation generally.</P>
    <P>The body of legislation which is now on the Statute Books has more relation to a situation which has largely passed than to the present position. Anybody who was a member of a local authority in 1948 or in the immediate post-war years will agree that the situation now is not at all comparable. In those years, those of us who were concerned with trying to get houses built in the terrible back-log of demands built up during the war lived night and day with the housing problem. The legislation of those days reflected that problem.  In many cases, that is now out of date.  Ideas which were beautiful in their concept then have not workerd out in practice.  Differential renting is one of these.</P>
    <P>I should mention, too, how out of date certain regulations are in Dublin. There still exists a priority under the housing regulations for people who suffer from tuberculosis.  Tuberculosis has, thanks be to God, been pretty well got under control in Dublin.  I assume from what I heard here today that a <Col N="298" /> similar situation exists in the rest of the country&mdash;thanks largely to the efforts of Deputy Dr. Browne when he was Minister for Health.  It is universally admitted that that situation still remains and that tuberculosis sufferers have priority over others who, perhaps, in these modern times are more deserving.  I am asking that this whole question of the housing legislation should be reviewed so as to bring it up to date.  How that may be done, I will suggest in a moment.</P>
    <P>I understand that my time is somewhat limited as mover of the motion. I do not want to trespass on the rules of the House.  At the same time, I should like to mention the various matters contained in this motion.  I think it is very essential to strike at the roots of many of the problems.</P>
    <P>I should like to come to the question of the proposal for the remission of rates for people who are house purchasers. In the Dublin suburbs, there are some £12 million invested in houses built under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  This amount was provided by means of loan by Dublin County Council, in the main, and by Dublin Corporation as well. Anybody who journeys through the suburbs and sees the vast housing areas, which are a credit to the people who live there, will appreciate that herein is a colossal number of people who have been housed.  They are people who are striving as best they can to purchase these houses.</P>
    <P>Most people who avail of the Small Dwellings Act loans in Dublin can be said to fall into the category of newlyweds. Under the present dispensation of the corporation and the county council, they get a remission of rates which works roughly on this principle: they pay one-twentieth of the rates in the first year; two-twentieths in the second year and so on until 10 years elapse and then they have to pay full rates.</P>
    <P>I suggest that when they come to pay the rates in the tenth year, that is the time of greatest difficulty for the family because the children are in the neighbourhood of eight or ten years of age.  The people I speak of are people who believe, and rightly so, in <Col N="299" /> large families.  These families in the tenth year could be said to be reaching the most expensive stage.  I am thinking in terms of the cost of education and the cost of clothing.  Everybody knows that children of that age are possibly less careful of their clothing than they are at a later age.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that the Minister should try to provide some help to the local authorities, Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  The period when the people in these purchase estates who avail of the Small Dwellings Act loans most need help in the form of a remission of rates is from the eighth to the sixteenth or eighteenth year.  That is the time when the children are growing up; that is the time when they are most demanding. Life is most demanding in every possible way and ever consideration and help should be given to the families concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much.  Let me come now to my final point.  I am glad to see that the Labour Party are taking an interest in it because it is of paramount importance to the tenants of rural cottages. In County Dublin, we have 4,500 cottages provided by the county council for rural dwellers&mdash;labourers' cottages, as they are called.  From time to time, legislation has been passed in this House to enable such tenants to purchase their cottages.  Due to the efforts of the last Labour Minister in the inter-Party Government, tenants were afforded an opportunity to purchase houses at 50 per cent. of the rents existing at that time and any tenant today who is paying 12/-, 14/-, £1 or 30/-, may avail of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases under the differential <Col N="300" /> rents scheme, that I have talked about as it affects Dublin Corporation, the tenants in county council labourers' cottages are paying 30/- and 33/- a week.  They may get a 50 per cent. reduction by applying to purchase and large numbers of them have done so. I would say 2,000 to 3,000 is the number in County Dublin who have done so.  In some cases they did that as long as five to eight years ago.  The snag is that when they purchase, the tenants become liable for repairs.  In addition, the local authority reserves to itself the right, if it so chooses, to send an engineer into the cottage to tell the tenant what repairs must be done and the tenant must get them done and cannot argue about it.  That is wrong.  As we all know, the tenants may be people in very poor circumstances.  They may be old age pensioners or widows.  In rural areas they may be farm labourers, members of that dying race, who are flying from the country as fast as they can go.  You will find them in labourers' cottages if you find them at all.  They are badly paid.  How are they to find the money to repair their cottages if they need repair?  There is no place to which they can turn to get the money.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting in this regard that there is an omission from legislation which affects such cottage tenants and which must be remedied, that there should be a provision whereby the Government would enable local authorities to repair rural cottages during the period of purchase.  The essential point is that the purchasing tenant does not finally own the cottage until the end of the purchase period which in some cases may be 30, 40 or even 49 years.</P>
    <P>The question, of course, will be asked, where is the money to be found for this?  There is underlying all housing problems a scandal which sooner or later will be tackled, if not by this Government, I hope by some Government of the future, that is, the scandal of usury, where public authorities who seek money to build houses for the Irish people have to pay interest rates to the banks, to private institutions, which have no moral justification whatsoever, at a level which is extortionate, wrong and a level of robbery.  There <Col N="301" /> might be, perhaps, in the long run, the solution of many of our problems.</P>
    <P>The immediate problem and the one that I want to urge on the Minister and on the House is that housing legislation is in urgent need of review. Steps should be taken to set up a Committee of the House, I would suggest, to review it because housing is not something about which we can quarrel.  Nearly every Party, even the most reactionary people in this House, have come to regard it as their duty to press for housing.  That is a good thing and thanks be to God for it. Even some who could be said to have been reactionary at the turn of the century agree that housing must go on.  Let us then resolve to do the best we can to bring the housing machinery up to date.  I would ask the Minister to set up a Committee of the House or to take some steps to bring about the reforms which I have mentioned, the abolition, once and for all, of differential renting and the substitution of some system of graded renting which seems to be working well in some counties.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that in the assessment of rent in any instance the only income that should be taken into account is that of the head of the family and let no influence be brought to bear on the family which may disturb the happy relations which normally exist in Irish households.</P>
    <P>The question of remission of rates is one of urgency.  So also is the other matter I have mentioned about labourers' cottages.  I am handicapped for lack of time in dealing with this matter.  I could talk for a long time in far more detail about it.  Perhaps effective and good work could be done by such a Committee and I urge the matter very strongly upon the Minister and upon all members of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If you please, Sir. I know there are many Deputies who wish to speak on this motion.  I feel it is a very reasonable motion and one which the House should consider. Deputy Dunne has suggested that, perhaps, a Committee of this House is a method of dealing with this review and it is a suggestion which I think is well worth examining, but, whether it is the Minister who carries out the review or a Committee of this House, it is important that this Dáil in the very early stages of its existence should take immediate steps to review <Col N="303" /> housing legislation, as is suggested in this motion.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is sufficiently appreciated that there has been in recent years a disastrous decline in housing in the Dublin area.  The number of houses built by the Dublin Corporation in the last year for which I have been able to get figures was 277. About five years ago, it was running at the rate of about 1,500 a year and in the past four or five years, there has been a disastrous decline in the number of houses built.  I do not know who is responsible for that, whether it is the Dublin Corporation or whether it is the Government, but, whoever is responsible for it, it is something we should immediately take note of and it is a trend we should immediately arrest and reverse.</P>
      <P>As anyone who is conversant with conditions in Dublin knows, there are appalling housing conditions in the city of Dublin.  There are thousands of people living in condemned dwellings who will have to wait years before they are rehoused.  There is appalling overcrowding in the existing housing schemes.  To my own knowledge, there are as many as 16,000 people living in two-bedroom houses in the Cabra area. These are the sort of conditions which we permit in this society and which we should take immediate steps to alleviate.</P>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate the form this review of legislation will take but I feel that in reviewing our existing housing legislation, we should ensure that methods of acquisition are speeded up, that houses and flats are made available to those living in appallingly overcrowded and insanitary conditions and that these steps are taken with the minimum of delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion refers to a review in relation to the differential rents system and I support the concept that this system which has been operating for some years should be reviewed and altered.  There is no doubt that the present system of differential renting is causing a considerable amount of injustice in this city and a great deal of hardship.  As has been suggested, <Col N="304" /> we would be well advised to bring in some sort of system of graded rents and avoid the inquisition that goes on at present with persons who suffer the rigours of the differential renting system.  If at present a man's wages go up by sevenpence, if he happens to work a couple of hours overtime, this is spotted and attention is directed to it.  Perhaps months later he finds himself with a considerable bill for increased rent which he is not able to meet.  I feel it has bad social consequences, consequences very frequently which cause jealousies and rivalries between neighbours, and the sooner it is changed the better.</P>
    <P>A matter which I do not think the Minister realises operates under the system is this: if a person gets compensation for an injury, if he suffers an injury in an accident and is compensated for a broken leg or a period in hospital and for the pain and suffering he has undergone, and perhaps has to undergo in the future, that compensation is treated as income and his rent is accordingly adjusted.  At present if a man gets £1,000 the Dublin Corporation treat that as income, at the rate of £4 10s. per week, which is added on until the £1,000 is wiped out.  This is one of the unjustifiable aspects of the scheme which is operated.</P>
    <P>At present there is a system of allocating houses for newly-wed couples.  That system has now almost become a farce because a person who is lucky enough to draw a house may be middle-aged before he finally gets the house.  There are extraordinarily long delays, even for people lucky enough to get what is alleged to be priority in the newly-wed scheme.  In fact, if a person is midway down the list it will be years before he is housed under the scheme.  It is happening all the time.  The young married couples go to their homes, usually in Corporation areas, families increase and a great deal of overcrowding conditions occur and, for many years, considerable hardships and suffering are caused in the family as a result.  The sooner this situation is remedied the better.</P>
    <P>One of the serious social problems which we have in this city is our <Col N="305" /> housing problem.  It is nonsense to suggest that our housing needs are nearly met.  The sort of figures which are given from time to time may apply in certain rural areas; they certainly do not apply in the city of Dublin. All the time there is a need for new houses and the decline in housing in the last four or five years in the city is something which must be arrested if we are to bring about decent social conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two amendments to the motion.  Is Deputy Casey moving his amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;Corporation&rdquo;, in line 3, to insert &ldquo;and other local authorities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>To my mind, and I hope the Minister shares my point of view on this, a motion such as that tabled by Deputy Dunne should be regarded from the aspect that at least the Dáil has come to the point where it can deal with the matter of rents rather than being forced, as it was over the years, as Deputy Dunne pointed out, to deal with the vital matter of providing houses.  The fact that we have come to the stage where we can go into the niceties of rents charged by local authorities should be regarded as indicative of the progress made in the rehousing of the working classes. Whenever we discuss housing we should, whatever the political party to which we belong, be able to pay tribute to successive Governments which down the years have grappled with this problem, and, by and large, have made tremendous strides forward in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In saying that, I should like to issue a word of warning that I should not be taken as urging that this or any other Government should be complacent in approaching the ultimate and final solution to our housing problem. Nevertheless, any of us, in any political Party, who has addressed himself to this problem should now and again give himself a clap on the back and say that in our time, and in the time of our predecessors, certain progress <Col N="306" /> was made.  We can be well proud of that.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the mover of the motion will accept this amendment because it is designed primarily to extend the scope of the debate and to enable other speakers, who are not directly concerned with the renting system of the Dublin Corporation, to pinpoint the conditions that apply to differential rent systems in their own areas.  The Minister must be well aware of the deficiencies inherent in the multifarious systems of differential rents that apply in the different local authorities.  I am sure he is well aware of this because it is outside the ambit of any county or city manager to implement any system of differential rents without getting the sanction of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to say on behalf of the Labour Party that, fundamentally and basically, we are in favour of a system of renting which takes into account the capacity of the tenant to pay.  You can call that a differential rent scheme, or a graded rent scheme, or anything else but, fundamentally and basically, we always said, and we say now, that the qualifications for any working class man to get a house should not be based on his ability to pay but rather on his own needs, and the needs of his family, for decent housing.  I think that that view is largely shared by every Deputy.  It has been adopted by successive Governments but I think we have been so obsessed with the problem of building the houses, of clearing the slums and giving our people decent living standards, that no Government have had time to examine in detail or to extract from the information available what might be regarded as a fair, equitable or Christian method of assessing rents in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne forcefully pointed out the conditions applying to the differential rent scheme as operated by the Dublin Corporation and he was aghast to note that in certain instances the maximum rent is 40/- a week.  All I can say to that is that in Cork Corporation we have a differential rent scheme in which the maximum rent is <Col N="307" /> 50/- a week, plus any increase in rates. Tenants of Cork Corporation are paying as much as 52/- or 53/- a week for a local authority house, irrespective of the accommodation in the house.  At least in Dublin, if you occupy a one-room flat, the maximum you can be charged, irrespective of income, is 12/6d.; in respect of a two-roomed dwelling, 17/6d.; in respect of a three-roomed dwelling, 29/6d., and so on up to a six-roomed dwelling at 40/-, plus nothing in respect of rates.  The unfortunate position with the Cork Corporation is that whether it is a one-, two- or six-roomed dwelling, the maximum rent applicable is charged &mdash;50/- in the case of the six-roomed dwelling&mdash;plus any increase in the rates.</P>
    <P>We could take up a lot of time telling how hard this system pinches toes in our particular constituencies, but I do not think it is necessary to do that to impress on the Minister that the time is ripe to review the whole system of differential rents.  Let us not have the situation whereby the Minister gives his global benediction to systems of that sort and then allows every local authority&mdash;in practice, of course, every county and city manager&mdash;to choose the method he will adopt.</P>
    <P>Some time ago&mdash;I do not know whether it was during the term of office of the previous Government or the Government who preceded them&mdash;I sought in a Parliamentary Question details of the various differential and graded rent systems applicable to the various local authorities.  I did not think I was going to put the officers of the Department to such trouble.  I thought such information would be readily available and that there would not be such differences in the scheme. On the day the question was tabled, the Minister told me he was having the information collected and would convey it to me.  It took months to collect, so different were the systems applying to each local authority. Several letters had to pass between the Minister and myself before I got the information I sought.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that members of the Minister's Party who are members of <Col N="308" /> local authorities have in their own Party conclaves with the Minister, at meetings of their parliamentary Party, brought to his notice the very serious shortcomings of the systems applicable to their local authorities.  I hope they have brought to his notice the very definite hardships these various systems have created for the ordinary working class man and his family dependent mainly on social welfare benefits.  I do not think it is necessary for us to quote individual cases where the differential rent systems have operated harshly against ordinary people.  I am sure the Minister must have sufficient evidence to know that at least something is warranted.  I do not expect him, like a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat, to be able to pull an ideal system out of his hat.  The motion says that the House is simply expressing an opinion that the present legislation should be reviewed with a view to redressing very serious shortcomings&mdash;the three most obvious ones which operate at the moment.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept this motion in the spirit in which it is presented, simply asking him to review the situation, not claiming that he should be in a position to have a solution here and now.  I hope he will institute some committee or some means of investigating the problem and of bringing to this House proposals for the solution of these difficulties that can be examined rationally, clearly and, I hope, constructively.</P>

      <P>I propose to move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the motion the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and that the tenant will have the right to refuse to vest the cottage if he is not satisfied with its condition of repair.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give the right to the tenant of a rural cottage not to accept the vesting of the cottage under certain conditions. It is well known that under the Act which operated for many years the tenant initially applied for purchase of the cottage.  Eventually the tenant was informed by the local authority that <Col N="309" /> the cottage had been put in proper repair.  Then the tenant had the right to refuse to sign the final form accepting the responsibility of vesting if he believed the cottage had not been put in proper repair.  Under that system the tenant had at least some protection. Now, for some years back, that has been changed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister may make the case that in some counties there are different legal opinions in this matter. I am aware that, not alone in County Cork but in other counties as well, a concession is given to a person who wishes to purchase.  The only concession is that the cottage will be put in repair.  It is common knowledge to all members of local authorities that those tenants who are not prepared to avail of vesting will not get repairs done.  These tenants are then in the difficulty that they have no alternative but to apply for vesting.  Eventually the local authority, after carrying out some repairs, will inform the tenant that from a certain date the cottage is vested in him, with the proviso that the tenant has the right of appeal to the Minister for Local Government within 30 days.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent, that relieves the responsibility on the engineering section of the local authority because the tenant can be told &ldquo;Appeal to the Minister.&rdquo;  But we have proof in County Cork at least, as members of the Minister's Party will agree, that perhaps in two or three cases out of 20 or 30, the inspector from the Minister's Department will make a recommendation that certain additional repairs be carried out. Otherwise, the recommendation from the inspector to the Minister, which is ultimately conveyed to the tenant, is that the cottage is in proper repair and that he or she is completely saddled with the burden of vesting in respect of a cottage which in many cases has not been properly repaired.  We have had too many such cases.</P>
    <P>Deputies of all Parties who are members of local authorities are well aware of the disgraceful manner in which the repairs are carried out to some of these cottages.  I am not for a moment condemning the tradesmen <Col N="310" /> who carry out the work.  I am condemning the system which prevents the tradesmen from carrying out the necessary repairs.  The local authorities can wash their hands because at present, and for some years past, the tenant has not the right to refuse to have the cottage vested in his or her name even though the local authority has not in so many instances had a sufficient amount of repairs carried out to the cottage.</P>
    <P>I believe that when this Bill was introduced initially it was meant to be of benefit to the tenant.  Therefore, the substance of this amendment is to be fair at least to the tenant and to give him the opportunity and the right, if the repairs are not proper and adequate, to refuse to accept the vesting of the cottage in his name.  If that were done perhaps it might be of some little help and consolation to the tenant, and it would be an incentive to the local authorities to face up to their responsibility of carrying out the necessary repairs.  I believe that is the only way we can protect the tenant against the system prevailing in County Cork and in other Munster counties, and in some counties in Leinster also.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to know from the Minister whether the local authorities are empowered by law to act in this manner.  We have been informed that they are.  If that is so, it is wrong and if the Minister checks the files he will see there are so many appeals coming to his Department that it must be obvious to him and to all in the Department that all is not well in the execution of these repairs to these cottages.  If the tenants have no redress they are faced with the terrible responsibility in the future of trying to put into repair cottages which the local authorities refused to put into proper repair.</P>
    <P>I realise there are many Deputies who wish to discuss this matter, and I would not for a moment wish to hold up any member anxious to speak.  If we want to encourage people to accept the vesting of their cottages we in turn must be prepared to be fair to them. We are over-fair to the local authorities; we are standing on the side of the local authorities who are shedding their responsibilities to their tenants.  We are <Col N="311" /> protecting the local authorities to an unjust degree and not the unfortunate tenant, the farm worker, road worker or any other type of worker in rural Ireland.  It is about time that we reverted to the system under which the tenants had the right to refuse to accept vesting unless the local authorities put their cottages into proper repair.</P>

      <P>I know how the differential rents system works so far as Dublin Corporation is concerned. I do not know how it affects other parts of the country. I have no knowledge whatsoever of the scheme with regard to rural cottages and, therefore, I cannot say anything in that connection.  I can say that theoretically the differential rents system in the City of Dublin was a beautiful scheme; if you have the means you can pay for the house and if you have not the means&mdash;if you are a widow, an unemployed man or a T.B. case&mdash;you are not put in a ghetto by yourself but placed with the rest of the community as you are entitled to be.</P>
      <P>That was and is the great idea behind the differential rents system. At present it makes no difference to the allocations department of Dublin Corporation whether a tenant can pay 6/6d. or 36/6d..  The very fact of being able to pay 36/6d. makes no difference. If the family of the tenant who can pay only 6/6d. is bigger than the other family he will get the house so that, so far as the Corporation is concerned, from that point of view the differential rents system works fairly well.</P>
      <P>In practice the scheme has not worked out well.  The farmers of the scheme meant well but I am afraid human nature was not taken into account by them.  There are too many snags in the scheme as operated by the Dublin Corporation.  Deputy Dunne went fully into the matter and, as he said, the average person does not want any official or anyone else prying into his business, and that, of necessity, is the case where the differential rents system operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another snag, as Deputy Dunne also <Col N="312" /> said, is that for the purpose of assessing the differential rents a son or a daughter may become the principal tenant.  I understand that in one case a boy of 14½ years of age earning £4 10s. a week was the principal wage earner in his house.  That is not right. That is not proper.  Whether or not the father is working he should be the tenant and there should be no change in that system.</P>
    <P>At the behest of several tenants I put down a motion in Dublin Corporation in connection with the question of overtime.  I do not know what happened to it; I never got any official reply to the motion which was to the effect that where there is one wage earner in the family, where the father is the only wage earner, overtime should not be taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <P>Several individuals came to me with this plea: &ldquo;I sacrifice my weekends so that I can dress my children for Confirmation or Holy Communion, or so that I can put a little more on the table for them.&rdquo; That was the case I put up on that motion, but I have heard nothing about it.  Overtime is still being taken into consideration: a tenant of the Dublin Corporation could be on a fixed wage for six months of the year and suddenly might get a month or two or three months in which he would do some overtime.  One would think he would be asked to pay the increased rent only for the period during which he did the overtime.  That is not so.  Even when he goes back to his basic wage, the increased rent, which is spread over the whole year, is still charged.</P>
      <P>Sometimes the public assistance officer has to give money to families to supplement their incomes and even that is taken into consideration in the fixing of the rent by the Dublin Corporation. It is only giving them money with one hand and taking it away with the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> Many people in Dublin city still do not understand this differential rent system.  They never will understand it, of course.  I know many families who are on maximum rent but prefer to pay it rather than have officials prying into their affairs.  I should like to point out at this stage that this rounding-off to threepence which is in operation in Dublin is dragging people continually, week after week, to the rent office. There should be no necessity for that. The amount could be rounded off to a shilling and that would mean people would not have to make so many journeys to and from the rent office.</P>
    <P>Instances occur where the husband might not say anything at home about some small increase in wages.  Or a son might get an increase and say nothing about it at home.  Then when the forms are sent in to the Corporation and the rent suddenly goes up, it is the unfortunate woman of the house who is upset when she has to try to balance the sudden larger budget.  As I said earlier, it is one thing to criticise the system as it is in operation at present, but there is no use in adopting a negative attitude towards it.  There is no doubt that all families on social welfare benefits should be on the minimum rent.  This whole question should be examined now in the light of the various snags that exist in it and if the present system cannot be amended as it stands, a new system should be adopted.</P>
    <P>We all know that even people who are paying the maximum rent are not paying the economic rent.  It could not be otherwise.  I read in the newspapers a couple of days ago that money will now be given to certain farmers at two per cent.  I really do not know why money for housing could not be given at cheaper rates.  A man who now wants to build a house gets £275 from the Government and £137 10s. from the local authority.  If he himself can manage it, he puts down £200 as a deposit and he borrows the balance of £1,600 over a period of 35 years at six or six-and-a-half per cent. interest. Over the period of 35 years, he will have paid over £4,000.  That is one of the reasons the rents at the moment, even in the lower cases, are so excessive. <Col N="314" /> As I said, even the maximum rent is not an economic one.  We have practically £92 millions in post office savings.  Why could that not be lent out for house building at a rate of, say, three or 3½ per cent.?</P>

      <P>I am rather browned off with discussions on this differential rent system.  Since I became a member of Dublin City Council six years ago, we have had regular discussions on it, year in, year out.  From time to time, we have had motions, all of which were referred to the Housing Committee of which I am also a member. Accordingly, I have heard all the arguments for and against.  I have always tried to see both sides of an argument and that is why I am sometimes misunderstood, because people do not want you, if you do not restrict yourself to their side of an argument. That is the kind of thing public representatives are up against.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that I know both sides of this question.  I have argued the toss on it with the housing manager in Dublin and with the differential rents supervisor and I know all there is to know about it. Before I became a member of the City Council, I had the same opinion about the system as many people still have, but once in the Council, I changed my mind very quickly and discovered that many people outside were just talking through their hats.  I said so in a letter to the Press and got myself involved in a controversy lasting months.  Of course I had the last word there, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree in principle with Deputy Dunne, I am not satisfied he has made any case for a new type of graded rents.  I was not satisfied with Deputy Costello's reference to another type of graded rents.  The present system was decided on so that old and unemployed people could be removed from dangerous dwellings into new and clean homes without the prospect of having to pay the full economic rent of 22s. 6d. in order to keep their new houses.  The old man with 30/- or <Col N="315" /> 25/- a week could not pay 22/6d. rent. Therefore, is the system not really there for the benefit of the old age pensioner, the unemployed person and the widow?  It was to facilitate such classes that the system was decided on; it was agreed it was the only system which would give these people a chance.  If the rents for these were economic, then there would be wholesale evictions.  The present rate would go up by 100 per cent.  Whether one likes it or not, the principle is sound. If a man suddenly finds himself without a job, with £2 or £2 10s. per week to maintain himself and his family, he need pay only 6/6d. rent during the period in which he is idle; and let me tell the House that 6/6d. rent is a tough rent to pay out of £2 or £2 10s. a week.  It is much tougher than £2 10s. or 33/- a week on the man with £9 or £10 per week.</P>
    <P>From every point of view, it is a good system.  There is really no alternative to it.  I should like some more information from those who support what they describe as a &ldquo;graded rents system&rdquo;.  I believe that, when they come to the mechanics of such a system, they will find a lot of snags in it.  I have no great faith in bald statements that some system is better than another one when no details are offered as to the mechanics of the alternative system.  In fact, I am suspicious of alternatives put forward in that bald fashion.  Let us have the mechanics of these proposed alternatives. Perhaps they will be more satisfactory, but, as a result of my experience, I am quite certain they will not be.</P>
    <P>One snag in the present system has been emphasised.  I refer to the inquisition into income.  I am as sympathetic as any other Deputy in this matter.  I live in a poor area.  I live in Finglas in which there are almost as many Corporation tenants as there are in Ballyfermot.  The fact is, if there were no inquiry into income, people just would not tell the truth.  Those who might tell the truth in the first instance would change their minds later when they saw others getting away with things.  That is common <Col N="316" /> sense.  What would happen then? The finances of the local authority would collapse.  People would say: &ldquo;I have only £8 or £10 per week&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mind your own business as to what I have.&rdquo;  There must be some inquiry in order to fix the rent in the first instance.  A tenant might even say he was earning twice as much.  What could the Corporation do then?</P>
    <P>Under the present system, if a tenant becomes unemployed, he hops over quickly enough to give particulars.  If he is prepared to give particulars about his unemployment, why should he not be equally prepared to give particulars about his employment?  I am not in love with the system but what is the alternative?  That is the question; there is the rub.  It is no use getting up here and saying people should not be asked to give particulars.  How could the Corporation continue to operate the system?  Once the system is accepted, then there must be the mechanics.  Suppose there were a flat rent of 22/6d. per week and no differential.  What would be the position of the unemployed man, the old age pensioner, the widow?  They would be evicted.</P>
    <P>How can one operate a fair system unless one knows what the incomes are?  To those who object to the system, I put one question: what other system do they propose?  That is a fair question. Some adjustments may be required in the present system but these are adjustments that could be ironed out at local level.  I understand the Corporation will shortly have some further discussions on differential rents.  The manager has stated that he has no objection to adjustments.  He also says the ratepayers are paying enough and he will not agree to one penny more being put on them generally.  If there are to be adjustments, and certain reliefs are given, then it is the other people under the differential rents system who will have to pay for those reliefs.  Public representatives must face up honestly to the position.  Most of the agitation over the years has been on the part of people who pay 33/- per week.  The main argument is: why should they pay that when someone else pays only 6/6d.?  The man who <Col N="317" /> pays only 6/6d. has an income of perhaps £2 per week.  If he has to pay 33/- in rent, he will not have much left for maintenance.</P>
    <P>There is a certain element of unreasonableness in all this.  People are willing enough to pay 6/6d. when they are idle but they are not willing to pay 33/- when they are in good employment. If there are to be reliefs, then those reliefs will have to be borne by the other differential rents tenants. Some public representatives are careful to avoid that particular aspect.  I am not afraid of it.  Some public representatives want the system done away with.  Very well&mdash;that will mean thousands of poor people evicted every year.  There is no use in public representatives trying to argue that the reliefs given will be borne by others.  Will the money come out of a hole in the ground?  It will not.</P>
    <P>I am as sympathetic as the next in this matter.  I know there is some difficulty about overtime; it should not be spread over the whole year.  I agree there is some justification in that argument. There is also the snag that the income of the children is taken into consideration.  One cannot compare £3 earned by each of three children with an income of £9 earned by the head of the family, because the children will want their pocket money.  Indeed, if they are girls, they will want most of it. <Col N="318" /> They want to do up and they want to dress up; they are looking for husbands. If they give up something at home, they are looking for it back before the week is out.  They give their parents &ldquo;buttons&rdquo;.  A married man earning £9 a week will give his wife £8 of that. Some allowance should be made for that situation.  There should be a better and more understanding psychological approach.  There is no comparison between the combined incomes of the children and the income earned by the head of the family.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty is the calculation of income in the case of those who are working in Britain.  It is estimated that it costs a man £4 10s. Od. per week to live in Britain.  The remainder of his earnings is taken into consideration for the purpose of differential rents.  Anyone who knows what conditions are in Britain knows that it is physically impossible to house, feed and clothe oneself, and have some little recreation, on £4 10s. Od.  If a man is earning £20 in Britain, £4 10s. Od. is deducted from that and the balance is calculated for a differential rent.</P>
