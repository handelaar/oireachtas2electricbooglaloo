      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 17, 4, 5, 6 to 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22.  Questions will be taken at 3 p.m.</P>

      <P>We have sought to make Parliament work.  I will not be a party to any proposal to turn Parliament into the equivalent of a rubber stamp. The Government are proposing to attempt to deal with 15 Bills between now and the Adjournment, in addition to disposing of the Estimates which are on the Paper.  We have sought to help in every way we can to expedite the discharge of public business but it is utterly wrong to propose that the House should expedite the discharge of public business to the point of not adequately considering it.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that 15 Bills could be adequately considered in all their Stages between now and any practical date for the adjournment of the Dáil. I want to protest emphatically against the proposal to attempt to rush 15 Bills through the House in the time left available to the House.  Some of the 15 Bills are of real substance, that is to say, they require careful consideration on Committee Stage of an elaborate character.  I would suggest to the Leader of the House that some accommodation should be arranged to determine which of these Bills are urgently necessary so that we can facilitate their passage and leave any Bills that are not urgently necessary to be disposed of in the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to rush any Bill through this House. Heretofore, I have carefully avoided even suggesting a possible date for the Adjournment.  Any arrangements the Whips consider necessary to ensure that there will be adequate time available for the business which the Government propose will be carefully considered by the Government.  The only element of urgency is in relation to the financial business.  As Deputies are aware, it is necessary to complete that financial business in time to enable the Appropriation Bill to go to the Seanad and receive the Presidential signature before the end of the month.  If that were not done, the Government would be unable to make any payments after the end of the month.</P>
      <P>I should hope that it might be possible to finish the debates on the Estimates today, on the assumption. which, I think, has been agreed to by the Whips in their discussions, that the debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate, which is, by tradition, the final business of this session, should be put over to the motion for the Adjournment and that the Estimate should pass today without debate.  If we do not succeed in disposing of the other financial business, the remaining Estimates, the Appropriation Bill and the necessary Resolutions today, the Dáil would meet for that purpose tomorrow and for that purpose only.  I would not propose to order any legislation tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is desirable that any of the legislation should be abandoned at this stage.  The Government have, in fact, withheld from the Dáil certain legislative proposals which they would have wished to bring forward in other circumstances, merely to prevent the programme for the session becoming too heavy.  That is a matter which we can discuss.  I think it has to be approached on the basis that it is desirable that the business which has to be done should be done, rather than that we should provide for its postponement or abandonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what views the Deputies may have in regard to the hours for next week.  As far as the Government are concerned, we would <Col N="1375" /> be agreeable to any hours which commend themselves to the Opposition Parties.  Most Deputies would perhaps regard it as preferable to meet next week at the same hours as this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are disposing of the financial business at this time of the year.  For reasons best known to the Government, 15 Bills remain undisposed of in the last week of July. Theoretically, we can all sit here until next October, but legislation requires careful consideration and pretty heavy work from those engaged upon it.  I do not believe that proper consideration can be given to 15 Bills at this stage of the parliamentary session.  In theory, we can sit here forever, but the work is not being properly done.</P>
      <P>I shall not be party to a procedure which aims to turn the House into a rubber stamp to pass legislation which has not got the proper consideration.  It is perfectly reasonable to work, as we have been doing this week, 12 hours a day, and next week 12 hours a day in order to dispose of necessary and essential legislation, even though it is very unusual for a large volume of legislation to be before the House at this time of the year.  But we are quite prepared for 12-hour days this week and next week to meet all reasonable requirements of urgent legislation.</P>
      <P>We do not believe that 15 Bills are necessary to pass all Stages between now and the time of the adjournment. We do not believe that programme is consistent with the proper care that the legislation of this House ought to receive, and I emphatically protest against this programme at this time of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I again disclaim any intention of trying to rush any legislation through the Dáil and preventing its proper consideration.  When Deputy Dillon refers to 15 Bills, he will recognise he is including in that number Bills which have already been fully debated in the Dáil, both on Second Reading and in Committee, and which are only awaiting the concluding Stages before they can go to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some knowledge of what discussions are likely to arise on these matters.  Most of the other Bills are not of the kind that would lead to a long or certainly a contentious debate.  In most cases, they are not likely to be challenged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach must appreciate that, no matter what arrangement may be come to with regard to the number of hours or the number of days we sit next week or the week after, many of the Bills listed are Bills which, of necessity, must take three weeks, having regard to the fact that there must be a Second Stage and a Committee Stage and that there is a possibility of a Report Stage.  It does not seem clear to me, even if we do sit for longer hours and for extra days next week and the week after, that we can dispose of some of these Bills within any reasonable time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of opinion.  In my view, there would be ample time to dispose of these Bills with full discussions on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Orders provide for four days between Second Reading and Committee, and presumably those who drafted the Standing Orders thought that was an adequate time to give.  I agree it is customary to give a longer period to long Bills, particularly those of a technical nature.  I think it is quite reasonable to consider the possibility of completing that programme and adjourning on 4th or 5th of August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That would hardly be possible in respect of the Holidays (Employees) Bill, which could be a fairly contentious Bill and to which amendments may be tabled.  Surely it will take three weeks to deal with such Bills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view&mdash;and I put it forward as a personal view&mdash;that is a Committee Stage Bill only.  There would be no serious dispute about the Bill on Second Reading and it would be merely a matter of considering amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy O.J. Flanagan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing last night with the limited pool of land available for the relief of congestion and the order of priority which, in my view, should be observed by the Land Commission in dealing with that pool.  I think it was Deputy Johnston who suggested that a certain amount of land should be made available on estates to deal with local congestion before migrants are brought in. Of course, that is the actual practice followed by the Land Commission. Where estates are acquired in the eastern part of the country for the relief of congestion by way of migration, if there are local congests within the mile limit laid down by the Land Commission, they are dealt with before the migrants are brought in.</P>
      <P>In some cases, too, it is possible, depending on the circumstances, that a suitable cottier may get a portion of land.  The division of every estate depends upon the surrounding circumstances and the local conditions.  It is also possible, where there are pockets of congestion in these counties, to migrate from one portion of the county to another to relieve that pocket of congestion in cases where local circumstances justify such a course of action.</P>
      <P>However, I want to make it clear, as I did on the Estimate last year, that the land available for the relief of congestion must be dealt with in a particular way and the order of priority observed, with the congests on an uneconomic holding at the head of the queue.  I stated at column 1088 of the Official Report of 10th June, 1960:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> ... every new holding bought or created by the Land Commission and diverted to a person not already on the land, means the perpetuation of one or more of the existing smallholders on dwarf holdings not sufficient to give even a modest living. Let me put it still another way: the 40 odd acres needed to establish just one landless person would be sufficient to advance three or perhaps four existing smallholders to economic level.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to Deputies that the congestion problem must be approached by dealing first with those who are already on uneconomic holdings. It is both unfair and dishonest to suggest that landless men&mdash;and when you talk of the sons of farmers who have not got land, you must classify them as landless men&mdash;have any reasonable hope of getting farms while this congestion problem we have continues to exist to the same extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan, I think, mentioned some form of leasing to farmers.  I think he had some form of farm apprenticeship scheme in mind. In fact, a farm apprenticeship scheme is being worked out by the bodies concerned and I assume that in due course such a scheme will be provided, because it is under active discussion at present.  In any case, the N.F.A. and other bodies concerned saw how unwise it would be to bring the Land Commission into any such scheme when they discussed the matter with me and understood it.  It would be unrealistic to try to get the Land Commission to provide farms for the farm apprenticeship scheme where you have such an amount of congestion and where invariably you have agitation for these lands by local congests where lands are acquired by the Land Commission.  The bodies concerned realised that the Department could not play a useful part in the proposed farm apprenticeship scheme. Deputies should not confuse two different matters.  The relief of congestion is one matter&mdash;dealing with people already on the land in an uneconomic way and they, I suggest, are the first charge on moneys provided <Col N="1380" /> by the House to increase the extent of their holdings and bring them up to an economic level.</P>
    <P>I had better deal with what has been said by Deputy Blowick regarding foreigners buying land in this country. He said much less here on the subject than he said down the country at recent meetings in the West of Ireland. Deputy Blowick and every rural Deputy know how sensitive people are on the subject of land acquisition and due to ill-informed publicity in connection with this issue, some people were misled into thinking that the whole of Ireland is being bought out by Germans.  Deputy Blowick and his colleague, Deputy Donnellan, for their own purposes, are endeavouring to exploit this issue in the West of Ireland and by their representations, as reported, are endeavouring to convey that this foreign invasion is going on. Deputy Blowick has alleged that one in ten Deputies are unaware of it.</P>
    <P>Nothing is further from the facts. According to a report in the <i>Western People</i> of June 24th, Deputy Blowick alleged that it was never more necessary than it is today for the people of rural Ireland to consider their position because if the trend of land purchasing by foreigners continued, the native Irish would be reduced to a very minor status.  Statements like that give rise to fears, in the minds of people who are not aware of the facts, that there is actually some tremendous invasion of foreigners at the present time and that the land of Ireland is being swallowed up by them.</P>
    <P>It is true that a number of transactions take place each year in which land changes hands mainly between foreigners themselves.  I find that in nine out of ten cases that have been brought to my notice they were what we would term outsiders who had these estates and that, as some Deputy said last night, they had come in and spent quite a lot of money on them and then had to get out.  I think Deputy Giles said that had been happening.  The great majority of these estates that have been investigated by my officials were what we would call white elephants and unsuitable for Land Commission purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> In the West, the few places that have been bought&mdash;with one exception that I know of&mdash;consist, in the main, of sand dunes and snipe grass that would be absolutely useless for Land Commission purposes.  That land has been purchased for the express purpose of erecting houses or holiday camps or chalets there.  Last week, I answered a question here about a purchase by a German in North Mayo and the particulars of that property are that it comprises 170 acres of steep and very exposed sandhills having a rateable valuation of £18 5s. or less than 2/2d. per acre, and it is not suitable for Land Commission purposes, because it is windswept and practically without vegetation.  I know the people there welcome with open arms the gentleman who is taking over that stretch of barren countryside in the hope that he will provide employment in carrying out the purpose for which he intends to use it.</P>
    <P>A similar purchase was made outside Louisburg, also of sandhills and heather, by another gentleman, again with the purpose, as expressed, of making it a tourist centre.  It could not be described as being suitable for any other but a business purpose of this kind.  There is only one case, that is, the Pim Estate outside Newport, portion of which has now been sold to a German, that could be regarded as being controversial. Approximately half the original Pim Estate consisted of islands, for the most part, and the remainder of it was claimed by the local people to be suitable for the relief of congestion, in that it contained mountainy agricultural land.  It was sold a few years ago to a private individual who has now sold portion of it to a German whose declared purpose&mdash;according to the local Press&mdash;is to erect houses as summer residences for some of his people and to develop it as a holiday estate.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission in their wisdom, be they right or wrong, refused to acquire the Pim Estate because they stated, according to the file which I have read, that it was not suitable for Land Commission purposes.  Deputy Blowick at this meeting to which I <Col N="1382" /> referred shed some tears about the Pim Estate.  Let me point out to the House that when he was occupying the position I occupy today, he had many questions put to him in this House about the Pim Estate.  During the time he was Minister in his last period of office, a period of approximately three years, the matter was constantly before him and the file discloses that he received many deputations in regard to it.  The Land Commission&mdash;acquisition is a reserved function of the Land Commission&mdash;decided not to acquire that estate.  Let Deputy Blowick not try to suggest now that this is something that has happened since his time. There were questions on the Pim Estate put to him here in this House when he was Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>He has also suggested here that the Government had made treaties which would prevent them dealing effectively with non-nationals in this country.  It is true that conventions were signed by the Government on this issue with other countries.  It is also true that the Treaty for Economic Co-operation &mdash;the agreement between Ireland and the United States of America &mdash; was signed on 28th June, 1948.  It provided that citizens of that country could enjoy rights of property here.  It was signed in 1948 by a Government of which Deputy Blowick was a member.</P>
    <P>Again, in the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation signed in January, 1950, there is provision in Article VII, paragraph 3:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Except as provided in paragraph 1 of the present Article, the ownership of real property within the territories of each Party shall be subject to the applicable laws therein. Nationals and companies of either Party shall, however, be permitted to possess and occupy real property within the territories of the other Party, incidental to or necessary for the enjoyment of rights secured by the provisions of the present Treaty.</P>
    <P>That Treaty, according national treatment to non-nationals, was negotiated and signed by a Government of which Deputy Blowick was a member. Speaking down the country, Deputy Blowick sought to suggest to the <Col N="1383" /> public at this meeting that it was this Government, and this Government alone, who were responsible for those Treaties.</P>
    <P>From time to time, a ramp breaks out here&mdash;as I have said land is a sensitive question&mdash;about the alleged buying up of the land of this country by non-nationals.  These ramps are invariably (1) founded on lack of information and (2) politically inspired, as the present one is.  I should like now to quote what Deputy Blowick himself had to say on this subject.  Speaking in the Seanad on 10th May, 1950, at column 1908 of volume 37 of the Official Report, he stated:</P>
    <P>A close watch is being kept on the purchase of land by non-nationals. I want to assure the House that there is no need for alarm.  Some have bought the land at fantastic prices and have burnt their fingers.  The number of purchases is so small that no action is necessary at the moment in regard to it.  I want to assure the House on that, for fear there might be alarms as a result of some of the speeches made here and in the Dáil.  The question is not a serious one, by any means.  Some Senators are afraid that there will be a new conquest of this country by money, that foreigners will buy out this country.  The only thing I can say is that they will want to hurry up to make any impression at all, because at the rate of purchase for the last ten years, it will take 2,400 years to buy up the land of this country.</P>
    <P>Those were Deputy Blowick's own words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Deputy who is today shedding crocodile tears down in the West of Ireland about the alleged invasion of this country by foreigners.  This Government took the <Col N="1384" /> necessary action&mdash;the only action we deemed to be necessary in our circumstances today &mdash; under the recent Finance Bill to deal with the situation. This Government in the Finance Bill made the law effective by enabling a penal tax of 25 per cent, to be charged by the Revenue Commissioners in connection with the purchase of land here by aliens.  It is also provided under the Finance Bill that the Revenue Commissioners will keep a record and notify the Land Commission of every transaction that takes place in connection with the purchase of land in which a non-national is involved.  The only escape clause in that Bill is where the Land Commissioners&mdash;let me emphasise it is an excepted matter for the Land Commissioners&mdash;certify, through the Minister, that the land is not required by the Land Commission for their particular purposes.</P>
      <P>There is the effective way of dealing with the problem, if it is a problem.  It is no more a problem today than it was when Deputy Blowick stated in the Seanad that it would take foreigners 2,400 years to buy up the land of this country.  I hope now the matter is cut down to size.  I hope that the House realises that the measures taken by this Government are now effective and that the loophole left under the provisions of the 1956 Finance Act with regard to pre-1947 companies is now sealed off.  Any foreigner purchasing land in this country will in future be subject to this penal tax of 25 per cent. and the Land Commission will be duly notified of any such purchases by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, of course, that in an election year, when one is bereft of policy, it is a good thing to start a hare, particularly a hare on a sensitive subject of this kind.  I believe that misleading people with these false scares will do nobody any good in the long run.  It was stated at this meeting, too, that if we went into the Common Market, there could be no prohibition on aliens buying land here.  Statements of that kind only confuse the public mind and I should like now to refer the House to the Provisions of the Rome Treaty under which those in the European Economic Community operate.  The <Col N="1385" /> purpose of the Community is not alone to pull down tariff walls and have an easier exchange and sale of goods but also to have a free exchange of labour and provide the same facilities for all. Article 54 of the Rome Treaty lays it down:</P>
    <P>Before the expiry of the first stage, the Council, acting by means of a unanimous vote on a proposal of the Commission and after the Economic and Social Committee and the Assembly have been consulted, shall lay down a general programme for the abolition of restrictions existing within the Community on freedom of establishment.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 sets out:</P>
    <P>The Council and the Commission shall exercise the functions entrusted to them by the above provisions, in particular:</P>
    <P>(e)  by enabling a national of one Member State to acquire and exploit real property situated in the territory of another Member State, to the extent that no infringement of the principles laid down in Article 39, paragraph 2 is thereby caused:</P>
    <P>Article 39, paragraph 2, deals with the need to make the appropriate adjustments gradually and the fact that in Member States, agriculture constitutes a sector which is closely linked with the economy as a whole.  Therefore, these provisions indicate that there is citizen status between the different members in dealing with real property in a Member country.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise that much of the sale of land to aliens involves land in which the Land Commission would have no interest.  In some instances, there are large houses with not sufficient land to go with them, neglected places or places for which there would be no market in this country at all. Last night, Deputy Blowick held up his hands in horror at the suggestion that free sale might be interfered with. He did not want that done at all.  I have no doubt Deputy Flanagan would take the same view.  I wonder what would be the reaction of some of these people who are so vocal on this issue <Col N="1386" /> if they were getting £100 or £500 more from an outsider or a foreigner than they would get from a local?  You must think of the individual who is selling the land, too.  We have an expression in the West of Ireland: &ldquo;It is great fun when it is not our ass.&rdquo;  It is great fun for many of these people who started this ramp about an alleged invasion of this country, but if the right of free sale of their own land was threatened I know the outcry there would be.</P>
    <P>As regards the latest reports my Department have received in connection with the Germans, it would appear they are now displaying no interest whatever in the acquisition of land here, with the exception of these holiday places they are developing and in so far as they are bringing the tourist industry to the West or indeed any other industry they may bring with them, I would certainly like my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, welcome them to this country.</P>
    <P>There was not a word, of course, about any of the people of the British Commonwealth who came here since the war.  There was no song and dance about them, but when a handful of Germans come here and bring their techniques with them, this latent fear in our people on the sensitive question of land is being exploited to the full by those who want to use it for their own political ends.  This Government have taken any action that is necessary at this time.  Under this law, we shall know exactly what is being purchased and by whom.  Thus the House will know, because I shall be subject to Questions by any Deputy on this register.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to a Bill which he and his colleagues introduced here recently.  I would remind the House that in that Bill&mdash;and Deputy Flanagan agreed with this last night&mdash; all that was provided was that a register would be kept so that these wild allegations would be cut down to size. There is a register there now and it will be open to the House to find out the extent, if any, to which any further action might need to be taken. There are said to be something like 13 million acres of arable land in Ireland <Col N="1387" /> and dealing with 6,000 or 7,000 acres in any one year will not do any great national harm, particularly when under the law purchases are subject to the scrutiny of the Land Commission and when there is the power this House has given it, under the Land Acts, to acquire these lands, should they be required for the relief of congestion.</P>

      <P>The truth is very bitter for the Deputy and I can understand it, because if we turn to his allegations last night about the 1950 Act, we find him asking me to repeal Section 27 of that Act which he held out to this House and the country to be the one that would relieve congestion in the whole of the West.  That is an indication of the Deputy's mentality.  That Bill got an agreed Second Reading when it was before the House.  We pointed out the uselessness of that section and divided the House on it.  We now find Deputy Blowick coming back here and asking me to cure his own Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I was challenging the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to cure it in due course, when I get the opportunity. This is a typical performance of the Deputy.  This Bill, under which the whole of the West of Ireland was to be relieved, was put on the Statute Book and then forgotten. There was never more than £20,000 spent annually by the Deputy under that Act.  He suspended its operations altogether in the year 1956, so that not one penny was made available by him for the purchase of land in the open market from that time on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day, with the very limited and lame duck powers the Land Commission have under that Act, we are providing £100,000 for the acquisition of land under that heading when, as I say, the greatest amount in any year spent by the Deputy under that heading was £20,000.  It is no wonder that the truth is bitter for the Deputy and that the figures I have quoted here are bitter for him to swallow. <Col N="1389" /> I know quite well that the Deputy did not like hearing in connection with this Estimate of the record figure provided and spent on the acquisition of land this year under the 1950 Act; of the record figure provided and spent by Land Bonds under the 1923 and the other Land Acts during the last year; of the substantial amount spent on the improvement of estates and rearrangement work during the last year; of the record post-war figure for the provision of migrants' holdings during the last year; of the significant increase in the acreage of land inspected and bought into the Land Commission machine during the last year and of the acceleration by the Land Commission in acquisition proceedings generally for the relief of congestion in that year.  I know the truth is bitter for the Deputy, as far as that record is concerned.</P>
    <P>At all events, the money is being provided, the work is being done and it is difficult for the Deputy with his record in this Department to swallow these unpalatable truths.  The proof of that achievement is there for all to see, from his native county right down to Carlow.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the new provision made in the Estimate this year for game councils.  I welcome the scheme which was inaugurated a comparatively short time ago for the establishment of regional game councils.  In many cases, these councils are operating very well and doing very good work in the extermination of vermin and, in some cases, in game re-stocking.  Another thing they have succeeded in doing in a number of counties is bringing all the interests together&mdash;the sporting interests and the farming interests&mdash;and getting them interested in the preservation of game.</P>
    <P>I should like to correct a fallacy.  I know it is believed by many Deputies and many members of the general public that farmers do not own the game rights.  In the vast majority of cases, the contrary is true.  In the majority of cases, the farmers are the owners of the game rights and only in some cases were these game rights reserved on the sale of estates.</P>
    <Col N="1390" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is not correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying here is correct.  If the Deputy puts down a question, I will give him comparative figures for the estates and farms, as far as we have records of them, in which the farmers own the game rights.</P>
      <P>It is also the policy of the Land Commission to vest the sporting rights in the tenants on the division of lands, and, although their main interest is in getting the land where they can do so, the Land Commission also acquire the game rights, as they did recently in connection with the Rockingham Estate, near Boyle, County Roscommon and, in due course, these game rights will be dealt with.</P>
      <P>This is a business that requires the co-operation not alone of the sporting bodies concerned and the regional game councils who are organising the matter but of the people who own the land and when this development comes to the proper stage, I have no doubt that the future of any leases of sporting rights remaining in the hands of the Land Commission will be discussed with them.  This development is new. I want to see emerging from rural Ireland a national organisation catering for all counties.  The regional game councils have made very good progress in a number of counties.  The entire country has not yet been covered by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy suggested here last night that it would be better in this business to make haste slowly.  We need to get the experience of these regional councils in their practical work in the field and we shall give them all the assistance we can.  Our plan at the moment is that where there is an active regional game council doing the job, they will get help from my Department. I do not believe in some of these local &ldquo;paper&rdquo; organisations.  I want to see people doing the job, as they are doing it in many of these new regional game councils.  I believe that in a short time we should have the entire country fully organised by bodies of this kind.  There have been disagreements between some of the interests concerned.  Let me appeal to them <Col N="1391" /> again here to bury the hatchet on this issue and endeavour to get on with the job.  The sooner we have co-operation from all concerned, the sooner it will be possible to create a national body on the lines of the Inland Fisheries Trust, or however it may be decided to organise it when the time is ripe.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I propose to help the local bodies that are active and doing a good job.  I have to approve of the schemes they submit and it is a very good sign on the part of many of these local bodies that they are putting some of their own money into it.  I am particularly familiar with counties west of the Shannon in which this movement has gained great momentum.  I express the hope here that this movement will develop and, in a year's time or so, it may well be that the country will be ripe for some type of national body such as has been suggested here by Deputies to deal with this development.</P>
    <P>I should not conclude without paying a tribute to the enlightened approach expressed here last night by Deputy Giles about migrants and others in the Midlands.  It took quite a long time to get that point of view established amongst the people in the eastern counties.  We all know, and it is quite natural, I suppose, that landless men and others resent people from other counties coming in to be established on migrants' holdings in their midst.  There was at the beginning of the migrations from the congested districts a good deal of local resentment which, with the passing of time, I am very glad to say, has very largely disappeared.  Indeed, in counties like Kildare, business people have told me that migrants have been the saving of their rural towns, that their industry has been a credit to them, that they are hard-working and industrious people and a credit to the places they came from and to themselves.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Giles expressing the views he expressed last night.  The quicker we all realise we are a small community, that we must all live in this small country, and that <Col N="1392" /> the migration of our people, whether from Kerry, Mayo, Donegal or Galway, is in the national interest and for the ultimate good of other counties, the better.  I can assure Deputy Palmer that Kerry is getting a fair crack of the whip from the Land Commission, judging by the figures I have recently seen of both migration and division.  I agree with him that the Kerry people have proved themselves very worthy migrants and have turned out quite successfully.</P>
    <P>I also assure Deputy Palmer that I do not regard myself as Minister for Lands for my native town of Castlebar or south Mayo.  I am Minister for Lands for the whole of the country and I can assure the House my duties will be discharged accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, would he answer my question as to what is the approximate number of holdings that have to be improved? Is it 10,500 that require to be improved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>A very substantial proportion of the 10,500 unvested holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that roughly the figure to be dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I would say that a substantial number of these unvested holdings must be improved.  That represents the hard core of the problem that has failed to be solved over the years.  That is probably the number that must be dealt with, many of which are still in rundale.  I think that practically all of these holdings need to be improved in one form or another prior to vesting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,634,400 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the <Col N="1393" /> charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of March, 1962, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946 and No. 6 of 1956) including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
    <P>The gross Estimate for Forestry for 1961/62, at £2,929,400, is practically the same as the gross Estimate for the previous year.  A substantial increase in the allowance for Appropriations-in-Aid, however, reduces the net draw on the Exchequer by £179,300, giving a net requirement of £2,387,400.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to deal in detail with the subheads of special interest to the House&mdash;Subhead C.1&mdash;Acquisition of Land, Subhead C.2&mdash;Forest Development and Management, Subhead G&mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid and Subhead D &mdash;Grants for Afforestation Purposes&mdash; I propose to refer briefly to the other subheads of the Vote.</P>
    <P>Subhead A &mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances &mdash; shows an increase of £24,675 on the provision for 1960/61; this is attributable to essential increases in inspectorate, engineering, forester and indoor staff and to normal incremental progressions.</P>
    <P>Subhead B &mdash; Travelling and Incidental Expenses&mdash;shows an increase of £5,600 on the provision for 1960/61. Of this, £4,000 is to cover extra expenditure on travelling and subsistence allowances, an inevitable feature in an expanding service.  An additional £1,000 is provided for advertising and publicity and the remaining £600 represents a non-recurring item in connection with educational exhibits at provincial shows.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.3&mdash;Sawmilling&mdash;is lower by £4,300.  This subhead provides for the operation of the Department's fixed sawmills at Cong and Dundrum. Provision for labour in the sawmills, at £15,500, is up by £2,000 compared with the previous year; the decrease on the subhead as a whole is due to the non-recurrence of provision for the purchase of additional equipment and for the carrying out of certain structural works at the sawmills.</P>
    <P>The provision for Forestry Education&mdash;Subhead E&mdash;is up by £5,085.  It <Col N="1394" /> is expected that in the current year there will be an average of 92 trainee foresters undergoing instruction at the Department's two training establishments.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that there is a special item of £5,000 included in this subhead for expenditure expected to be incurred this year on the reconstruction of Avondale House as a forestry training centre.  A sum of £20,000 has been allocated for this work from the American Grant Counterpart Reserve Fund and provision is being made in the Appropriations-in-Aid subhead for the recoupment to the Forestry Vote of the amount expected to be spent in the year.  Detailed plans for the work have been prepared by the Office of Public Works and it will be undertaken under the supervision of that office.  The main architectural features of the house will be preserved.  Avondale House, the old Parnell home, was the cradle of Irish forestry.  When reconstructed, it will provide a suitable centre for short-term refresher and specialised courses for our forest technical staff, a very necessary development in this age of specialisation.  It is very fitting that Avondale should again come to play an active role in Irish forestry.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F&mdash;Agency, Advisory and Special Services&mdash;is down by £1,560. Provision is being made under this subhead for continued engagement of the services of a firm of industrial consultants for part of the year in connection with the incentive bonus scheme for forestry workers and allied matters and also for the re-engagement for some months of a consulting engineer to advise on road and bridge construction problems.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the more significant parts of the Estimate, Deputies will note that the Grant-in-Aid provision for land acquisition (Subhead C.1) is £130,000, £55,000 lower than the provision for 1960/61.  This reduced provision does not reflect any intention to slow down the tempo of land acquisition; on the contrary, it is intended to accelerate acquisition to the highest possible level in the current year.  The reduction in the provision is, however, justified by the fact that there was a substantial balance of £108,000 in the <Col N="1395" /> Grant-in-Aid Fund on 31st March. 1961, and this, with the new grant or £130,000 sought, will give a total of £238,000 available for the acquisition of land in the current year.</P>
    <P>Last year, a gross total area of 29,169 acres was acquired for State forestry purposes.  This was the largest area ever acquired in a single year to date.  The plantable content of the area acquired was in the region of 25,600 acres.  The effective plantable reserve at the begining of 1960/61 was 48,000 acres.  The total area planted in 1960/61 was 25,800 acres, of which an estimated 2,000 acres consisted of land previously classified as unplantable or woodland areas cleared for replanting. With the addition of the plantable area of 25,600 acres acquired in 1960/61, the effective reserve on 1st April, 1961, was 50,000 acres, an increase of 1,800 acres above the figure for the previous year.</P>
    <P>This slight improvement in the plantable reserve position is very welcome but the reserve is still quite inadequate to permit of proper programme planning and, furthermore, the uneven distribution of the reserve over the country inevitably means that to meet a planting target of 25,000 acres over-large programmes have to be undertaken at some forests while at others it is not possible to maintain planting at an even level because of rapid exhaustion of land reserves.</P>
    <P>A significant feature of land acquisition progress in 1960/61 was that the total productive area of 25,600 acres taken over was acquired in 504 separate transactions, giving an average of 51 acres per case.  The downward trend in the average area of the individual lots acquired has been accentuated in the past two years.  In 1959/60 a productive area of 23,323 acres was acquired in 346 transactions, giving an average of 67 acres whereas in 1958/59 a productive area of 25,244 acres was acquired in 339 transactions, yielding an average of 75 acres.</P>
    <P>This drop in the average size of productive area acquired is partly attributable to a falling-off in the number of substantial blocks of land <Col N="1396" /> suitable for forestry development coming on offer and partly to the more welcome fact that State forestry operations are now so widespread throughout the country that the acquisition of smaller areas can be more favourably considered than formerly.  The overall effect of the reduction in the average size of acquisitions, however, is that considerably more cases have to be dealt with to acquire any given area of land, thus adding to the difficulties being encountered in our constant efforts to bring the plantable reserve to an adequate level.  It is encouraging that the year's work secured an overall increase in the area acquired, notwithstanding the sharp fall in the average area per transaction.</P>
    <P>When I was introducing last year's Estimate I mentioned that the Statutory Regulations to deal with commonage and title difficulty cases under the provisions of the Forestry Act, 1956, had been made and that action had just been initiated in the first case to be dealt with under the new procedure, which involves the formal use of the compulsory acquisition machinery provided in the Forestry Act, 1946.  Since then, progress has been made in several cases suitable for treatment in this way.  The position at present is that acquisition orders have been made by the Land Commission in respect of a total of 2,514 acres, applications for acquisition orders in respect of 2,822 acres have been made and are awaiting hearing and applications are pending in respect of areas totalling 1,714 acres.</P>
    <P>In addition, negotiations are in progress with the owners of areas totalling 6,324 acres with a view to the use of this new machinery to complete acquisition.  The total area at various stages of progress under the new procedure is, therefore, 13,374 acres. Because of the complicated nature of the cases involved it would be unwise to expect spectacular results in the earlier stages of the use of the new procedure but once that procedure has been firmly established and initial difficulties overcome it will facilitate the acquisition of very substantial areas that might never have been acquired <Col N="1397" /> by voluntary purchase in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.2&mdash;Forest Development and Management&mdash;totals £2,248,400, an increase of £25,200 on the provision for the preceding year.  From the details of the subhead given in Part III of the Estimate, it will be noted that provision is made for increased expenditure on all Heads except Head 3, that dealing with new roads and buildings.</P>
    <P>Head 1&mdash;State Forest Nurseries&mdash; shows no significant change compared with last year.  I should mention in connection with this Head that considerable progress has been achieved in carrying out the policy of establishing large-scale nurseries to replace small existing nursery units of uneconomic size.  Seven large-scale nurseries have now been established and other areas are being considered for acquisition. The operation of these large-scale nursery units will greatly facilitate the meeting of the heavy demands for plants of the various species resulting from the substantial annual planting programme now being undertaken. The present programme requires the use of 40 million young trees a year, so that an efficient nursery service is vital.</P>
    <P>The provision under Head 2&mdash; Establishment of Plantations&mdash;shows an increase of £20,600 over the 1960/61 level and the increase is attributable to enlarged provision for the purchase of fencing wire and manures for plantations.</P>
    <P>This Head covers all expenditure on fencing, ground clearance, drainage and planting of land.  Deputies will recall that the ultimate State planting target of 25,000 acres of new planting was achieved for the first time in 1959/ 60.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that planting continued at this very high level in 1960/61.  The total area of new plantations established in the year was 25,800 acres and by the end of the year the total planted area held by my Department had increased to 332,000 acres.  It is of interest that the area planted was in fact the highest figure ever attained; with a programme of the order of 25,000 acres, the final outturn is liable to be 500 to a thousand acres up or down on the target.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> Plans have been completed for the planting of an additional area of 25,000 acres in the current year.  I think that our forestry service deserves credit for tackling a programme of this magnitude despite the difficulties in regard to the size and distribution of the plantable reserve to which I have referred previously.  If, as I hope, these difficulties are overcome, I have every confidence that planting will continue at the rate of 25,000 acres a year.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Forestry Estimate last year, I made particular mention of the great expansion in planting in the western counties which has become such a feature of forestry development in recent years.  In 1960/61 a total of 11,000 acres, that is to say about 43 per cent., was planted in the western counties.  In the current year the programme for the West will continue at the same high level.  It is noteworthy that 48 per cent. of the total productive area acquired last year was situated in the western counties and that about 70 per cent. of all land now on offer to my Department is in the West.  These figures are indicative of the tremendous potential for forestry development in the western areas where some 2,000 men are now regularly employed in the State forests.  As our existing plantations in the West develop and more plantations are established Forestry will contribute more and more to the fund of productive employment in the Western counties.</P>
    <P>The sum provided for labour under the Establishment of Plantations Head for 1961/62 is £410,000&mdash;representing over 80 per cent. of the entire provision under this head.</P>
    <P>Head 3&mdash;New Roads and Buildings &mdash;shows a reduction of £46,500 on the provision for the previous year but the reduced provision is in fact substantially higher than the actual outturn of 1960/61.  It had been hoped that the record achievement of 1959/60, when 201 miles of new forest roads were constructed, would be surpassed in 1960/61 and the Estimate was framed accordingly. In the event, however, the bad weather experienced last Summer led inevitably to a drastic curtailment in the road-construction programme.  Preliminary <Col N="1399" /> work returns indicate that the total mileage of forest roads completed in the year was 147 miles, a substantial achievement in the circumstances but less than had been expected.  The Estimate provision for 1961/62 is adequate to provide for the completion of 280 miles of road in the year, almost double last year's actual level.  If this programme is satisfactorily accomplished the most pressing needs for extraction roads to serve the plantations will have been met.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been done in the past few years to rationalise methods of road construction and with the specialist services of engineering and surveyor staff now available the Department is well-equipped to tackle the many difficult and complicated problems in relation to road and bridge construction that have to be faced in the rough terrain characteristic of our forest locations in most parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The provision for road construction this year includes a sum of £265,000 for direct labour.  The provision for the supply of road materials on contract is £170,000; the bulk of this sum is for the supply of stones and gravel to road-sites and it includes, therefore, a significant element for indirect employment provided by contractors.  The provision for buildings in Head 3 is £25,000, compared with £20,500 in 1960/61.</P>
    <P>Head 4&mdash;General Forest Management&mdash;is increased by £27,400.  This is the biggest expenditure Head in the Vote, since it bears all the costs of maintenance and protection of the State plantations, including such work as cleaning of young plantations, repair of fences, drains and forest roads, construction of fire lines, pruning and so on.  As the area of plantations increases the expenditure under this Head must increase correspondingly. Far more attention has been given to the maintenance and protection of plantations in recent years.  Sound forest management is essential if the plantations are eventually to give the best possible yields of timber and I <Col N="1400" /> am glad to say that all management requirements are now being fully met and that the drive for new planting is in no way being permitted to detract from the attention that must be given to the plantations already established.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the provision under this head is accounted for by labour&mdash; £723,000 or 97 per cent of the total of £747,600.</P>
    <P>Head 5&mdash;Timber Conversion&mdash;is up by £3,000.  £90,000 of the total provision of £103,000 is for labour. &ldquo;Direct labour&rdquo; felling by forestry workers is now almost entirely confined to felling for the purpose of meeting special orders, such as transmission poles for the E.S.B. or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and to felling in areas being thinned for the first time or areas where there are unusual felling problems.  As far as practicable, forest produce is now sold standing and the material is felled and extracted by the purchasers' own employees.  This policy has had the effect of switching a substantial volume of employment from the direct to the indirect category.  The standing sale system has, in practice, proved itself to be the most satisfactory method of disposal of forest material and it is now fully accepted by all concerned.</P>
    <P>Provisional thinning returns for 1960/61 show that the total volume of thinning produce for the year was approximately 2.8 million cubic feet, compared with 2.6 million cubic feet for the previous year.  Other felling such as the clear-felling of mature timber, the clearance of blown material, the felling of specially selected poles to meet particular orders and so on, is estimated to have produced material with a total volume of approximately three million cubic feet.</P>
    <P>Head 6&mdash;Mechanical Equipment for Forest Development and Management &mdash;shows an increase of almost £17,000. An additional sum of £10,000 is provided for increased purchases of machines and mechanical equipment and the balance is due to increased provision for running expenses and repairs. The provision for labour under this head is £60,500.</P>
    <P>The total sum included for labour in the various heads of Subhead C.2 and in Subhead C.3 for 1961/62 <Col N="1401" /> amounts to £1,704,000, compared with an actual outturn on labour of £1,671,105 in 1960/61.  There were 53 pay weeks in 1960/61, so that the provision for 1961/62 allows for increased labour expenditure of approximately £64,000 in the year on a 52 weeks basis.  Agreement has recently been reached with the trade unions concerned to increase the basic wage rates of the forestry labourers by 7/6 a week with effect as from the 1st April, 1961.  This increase will cost £84,000 for the year and provision to meet this extra expenditure may have to be made in a Supplementary Estimate later in the year.  The position cannot be assessed properly until the probable impact of minor savings and excesses on other heads in the Vote becomes clearer.</P>
    <P>The average weekly number of men employed in 1960/61 was 4,653, a drop of 126 compared with 1959/60, but about the same as the level for 1958/ 59.  The higher level of employment in 1959/60 was primarily attributable to the exceptionally fine summer of 1959 which facilitated rapid progress with many forest operations and particularly with road construction.  By contrast the weather in the summer of 1960 was anything but favourable and reports from the various centres indicate that sodden ground conditions rendered road construction work impossible in many areas.  Forestry, like most outdoor operations, is subject to the vagaries of our climate but that is a difficulty we have to live with and we can only hope that conditions will be more favourable this year.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the current year was framed in the expectation that the average employment level for the year would be approximately 4,700 men. In the settling of the Estimate account had to be taken of the fact that this is the first year in which the incentive bonus scheme for forestry workers will be in operation at all forests.  Application of the scheme was completed in October, 1960.  It is a most encouraging fact that forestry workers generally have given a very favourable reception to the scheme.  Their positive reaction to working under incentive conditions has been clearly indicated by a sustained rise in productivity levels, resulting <Col N="1402" /> in substantial savings to the Department in operational costs and in increased earnings for the workers themselves.</P>
    <P>In the application of the scheme my Department has done everything possible to ensure that the increase in labour productivity would not lead to staff redundancy at individual centres and these efforts have been pretty successful. In a comparatively short time the natural increase in the volume of work requiring attention as a result of the rapid gain in the planted area will bring about a progressive increase in the level of employment provided, but for the present the emphasis must continue to be on the provision of steady employment for the maximum possible number of existing staff.</P>
    <P>Turning now to Subhead G&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;Deputies will note that allowance is being made for an increase in forest income in 1961/62 to £542,000, an increase of £179,000 over the original income level expected for 1960/61.  In the event, the Estimate for receipts last year proved to have been substantially undercast.  Actual receipts for the year came to £457,000, by far the highest figure for forest income in any single year to date.  The bulk of this income came from sales of timber in the forests, which realised £398,000 in the year.  The remainder was made up of £33,000 from the sale of sawn timber from the Department's sawmills, £10,000 from sporting, grazing and other rents and £16,000 from miscellaneous sources, including the proceeds of sale of surplus nursery stock.</P>
    <P>The total volume of timber sold in 1960/61 was 4.3 million cubic feet; almost 40 per cent. of this material was over 8&rdquo; quarter girth and therefore in the sawlog or boxwood category. The market for all classes of material in the year was generally very favourable. In particular the increasing volume of heavier material suitable for conversion to structural timber becoming available from the State forest commanded a very ready market.  This provides heartening evidence of increased awareness in the building sector of the competitive qualities of home-grown timber.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> In the expectation that buoyant market conditions will continue to prevail in the current year and that there will be an increase in the volume of all classes of material becoming available, provision has been made in the Estimate for receipts of £490,000 from timber sales in the year.  This is a high target.  I hope that it is not over-optimistic but at any rate I can assure the House that everything possible will be done to reach it.</P>
    <P>The overall level of receipts for 1961/62 has been put at £542,000.  For the first time, therefore, it is expected that forest revenue will pass the half-million pound mark, a significant milestone for State forestry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the increasing acceptance of the satisfactory quality of home-grown timber.  The vital importance of dissipating anything that may yet remain of the old ill-conceived prejudices against Irish timber is not being left to chance.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards has already done valuable work by producing a standard specification governing moisture content limits for softwood timber used for building purposes. This standard specification provides a ready means for the settlement of contract clauses relating to the supply of timber for particular purposes. The Institute intends to formulate other standard specifications for timber in due course.  As a result of recent discussions between the Institute and my Department it has been agreed that the Institute will instal the equipment necessary to carry out exhaustive tests into the mechanical properties of home-grown timber.</P>
    <P>Objective scientific evaluation of Irish timber has hitherto been lacking and the provision of facilities to carry out the necessary mechanical tests will be an important step in the efforts being made to promote the more extensive use and better handling of our timber.  In addition to providing scientific data of considerable importance to the timber trade and to all users of homegrown timber the tests will also be of great value to my Department in indicating the relative qualities of the various species being grown in the <Col N="1404" /> State plantations, variations in the quality of timber grown on different soil types, the effects of various methods of ground preparation, manurial treatment, and so on.</P>
    <P>In this connection the House will be interested to learn that some months ago my Department received from the Forest Products Research Laboratory in England a report on the properties of some pinus contorta grown in an Irish State plantation.  The British Forestry Commission had very kindly arranged for the carrying out of the necessary tests.  Pinus contorta is a particularly important species for Irish forestry because of the extensive use that is being made of the species on some of the less fertile peat areas and the results of the tests are, therefore, of considerable interest.  I am glad to say that the people who conducted the tests were very favourably impressed with the quality of the Irish Pinus contorta sent to them.  It is, in fact, clear from their report that in some respects the timber was superior to Sitka spruce, which has found such favour in recent years.</P>
    <P>The general conclusions from these tests leave no doubt that the continued planting of contorta pine is fully justified and it may well be that the species will eventually enjoy a very high reputation on the timber market. From the point of view of Irish forestry the results of the tests are most encouraging since Pinus contorta has proved to be so well-suited to our western peat areas and they support the view that our pioneer work in the use of the species is likely to pay a handsome dividend in the future.</P>
    <P>As regards private forestry, Deputies will note that the provision for grants for afforestation purposes&mdash;Subhead D &mdash;remains unchanged at £25,000.  No clear picture has yet emerged of the extent of private planting undertaken in 1960/61.  During the year first instalment grants were sanctioned in respect of plantations totalling 987 acres, but most of this planting would have been done in the 1959/60 planting season.  During the past year my Department's efforts to promote more private planting were continued at national and local level.  Four counties &mdash;Laois, Offaly, Mayo and Kerry&mdash;<Col N="1405" /> were selected for special intensive campaigns and during the winter lectures on the benefits of small-scale planting were arranged at 92 centres in those counties.</P>
    <P>During the past year, also, the minimum qualifying area under the planting grant scheme was reduced to half an acre for the congested districts in order to enable more farmers in those districts to avail themselves of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The financial assistance for private planting now provided is on a generous scale.  The full free advisory service ensures that lack of forestry experience need not deter any prospective planter from establishing a plantation on his holding.  My Department will continue in its efforts to secure more private planting but in the final analysis the success of these efforts must depend on the response of our landowners.  I sincerely hope that more of them will come to realise the value of the small farm wood-lot and that they will make full use of the improved assistance now made available for their benefit.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say as regards State forestry generally that in the past 12 months I have had the opportunity of visiting many of our forest areas and of seeing a representative cross-section of our plantations for myself.  I was very impressed by the high quality of the work being done and by the enthusiasm and initiative shown by all the officers concerned with the development and management of our forests.  We can, I think, be justifiably proud of the progress we are making in forestry development and it is in that belief that I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. The Minister did not indicate to the House what the Government's future policy is in relation to an increased afforestation drive.  Up to 1948, the total area planted was 42,000 acres. We had in this country from 1932 to 1948 a Fianna Fáil Government and their best efforts at the end of 1948 were 42,000 acres planted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a new feature.  The position now is that we have 330,000 <Col N="1406" /> acres planted.  That did not happen by accident.  In 1948, there was a change of Government.  The first inter-Party Government devoted most of their energy towards reviving afforestation policy in this country.  As a result of their efforts, most of the present State forests commenced to extend and expand. From 1948 to 1951, most of the forestry centres throughout the country were revived.  Extra employment was given and further lands were made available for afforestation.  A number of new forest centres were established. Unfortunately, in 1951, a change of Government took place, but in the 1952/53 Estimate there was a considerable improvement in the progress of forestry because of the groundwork laid down by the first inter-Party Government. The foundations laid were solid and produced results.</P>
    <P>In 1954, the inter-Party Government again assumed office and continued with increased energy, determination, zeal, enthusiasm and efficiency to tackle once more the afforestation programme. Not alone did they tackle the afforestation programme from 1954 to 1957 but they had a re-examination as to what would be the best means of extending and expanding afforestation. All the difficulties were examined and many of them were sorted out.  It was decided that legislation would have to be introduced for the purpose of simplifying the taking over of land.</P>
    <P>It was the Forestry Act of 1956 which made it simpler and easier to unravel many of the knots which made it impossible for commonage to be acquired for forestry purposes.  The very high acreage the Minister boasts about in his report today shows that the increased acreage under forests has been brought about by the efforts of the two inter-Party Governments and by the progressive legislation which they introduced during their periods of office. Great benefits were associated with the Forestry Act of 1956.  That Act made it possible for some hundreds of acres of land to be acquired more speedily, without loss of time and without any great expenditure.  It made it easier and simpler to acquire lands for forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>Now we find we have reached, in <Col N="1407" /> 1961, a pleasant situation.  In 1948, 42,000 acres were planted and in 1961, 330,000 acres were planted.  Again, that shows that it was not by accident this was brought about.  There were two periods during which the Governments of the day put special emphasis on afforestation.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Department has been subjected on many an occasion to very severe criticism.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me when I say that those people who criticise are fond of writing on afforestation and are anxious to comment either favourably or unfavourably about the headway in afforestation.  It is the easiest thing in the world to plant trees on paper but it is a different day's work to implement speedily extensive schemes of afforestation.</P>
    <P>The programme of afforestation can easily be divided into a number of categories.  We have State afforestation, State planting; we have private planting; we have our marketing section; and we have the training of our staffs, which is very important.  We must take into consideration that employment in forestry is an important factor in the rural areas, particularly in the West.  If the Minister had brought in an Estimate for a much greater sum, it would have met with the approval of all rural Deputies.  The amount provided is insufficient.  As well as providing employment, afforestation can profitably utilise waste land.  One would expect from the Minister, on this his last Estimate before the general election, a declaration of future policy and a substantial increase on all subheads.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £24,675 under the subhead for salaries, wages and allowances, attributable to essential increases in the inspectorate, engineering, forester and indoor staffs. I think there should be a special word of praise for the valuable work carried out by the engineering section and the inspectorate.  Our qualified advisory and technical staffs are equal to, if not better than, the best in the world to-day. I venture to say that if there was a competition in which our forestry staffs were pitting their <Col N="1408" /> experience and practical knowledge against colleagues from such countries as Norway and France, which specialise in forestry, our men would give a very creditable account of themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister has charge of a very efficient and highly geared machine. That did not come about over-night. It took many years of training to reach the stage, as the Minister said, of having our trained personnel leaving the training colleges.  We hope that trend will continue.  It can be said that we have now made strides in afforestation. The forestry colleges have produced very good results.  A tribute to the high standard of training and instruction given by the staff at the college in my constituency should be placed on record. While such standards exist we can expect that our trained forestry personnel in future years will be better than the best in the world.  All of us are quick to criticise, but we should not be slow either to give deserved praise.  Therefore, I take this opportunity of saying again that our advisory and technical staffs rank with the best in the world.</P>
    <P>I am rather disappointed at the amount of money provided for publicity. I think we could do more in that field.  I know the forestry section like to spend every penny wisely and that it is the duty of the heads of the Department to see there is careful and wise spending.  But we must take steps to advertise.  There should be publicity to encourage private plantation and further publicity in regard to State plantations.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the progress of our forestry education, and we were glad to note that the expenditure for the coming year is up by £5,085. The Minister said it was expected in the current year there would be an average of 92 trainee foresters undergoing instruction in the Department's two training establishments.  I believe there is a future in afforestation for the right type of person.  In the past we have found very great difficulty in getting horticultural instructors; one cannot be got in my county to-day. There are other professions also in which it is difficult to get trained people because of the limited number <Col N="1409" /> entering them.  With the expansion of afforestation and the possibilities of future development, there is a duty on the Minister for Lands to draw to the attention of parents, anxious to find a good profession at home for their children, the possibility of a career in forestry.  We should draw up a plan extending over ten or fifteen years so that we would be in a position to have a fully trained staff to control our State forests and an advisory staff to advise on private afforestation.</P>
    <P>There is a great future in private afforestation.  It is only in recent years people have become interested in it.  I think there is a great opening in forestry training for young men anxious to embark on a profitable career and this should be made known.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that steps have been taken regarding Avondale House, the old home of Parnell and a very historic spot.  It is a source of great satisfaction that Avondale is again playing an important rôle in Irish forestry.  The Department have acted wisely in that case and I am sure Avondale House will play a very distinguished part in the future of Irish forestry.</P>
    <P>The bonus scheme for forestry workers is a good scheme because the workers feel that under it they can earn better pay and the Forestry Branch probably also realise that under it a greater amount of work is undertaken. I should like the Minister to give some consideration to initiating a pension scheme for forestry workers who are carrying out very specialised work. The ordinary county council road workers have a contributory scheme now and when forestry workers reach retiring age they should not be thrown on the scrap heap without provision. We have forestry centres in most parts of the country and each worker becomes highly trained each in his own sphere of work, whether thinning, drainage, preparing land or carrying out special trimming and pruning. Therefore, not alone should provision be made at present for workers but also for their retirement.  I trust the Department will examine that possibility perhaps in conjunction with the men's unions or other organisations so that <Col N="1410" /> some practical move may result which would give the workers some security and return for the services they render in such an important sphere.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a very important factor to which the Minister and probably the forestry people do not seem to advert as much as they should.  In many of our forests, workers are obliged to wear second-hand thigh boots and in many cases, certainly in my own constituency, workers object to this.  There are many health reasons against this practice.  The medical profession and officers of the Department of Health always issue warnings against wearing the boots of other people.  Politically, it may be all right but I doubt if it is a wise thing for workers to work in boots that have been worn by others.</P>
    <P>I ask the Department to make some provision to obviate this necessity.  I do not know what provision can be made.  The excuse given officially is that thigh boots are used only occasionally when drainage work is being done and that it would be impossible to have a pair for every worker.  Some arrangement should be made by which the forester in charge of each centre would allocate the boots so that they would be worn by the same person all the time instead of having them passed round from one to the other.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that certain diseases have been contracted through wearing secondhand footwear, and naturally workers are afraid to take the risk.  I do not know what has been the result of representations I made to the Minister but I suggest that the Department should have sufficient thigh boots in stock to enable them to be allocated to the same people time after time&mdash;naturally to those specialising in drainage work.  Each forester will know the best men for drainage, for thinning and other specialised work, and I ask the Minister to direct his officers to see that no worker will be compelled to wear secondhand boots if he does not wish to do so.</P>
    <P>Last year a gross total of almost 30,000 acres was acquired for forestry purposes.  That is a reasonably good result for one year.  I presume the <Col N="1411" /> 1956 Act was responsible in no small way for that acreage.  Could the Minister put on record the result of experiments that have been carried out &mdash;he made no reference to this in his speech to-day&mdash;in regard to the utilisation of certain bogland for forestry purposes?  I know some experiments were carried out at Clonsast in Offaly but what the results were I cannot say.  There was little reference to it in last years report and the next annual report will not be published for another week or ten days.  State and private forestry, I feel, could work hand in hand with Bord na Móna in having certain types of bogland planted with plants that will thrive in the type of bogland available.</P>
    <P>Previously I asked that frequent conferences be held between the Forestry Branch and Bord na Móna but I see little evidence of any land which Bord na Móna holds being planted and I know they have extensive areas of waste land.  We have a very highly trained staff available for experimental purposes and it is difficult to understand why there has not been a greater degree of co-operation between the Forestry Branch and Bord na Móna, especially when in most areas Bord na Móna have large acreages of surplus cutaway bog.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to planting. I note he describes the target of 25,000 acres as an ambitious programme.  The planting programme has certainly been speeded up but I think there is room for a greater degree of acceleration.  There are 4,700 men employed.  It should be possible to employ at least 20,000.  The Minister told us that it is now possible to acquire certain lands in the West for afforestation.  I remember receiving a deputation from the Muinntir na Tire organisation in South Leitrim.  Proposals were submitted for an afforestation scheme there.  The deputation came from Drumkeerin.  I should like to know what happened to those proposals.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why there should not be greater progress.  We have the <Col N="1412" /> land; we have the trained personnel; we have the men; we have the nurseries. I expected the Minister to make some reference to the Shannon Valley. I understood the Forestry Branch were examining the position there.  Right down from Longford to North Tipperary there are extensive properties on both sides of the Shannon which would be available for afforestation. The land, of course, is subject to flooding but very successful afforestation has been done in the United States of America under similar conditions. The Forestry Branch should survey the Shannon and the Nore.</P>
    <P>Why is it not possible to have more land available for afforestation? The answer is that those who offer land to the Forestry Branch expect to get a little more for it.  I have known instances in my own constituency in which I thought the valuers for the Forestry Branch valued a little bit on their own side.  In most cases they are very reasonable.  Remembering the high value placed on land for agricultural purposes it is a bit difficult to understand the rather low value placed on land for forestry purposes.  I think that a more generous response would result if the valuation was increased.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister said:</P>
    <P>When I was introducing last year's Estimate I mentioned that the Statutory Regulations to deal with commonage and title difficulty cases under the provisions of the Forestry Act, 1956, had been made and that action had just been initiated in the first case to be dealt with under the new procedure, which involves the formal use of the compulsory acquisition machinery provided in the Forestry Act, 1956.  Since then, progress has been made in several cases suitable for treatment in this way.  The position at present is that acquisition orders have been made by the Land Commission in respect of a total of 2,514 acres, applications for acquisition orders in respect of 2,822 acres have been made and are awaiting hearing and applications are pending in respect of areas totalling 1,714 acres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> That demonstrates the foresight shown and the usefulness in introducing and passing the Forestry Act of 1956.  It has contributed in no small measure to the satisfactory position indicated by the Minister.  I think the amount of money provided for new roads and buildings should have been substantially increased.  Nothing beautifies a country like trees.  Every single acre should be acquired for afforestation, not merely to beautify the country but also because of the employment potential.</P>
    <P>The position is we cannot bring visitors in through our forests to see them because of the lack of proper roads.  The local authorities and the Department of Local Government should be prepared to set aside a sum of money either from the Road Fund or some other source to which a contribution could be made by the Forestry Branch for the provision and maintenance of roads convenient to State forests.  Take, for instance, the route from Mountrath to Killenure right down to the Slieve Bloom mountains and across to Clonaslee, one of the most beautiful parts of Ireland.  It is beautiful because of the tremendous work carried out by the Forestry Branch.  In fact it is God's own country. Thousands of our people are travelling to the far corners of the world to view scenery while there is nothing to equal the scenery which can be viewed from the top of the Slieve Bloom mountains.  Forest roadways would eventually be needed for the haulage of timber when it reaches the stage of being cut for sale or for commercial use.  It is very hard to see how this timber can be transported economically from some of our new forest centres unless better roads are provided.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Branch should give serious consideration also to the building of modern houses for our foresters convenient to plantations.  It may be rather expensive to provide up-to-date residences for them but when we have a Forestry Branch let us look after those who are employed by it so that good results will be achieved.</P>
    <P>Steps are also being taken, I see, for the establishment of large-scale nurseries <Col N="1414" /> to replace the existing nursery units of uneconomic size.  That is a step in the right direction.  When we realise that the present programme envisages the use of 40,000,000 young trees a year it indicates that there is great scope for large-scale nurseries. I have often wondered why it was not possible to establish large-scale nurseries in some of the forestry centres in the Midlands.  If we accelerate the the forestry programme, take over more land, and have it drained, we may reach the stage when it will be 50,000,000 young trees a year instead of 40,000,000.  In those circumstances it is only right that these large-scale nurseries should be established either by amalgamating uneconomic sized units or creating new nurseries on an extensive scale.</P>
    <P>May I ask this question of the Minister for Lands?  If one travels through France, particularly the South of France, one will notice the very beautiful tall trees growing on both sides of the road.  What seems to be disappearing altogether from this country is the good old poplar tree.  Many of them stood in parts of County Laois and County Kilkenny but usually after every storm or, after every high wind, there would be fewer of them standing.  The Forestry Branch should consider replacing them. Those poplar trees were a landmark which beautified the country and I would suggest the planting of all lands which may become available near main roads and near county roads.  The Forestry Branch may not like undertaking isolated schemes because of their uneconomic nature but I have often wondered why local authorities had not the power to plant small areas of land convenient to main roads.  I expect the only provision that would be available for them would be the same as that for private planting.  Nevertheless the Forestry Branch should consider having lands convenient to our main roads planted.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Forestry Branch on the work they carried out last year in the encouragement of private planting.  Last winter was well spent in organising interesting lectures which I understand were given by Professor Cleere.  Professor Cleere has <Col N="1415" /> the gift of imparting his very wide knowledge in a very understandable way to his listeners and he is a man of whom we can be proud.  I am sure there are many people of his type who would be prepared to go through the country and lecture on the importance of private planting.  While the Minister has increased the grant for private afforestation, it is insufficient to encourage private planting on a large scale.  The Minister knows that in France new private plantations are exempt from local rates for a period of 30 years because it is recognised that young trees planted will not be a paying proposition for at least 30 years.  That is a great encouragement. Special concessions are given in Denmark to encourage private planting.  In Norway, in poorly wooded districts, taxpayers may claim all their expenses in connection with the raising of forests in their district, subject, of course, to certain limits.  All the old-fashioned woodlands are profit-making.</P>
    <P>In France, Denmark, Norway and British Columbia, special provision is made so that land owners may obtain a tree farm classification for tax purposes.  If Irish land owners could get an abatement of rates or a financial concession of any kind, it would encourage private planting.  I am sure the Forestry Branch has examined this matter but the Minister has not referred in his introductory speech to the means by which he will encourage private planting.</P>
    <P>In Sweden the tax payable to the local authority is based on the income derived from the amount of land planted and if no income is being so derived the landowner does not have to pay his share of local taxation.  It will be seen, therefore, that in Sweden, Norway, British Columbia, Denmark and France wonderful encouragement is given to private planting.  In this country the encouragement given is insufficient to attract land-owners to carry out this work.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the position in relation to the availability of advice for private planters.  In this country it may be possible to obtain certain <Col N="1416" /> information from the local forester, but the local forester is not always available.  In Sweden, private forest owners have at their disposal a comprehensive forestry organisation with Government employed forestry officers, forest guards, etc., whose duty it is to help private owners with the organisation of their forests and to advise on planting and thinning.</P>
    <P>Private planting has been tackled properly and courageously in Sweden and, if we are anxious to embark on a scheme of private afforestation, we must take a leaf from the book of countries where it has been a terrific success.  In no country in the world has there been the degree of profitable private planting that there has been in Sweden.  That is not surprising having regard to all the facilities placed at the disposal of landowners who are prepared to spend a great share of their own money in private planting. We do not seem to have that service in this country.  If we are to develop private planting, facilities must be made available.  We have the experts. There are 92 trainees completing a course in College.  We have the best and most highly technically qualified people in the world.  In relation to private planting the only advisory service is the county committee of agriculture, the local forester and the Forestry Branch who may give advice when requested.  The Minister for Lands should copy the Swedish method of promoting private planting.</P>
    <P>In Denmark private planting has also been encouraged.  It carries free supervision from the Department of Lands and there is also a very substantial and high rate State grant.  The State grant here would not encourage people to use their land for planting purposes.  In Denmark there is a free advisory service also.  The Minister for Lands during the past year was in some country reviewing forestry work, with particular reference to private forests.  I do not know if he was in Denmark or Sweden.  Denmark and Sweden have produced results and there is no reason why we cannot produce them.</P>
    <P>In Ontario assistance is given in drawing up plans and any assistance required is provided free of charge to <Col N="1417" /> anybody who has any portion of land for private planting, whether big or small.  In Great Britain the Forestry Commission has officers in each area whose sole duty it is to visit private forests and plantations and to give every kind of advice and assistance that is required.  The Forestry Commission there have already listed a number of private plantations and have guaranteed markets for the product. It would appear that private afforestation in England has made wonderful strides due to the amount of work being done by the Forestry Commission and the support they give to private planters.</P>
    <P>We are making a certain amount of headway in State afforestation.  We can make more.  The land is available, the workers are available, the plants are there and the staff and technical personnel are available.  Let us go full steam ahead.  We are capable of employing twice as many men. Where there is mountain land suitable for afforestation, planting should proceed. A conference should be convened with Bord na Móna with a view to planting waste bogland.  Let us courageously tackle the problem of private planting on the same lines as other countries have done.  In that way we can make some headway.</P>
    <P>About a year and a half ago the master builders referred to the fact, and every Deputy notes with pride and satisfaction, that the doubt that existed in relation to home-grown timber is dying out.  It is a source of very great satisfaction indeed that our home-produced timber is now looked upon as the best for building purposes.  It compares more than favourably with the best timber imported for construction purposes.  The Minister must admit that is a great stride and a great achievement.</P>
    <P>Naturally, we cannot allow this occasion to pass without commenting on the foresight of the first Cumann na nGaedheal Government in embarking on the first scheme of afforestation and planting.  I recall, from reading the debates, the difficult problem they had putting the Estimates through the House but the timber now being sold is the pride of the forestry section. <Col N="1418" /> Thirty-five or 40 years ago, the land was prepared for growing the little plants which are now being used as timber which is the pride and joy of the building trade.  The foresight understanding and wisdom of the old Cumann na nGaedheal and Fine Gael Governments are shown in their decision that our own houses should be built with native timber.  We have now reached the stage where the building trade experts say that our own forests and woods produce timber that compares favourably with the best timber that can be imported for building purposes.  That is what we wanted to achieve.</P>
    <P>We should all realise, and the tax-payers should realise, that the money we sink in afforestation will not show results overnight.  Afforestation takes at least 20, 25 or 30 years to produce results.  The more money we invest in afforestation, the greater will be the yield in profits and dividends in 35 or 40 years time.  I am glad there is such a market for our timber.  I am glad it has been used by the E.S.B. as poles. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs also use it as poles.  We now have the E.S.B. and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs using our own timber which has been stated publicly to be the pride of the master builders' association.  If it were not for the first steps which were taken in afforestation, we would not find ourselves in the happy position in which we find ourselves today.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not taken up too much of the time of the House on this Estimate but it is one in which the Fine Gael Party take a very great interest.  The Fine Gael Party believe more people can be employed, and more waste lands utilised, the country can be beautified by trees, and the economy of the country can be strengthened through afforestation.  The aim of this Party is to maintain and expand the afforestation programme initiated by the old Cumman na nGaedheal Government and carried on during the two periods of office of the inter-Party Government which certainly showed great drive and initiative in furthering our afforestation programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> The Fine Gael Party established efficient marketing machinery for forestry products.  That marketing machinery should be improved and developed to an even greater extent. There is room for the establishment of suitable rural industries to handle the by-products of timber.  We have the trained personnel and we should now get down to the establishment of industries convenient to the forestry centres which will employ local labour, be it technical or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference to the by-products of timber.  As I have said, we see the tremendous progress which was made in Sweden, Denmark and Norway in relation to local industries set up to deal with the by-products of timber.  I wonder have our forestry section done any planning in that regard?  Have they had sufficient foresight to plan and look ahead and see what industries can be set up to deal with these by-products?</P>
    <P>Any steps taken by the forestry section are certainly steps in the right direction.  They have a big job, a job which cannot be done overnight. Forestry will not produce results overnight. Forestry is the one section where you cannot see results from year to year because of the extent and nature of the work.  Let us not be too hasty, but let us lay down the foundations for greater progress, drive and enthusiasm. There should be greater determination on the part of the State to bring home to the people the importance of afforestation.</P>
    <P>The forestry section is looked upon by some Deputies as a second-rate section but I believe there is no more important section of a Department in the country than the forestry section. The forestry people realise that it should not be shoved into the background. It can give employment, beautify the country and bring us a return in the years to come.  That is why I say every effort should be made to revive enthusiasm in relation to afforestation.  We will get a return from the money we sink in it and we will get greater profits eventually.  Is it not grand to see employment given and the countryside beautified and, <Col N="1420" /> at the same time, our own resources being strengthened, and to have the knowledge our own timber compares favourably with the best that can be imported from any part of the world?</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister will bear in mind the great source of employment afforestation is.  My view is&mdash;I do not know if the Minister shares it&mdash;that between State afforestation and the establishment of minor industries for timber products, with long term planning, taking into account the amount of land available &mdash;which can be got and which must be got, if we are to expand&mdash;the aim of all Parties in this House, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour, should be to develop afforestation to the fullest possible extent.  It is not 4,500 men we should employ but 20,000. We have the men.  All we need is the initiative, the drive and a realisation of the urgency and importance of afforestation.  It can be done and it will be done with drive and initiative in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an Estimate in which I take a particular interest each year when it comes before the House.  At the outset it is no harm to look at the nature of the work confronting the Forestry Department. They have three principal tasks, the acquisition of land, the actual planting of land&mdash;including the nurseries to grow plants, providing fences, drainage and road making&mdash;and thirdly, but by no means least important, is the sale of the produce of the forests.  I was very pleased to learn this year that the Appropriations-in-Aid, the sales of timber, in the Department had come well over the half million pound mark. I remember the first time I had anything to do with forestry, in 1948, and the figure then was £103,000.  Therefore these figures, the £103,000 in 1948 and the £542,000 in 1961-62, give a very adequate answer to any opponents afforestation might have.  It is the one Department which is helping to pay its way.  I can visualise the time in the years ahead when, instead of the Minister for Lands coming in to look for money, his Department will be showing a profit and funds will be going in to the Exchequer from the yields <Col N="1421" /> from the sale of timber now being planted and which will come to maturity slowly but surely.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us there were 2,800,000 cubic feet of thinnings last year but he did not tell us what was done with them or where the market for such a quantity of timber was.  I suppose they would be up to and beyond eight inches to nine inches in girth.  In that connection it is relevant to inquire what is the Government's intention in regard to setting up a pulp mill to utilise this timber and to convert some of it into pulp.  The Minister will probably tell me that there are already a few private industries participating to a certain extent in that work.  As far as I can see, private industry could not establish an industry of the proportions needed to handle the output from the forests.</P>
      <P>When the Minister is replying I should like him to tell the House what the cubic footage is expected to be in 1970, nine years ahead.  While I have the greatest admiration for private industry which is already handling and converting timber thinnings into pulp and other by-products, I think the financial implications in such a huge industry could not be handled by private industrialists.  I believe it would run into the region of £9 million or £10 million to establish a pulp mill with subsidiary industries to handle the out-turn of the forests in eight or nine years time.  I submit that it is not too soon to look ahead to our doing that.  It is something which the State must undertake sooner or later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to answer those two points: in what way were the 3 million cubic feet of thinnings disposed of last year, and secondly, what is the intention regarding the setting up of an industry to handle the output?  I was disappointed to see that private planting was not making better headway.  Might I give the reason for that?  The planting of half an acre or an acre by the private individual is not so easy as it looks at first sight.  I am quite sure many people who know nothing about land or the life of the average farmer think to themselves &ldquo;Is that not a lazy fellow when he will not put an acre or two <Col N="1422" /> under timber?&rdquo;  For the average small farmer it is quite a substantial undertaking. Even the worst acre of land he has is producing something.  It might be a run for a horse, a few sheep or cattle and while it may not be making a profit it is helping him.</P>
    <P>We must remember that a man who intends to put an acre of land under timber has to fence it off completely and, while he is paying rent and rates for it, it will be absolutely no use to him for 12 or 15 years, when he may get a return.  While £20 might seem a substantial grant, I submit it is totally inadequate for this reason.  The Forestry Department have experts and they have all the machinery of the Government behind them.  It must be admitted they are doing a huge job very economically but the Minister is asking for £3 million to plant 25,000 acres this year.  If we do a simple sum of division, we find that each acre the Forestry Department is planting, has planted or will plant, is costing about £108.  That includes the buying of land.  If we take the £10 which is the highest figure per acre they give, we find that between nurseries and fencing, drainage and all the rest, each acre costs £108.  When we look at it that way, we see that it still costs the Forestry Department, who are doing the job as economically as possible, £108.</P>
    <P>The reason private planting has not gone ahead is that the £20 grant is just not sufficient.  Deputy Flanagan suggested there should be some other inducement and I agree.  I think the plantation, until it starts to earn some income in about 15 years time, should be free of rates.  That would require legislation.  The private planter could make a very good contribution and the question of increasing the grant should be looked into.</P>
    <P>I understood from the Minister's opening speech that there was a surplus of plants disposed of last year. How were they disposed of and to whom?  I was very glad to see that Avondale is being saved.  The last time I was in Avondale was during the summer of 1956 and it was then showing signs of its age.  The roof was bad and the floors were beginning to give <Col N="1423" /> way.  I am very glad to see that the old home of Charles Stewart Parnell, who was good enough to make his home the first home for forestry, is now going to have sufficient money spent on it to keep it in good order.  I do not care to what use it is put afterwards. I am glad that the fact that Parnell was so enthusiastic about afforestation to give his home and land to the government of the day for afforestation purposes is being appreciated.  It would be a shameful thing if the house were allowed to fall into a state of disrepair.</P>
    <P>There is a plantable reserve of 50,000 acres this year.  I can describe it as being barely safe.  It is essential, if we are to get on with forestry properly, that we should build up to at least a three years' reserve.  That would bring us to a plantable reserve of 75,000 acres.  I fully appreciate the difficulties of getting sufficient land. The lots of land coming on offer to the Forestry Department are getting smaller in size each year.  The Minister told us that the average is dropping year by year.  That is to be expected. The large areas of land, as far as I know, have come in already.  There are not many more big widths of country to swell the acreage required.  We shall have to fall back on smaller and smaller lots.  Nevertheless that should not be a deterrent.  If necessary the staff in the Acquisition Section of the Forestry Department should be increased to meet that threat.  When we find the acreage getting smaller, it is a threat.</P>
    <P>Over 400 cases were handled last year.  That is a very creditable piece of work for the men concerned.  Even 200 cases of title&mdash;and we know of the deplorable state of the title of a great deal of the land of this country&mdash;is, I think, very creditable for the Acquisition Section to have ploughed through and brought to a successful conclusion. Above any section of the Forestry Department, there is very great credit due to them for that work.</P>
    <P>Being a legal man the Minister must know quite well how difficult it is to iron out all these small knotty problems that are so irritating.  I shall not <Col N="1424" /> dwell any further on the plantable reserve.  We have to be satisfied with it.  We should like an adequate storage.  However, it is not bad.  It is quite enough to get by with, provided we can keep up an intake of 30,000 acres a year.  I want to throw out a warning that I think it will be very difficult for the Forestry Division to maintain the acquisition of 30,000 acres a year.</P>
    <P>The getting of 30,000 acres is a terrific problem.  I would like to see an intake of 30,000 acres a year for a few years.  That amount is needed but I do not see any hope of it. Forest enthusiasts now and again let themselves go and urge compulsory acquisition for forestry purposes.  That is one thing that should never be contemplated for a moment.  There is nothing more vulnerable than growing forestry.  If the Forestry Department have not the goodwill of the people who live in the vicinity they will not have the forest.  On a few occasions it was brought to my notice that, without compulsory acquisition proceedings at all, some local fellow did not like the fact that a piece of grazing was sold and that forestry put it out of his reach.  In one case, he burned it for the third time, I believe.  That shows that in the matter of acquisition of land the goodwill of the local people must be retained if the forest is to be a success.  Otherwise it will be burned down.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the establishment of big nurseries.  Smaller nurseries might be more economic.  They might be easier for the Department to handle and to manage; and might work out cheaper in the long run.  I think some of the small nurseries that were established and that gave very good and useful employment in areas where no other employment was likely should never have been abandoned. That happened to some of them when the present Minister for Transport and Power was Minister for Lands. It was a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>A Forestry Department, as well as being saddled with the job of growing our requirements of timber, takes part in social work of a very high character. They give employment in the backward <Col N="1425" /> rural areas.  The areas are backward because it is only where the land is poorest that the Forestry people can or will acquire land for afforestation. Along with the employment given by ordinary forest work in these areas, I think it was a huge mistake to close down some of the smaller nurseries which were giving very useful and much-needed employment.  One, at Moore Hall, was established in 1949 or 1950.  It was giving employment to about 30 men.  That was closed on the ground of economy and the growing of the trees was transferred to God knows where.  I made inquiries a few months back and to my surprise I learned that 22 of the 30 men had emigrated since they laid off work in that nursery.</P>
    <P>That is one example of why, while it might be very creditable for any Government Department to effect as much economy as possible, it is a desperate thing when, for the sake of a few pounds economy, we lose 20 or 22 men in one small area.  I know the place intimately; it is outside my own home.  Whatever Minister advises that kind of thing is certainly not doing his work properly.  I cannot understand how it is that the planting acreage is going up but that the number of men employed is shrinking.  It was 126 lower last year compared with the year before.  That needs a word of explanation when the Minister comes to reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the English Forest Products Research Laboratory carried out certain research work on contorta pine timber submitted to them.  I should like to hear more about that.  I learned to regard contorta pine in a not very favourable light as a commercial timber.  I should be delighted to hear that I was wrong.  I should like the Minister to tell us some more about the samples submitted to the Forest Products Research Laboratory, the kind of soil on which they were grown and the elevation.  All these factors should be taken into account in the testing of timber.</P>
    <P>If you sow contorta pine on a very poor type of peat soil I know the type of timber you will get.  On a good mineral soil you would get a reasonably good contorta pine.  The Minister <Col N="1426" /> seems delighted that the British research people gave a favourable account of the contorta pine sample submitted to them.  I should like to know more about it than that.  The few curtailed remarks the Minister made about it do not make the position very clear.</P>
    <P>As regards planting in the West of Ireland, I am sorry to note that since the Minister took over, or even since the present Government took office, not many new forests have been established from Donegal to Kerry.  It is to that part of the country that we must look to get the greatest acreage of our forestry plantations.  It would be sheer madness to plant arable or marginal land.  Because the biggest area of suitable forestry land is in the west of Ireland, we look there for the land we need for this work.  I am sorry to have to say that for the past five years no new forest I know of has begun and that any additions to existing forests have been meagre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the position, it is clear that the Rome Treaty provides for the possibility of separate protocols relating to the circumstances of individual members, even existing members.  It is not possible to give any further information as to how long it may take to negotiate a protocol for this country or what the precise procedure may be.  It will be a matter for us to decide, knowing the terms of any such protocol, whether we will accept membership.</P>

      <P>May I put it this way?  It is quite clear that a decision by the British Government not to pursue the matter of membership would not put matters back into the state they were before but would create a new situation.  It is only when the particulars of that situation are known to us that we should make a decision as to our course of action.</P>

      <P>The questions I wished to ask have been largely put by Deputy Norton.  In the event of the United Kingdom not applying for membership of the Common Market&mdash;and that is most unlikely&mdash;is it then the policy of the Government to apply for admission or not?  Could the Taoiseach say if this Government are acting independently of the United Kingdom subsequent to the present events clearing themselves within the next fortnight?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

      <P>Of course, there is no question of going in by the back door.  That is nonsense.  We are free to take any decision we want to take. The question is what is the best decision in the national interests and that can be taken only when we know the facts.</P>

There is always a danger that slow moving waters may, from time to time, become polluted by infected rats and, consequently, the practice of bathing in canals should be strongly discouraged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why a deduction of 18/6d. per week is being made from the contributory old age pension of Mr. George King, Julianstown, Drogheda, County Louth, C.P. 19412, for the purpose of recovering an alleged over-payment of £80 5s. 0d. of non-contributory pension paid to Mr. King, in view of the fact that Duleek old age pension sub-committee had decided that this sum was not recoverable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overpayment referred to in the question arose as a result of the revocation of Mr. King's non-contributory Old Age Pension as from 22nd November, 1957, by decision of an Appeals Officer following an oral hearing by him of the facts of the case.  The recovery of Old Age Pension money irregularly obtained by persons who were not entitled thereto is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare and not for an old age pension sub-committee, which has no functions in this respect.</P>

      <P>There is no proposal before my Department at present for the erection of additional houses by Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  On 3rd June, 1961, I informed the Corporation that no objection would be raised to their proposal to proceed with the erection of a further 44 houses at &ldquo;Boley,&rdquo; Abbey Road, Monkstown, <Col N="1462" /> where 46 houses are at present in course of erection.  A proposal in regard to acceptance of a tender for these further houses is awaited.  I have no precise information as to the extent of the additional need.  I have, however, requested the housing authority to make a survey of the remaining unfit houses in their area and I understand that this is being carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of sales of home-grown timber for ordinary commercial purposes, I am glad to note that a good deal of the old prejudice against native timber has <Col N="1467" /> died out.  The practice that existed from time immemorial up to about 1948 or 1949, whereby the best Irish timber was sawn up and sold to the customer with the sap dripping out of it, did more damage than anything I know of.  The result was that customers who burned their fingers with it would not touch it again.  Since the starting of kiln drying by the Department in their mills, I am glad to note that other sawmills have installed adequate means of drying timber and of putting it on the market in as good shape as the foreign product.</P>
      <P>The time has come for the Department to give a certain amount of protection to the name of Irish timber.  It is not good enough to allow our own citizens, for the sake of profit and through carelessness, to destroy the name of one of our most valuable products.  This is like the Department of Agriculture insisting that farmers, for their own good should rid their herds of T.B. and I think it would not be too much to ask those handling native timber to ensure that they do not damage its name or reputation simply through greed or carelessness.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in the experiments carried out at my direction in the plantations established on the poorest quality peat land in the West of Ireland.  There are three of them pretty close to myself and the Minister, one at Shrahmore.  I think the name of the forest is Nephinbeg, a huge area planted on poor quality peat. There is a similar one at Cloosh in Connemara outside Oughterard and a third at Glenamoy in North Mayo. At Glenamoy, the quality of the bog is much better.  The severest tests of the possibility of growing timber on poor quality land have taken place at Nephinbeg in Mayo and at Cloosh in Galway.  The Minister might have referred to these in his opening speech and told us how they are getting on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I remember correctly, there must be about 5,000 acres planted at Nephinbeg where a large proportion of it is of a very poor type, so poor that when a small pilot plot was put down, the experts believed the trees could <Col N="1468" /> not survive.  They got a little help by way of fertiliser.  Even if we succeed in getting second quality timber to grow on such land, it will be well worth while and the shedding of the foliage of the first crop will condition the soil to produce a better crop in the following rotation.  Would the Minister be good enough to tell us exactly what is happening there?  His technical advisers will know all about these matters.</P>
    <P>I was dealing before Question Time with planting in the west of Ireland. It is only right that the largest area of plantation should be along the west coast because there we have the greatest area of land suitable only for afforestation.  While very fine plantations are established in Wicklow and some scattered places in the midlands, it is along the west coast that we must look for land for afforestation purposes. The Minister told us that something like 48 per cent. of the land intake during the year was along the west coast.  I am very glad of that because of the very poor quality of the land there and it is from that area that the emigration is greatest.  If we can use State money to establish plantations there and hold some of the people, we shall be doing good work.  Such land is contributing a little towards agricultural output in providing sheep grazing but there is a factor now very noticeable to anybody going through the mountainous areas in the west, that is, the peculiar spread of ferns.</P>
    <P>In 1950, Wicklow farmers told me that ferns had banished the sheep farmers off the land there and I see the same thing happening now in the West. It may be a climatic change.  I do not know if anybody can account for it but more and more deaths of stock from fern poisoning are occurring. This, with other factors, discourages people on the mountain farms and timber seems to be the only thing that can be introduced.  We cannot afford to leave such large tracts derelict.  The situation will not be too bad if we can replace the livestock with timber after the ferns have done their deadly work of driving the farmers from the hills.  Timber will hold some of the population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> I was very disappointed at the number of men now employed, 4,653, an average of 126 less than the year before. Although there is probably a very good reason for it, I find it hard to understand this fall.  When I handed over the Department to Deputy Childers in 1957, if I remember correctly, the number of labourers employed by the Forestry Branch exceeded 5,000.  At that time planting had reached about 17,500 or 20,000 acres and the number employed was over 5,000.  Now when 5,000 more acres per year are being planted, the number of men employed has dropped. Is this due to the increased use of machinery?</P>
    <P>Efforts to promote private planting have flopped, largely because the grants are insufficient.  The cost to the Forestry Branch of planting an acre, including the purchase of the land, works out at about £108 per acre.  That is calculated by taking the overall cost to the Department and dividing it by the number of acres planted.  I admit there is not much comparison between private planting and what the Forestry Branch does, but the gap between £20 and £108 is too great and if we want to induce land owners to plant, we must sweeten the pill, so to speak, with better grants and also by offering to keep such land free of rates.</P>
    <P>I take a great interest in this Estimate each year because I believe it is absolutely necessary to stop the outlay of £10,000,000 or £11,000,000 a year on imported timber and wood products. It is essential that we supply our needs from our own resources.  We have the land, the people to produce the timber and a climate in which timber can be raised as successfully as in any other country.  We must consider also the flight from the land and it is where the quality of the land is poorest that emigration is greatest.  In those circumstances, the Forestry Section can do a very good job by keeping at least some of our population at home, even if it means changing from farming and wage-earning to a livelihood of complete wage-earning in forestry work.  I have never known forestry workers, sure of getting constant employment, anxious to emigrate, <Col N="1470" /> although it is quite possible they could get better wages across the water.</P>
    <P>I am very proud of our forestry development, although I feel a little embarrassment in speaking on this Vote each year, since I was largely responsible for bringing forestry to what it is today.  That, however, will not prevent me from giving advice to whatever Minister is in office and from taking an active interest in forestry and trying to ensure that the baby I had in my charge for a while is thriving, thanks, not so much to the Minister, but rather to the officials of his Department who know their job and do it well.</P>
    <P>The only thing the Minister has to be proud of is the fact that he did not tamper with the machine.  He sat idly by and let the machine do the work. I offer him my sincerest thanks for not putting the machine off the rails; I congratulate him on leaving it alone. The Minister takes some interest in the Fisheries Branch.  More power to his elbow.  He should remember, however, that it is to the Land Commission and the Forestry Branch that many people look for a livelihood and for an improvement in their lot in life. The Minister should not stand idly by and devote all his attention to Fisheries, leaving the other machines to run as they will.  I am glad he did not interfere with the Forestry machine, but, good as it is, there are still improvements to be made in it.</P>
    <P>Steps will have to be taken now to absorb what I estimate at not less than 8,000,000 cubic feet of timber which will come out of our forests in seven or eight years time.  I cannot see a local market for all that timber but it has to be remembered that we pay £6 million or £7 million every year to foreign countries for pulp produced from timber similar to what we grow here.  Thinnings should be turned into paper, thereby providing very necessary employment and keeping so much sterling at home, while, at the same time, considerably decreasing our need for dollar currency.  These are the things to which the Minister should turn his attention.</P>
    <P>The planting programme of 25,000 acres annually initiated by the first <Col N="1471" /> inter-Party Government has been achieved and the programme is now running smoothly.  I have complete faith in the officials of the Forestry Branch.  I appreciate the difficulty there is in acquiring the necessary acreage each year to keep up the plantable reserve.  There are some fairly big issues involved.  One is the possibility of increasing the planting programme to 30,000 acres per year.</P>
    <P>I impress upon the Minister the absolute necessity of making provision now for utilising the vast cubic footage of timber which will come out of our forests in the next eight or ten years. It will be a national crime if that timber is felled and allowed to rot, while we continue to pay £6 million or £7 million for imported paper, paper which we could produce ourselves from our own raw materials.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to compliment the officials of the Forestry Branch on the excellent work they are doing, sometimes with very poor help from this House.  It is only right we should acknowledge their work.  In a few years time, this is one branch of Government activity which will pay its way.  Instead of the Minister coming in here looking for money, he will be coming in with an account which will show a profit earned, a profit which he will hand over to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prompted to rise by the Minister's statement that he feels a justifiable pride in the progress made in forestry development.  I wonder is the Minister proud of the timber that is now coming to maturity, timber planted by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government?  Or is he proud of the fact that last year a sum of £100,000 was left unspent?  That surplus could have been diverted to dealing with unemployment and emigration.  The fact that such things can happen shows there is a definite lacuna in Government policy.  I am glad to see a sum of practically £3,000,000 earmarked this year.  That is money that will be well spent, because it will come back.  Afforestation is a long-term policy, but it is one with which we all agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> I should like to draw attention to the danger of forest fires.  Nobody should be allowed to park in any area adjoining a forest.  One fire can undo 20 or 30 years' work.  It can have devastating results.  The Forestry Branch should enlist the services of the Garda and ask them to take better measures to deal with this matter of parking and the danger of fire in our forests.  School children should be imbued with a greater interest in afforestation.  The Forestry Branch should go all out on Arbour Day.  I hope that in this financial year we will not have a surplus of money and a concomitant surplus of unemployed.  A surplus shows a lack of policy planning.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention now to a letter I got from the Forestry Branch in reply to representations I made on behalf of the Clonbur Development Society.  They applied for a site for a swimming pool, a handball alley and a children's playground on lands adjoining an afforestation area adjacent to that village.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you will bear with me, Sir, I will show you.  The letter states that the Minister has fully investigated the possibilities of providing a suitable site and regrets that no such site is available on State forest lands. I put it to the Minister that these forest lands hold out the only hope for development of this village.  The Minister may have the idea that no one should be permitted in the vicinity. Possibly that is so, but I should like to point out that these people cannot develop at the other end of the village. They must move towards the forests.  I do not want them in the forest.  I have already said that that is something that should not be encouraged because of the danger of fire and damage. In view, however, of the laudable work this committee proposes to undertake, I think the Minister should give way and provide some little corner.  Our countryside is being denuded of youth.  The young people are emigrating.  The main reason for that is the lack of amenities. I suggest the Minister should reconsider his decision and try to meet those who <Col N="1473" /> have put forward this very worthy project.</P>
      <P>With Deputy Blowick, I should like to congratulate the officials of the Forestry Branch.  They have worked excellently, and under a handicap.  I do not think the Minister can claim the kudos.  Results have been achieved by the herculean efforts of the officials.  I should like the Minister to have a more definite policy.  If there is a surplus at the end of the year, it shows clearly that there is a lack of policy.</P>

      <P>I rise to congratulate the Minister on his Estimate.  He and the Forestry Branch are doing an excellent job of work.  In my own constituency, I see the forests growing and expanding every day.  Surely the Opposition must give the Minister some credit.  I certainly would not deny credit to any Opposition Party, if they deserved it.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to money unspent.  There is a reason, of course and I am sure the Minister will give the reason when he comes to reply.  Some time ago, Deputy Coogan alleged here that houses were being closed in the vicinity of forests.  I investigated that allegation and failed to find any house that had been closed. These are the forests in my constituency: the Rosscahill forest, the Cloosh valley forest, the Hill of Doon forest, Derryclare forest, and Maam Valley forest.  I challenge anyone to tell me where there is a house closed around any of these forests I stand up here to contradict that statement.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to an application by a group of people for a swimming pool, a handball alley and a playground in Clonbur.  I have had some correspondence from these people and I was in the Department in that connection. I also led a deputation to the Minister who was very sympathetic but was sorry because the particular portion of land these people wanted has been planted for the past five or six years. The trees are approximately 10 to 12 feet high and if that request were to be granted, at least two acres of those <Col N="1474" /> young trees would have to be uprooted. That is hardly a reasonable request to make to the Minister for Lands.  If land were available elsewhere, the Minister would be only too pleased to hand it over.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the Minister speeding up the proceedings in regard to land offered for afforestation.  I realise that this involves a great deal of work for the officers concerned. However, if there could be an inspection of the land carried out so as to give the people offering the land some indication whether the land will be accepted, these people would know where they were.</P>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister and his Department on everything they have done.  The progress in forestry is a credit to them and I wish them every success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a large measure of agreement on this Vote and we are all proud of the fact that there is a gradual expansion of forestry throughout the State.  It does not matter who is responsible for it; it is there.  Let Deputy Blowick take all the credit due to him.  There is no doubt that during his term of office great emphasis was placed on the necessity for afforestation.  Another gentleman who was in this House, the former Deputy MacBride, always advocated greater development in this direction.  When men leave this House, they are soon forgotten, but, in fairness, that must be said about that former Deputy.  There is a great deal to be said for the organisation called Trees because of the publicity they gave to our forest potential and the value forests are to our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great thing to see Governments having continuity of policy on matters that are fundamental to the development of our country in order to maintain our own people.  Even though there have been great developments, it must be remembered that we have been 39 years established as a free country and altogether to date, we have had only 330,000 acres planted, an average of about 8,000 acres a year.  That falls very short of the target set for the past year and the target set for the coming year.  At the <Col N="1475" /> planting rate of 25,000 acres per year, it will take four years to give us a plantable acreage of 100,000 and it will be 40 years before we arrive at the 1,000,000 acre mark.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if a survey has been made of all the possible plantable land.  I agree that hitherto we have got the land that was perhaps most easily acquired; we have the flat portions on the waste lands of the countryside but there is a great deal of glen land and hill land that could be planted.  That would add to the beauty of our country and would be a very valuable source of wealth if these trees could be utilised as contemplated. As the years go by, it will become more difficult to acquire land. The Minister has explained that there was a reduction in the current Estimate in connection with the acquisition of land.  The Minister has explained that satisfactorily and those who have criticised it may not have been here in the morning when it was mentioned.</P>
    <P>Forestry is one of our greatest potential money earners.  It is the greatest form of development since the Shannon scheme and since rural electrification consequent on the Shannon scheme.  It is a wise investment which will pay dividends eventually.  It has a great potential for employment.  It is very comforting to know we have today 4,600 forestry workers in this State. Not of least importance is the fact that forests transform the whole pattern of our island.  There is nothing more beautiful than a growing forest.  There is nothing in nature more inspiring than a young tree, so beautiful that no pen can describe it effectively and no artist can paint it realistically.  That multiplied many times over in a forest gives that added beauty which is so enjoyed by those coming to this country.</P>
    <P>We are glad to hear from the Minister that our timber has stood up to the analytical tests made on it and that for building purposes our timber compares favourably with that which has been used hitherto.  Could the Minister say whether there has been any great research in regard to hardwoods?  Is it possible at all to <Col N="1476" /> produce them in this island, in view of its humidity?  In any event, it would be a comfort to know that there was continuous research and experimentation along those lines and that there was a possibility of increasing further the commercial potential of our young forests.  We were glad also to hear that pinus contorta which is so common in our forests, has had uses beyond our conception and is very valuable.</P>
    <P>The policy suggested by Deputy Flanagan of having large nurseries and eliminating the smaller ones seems to me to be a very wise one.  There are 40 million plants produced out of those nurseries per annum.  The time, care and attention involved in the propagation and cultivation of those plants must be considered.  Whoever is in charge of the nurseries must have a good deal of anxiety because of pests and diseases of various kinds. It is a wonderful achievement to be able to produce 40,000,000 plants per annum.  That is a fact that many people are not aware of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to publicity. The greatest publicity of all is the growing forest.  The more forests there are throughout the State, the more their value is publicised.  A certain amount of publicity is valuable and effective but we should publicise our nurseries and the fact that there are places like Avondale House, which has great historical associations, and which is now to be used as a forestry training depot.  It is a pity it is not used also as a nursery to which regular visits could be arranged at a small charge in order to pay for the cost of upkeep and so on.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Forestry Branch on its selectiveness, good judgment and good taste in selecting Gougane Barra and the surrounding area as the first forest park in Ireland.  I say that, not because I am a Cork man or Munster man, but because the scenery there is matchless. On the way through the pass of Keimaneigh towards the Kerry border and through Ballingeary on to Gougane Barra the scenery is breathtaking and along the Valley of Desmond by the banks of the Lee in <Col N="1477" /> its very early stages is something to be proud of.  The terrain is very difficult and it will take a lot of excavation and labour to bring about the development the Forestry Branch envisage.  It is proof of their courage and vision that they have undertaken a task of this kind and I hope when it comes to fruition it will be a monument to the Forestry Branch who were responsible for the selection of the site and will redound to the glory of our little island.  Gougane Barra is associated with many historical epochs.  It is in the Gaeltacht.  For that reason I am very glad it has been selected as the site for the first forest park.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this year I do not find myself in the position of having to force the Forestry Branch to take over a place that they had been offered for a period of 12 months.  I am also glad that the lack of co-operation that heretofore appeared to exist between the Land Commission and the Forestry Branch in regard to taking over land has largely disappeared.  On every other occasion that I have spoken on the Estimate for Forestry I have had to refer to that lack of co-operation.  I am glad to be able to congratulate the forestry officials on the fact that the situation appears to have been considerably improved.</P>
      <P>Before I go on to speak on general policy in regard to forestry, there are one or two small points of perhaps local interest which I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister. The policy of the Forestry Branch in marketing timber is to sell large quantities in the biggest market.  That is a reasonable approach because they get a better sale and it is perhaps more economic to sell timber in that way but I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that the Vote for Forestry is provided by the taxpayers as a whole and there are, as the Minister knows, many small timber merchants scattered throughout the country who require timber and who have very little opportunity nowadays of buying timber other than from the State as the State owns practically all the forest land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> When they apply to the Forestry Branch these small merchants are inevitably told that the timber cannot be divided into small lots, that that would be uneconomic and that it is the duty of the Forestry Branch to sell in the most economic way.  I consider that it is also the duty of the Forestry Branch to give small timber merchants an opportunity to buy timber.  It should be quite feasible and possible where a large quantity of timber is for sale to divide it into a few small lots in order to give local people an opportunity of bidding for it.  The State forests are their forests too.  They should have equal rights with other citizens.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the overall direction of local forests and nurseries is conducted by people in offices in the city of Dublin, in the Department of Lands.  It may very well be that the official directing policy may originally have been a forester and lived and worked in forests but in many cases that is not so.  It does not seem to me to make for efficiency, nor is it an encouragement to a local forestry officer who is keen on his work, if he has to take direction from people who, to put it bluntly, have no practical knowledge of the work although they may have considerable theoretical knowledge.  If the Minister has any doubt on this point, I should like to tell him that it is the policy in other countries to train persons connected with the Forestry Department on the spot as foresters or in forestry colleges and when they have acquired a practical knowledge of the work to return them to roost, so to speak, to the Department.  In this country we tend to have overall directive policy conducted from the central office.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything derogatory of the forestry officials but it is true to say that there are forestry officials directing overall policy who have no practical knowledge of woods. They may have gone from time to time in their motor cars from Dublin and looked at the woods but I doubt if they have worked as practical foresters.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to homegrown timber.  The Minister referred to analytical tests, and so forth, as to the <Col N="1479" /> quality of homegrown timber.  I do not think homegrown timber has ever got a fair chance.  We must remember that, due to the climate we have here, timber matures and grows much faster than is the case in colder countries, such as Scandinavia, which goes in extensively for afforestation.  I speak subject to correction by those who carried out analytical tests, which I have not done, but I suggest that where timber matures faster, as in this country, the tendency is to get a softer type of timber, which requires a longer maturing period.</P>
    <P>In my travels in Europe, in France, Germany and Scandinavia, I have noticed that when a tree is felled it is immediately stripped of its bark, then put to lie out in the wood for a certain time to mature and subsequently transferred to the lumber yard where it remains for a considerable period.  It is almost true to say that the average length that a felled tree lies in the forestry yards or forests of Europe is nine to twelve months before it is brought into the sawmill, cut up and used.  That is why I say Irish timber has never got a fair chance.</P>
    <P>I think it is perfectly true to say that Irish timber has stood the test very well and I think some direction could be given in some way by the Forestry Department&mdash; and it would not be very difficult for them to give that direction as they own most of the timber in Ireland &mdash; that a period should be given for the timber to mature.  You would not then have the adverse comments one gets on Irish timber nor would there be that urge on the part of builders who use timber to look for the product outside their own country.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the overall policy of the Forestry Department.  Their aim is to acquire and sow 25,000 acres of timber annually.  I have not got the actual figures before me but gradually over the years the amount of land they have acquired has been growing.  The amount of land in the forestry pool has been growing from year to year.  It is a fact about the Forestry Department or about any State Department in this country that anything they get they hold and never give it up again.  I <Col N="1480" /> wonder is it good policy for the State to hold so much land?  I wonder is it good policy for the Forestry Department to acquire land, plant it and keep it for all time.  That is not the policy in other countries.  In other countries the policy is to decentralise forestry.</P>
    <P>Our policy has been praised by the Minister himself in his opening address and by other speakers.  The amount of private afforestation is limited but private afforestation has been encouraged in other countries by handing over to private enterprise on a long term lease timber which is partially mature.  It is very hard to convince people that they should sow timber when they themselves can never reap it in their own lifetime.  It is very hard to convince people, farmers in particular who are busy at other things, to sow one, two or even more acres of timber starting from the beginning, because in the first instance they have little or no knowledge of timber or of the benefits of timber.  They have never really seen plantations or studied timber. They have never had the opportunity of becoming timber minded.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Forestry Department, who in their large acquisition of land are increasingly bringing us to the position where the State are getting control over more and more of the land of Ireland, that they could well consider laying off that land.  In other words they have the experts, the personnel, at their disposal and they would still give employment.  They would plant the land and have responsibility for maintenance, preserving fences and looking after the forests.  It is true to say if you plant timber that after the first five years you have got to do a good amount of thinning, cutting down undergrowth and so on and that creates employment.  The State therefore would create employment if they had to look after planting and laying out good forests, but if they rented those forests so that it would be free to private enterprise to look after them they would create an interest in the community as a whole in timber. That is the only way you will get an interest in the general public of this State in growing timber.</P>
    <P>That is nothing new.  It is done in every other country.  If the State is <Col N="1481" /> prepared to lay out the plantation and after five years to lease it for 45 or 50 years at a certain annual rent when the land comes to maturity these people will use the timber.  They may not be the same people who leased it. They may be their descendants, but it will create a timber minded feeling among the people of the country.  That is done in Norway, Sweden and in all the countries of Europe.  Practically all the forests in Europe are not completely State-owned.  They start by being State-owned but then they are let to municipal or local authorities.  They create employment, reduce the rates and provide firing as well for local institutions.  We have now got to the state in this country &mdash; and it is a bad state of mind to get into &mdash; that the State must do everything for us: let us get the State to buy everything, look after afforestation and give all the employment.</P>
    <P>Are we wise in doing that?  What is the answer if you do not do it?  You are going on with the State acquiring more and more land and the Minister for Lands coming year after year to tell us that he has sown 25,000 acres and employed 5,000 men.  As the years roll by &mdash; and they roll by very quickly &mdash;we shall reach the state of affairs where the State owns too much land. In my humble submission they own too much already.  We are a free people devoted to our private rights and private property and Dáil Éireann should be slow to encourage a policy of gradually handing over everything to the State.  Anything done by private enterprise is done better than by the State.</P>
    <P>Admittedly in the case of forestry you have to make a beginning, work out the plantation of trees, clear them, fence them and look after them, but having done that, I submit that State control should then end.  I am not asking them now to hand over everything. I know I am talking to deaf ears as far as the Forestry Department are concerned.  Their policy is to get hold of land, sow it, keep it and never surrender it again, but surely there must be some little thinking done in this country and some Minister will have the courage and initiative to institute a new policy, reverse the present policy <Col N="1482" /> and utilise the Forestry Department to build up forests but ensure that it will not be the Forestry Department or the State that will benefit but the nation as a whole.  I have said this nearly every year in Dáil Éireann since I became a Deputy.  Perhaps this might be my last run because one never knows what might happen in the next few weeks, but perhaps some time I shall not find that what I have said has fallen on deaf ears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few remarks to make, mainly local remarks, because I do not want to hold up the debate.  I want to ask the Minister why there has been such a significant decrease in the area of new plantations in County Wexford.  There has been an overall increase in the area planted over the last two, three or four years but there has been a significant decrease in some places.  One of them is Wexford.  Others are Louth and Carlow, for example.  If there is to be, as there has been, a continuous forestry drive over the country, it is only right that various areas should participate equally.  The Minister has stated, he has boasted of the fact, that afforestation has gone on apace in the West of Ireland, in Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and other parts.  Everybody welcomes that because such work and such employment is desirable in the West, in the Connaught counties, where tillage is absolutely nil and grazing is not as good as in other parts of Ireland, but the decrease in new plantations in Co.  Wexford has been from 843 acres in 1958-59 to 535 in 1960-61.  There has been a big decrease in Carlow where in 1958-59 the areas of new plantations were 439 acres and have now gone down to 117 acres.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that there is difficulty in acquiring land.  I could understand that to some extent but if the Minister continues to offer the price he has been in the habit of offering in Wexford, at least, it will be very difficult for him to get more land, not necessarily in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had occasion during the past few months to make approaches with regard to offers of small areas of land and I gleaned from the reply to a <Col N="1483" /> Parliamentary Question that the average price per acre was £6, £7 or £8. I know the type of land needed for forestry is not supposed to be of excellent or very good quality; but I do not know what the Minister expects to get for £6, £7 or £8 per acre.  Therefore, I should be pleased if the Minister would comment on what I describe as the spectacular reduction in the area of new plantations in Wexford.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Deputy Blowick in his plea that there should be a discontinuance of the abandonment of small nurseries and the establishment of big nurseries.  That certainly could militate against employment.  I do not want forestry to be regarded as a social service but the Government have accepted the obligation of providing employment through afforestation and I think they should have regard to the amount of employment given as against the amount of timber produced.  It was very unwise of the Minister and the officials of his Department to abandon the nursery at Bree in Wexford.  It gave a substantial amount of employment.  It was not successful in accordance with the economic standards laid down by the Minister and the forestry experts, but I believe it should not have been abandoned in the way it has been abandoned.  It may not have been absolutely economic but it could have been made a little more economic than it was.</P>
    <P>There is no nursery centre now in Wexford that I am aware of.  The nursery centre for two or three counties is in some part of Carlow.  I should like to stress again the fact that those nurseries do provide a certain amount of employment which is badly needed in the rural areas, not only in Wexford but in other counties as well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde said that it is not the duty of the State to engage too actively or for all time in afforestation and accept the responsibility of providing employment.  I hold the contrary view.  Now that the Department have accepted that it is their job to develop afforestation, they also have the obligation, and should accept it, in consequence of that decision to provide employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1484" /> If the nurseries are to be abandoned in certain counties, and if there is to be a reduction in the area of new plantations, I certainly think it will affect employment as I am sure it has in Carlow, Louth and my own county of Wexford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to thank the different Deputies who paid tributes to the officials of the Forestry Division of my Department. I think those tributes are very well deserved.  The results of their labours over the past year, or indeed the past two years, show that the House and the nation are well served by our field staff, by our executives, and by everyone connected with the work being carried on by the Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan spoke at some length about the comparative State aid available for private forestry in this country and in various other countries. He quoted Sweden particularly as a place where large private afforestation is being carried on.  The Deputy must realise that, in Sweden, the forestry area consists almost entirely of land which was never reclaimed for agricultural use.  So far as I know, over half of the Swedish forestry is held in private ownership. They have very large stretches of forest.  They have had natural regeneration for years and conditions there and the whole set-up there are completely different from the conditions we have here.  I would say that our State aid to private forestry is at least as generous, so far as I can find out, as it is anywhere else in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may not realise the magnitude of the task undertaken here in keeping up a planting programme of 25,000 acres per annum.  In relation to our population, that is the largest programme being undertaken anywhere in Western Europe at this time, if not, in fact in the world.  While I am always optimistic, let me say that we will be doing very well if we are able to keep that programme going steadily, and to get the necessary amount of land that is required to keep it up, and to keep a reasonable plantable reserve. I gave particulars in my opening statement as to the number of transactions <Col N="1485" /> involved in getting in sufficient land for that programme.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that as time goes by, the problems of the intake machinery of the Forestry Division will get more and more difficult.  From my recent visit to the Forestry Commission, I discovered that in Wales the average size of the lot now taken in is down to 30 acres.  Wales has had forestry traditions down through the ages and it is a place where they were used to getting areas of 2,000 or 3,000 acres in one stretch.  It is true that the position is not quite so bad in Scotland but the British Forestry Commission are experiencing the same difficulty now.  As time goes on, the amount of land becoming available is getting smaller and smaller on the intake side.</P>
    <P>The House, therefore, should realise that while I do not set 25,000 acres as the ultimate limit &mdash; and in fact as I have told the House, we exceeded that in the acreage planted this year&mdash; with the practical difficulties we are experiencing on the intake side and in maintaining plantable reserves, we shall be doing very well if we can continue with the record figures for intake and planting which have been achieved during the past two years.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies inquired about what progress had been made, or what we have learned, as a result of research in afforestation on deep peats.  Provability resulting from such researches becomes available only after a long period.  Initial indications however, are quite favourable and are influencing our view in our current planting programme.  One of the matters I might mention in this connection is that it takes time to estimate and assess the effect of windblow on peat that is planted.  While the young plants that have been put down under recent experiments are doing very well, even in these very exposed areas in Glenamoy, Cloosh and elsewhere, it is too soon to estimate how they may stand up to wind exposure &mdash; and you have very high velocities in these areas &mdash; in the future.  In so far as they are progressing at the moment the evidence is very satisfactory.  They seem to be doing quite well but it <Col N="1486" /> would be unrealistic at this stage to be positive about the results of these experiments particularly in respect of what I have said about windblow.</P>
    <P>We have seen and collected some interesting information from the Afforestation Commission about these problems.  There are different theories even amongst the experts as to whether crown thinning is the more desirable form of development, or whether the type of thinning we do here is the better form of development.  As I said, experts are divided in their views on these issues and only time will prove whether these experiments, from the point of view of effectively standing up to great exposures and great wind velocities, will be successful.  At all events, in so far as we have gone in these experiments the results are quite encouraging and we have got a vast amount of information as to suitable species and how they will do and progress under different soil conditions and at different altitudes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan raised the question of the handing over of the cutaway bogs by Bord na Móna.  I can inform the Deputy and the House that my Department are in touch with Bord na Móna on this issue.  There are difficulties there but it is a matter that is not being lost sight of and discussions are going on at this time.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy, if not more than one Deputy, made some point about the use of thigh boots by foresters.  I answered a question on this matter in the House not very long ago and, as I said, any medical opinion that is available to me on the matter assured me there are no medical grounds on which anybody can object to somebody utilising another person's boots, or boots that had been used by another man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if he would like to use the boots of somebody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy puts that point to me, I think I stated in reply to a Supplementary Question, that time and again when I was going fishing I used other people's boots. Whether I was able to fill them successfully or not is another matter.  Recently when my opposite number in Ontario, <Col N="1487" /> Canada, was visiting here and we were out in the forests, he had no objection to using my boots and he survived.  Some people may be sensitive on this issue.  I want to tell the House that this type of boot is rarely in use and it would be impracticable to assign boots permanently to individual workers.  There is, of course, no objection in the world, as I stated, to any worker who is very sensitive about the odd occasions he has to use these boots, bringing his own.  He is quite entitled to do so and there would be no objection from my officials or my Department to his bringing his own boots and utilising them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they could bring their own boots that would solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy and the House they are quite entitled to do so.  There would be no objection from my Department if they did wish to bring their own boots and use them.  The Deputy also inquired whether anything could be done to secure more roadside planting of poplars.  As the Deputy and the House is aware, such planting can only be done by the owner of the land adjoining the road, or by the local authority if it owns the roadside or owns the land adjoining the road. I should say that there is a special grant for planting poplars.  It covers row planting and it will be freely available where the soil is suitable for poplars.  In this connection we have given considerable attention to what I call amenity planting and that aspect of our work will become more and more prominent as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Manley with regard to what he said about the beauties of Gougane Barra.  It was while on a visit some time ago to the forest at Gougane Barra that I decided it was the obvious place to start our programme of bringing forests to the people and opening them for tourism.  I could not agree more with the Deputy when he states that the scenery there is breathtaking. It is particularly so in what the Americans call &ldquo;the Fall&rdquo; of the <Col N="1488" /> year with the wonderful blaze of colour between the Japanese Plane trees intermixed with the conifers which we have there.  It was for that reason &mdash; its natural beauty and the forest enveloped in all its colour &mdash; that we have decided to make it what I would call the first free park that we have in this country.</P>
    <P>Let me say also that the amenity aspect of forestry will become more and more apparent as time goes on and as plantations grow.  One of the difficulties is that by virtue of their locations our forests are not very well known to the public.  They are usually off the beaten track and, in many instances, the public are unaware of the progress that has been made and the amount that has been planted.  I have no doubt at all that, in a few years' time, some of our forest centres will become as popular, from a tourist point of view, as the Black Forest is in Germany and the forests in other countries which attract so much interest and so many visitors.  In this connection I shall have something to say before I conclude dealing with the necessity for educating our people and especially our young people in regard to guarding against forest fires arising from carelessness.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, we have not a forestry tradition.  I believe that in many cases it is due to ignorance that people make a mess of the place around a forest.  We have instances of vandalism and, in particular, people are careless about throwing away cigarette butts or lighting fires in the vicinity of forests.  I hope to enlist the aid of the Minister for Education in getting this lesson home in the schools.  It is necessary, now that there is such a large investment of State capital in forestry here and such a large development of forestry throughout the country, that our people as a whole should become more forest-conscious and more alive to the dangers of being careless in the vicinity of forests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider soliciting the support of Radio Éireann and having warnings repeatedly broadcast in relation to the danger of forest fires?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>We issue warnings <Col N="1489" /> from time to time.  I shall have the Deputy's suggestion considered.  There is an urgent need for more public co-operation in the protection of our plantations.  Since the beginning of this year no less than 310 fires occurred in or near State plantations.  They had to be extinguished by the forest staff and local fire-fighting services, assisted in some cases by military personnel. Fortunately, the damage caused is slight due to the efforts of the fire fighters but the danger of really serious damage is becoming progressively more real with the rapid increase of the area under plantation.</P>
      <P>The burning of gorse, heather, and so on, in the vicinity of plantations by mountain farmers is a serious menace. If our farmers engage in such burnings without giving notice, as required by law, they might find themselves not only liable to prosecution in our courts but also to the payment of compensation in respect of any damage caused to forest property.  If, on the other hand, they co-operate with my Department, and give advance notice to the local forester, these burnings can be carried out safely and under controlled conditions.</P>
      <P>There is a special danger of forest fire in County Dublin and County Wicklow.  Large numbers of people, particularly young people from Dublin City, visit the forest areas in South County Dublin and in County Wicklow at holidays, weekends, and so on. Most of these people respect forest property and are careful to do nothing to damage it but there are the thoughtless and irresponsible few who cause serious damage to the young plantations of these areas.  The extent of the depredation done by some of these people is appalling.  Trees were cut or damaged.  Fires were lighted in the middle of plantations.  Fire warning notices were pulled down, defaced or destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as our evidence goes, there have been a few instances of deliberate fire-raising by some of these irresponsible young people.  Only for the vigilance of these foresters as well as of the Gárda Síochána there is no doubt that serious damage would already have been caused.  Hitherto, <Col N="1490" /> my officials have been rather lenient with these people.  They have been inclined to warn them and let them get away in the hope that they will learn something and appreciate the value of our forests and our plantations to the nation.  I fear that in view of some recent evidence that has come before me I shall have to direct my officials to deal with these vandals with the full rigour of the law from this on.  I ask the support of the House in taking these steps to ensure that this vandalism will be discontinued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only way to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blowick raised a number of questions on this Estimate and, as briefly as I can, I propose to deal with them.  As far as the point that the Deputy made about small plantations is concerned, I think Deputy Manley very effectively dealt with that issue.  The small nurseries were not done away with solely from the point of view of economy.  Indeed, economy was the last question involved.  The position, as Deputies will realise, is that a huge amount of young plants are now required to deal with the intensified planting programme.  Many of these small nurseries were located on unsuitable soil, subject to all the hazards of disease.  Production was inefficient.  The end product, the plant, which is so vital, was not up to standard.  It was to deal with that aspect of the matter rather than any aspect of economy that more suitable nurseries, nurseries of more suitable size, have been acquired and are now in production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the nursery at Moore Hall in County Mayo which comprised two small plots totalling 11 acres which had a very modest employment capacity, not the figure quoted by the Deputy.  This nursery was primarily closed because of the adverse high lime content in the soil. The general nursery policy of concentrated large units is not an economy measure at all.  It is for the purpose of producing better plants on better soil. It is part of the planned programme in <Col N="1491" /> which the Forestry Division have been engaged, although Deputy Blowick and some other Deputies accused us of not planning ahead.</P>
    <P>For these nurseries the Forestry Division pays not the amount that we generally pay for forestry land.  Nursery land, as I am sure is apparent to most members of the House, is a different thing altogether.  We need special soil conditions.  We require special properties in the land in order to have a successful nursery.  My Department are now engaged in acquiring suitable nurseries of suitable size with the best type of land for that purpose.  That will be reflected in the better type of plant that will be available not alone for State forests but for the nursery trade as a whole.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Blowick who inquired as to how we sold or dealt with the amount of thinnings, including the surplus plants, we had during the past year.  In the main, the thinnings went to the wallboard factory in Athy and those other pulp factories we have, and portion of them went to the Clondalkin paper factory that is now producing newsprint on a limited scale and, I must say, producing it very well.</P>
    <P>I entirely disagree with the Deputy when he suggests that private enterprise is not able or will not be geared to deal with the production of pulp products in this country or to deal with the increasing output of our forests.  Indeed, all the evidence I have seen is to the contrary.  There are already a number of industries building up based on our raw material that is available and is becoming available.  A national survey is being carried out by my staff in both an aerial and factual form to assess what the output of our forests will be.</P>
    <P>I cannot foretell what the intake of our acquisition machine will be in 1970.  I can only estimate what will become available by way of raw material for industries based on wood pulp or thinnings over a number of years to come.  We are engaged in that very job at this time.  I have no doubt at all from what I have seen in this country and abroad that private enterprise will be fully able to deal with the output as it becomes <Col N="1492" /> available in our forests here.  I have compared the plants operating here with those abroad and, comparatively speaking, they are doing the very excellent job for which they are geared.  I have no doubt that if the raw material becomes available, these people or others like them will get geared for the increased output of our forests when they are assured that it will be there.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Blowick inquired about contorta pine which was tested at Prince's Risborough and where it was grown.  It was grown at a level of 700 feet on shallow peat overlying mineral soil.  It was only 27 years of age, and an important factor there is that though it should give less favourable results than might be expected in older timber, the results, taking full account of the source and age of the material tested over there, and the promising report, legitimately justify optimism in relation to contorta pine grown on western peat soils.  Lack of fertility in the western peat lands which retards growth and affects the timber quality has not been adverse, and if this test has proved one of Deputy Blowick's pet theories wrong, I can only say that the experts have given us this report, not here but from abroad, and that it encourages us to believe that <i>pinus contorta</i> is going to be a very valuable timber from the usage point of view, and we are encouraged in our planting programme to take cognisance of the reports we have got on these samples we have sent there.</P>
    <P>I do not know where Deputy Blowick got his calculation that a State forest costs £108 an acre to plant, including the acquisition price.  I can only say that he must be as wrong in that conclusion as he is and has been in many of his other conclusions as expressed here, because the actual cost, including the price of the land to the State of acquisition, planting, and fencing is £36 an acre.  How Deputy Blowick blows this up to £108 an acre, I do not know, but, as I have said, I cannot indicate to the House what form of reasoning or mathematics he used to get that fantastic figure.</P>
    <P>He suggests that the grant is not sufficient to interest people on the private <Col N="1493" /> planting side.  On the contrary, it is more than generous.  Indeed, where people go in for planting on a large scale, as they are entitled to do, I should like to point out that it is more than is available in any other country I know, and I have already pointed out elsewhere that hard-headed business men with an eye to the future have been taking advantage of these generous grants in making a private investment in private forestry in this country.</P>
    <P>It is true to say, of course, that the amount of private forestry here is small.  The big job has been commenced by the State and will have to be largely finished by the State.  There is a big State investment in this business, and it has been progressing apace.</P>
    <P>It is true that the labour force approximates to something like 4,800 at the moment, and what has been aimed at by the Forestry Division is stability for those working in the industry. It is also true that due to the incentive bonus scheme, the output of the workers is far higher now than it was.  Let me say that I consider it more desirable to have a steady labour force permanently employed rather than have a flush of labour for one season and unemployment for half of them the next.</P>
    <P>It is untrue to say that machinery or mechanism has played any part except a helpful one in this business.  Indeed only for the mechanisation in ploughing of much of the type of land planted now, there would not be nearly so many men required, because we could not plant it.  It is due to new techniques that have been discovered, particularly in mechanical ploughing and manuring, that a lot of planting can be now done, so that machinery which has been used to bring forestry land into production which a few short years ago was regarded even by our own experts as unplantable contributes in its own way to the employment of more men.  I should like to assure the House that any judgment or assessment that can be made in my Department indicates that the machinery contributes to more employment on forestry land.</P>
    <P>The fact is that all men working at <Col N="1494" /> forestry, like men working in any other line, acquire skill in the course of their experience, and an ordinary hardworking forestry worker with a few years experience will have a much greater output than a raw worker brought in to do forestry work for the first time.  Therefore, as time has progressed, what I call the hard core of the labour force are now virtually all experienced men, whose output is higher, and the incentive bonus scheme, which applies to skills acquired by those men in the different types of forestry work, has contributed to higher output from a smaller number of men.  That is the real reason we are planting much more and getting much more work done with a lesser labour force that possibly was employed before the job was planned some years ago.</P>
    <P>If this programme continues, it means, as I said in my opening statement, that there will be employment for more and more men.  The more the intake of land and the more we can continue year by year with the planting of 25,000 acres, the more will be the number of people who will be employed in the industry, not only in the industry in the field, but in the factories and industries that use timber in any of its forms for their raw material.</P>
    <P>In the main, I know that this Estimate is acceptable to the House and that the progress being made under this section of my Department is praised by Deputies on all sides of the House.  Before I conclude, perhaps, I should say this.  I am accused by Deputy Blowick of standing, as he puts it, idly by and doing nothing about forestry.  He suggested to the House that I am solely interested in the Fisheries Section of my Department. If I am standing idly by, I want to assure the House that I have some figures for my Department which do not indicate idleness over the past two years.</P>
    <P>Last year we achieved, as the House knows, 25,000 acres of planting which is a record for this country.  It was the first time in the history of this country that that figure was achieved.  That figure has been beaten this year.  It is <Col N="1495" /> near 26,000 acres.  There is a big difference between that and Deputy Blowick's effort in 1956.  His maximum effort in that year was 14,996 acres.  It may be difficult for the Deputy to swallow the figures I am quoting.  I do not regard, as the Deputy evidently did, the purchase of Belgian rabbit wire as Irish forestry. I regard as progress that progress which has been made under this administration, the actual planting and acquisition of the land which is what the Department is there for.</P>
    <P>The most extensive new afforestation in the western counties &mdash; 10,000 acres in 1959/60 and 11,000 in 1960/61 &mdash; was achieved for the first time.  The figure is 44 per cent. of the total planting programme for the country.  Both the acreages and the percentage I have quoted are record figures for forestry in this country.  The greatest volume of work in existing plantations has been achieved during the past year and is being achieved this year. A record mileage of forest roads was constructed last year which was 60 per cent. higher than any previous figure since forestry started in this country.</P>
    <P>We had the biggest annual spending on direct rural employment in State forests.  It was £1.5 million in 1959/60 and £1.6 million in 1960/61.  We had the greatest State investment in forestry to date &mdash; £2.5 million gross in 1959/60 and £2.9 million in 1960/61. We had a record forest revenue of £380,000 in 1959/60.  This increased to £457,000 in 1960/61 and will increase still further to £500,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>These record figures have been created under my administration of this section of my Department I think it is an indication, even to Deputy Blowick, that we are not asleep in the forestry section now.  I can only suggest to the Deputy that he scratch his head and wake up to the reality of the figures and records achieved under the forestry division for the past two years.</P>

      <P>I should like to listen to the Minister's speeches and <Col N="1496" /> the speeches of Deputy Blowick in the next Dáil election.  I am sure it would be very interesting.  I would nearly leave my own constituency to go down and listen.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £210,800 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The net total of £315,800 required for Fisheries is much the same as that voted last year and there is little variation under any of the usual subheads. Some token provisions have been eliminated and, in accordance with the standard practice in this year's Estimates, the subheads for travelling, telephones and incidental expenses have been amalgamated.  Slight increases under subheads A and B reflect a strengthening of the staff of the Fisheries Division.  There are two new subheads &mdash; E.2 and G.4a &mdash; which cancel out and have no net effect on the Estimate but I shall have occasion to refer to them later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have declared on a number of occasions, the policy of the present Government in relation to fisheries is an expansionist one and a planned programme of development has been undertaken for the implementation of this policy.  The reports published half-yearly on the Programme for Economic Expansion indicate that a fair measure of progress has already been achieved.  I must confess, however, that I had hoped for a more accelerated rate of advance in the field of sea fisheries.  In the final analysis, the objective is to secure a very substantial increase in the volume of landings by our fishermen.  Assuming that <Col N="1497" /> the seas around our coast are capable of yielding a much greater harvest of fish&mdash;and all the available data support this assumption &mdash; the problem may be reduced to one of providing the most suitable types of boats and gear in sufficient numbers and, more vital still, attracting and training the necessary personnel to use these boats to the best advantage.  Before dealing more fully with these aspects of the problem, perhaps I should give some statistical and general information.</P>
    <P>There were 1,764 fishermen and 532 motor vessels solely engaged in sea fishing in 1960; of these vessels, 189 were classed as 25 tons gross and over. During the year ended 31st March, 1961, 15 new boats, including nine of over 25 tons gross &mdash; five 56-footers and four 50-footers &mdash; were issued by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to hire purchasers.</P>
    <P>Landings of all varieties of sea fish &mdash;including shellfish but excluding salmon&mdash;were valued at £1,612,000 in 1960, representing a slight increase on the 1959 figure which itself was a record one.  The increase was achieved despite an unexpected drop of over £60,000 in the value of shellfish landings, due largely to unfavourable fishing conditions for lobsters and craw-fish. Landings of pelagic fish increased by 120,000 cwt. to 455,000 cwt. and their value rose by almost £50,000 to £453,000.  The quantity of herrings alone constituted over 90 per cent. of the pelagic varieties and 60 per cent. of all varieties of wet fish.  At the beginning of 1961, however, herring fishing came to an end earlier than usual.  The value of demersal landings increased slightly in 1960 to £819,000, despite, I regret to record, a drop of 24,000 cwt. or almost 10 per cent. in the quantity.  As in 1959, the most important varieties in order of value were whiting, plaice, cod, ray or skate, and haddock, but, in order of quantity, cod took second place to whiting, followed by ray or skate, plaice and haddock.  A reduction in the catch of whiting in 1960 has persisted in the early months of 1961.</P>
    <P>The value of exports of fish &mdash; excluding salmon and freshwater fish &mdash; increased by £78,000, or almost eight <Col N="1498" /> per cent. over that for 1959, to the record total of £1,107,000 in 1960. Herrings accounted for more than half of that total.  For the opening months of 1961, however, the early termination of herring fishing has been reflected in reduced exports.</P>
    <P>The extent to which processing of fish is undertaken depends primarily on the volume of landings and, while I cannot report any significant increase in processing activities in 1960, I would like to underline the importance of this arm of our fishing industry by mentioning that in 1960 processed fish valued at over £300,000 constituted more than a quarter of our total exports of sea fish and shellfish products. Given increased landings, this valuable trade is capable of considerable expansion. It is encouraging to note that some of our larger fish processing firms have sufficient confidence in the future to go ahead with plans for the enlargement and modernisation of their undertakings where fish will be handled and processed in wider variety and with greater efficiency according to the best hygienic standards.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of processing I should like to refer to the fishmeal factory at Killybegs.  The closing of this factory last year threatened a serious setback to the development of our sea-fishing industry.  Fortunately it has since been found possible to complete arrangements for the re-opening of the factory by a Danish firm of international standing in the fishmeal industry.  The present lessee is confident that, with the co-operation of Irish fishermen, he will be in a position to operate the plant successfully.  Substantial supplies of fish are, of course, essential for that purpose.  In the absence of a guarantee that such supplies would be forthcoming from the local fleet, there was no alternative but to grant limited facilities for the operation of Danish boats here.  I would like to take this opportunity of repeating my recent assurance to Irish fishermen that the concessions granted in this case are of a temporary nature and are intended to provide essential requirements of raw material to supplement supplies coming to the factory from home landings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> Turning to subheads of the Estimate I may say that, while the provision at Subhead C.1 shows a reduction, scientific investigations will in fact be on a larger scale because, with the commissioning of the first exploratory fishing vessel last year, some of the services and materials formerly paid for from this subhead can now be provided by the <i>Cú Feasa</i>.  Subheads C.2 and C.3 provide for contributions to two international bodies on the usual scale and travelling expenses of delegates to meetings of those bodies.</P>
    <P>The fact that the provision at Subhead C.4 for the operation of the exploratory fishing vessel <i>Cú Feasa</i> shows a slight decrease on the figure for last year does not mean that the operation of the vessel will be curtailed in any way.  This year's provision is based on experience of operating the vessel and is therefore more realistic: indeed it is about £1,000 higher than the actual expenditure incurred last year.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of the <i>Cú Feasa</i> has made it possible to undertake investigations which should prove of great value in the development of our sea fisheries.  With the aid of the vessel, research work on the Dunmore East herring fishery has been extended to a study of conditions in the open sea.  Investigations into stocks of Dublin Bay prawns in the Irish Sea have also been carried out and a pamphlet outlining the results has been circulated to fishermen, buyers and other interested parties.  A large amount of scientific data on whiting in the Irish Sea and off the south coast has been collected and is being examined.  The vessel is at present operating off the west coast.  Many of the investigations being undertaken by the <i>Cú Feasa</i> are of a long term nature and cannot be expected to show immediate results: data must be assembled over a period before useful conclusions can be drawn.  Any helpful information obtained will, of course, be made available to fishermen without delay.  Some difficulty has been experienced in the recruitment of staff for the scientific work.</P>
    <P>As I announced some months ago, <Col N="1500" /> a new fisheries research station will be built at Galway.  I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to the Galway Harbour Commissioners for placing a site at my disposal.  About half of the staff of the Fisheries Division will be transferred to the new building for which plans are being prepared.  Having long favoured a policy of decentralisation, I am glad to point to this start in my own Department.  Galway will also become a base for the <i>Cú Feasa</i> and data assembled by the vessel will be studied there.  It is hoped to enlist the full co-operation of the universities in some aspects of the fisheries investigations to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The first essential in the success of any industry is to provide the men with the technical &ldquo;know how&rdquo; to do the job.  I am convinced that one of the reasons why the fishing industry is not progressing as it should is the fact that we have not sufficient trained and skilled personnel.  The schemes for training experienced fishermen as skippers and boys as fishermen were inaugurated to remedy this situation. Quite frankly, I am very disappointed with the response to these schemes.  If we are to make real progress on the catching side, much greater numbers of young men must undergo the training offered.</P>
    <P>The conditions of the scheme for training fishermen as skippers were made more attractive some months ago: higher payments were authorised and the training period was shortened and rearranged for the spring and summer months for the greater convenience of applicants.  While there was a slightly better response when the scheme was subsequently re-advertised, it is still most disappointing in the light of the attractive terms offered. Seven trainees are at present completing the theoretical course at Galway and will shortly sit for examination. Only thirteen fishermen have so far secured certificates of competency under the Merchant Shipping Acts after completing courses under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputies to use their good offices in encouraging fishermen to come forward for training.  Applicants, <Col N="1501" /> who must have at least three years' experience of sea fishing, are paid at the rate of £7 per week and, in addition, are eligible for allowances up to £6 per week for dependants.  I am sure Deputies will agree that these payments are generous and that the training facilities offer a great opportunity of betterment to ambitious young fishermen, particularly bearing in mind the attractive terms available for the purchase of new boats.  I might mention that in future An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will not issue a boat of 50 feet or over on hire purchase, unless the hirer has satisfactorily completed training under this scheme or produces other evidence showing that he is fully competent to handle such craft.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme for training boys as fishermen, youths over 16 years of age without previous experience of sea fishing are paid up to £4 a week. Of the total of 46 boys assigned for training so far, five have graduated&mdash; in the sense that they are now receiving shares of the net earnings of the boats on which they are employed&mdash; and 22 are still undergoing training. This scheme was again widely advertised last month but the response has been poor.  Eligible applicants will shortly be interviewed at convenient centres.  Although the closing date announced has already passed, late applications will be accepted up to completion of the interviews early next month.</P>
    <P>The future of the fishing industry depends on the recruits now being attracted to the catching side.  To my mind this scheme for training boys should play a very important role in the expansion of the industry.  I have sought the assistance of the Minister for Education and his Department in encouraging pupils towards a sea fishing career.  It is my earnest hope that many more boys will come forward and, when they are experienced fishermen, go on for further training to secure certificates of competency as skippers.</P>
    <P>I must again record my appreciation of the co-operation of the skippers and crews of fishing boats taking part in the training scheme.  With the continued expansion of the scheme I look to other skippers to provide <Col N="1502" /> berths on their boats with the same measure of co-operation as their colleagues have been giving.</P>
    <P>Both the scheme for training fishermen as skippers and that for training boys as fishermen are advertised in the press from time to time but anybody interested may, without waiting for an advertisement, ask at any time to have his name recorded in the Fisheries Division.  I look forward to the time when it will become necessary to increase the provision under Subhead C.5 because of greater interest in these training schemes.</P>
    <P>Subhead E.1 provides the annual grant-in-aid of administration expenses, such as salaries, fees and travelling expenses, and development projects undertaken by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  In addition to the grant-in-aid of £160,000 which is the same as that provided last year, repayable advances up to a total of £220,000 have been authorised for the current year; these advances are in the main used to provide boats and gear for fishermen.  The grant-in-aid also includes provision for new boats&mdash; 15 per cent of the cost and the subvention necessary to meet the difference between the interest paid by the Board and that charged to purchasers at the reduced rate of 4 per cent.  I may also mention that I am considering what further incentives might be introduced to give the hire-purchasers a new deal and encourage them to better efforts to meet their commitments.</P>
    <P>Up to the present, boats of about 56 feet in length have been the biggest built by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara. A boat is now being designed by the Board which would be about 65 feet in length, just short of 50 tons gross tonnage, have an engine of up to 250 h.p. and be capable of fishing at considerable distances off our coasts.  Such a boat would, I am told, cost something in the region of £20,000 and should be within the capacity of competent fishermen to purchase.  The acquisition of boats of this size would strengthen the position of owner-fishermen who have a very important part to play in this country's fishing industry.  Indeed a few fishermen have <Col N="1503" /> already acquired boats of this or even greater size.</P>
    <P>I have been examining a number of the activities of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I find that there are strong differences of opinion as to whether the Board should continue to market fish or leave this field entirely in the hands of private enterprise.  In any event I am not at all satisfied that our present marketing arrangements are the best that can be devised. Before proposing any changes, I will, of course, consult with the various interests concerned.  Any decision on this or any other issue must be considered in relation to its effect on the industry as a whole rather than on any one sector.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the two new subheads &mdash; E.2 and G.4a &mdash; showing substantial figures of £186,000 which, as I said at the outset, cancel out and have no net effect on the Estimate.  The object is to seek approval of the House for the writing off of a deficit in respect of advances made to the former Sea Fisheries Association for the provision of boats and gear.  Advances totalling £408,500 were made to the Association for that purpose in the period of more than 20 years up to its dissolution in 1952.  These advances were made from the Fisheries Vote and were repayable by annuities, the amount repaid each year being appropriated in aid of the Vote, as, for instance, at Subhead G.4 for the current year.  In contrast, perhaps I should mention that advances to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara do not pass through the Vote, but are made from the Central Fund and appear &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; in the Exchequer Account published regularly in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>Neither the Association nor its successor, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, has been able to recover all payments due for boats issued to hire-purchasers, some of whom, unfortunately, have utterly failed to meet their commitments. In the worst cases, it has been necessary to resume possession of the boats and re-issue them at a loss.  In this way, losses have been accumulating over the years and the annuities due to the Fisheries Vote have been falling <Col N="1504" /> into arrears.  Had the liability to the Vote been reduced as each loss occurred, the total amount written off would be much smaller than the figure of £186,000 which is inflated by the inclusion of interest that has been accruing over the years.  At long last, however, consideration of the matter has reached the stage at which this deficit can be formally wiped out.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will, of course, continue to repay to the Vote advances made to the Association in so far as they correspond to the value placed on assets still remaining.</P>
    <P>Technical assistance projects of the type financed from Subhead F have included visits abroad and advice from foreign experts.  Deputies will recall the publication of two reports in recent months.  One of these is the specially commissioned F.A.O. review of the sea fishing industry which is based on a study made by a Canadian economist.  Various suggestions in this report are being considered, along with comments received from persons and associations interested in the industry.  Comments from Deputies will, of course, be also welcome.</P>
    <P>The second report to which I have referred is that of the Swedish consultant on fishery harbours.  After consideration of that report, I had the pleasure of announcing the Government's scheme for the development of five major fishery harbours &mdash; at Killybegs, Castletownbere, Passage East, Howth and Galway &mdash; at a cost of some £1,200,000.  The full programme of construction works will take a few years to complete and, while I appreciate the problems confronting the Commissioners of Public Works, I can assure the House that I am constantly pressing them to proceed with these works as quickly as possible.  No doubt some Deputies here will pursue the same line in the course of this debate.  Perhaps I should add that the development of these major harbours does not mean that smaller landing places will be neglected: proposals for improvement of several of them are also being considered.</P>
    <P>On the question of extension of <Col N="1505" /> exclusive fishery limits, progress towards international agreement is regrettably slow.  We are keeping in close touch with other countries in this matter and have taken part in some informal talks.  We are anxiously seeking every possibility of establishing an international rule of law on the issue.  As Deputies know, we support the United States/Canadian proposal for 12-mile exclusive fishery limits.</P>
    <P>On the inland fisheries side, there is a good deal of work in hand which we expect to lead to increased production of many kinds in our inland waters, but it is not a case merely of bringing increased fishing power to bear; one must patiently work out measures of improvement which may take five to ten years or more to show results.</P>
    <P>Salmon fishing, which is the most important item on the inland side, runs in cycles of productivity dependent on weather, particularly rainfall, on temperature trends in distant waters, and on a number of other imponderable factors.  It will therefore be appreciated that any view of productivity must necessarily be long-term. In recent years, salmon fishing has been passing through a trough of low catch returns: the total catch by all methods, which over the ten years to 1957 was returned at an average of over 16,300 cwts., was down to roughly 15,000 cwts. in 1958 and 14,500 cwts. in 1959; in 1960, it fell to just over 11,000 cwts. &mdash;the lowest figure on record since 1945.  This very low return was due to a combination of circumstances.  The run of spring fish was a poor one in most rivers as also were the runs of large or early summer fish.  The main grilse run was late and came with continuous rain which gave high water conditions unsuitable in the early stages for netting and later in the season for angling also.</P>
    <P>While we can do nothing to speed the return of more favourable conditions in the distant feeding grounds of the salmon, we must continue to work for the better protection of the spawning stock and for the improvement of our rivers in a variety of ways calculated to provide the requisite conditions for increased production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> A lot of useful ground work is being done and there are some activities which are already showing promising returns.  As a result of the brown trout and coarse fish development work being carried out by the Inland Fisheries Trust in collaboration with Bord Fáilte Éireann, a record number of 39,000 angling visitors came here in 1960 as against some 29,000 in the previous year.  This record represents the spending of more than £1,000,000 in 1960.</P>
    <P>Another example of progress is the increase in the value of eel exports which rose to some £41,000 in 1960 as against £37,000 in 1959 and £32,000 in 1958.  These are encouraging results from the revival of eel fishing which has become possible since certain statutory restrictions on the operation of eel weirs were removed in 1958.</P>
    <P>The amount provided for inland fisheries in Subheads D.1 to D.10 shows an increase of less than £1,000 this year &mdash; £88,760 as compared with £87,775.  Perhaps I should deal briefly with the principal matters arising under these subheads.</P>
    <P>The major item at Subhead D.1 makes provision for statutory payments to local authorities in compensation for the loss to their funds due to exemption of fisheries for local authority rating.  A slight increase maintains the trend of a number of years past which reflects the rising level of local rates.</P>
    <P>Noteworthy among the payments to be made to boards of conservators out of Subhead D.1 is a payment of £500 to the Ballyshannon Board of Conservators to enable it to contribute to the cost of protection in the Erne system.  The cost of this scheme continues to be shared with the Electricity Supply Board and the Ministry of Commerce, Belfast, who are partners with my Department in these measures for the welfare of the salmon stocks in this river system.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to the scheme of regulated fishing in the Erne estuary which was being instituted on an experimental basis for the three years 1960, 1961 and 1962.  I am happy to say that the run of salmon in this river last season was rather better than the average for the preceding three years, and it was found possible to declare <Col N="1507" /> the fishery open to fishing by commercial methods from 29th June; up to that date a total prohibition on fishing had secured the passage up-stream of some 3,000 fish.  This was the pre-arranged escapement figure which, taken together with escapement at week-ends and so on, is regarded for the time being as providing an adequate spawning stock.  Unfortunately, the run of fish has not been quite so good this season and the escapement has not yet reached the 3,000 mark.  I may say that the fishermen have quite willingly accepted this unusual system of regulating the fishing season which they recognise as being designed to help in the rehabilitation of salmon stocks in the River Erne, while at the same time permitting a gradual return to a normal level of exploitation.</P>
    <P>An increase under Subhead D.3 for management of State fisheries arises mainly from higher wages and fishery rates on the Owenea fishery, which is managed by my Department in conjunction with the hatchery at Glenties. This subhead also provides funds for the management by Fisheries Division of fisheries held by the Land Commission and Forestry Division.  Receipts from the letting of these State fisheries are brought to credit under Subhead G.3.</P>
    <P>The sum of £4,200 provided at Subhead D.4 for scientific and technical investigations shows an increase of £500.  This modest sum by no means reflects fully the importance of the work being tackled by the biologists and engineers.  It will be spent on building up equipment and in defraying the incidental expenses of various operations of investigation and development.  A few of these call for special mention.</P>
    <P>Much has been learned in recent years of the extent of predation to which salmon, sea trout and brown trout are subject.  The predators include pike, pollack and fish-eating birds.  Investigations are being pursued in greater detail and the results will be published for the information of conservancy authorities and anglers' associations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> The biologists are making a study of how fish life is affected by arterial drainage work.  A section of the Moy system is being examined according as drainage work proceeds and the effect on fish food and spawning grounds can be observed.  The engineers are engaged in working out means of employing fish counting devices under varying conditions.</P>
    <P>The revival of eel fishing which I mentioned earlier will be helped by investigations into the stocks of a number of rivers and the efficiency of the existing methods of capture. Experimental work will also be done with modern methods of capture used in other countries.  Experience gained abroad in methods of holding, transporting and processing eels will also be passed on to the industry by practical demonstrations.</P>
    <P>The promotion of fish farming has given rise to a number of problems which are being tackled.  Feeding trials have been initiated with the object of ascertaining the tolerance of rainbow trout to a diet of fish food pellets &mdash; a convenient form of food which has been developed to solve some of the problems of food supply for fish pond culture.  Experimental work on the rearing of rainbow trout in brackish water using sea organisms as food will also be undertaken.</P>
    <P>These, of course, are merely some of the more unusual features of a comprehensive programme of scientific and experimental work.</P>
    <P>Subhead D.5 provides for compensation for the statutory suppression of freshwater netting rights and for miscellaneous expenses in that connection. The delay in completing these payments is due to difficulties experienced by claimants in proving title.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid of £33,500 which is being provided in Subhead D.6 for the Inland Fisheries Trust compares with £30,000 paid last year and £25,000 in the preceding year.  The Trust will, of course, also receive during the year a contribution from Bord Fáilte Éireann in respect of the final year of the present joint five-year angling development plan.</P>
    <P>I do not need to go in detail into <Col N="1509" /> the nature of the work being done so well by the Trust in the development of sport fishing for brown trout and coarse fish, and also of sea angling. These activities are fully described in the Trust's annual reports and their merit is widely acknowledged.  I must, once again, pay tribute to the indispensable co-operation which the Trust and Bord Fáilte have received from angling associations and development groups throughout the country.  The spirit of self-help and of goodwill which has been engendered in the relations between these bodies has manifestly contributed to the success of their efforts.  I appeal to all concerned to maintain this spirit and also to be jealous of the reputation they have earned of fair dealing with the visitors who have come in such numbers to enjoy the excellent fishing facilities now offered.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid under subhead D. 7 to the Salmon Research Trust amounts to one third of the running expenses subject to a maximum of £1,000, the balance being contributed by Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co. (Dublin) Ltd. Since it was set up in 1955, the Trust has been studying the problems connected with the management of salmon fisheries and a good deal of useful information has been assembled.  I have been informed that a progress report will shortly be published.</P>
    <P>I regret that it has not yet been found possible to put into effect the agreement reached whereby the Trust is to investigate the effects of effluent from bog workings on fish, fish food and spawning.  The hold up is due to difficulty in the recruitment of scientific staff but this obstacle will, I believe be overcome in the near future and the work can then begin.  A sum of £1,000 is provided under Subheads A and F towards the cost of the work which is expected to amount to some £3,000 a year at the outset.  The balance will be contributed by Bord na Móna and Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co. (Dublin) Ltd.</P>
    <P>The two fish farm demonstration units set up under subhead D.8 last year at the Glen of Aherlow and at Blackwater, near Enniscorthy, have been operated successfully and the farmers <Col N="1510" /> concerned have found a ready sale for the rainbow trout according as they reached marketable size.  It is right to emphasise that the two farmers who are running these demonstrations have been fortunate in being able to secure attractive prices for their output which one cannot count on being maintained in conditions of more plentiful supply.  The results will be reviewed in a few months' time when the entire produce of the first stocking with fry has reached marketable size.  However, even allowing for a certain settling down of the price, it seems safe to assume that such ventures can be quite profitable.  In any event it has been established that the production of rainbow trout in ponds for table use is a practical proposition for the small farmer who can quickly acquire the know-how and, without undue expenditure of labour, bring in a worthwhile addition to his farm income.</P>
    <P>Funds are being provided this year for setting up some further demonstration units &mdash; one has already been constructed at Raford, near Loughrea, County Galway, and another at Ballymote, County Sligo, and plans are being prepared for a site near Mullingar.  I am content to let the verdict for or against small scale fish culture depend on the results achieved by these demonstration units.</P>
    <P>Fish farming is, of course, conducted on a large scale at Roscrea and Woodenbridge.  There are also proposals by Danish interests to set up fish farms in County Kerry.  While the expansion of production and the building up of a substantial export trade in rainbow trout are beset with many difficulties, the establishment of such projects is to be welcomed and I need hardly say that my Department will co-operate fully in advising private interests.</P>
    <P>The sum of £16,000 at subhead D.9 for contributions to the Salmon Conservancy Fund stands as it was last year, but it will be allocated in a different manner.  The amount ear-marked for grants to boards of conservators to supplement their revenues from fishery rates and licence duties has been increased to £9,000.  This increase has been rendered necessary <Col N="1511" /> by the shortfall of receipts into the Fund last year from the salmon export levy.  The total paid into the Fund from the levy and from excess licence duties fell just short of £10,000 because of the poor fishing season and the consequential decline in salmon exports, whereas in a good year such payments should be around £15,000.</P>
    <P>There is a further allocation of £2,000 for minor works for the improvement of salmon rivers.  The greater part of the Exchequer contribution towards the cost of two major works &mdash; the fish passes on the River Inagh at Ennistymon and the fish hatchery and rearing station at Cong &mdash;has already been paid into the Salmon Conservancy Fund and only a balance of £5,000 is to be provided this year towards these projects.  A contract has been placed by the Limerick Board of Conservators for the work at Ennistymon which should shortly commence.  The work at Cong is to be undertaken by direct labour and arrangements to that end are being made by the Galway Board. Conservators have in general been quick to take advantage of the scheme for minor improvements; there are in hands many works for the improvement of spawning facilities or the easing of obstructions to the passage of fish to the spawning grounds and these must in time contribute in increasing measure to improving the salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>Subhead D.10 relates to the European Inland Fisheries Advisory Commission which held its inaugural meeting in Dublin in April of last year. The Commission appointed an Executive Committee which is responsible for carrying through the programme of work set down for execution by the time of the next meeting in April, 1962.  The provision of £100 this year is to meet expenses of participation by the Irish representative who is Chairman of the Commission and of the executive Committee.</P>
    <P>The work of reviewing the law following on enactment of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, is now well advanced and the drafting of a first instalment of amending legislation is <Col N="1512" /> almost completed.  This Bill, which will soon be ready to bring before the Dáil, will incorporate proposals to deal with the more pressing problems. Among these I would mention the need for more effective measures to deal with offences like the poisoning of a river which can be so far-reaching in doing lasting damage to the fish stocks.</P>
    <P>Draft legislation has also been prepared to amend the Foyle Fisheries Act so as to make similar provision in regard to poisoning offences and also to strengthen the powers of the Foyle Fisheries Commission in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>The development of our fisheries&mdash; both sea and inland &mdash; is a major aim of Government policy.  I am glad to say that a real start has been made but I am very conscious that much remains to be done and I am determined to do it.  In recommending this Estimate I may say that, when more money can be effectively devoted to the development of our fisheries, it will be a pleasure for me to come to the House for additional funds.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister moving the Estimates for Lands and Forestry and to a great deal of the debate during which the Minister and his officers were the recipients of congratulations from speakers on both sides of the House for the manner in which they conducted their affairs. I have no compliments to pay either the Minister or his officers on the policy of the Fisheries Branch.  They had their minds made up that when they made a blunder the only way they could get out of it was to keep on blundering.  Their mistakes have been so many that I do not know where to start.  The last few words of the Minister's statement reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recommending this Estimate I may say that, when more money can be effectively devoted to the development of our fisheries, it will <Col N="1513" /> be a pleasure for me to come to the House for additional funds.</P>
    <P>The squandermania and stupid waste which has taken place in relation to fisheries for the past four or five years is astounding.  I wish to quote from a statement made by a man who would know but who might not be consulted by the Department and to whom I have not spoken about this. He happens to be a man in the fish trade and the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of June 12th, 1960, refers as follows to a statement he made at a vocational education congress in Bundoran, Co. Donegal:</P>
    <P>Mr. S. Clayton of Dun Laoghaire, declared that employment for 50,000 men could be provided and exports could be increased tenfold if the maritime industry were put on a proper footing.</P>
    <P>That is good but he was speaking in a very dangerous place, in Donegal, as far as sea fisheries are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">

      <P>They are most hospitable people in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To be hospitable is a very nice thing and to be hospitable to people who are bringing you concessions worth £200,000 is no miracle. I am sure that if you went into the fastnesses of the Congo with £200,000 you would be received with open arms. Let me come back to Donegal and give you an idea as to how the Fisheries Branch keep on making mistakes. The first big blunder I came across when I came into this House was the purchase of the three famous deep sea trawlers.  I was for years trying to find out about these deep sea trawlers. I even had to bring the Minister in here on the adjournment one night, which I regretted because it was a very late sitting, to endeavour to get the information I wanted.  The total amount of fish landed by the three trawlers was £355,000 but it cost £288,000 to land that quantity of fish with these three wonderful trawlers. Losses amounted to £52,000; the average loss per vessel per year was £2,177 and the total amount for depreciation and operational allowances was £125,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> I wanted to know but was never told who surveyed these three vessels for the Department.  A certificate must have been supplied to the Department as to the condition of these vessels.  I should like to know who gave it.  We must judge by results.  I understand that it was an epic voyage when these boats were being brought from Germany to Killybegs.  They got there and were tied up for a very long time.  I do not want anybody telling me who did this or who did that.  It does not matter who did it; it was done on the advice of the Department of Fisheries.  These boats were tied up in Killybegs; they did not go to sea and it was discovered after some time that the engines were not working.  In the case of one vessel, the engine fell out.</P>
    <P>What I complain of is that there was no efficiency in the Department that bought these vessels.  The certificate must not be a very strict one. The examination must not have been sufficiently careful.  The vessels were not seaworthy; they were three old rusty buckets.</P>
    <P>We asked questions about them and the Minister gave us too much credit. He gave us credit for being in possession of a secret weapon that the President of the United States of America or the man in the Kremlin would be interested in.  The Minister said, as reported at Column 2065 of the Dáil Debates of 20th July, 1960:</P>
    <P>An elaborate, persistent and continuous attack has been made down through the years by the Deputy's Party in relation to these boats.  If one thing is clear, it is clear now, at any rate to an impartial observer, that these boats failed.  Two of them undoubtedly did.  That failure was due to the deliberate slander campaign conducted against these boats in this House ...</P>
    <P>I have known boats to be sunk by torpedoes, aerial torpedoes and magnetic mines but this was a new way of smashing up boats, namely, to slander a boat in Dáil Éireann.  That, it would appear, was the cause of the engine falling out of the boat and of their not being able to go to sea.  Will the Minister find out who certified <Col N="1515" /> these boats and make sure that that person or persons will not have anything to do with the examination of boats for the Minister's Department in future?  That is a reasonable thing to do.</P>
    <P>I could say a lot more about these boats.  If the amount of money lost on these boats were spent in places where fish were caught the Minister would have a better record to give to the House of his Department.  Listening to the Minister's speech, one would come to the conclusion that there is no future for Irish sea fisheries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what this Deputy does not think.  I wish the Deputy would not interrupt.  I listened to a whole lot of clap-trap from Fianna Fáil speakers for the past few days and did not interrupt any of them.  There is a future for Irish sea fisheries but there can be no future for them as long as whoever is responsible for the Fisheries Branch is allowed to carry out the fixed policy they seem to have, that is, to ignore the east and south coast and to continue pouring money into the western and northern ports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall see if it is he proper attitude.  Of course, when you speak Irish down there it must be an enormous advantage in attracting the fish.  It must put a good flavour on the fish.  The Minister says here:</P>
      <P>The value of exports of fish &mdash; excluding salmon and freshwater fish &mdash; increased by £78,000, or almost 8 per cent. over that for 1959, to the record total of £1,107,000 in 1960.  Herrings accounted for more than half of that total.  For the opening months of 1961, however, the early termination of herring fishing has been reflected in reduced exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that the policy <Col N="1516" /> of the Minister's Department from 1948 onwards, when they gave out an armada of fishing boats, meant for my constituency, one boat in Dunmore East up to the end of 1957.  I thought, in my innocence, that perhaps the people in Dunmore East were not looking for boats.  I discovered that the people there had had so many disappointments about boats that they would not even bother to apply for one. One of them said to me: &ldquo;Of course, we do not speak Irish down here.&rdquo; Ring is an outstanding Gaeltacht and there is a port in Ring.  That is in my constituency, Helvick.  I went to Helvick and discovered that they had never got a boat in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they did not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a few rusty applications in the Department. Eventually I went to the Minister in charge of Fisheries at the time and stormed so much that a boat, the Ardmore, was sent to Helvick &mdash; a boat. Now I might be asked why should Helvick or Dunmore East get a preference over any other of these places, these wonderful western and northern ports?  My answer is a reply by the Minister.  I discovered that while they were catching 15,000 cwt. of fish at Schull where they have a new installation and while they were catching 27,000 cwt. of fish in Galway, and roughly 100,000 cwt. in Killybegs, they caught in Dunmore East 296,000 cwt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They had to come down from Killybegs to look for fish and they had to run away from the wonderful Killybegs factory, but I will come to that.  Mind you, I am on concrete here but there is no concrete in Dunmore pier.  There are holes in that. Now what do we find?  We find that other Departments of State seem to be in a line up with Fisheries against Dunmore. I had been in Dunmore one evening at the height of the fishing season last year and saw this enormous catch of fish being brought in there.  At the same time, on the one o'clock news on the radio on the 8th <Col N="1517" /> December, 1960, it was announced that 2,000 cran of herring had been landed at Killybegs.  They finished the news broadcast by saying that there had also been a large catch at Dunmore East.  At 6.30 I listened to the news again and Killybegs was again headlined with its 2,000 cran while Dunmore was washed up.  On the 10.15 news there was talk again of this marvellous catch.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait; I am a dangerous man to interrupt.  Do not be too impetuous, I say to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I went to the journalist and asked what he was doing and he showed me his copy.  He had sent it.  I wrote to the broadcasting authorities to know whether I could get a copy of the news script and I was told that it was not made available.  I have had occasion to write to our friends in Northern Ireland and it was made available &mdash; not to me as a Deputy but as an ordinary outlander, a southerner, who wrote to the Belfast men and they sent it to me.  I put down a question and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his own inimitable fashion of answering, like the Minister for Transport and Power, said he had no function in the matter and there it was.  I want to put on the records of the House that on the day that broadcast was going on, 7,000 cran were landed at Dunmore, 7,000 the next day, and 7,000 the following day when they had to stop fishing because they were out of ice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the next one from the Department of Fisheries.  The Department have ice plants established all round the coast.  Some have been built in places where they need no ice at all, barring they get into the ice cream business or people come in summer for mackerel fishing, angling or something like that.  I put down a question asking what was being handled by these ice factories and discovered that they are all losing money.  The one they built at Dunmore is losing money and I want to tell something about this magnificent factory we have built at Dunmore.  It <Col N="1518" /> did not rest with me to come in here today and talk about fishing at Dunmore. Even on the 8th May, 1957, when Deputy Ryan, the Minister for Finance, was introducing his Budget I could see him looking across at me, as much as to say: &ldquo;This will shut your mouth&rdquo;.  He said as reported at Column 944 of the Dáil Debates:</P>
    <P>I propose to make available for the benefit of the sea and inland fisheries an additional sum of approximately £50,000.  Of this sum, £45,000 will be used to erect an ice plant at Dunmore East.</P>
    <P>He looked straight across at me.</P>
    <P>I heard that broadcast from Radio Éireann and I had to suffer some little ribbing from some friends I have left in the Government Party.  As I mentioned that was the 8th May, 1957.  These policy makers in the Department of Fisheries, in the words of the hurler &ldquo;were not bet yet.&rdquo;  They were going to have another &ldquo;go&rdquo;. Deputy Childers, the then Minister for Fisheries, had moved the Vote for Fisheries and was closing it.  I had asked a question about this fish factory and ice plant to be started at Dunmore. If you will note, Sir, it is a matter of only a few days afterwards.  I had to intervene when he was closing and I said as reported at Column 1069 on June, 19th 1957:</P>
    <P>I wish to remind the Minister that I asked a question about the £45,000 and the £5,000 mentioned in the Budget speech of the Minister for Finance in regard to Dunmore East. The Minister was not in the House last night when I was speaking.</P>
    <P>The Report goes on:</P>
    <P>Mr. Childers: There was an error in the report.  The Minister for Finance gave a total grant of £50,000 comprising a sum towards exploration, money for additional boats and a grant towards the construction of an ice plant in Dunmore.  Owing to an error in the publication, which is not my responsibility, it appeared as if Dunmore was getting all but <Col N="1519" /> £5,000 of the whole of the extra grant.  However Dunmore is getting the ice plant.</P>
    <P>You could have knocked me down with a feather &mdash; not that Dunmore was getting the ice plant but because it was too good to be true, that £50,000 could be allotted to Dunmore East.  They would not have enough sense in the Department of Fisheries to put an ice plant where it was wanted.  They did put up an ice plant and I discovered that the cost was £18,000.  It is an inadequate ice plant but, in spite of the fact that it is inadequate, it sells more ice than all the other ice plants the Department have.  Only for Messrs. Henry Denny &amp; Sons, Bacon Curers, and their fine ice plant in Waterford city, they would not be able to fish at Dunmore because when they would bring in their enormous catches they would be out of town as far as ice was concerned and would have nothing but stinking fish.</P>
    <P>Just to show the continuing policy of the Fisheries Branch towards the ports into which the catches of fish are brought and where the biggest landings are made, I put down a Parliamentary Question as far back as 16th April, 1959, asking the Minister for Finance to state, &ldquo;the amounts expended in the case of harbour works by grants from his Department on each of the following ports since 1945: &mdash; Howth, Arklow, Dunmore East, Baltimore, Dingle, Galway, Helvick, Kilmore, Killybegs.&rdquo;  In reply I was told that the amount expended on Howth, a good port, was £49,649; Arklow, £15,751; Dunmore East, £21,191; Baltimore, £646; Dingle, £7,607; Helvick, £3,669; Kilmore, £1,581; and Killybegs, £28,109.  Since then £50,000 was spent on Killybegs and £50,000 on Greencastle.  I wanted to know where Greencastle is and I asked the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Being a Donegal man he was able to tell me it is in Donegal.</P>
    <P>On the day that was made known to me I put down a question asking <Col N="1520" /> how much was caught in Greencastle from 1st January, 1959, to 30th April, 1960.  I was told 2,454 cwts, of fish were caught.  I thought I would be told it was something like 70,000 or 80,000 cwts.  Greencastle was the fastest thing on the draw I ever saw.  That was pulled out of the hat and 50,000 smackers shoved into it.  This matter came up on the Vote for the Office of Public Works.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary, who is now present in the House, about it on his Vote and he told me I should not give him the credit for the work being done in Killybegs and Greencastle but that it was the recommendation and the policy of the Fisheries Branch.  I was hunting for that information for a long time.  I had been told: &ldquo;That is not the function of my Department,&rdquo; or &ldquo;That is the function of my Department.&rdquo;  I did not know until then that it was a function of the Fisheries Branch.</P>
    <P>During that same debate I first heard of the report of the Swedish expert.  The Parliamentary Secretary made a mistake.  He thought it had been circulated but it had not been circulated at that time.  I am not making any issue out of that.  He did put me a little off my stride when he said that the report of the Swedish expert had been supplied to every Deputy, because I take such an interest in fisheries, especially in regard to my own constituency, that when I get a new report on fisheries, if I cannot deal with it immediately, I file it away.  This report is by Carl G. Bjuke.  Not having a fáinne for the Swedish language I do not know how to pronounce that name.</P>
    <P>He mentioned Dunmore East and said he thought the harbour was inadequate. At page 45 of the Report he says:</P>
    <P>Present facilities should, however, be improved to an extent to meet some of the requirements of a modern fishery fleet.</P>
    <P>He points out in another part of the Report that Dunmore East can accommodate in crowded conditions up to 30 boats.  The Report goes on:</P>
    <P>... the detailed survey has shown that the provision of adequate depth <Col N="1521" /> and sea room in addition to greater protection of the harbour and approaches would be most difficult. It would involve the construction of extremely costly breakwaters and extensive underwater rock excavation.</P>
    <P>Further on he says:</P>
    <P>It is recommended that any large scale developments to suit the requirements of a major fishing port on this section of the coast should be centred on nearby Passage East, which has many attractive features to offer.</P>
    <P>Here we have the bible, and here is a report that says we should go to Passage like copyboys.  I am not finding fault with this expert's Report. Passage East is a great anchorage and a safe anchorage, and in time of great storm or great stress ships run there for shelter.</P>
    <P>This is the report on Passage East:</P>
    <P>The harbour is small and shallow and siltation in the base is a serious problem.  The approaches are deep and well protected.  Frequently, boats land their catches at Dunmore East and move to Passage East for shelter in difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>Of Dunmore East the Report says:</P>
    <P>Dunmore East is a resort centre with a permanent population of about 500.  It has good accommodation facilities and there are good road connections to Waterford City. There are 30 active fishermen and 9 boats over 10 tons.  Landings amount to more than 80,000 cwts., virtually all pelagic fish.</P>
    <P>Since this gentleman was here we have landed 300,000 cwts.</P>
    <P>The Report continues:</P>
    <P>Dunmore East is a State-owned harbour administered and maintained by the Office of Public Works. A resident Harbour Master and staff control harbour traffic here.  Up to 40 vessels have tied up at Dunmore East at the same time, but with a great degree of congestion.  The harbour is open to the seas from the South to South East and makes such <Col N="1522" /> congestion extremely dangerous. Fuel and water are available at the pier, and a small ice plant has recently been constructed and there are plans for the early erection of a second plant.</P>
    <P>All the white elephants around the coast should be taken down and a second plant put where it would be most useful.</P>
    <P>Replying to a question put down by Deputy O'Donnell about the exploratory vessel and what it was doing the Minister, as reported at Column 75 of Volume 184 on the 26th October 1960, said that the &ldquo;Cú Feasa&rdquo; was down at Dunmore East exploring the herring fisheries off the south-east coast and conveying the results to Irish boats in the area.  The Official Report continues:</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Donnell: Could the Minister inform the House if the vessel has been on research work on the west or north west coasts of the country yet?</P>
    <P>Mr. Moran: No.  As I understand it, she has been where I have indicated, off the south-east coast.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Donnell: But surely everybody knows there are herrings there at the moment?</P>
    <P>There was only herring by the 7,000 cran to be got in Dunmore East.</P>
    <P>Mr. Moran: If the Deputy has misunderstood me, by protection I mean the conservancy of Dunmore East fishery which is the most important one on our coasts.</P>
    <P>Mark, the Minister of Fisheries himself said it.  Now the Department of Fisheries are going to have another &ldquo;go&rdquo; as the saying is.</P>
    <P>There were some gentlemen in my area who were inclined to put up a fish factory about four or five years ago.  There was substantial local support for this in Dunmore East.  I attended a few meetings and I thought everything was going well but the next thing I heard was that they were going to build a factory at Killybegs.  The factory went up at Killybegs and on the 30th November 1960 Deputy O'Donnell asked the Minister for <Col N="1523" /> Lands, as reported at Col. 350, Vol. 185:</P>
    <P>if in view of the glut of herrings on the Donegal coast he will ask Atlantic Fisheries to reopen their fish meal plant at Killybegs, or, alternatively, arrange for Bord Iascaigh Mhara to take over the plant.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was keeping the matter under review.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>Mr. T. Lynch: Is it a fact that Atlantic Fisheries lost over £150,000 in the last twelve months?</P>
    <P>Mr. Moran: That is a private company and I have no information as to the state of its finances.</P>
    <P>There we are.  I did not know where we were going then.  It was a private company.  On Saturday, 4th February, 1961, <i>The Kerryman</i> published an article with the heading &ldquo;The Killybegs Fish Surplus That Never Was,&rdquo;&ldquo;Cost of three months' employment of 30 people to process it was £2,333 a head!&rdquo;  The article stated:</P>
    <P>It had to happen &mdash; and it has happened. The Killybegs fishmeal factory, built in 1957 at a cost of £132,000 and often a subject for comment on this page, is to be sold this month.</P>
    <P>This was a private enterprise but I am informed, and I have checked it and it is right, that a Government grant of £70,000 was put into that factory. We had to have a lot of old window dressing about this factory when it was put up and of course it became a sacred bull with the <i>Irish Press</i>.  We had triumphant headlines in that paper on January 29th, 1960, which read &ldquo;160-mile coast to coast &lsquo;herring lift&rsquo; under way.&rdquo;  They had to bring the herrings over from Clogherhead to Killybegs.  That was not clever.  That cost us a packet of money.  Not only did this factory lose that amount of money but I was informed by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara that they put up a substantial amount of money for boats for this factory and that had to be written off.  That went down with the ship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> Now we have discovered that the Minister bought it and that we have Danes in there.  They are under licence, having made a gentleman's agreement with the Minister to bring in deep-sea trawlers &mdash; and fish in opposition to the inshore fishermen.  I say &ldquo;in opposition&rdquo; because they will get into the waters in which the inshore fishermen should be fishing.  Why does the Department of Fisheries insist on squandering money at such a rate on ventures that are obviously a dead loss?  They will keep on doing it.</P>
    <P>I have a report here from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the 31st March, 1959.  They did not mention Dunmore East at all but they mentioned the other places.  I do not know whether this is the most up-to-date report from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara but they state that Killybegs Ice Plant lost £14,000, Galway lost £6,000 and Schull, nearly £1,000, making a total of £21,000.  They never mentioned what happened at Dunmore East.  Another matter mentioned in the Report is this writing-off of money.  The Minister mentioned it here himself.  On page 9 of his speech, he mentions that the deficit for boats and gear was £186,000 which was written off.  I think we should have more details and get more information.  Have these men been allowed to keep these boats? That is a question I want the Minister to answer.  If a man did not pay for his boat was he allowed to keep his boat and was the money written off?</P>

      <P>That has the whole bearing on what I want to put over here &mdash; the neglect of Waterford Estuary. This fine harbour is a combination of Passage, Dunmore and even Duncannon. The fishermen come into it from Kilmore and Helvick.  Here is the place where the most fish was caught, landed and sold in the years gone by.  Some people say: &ldquo;Oh, but the herring might go away.&rdquo;  I hope they are not making novenas in the Fisheries Branch that the herring will go away and justify their policy.  It is time a change were made in the policy.  It is time there was a change in the approach of the Department so that, when contemplating putting up works or improving harbours, they will look to the place where the most fish is caught.</P>
      <P>Recently I put down a Parliamentary Question asking what was being done and how much money had been allotted for expenditure on Passage East this year.  No money has been allotted for expenditure on Passage East.  All there will be are trial borings, and so on, and so on.  I heard of this report a year ago on the debate on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works.  A deputation saw the Minister.  The whole business was welcomed.  Some people even said to me: &ldquo;Maybe this is a change of heart.&rdquo;  Evidently it is not a change of heart.  It looks as if nothing will be done at Passage East for a long time.</P>

I know now that it is the Fisheries Branch and the Minister in charge of it and his officials who will make the decision as to what harbour shall get pride of place.  I say that the harbour at Passage East should get pride of place, not because it is in my constituency but because they catch more fish there.  It is the best proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know. The very minute the &ldquo;Cú Feasa&rdquo; comes down about the white fishing it is taken away again.  With all the roaring about the white fishing, this has been developed and developed and developed.  Now we are to have another thing in Galway.  I suppose it is just as well to put it up there and have it alongside that fish factory they have there that was never used. That is some more of the good policy. This policy cannot and could not be defended.  A fish factory was put up in Galway.  It was opened with the greatest flourish of trumpets and headlines one can imagine.</P>
      <P>The then Minister for Fisheries, Deputy Childers, went down there and they had the most wonderful party. I do not know what it would not do. They ran a few boxes of fish which they had brought down with them through the factory and it has never been used since.  It was only used as a customs station when an American liner came into Galway.  Now, following their old form, the Minister says today:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> As I announced some months ago, a new fisheries research station will be built in Galway.  I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to the Galway Harbour Commissioners for placing a site at my disposal.  About half of the staff of the Fisheries Division will be transferred to the new building for which plans are being prepared.</P>
    <P>I hope they will be able to get fish for their dinners on a Friday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That station should be at Killybegs, really.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>You are able to catch only one-third of the amount of fish we catch but you get four times as much money as we get and you look like getting it in the future.  That is what I am protesting about.</P>
      <P>I want to come back to Atlantic Fish Industries, Limited, Killybegs. They got a loan of £38,350, apart from the grant of £70,000 to assist the company in the purchase of two fishing vessels.  I understand that a grant of £4,350 was made in respect of one of the vessels which was new and that the loan agreement executed by the company in each case is supported by a first mortgage on the vessel and the personal guarantees of four of the directors.  I am further informed that the vessels have been surrendered to An Bórd Iascaigh Mhara and offered for sale through a firm of shipbrokers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How much do we lose by the transaction? As far as I can see, the Minister had to step in and buy the fish factory.  He had to step in probably and take over these boats too.  I would like to know how much had to be written off in the process.  I will be pardoned, I am sure, or maybe I should not ask anybody's pardon, for saying that I am jealous of all this money.  I would not be so jealous of it if it were being spent to good account, but we have had hundreds of thousands of pounds being lost on our three trawlers, on the Atlantic Fisheries, on building ice plants where they were not needed, on putting up <Col N="1528" /> fish processing factories where there was no fish to be processed, and additional hundreds of thousands of pounds being spent on fishing piers that are not being used.</P>
    <P>This great progress of the Department of Fisheries should come to an end, and as the Minister himself has said, and I would compliment him on it, to Deputy O'Donnell:</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has misunderstood me, by protection I mean the conservancy of Dunmore East fishery which is the most important one on our coasts.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Donnell: The herring fishery?</P>
    <P>Mr. Moran: Yes.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on that, and it is the only compliment I have to pay him.  He said it on the 26th October, 1960, as reported at Column 77 of the Dáil Debates for that day.</P>
    <P>I again exhort the Minister to go into this Department and before we dissolve to lay down a policy or give a direction to stop the rake's progress I was talking about when he came in, and to endeavour to direct the Department of Fisheries and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to spend their money on improvements in harbours where fish are caught and where fish can be sold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay this Vote, but I was interested to hear the Minister's statement in regard to fish farming.  I would like to put to the Minister and his Department the wonderful and abundant facilities that are available in and around Galway City for development in that line.  With the least possible expenditure I believe we could have a wonderful development along these lines.  There is an immense number of anglers coming from across the Channel to the West, and there are great opportunities if the Department would only direct their attention to them and see what they could do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1930 An Bord Iascaigh Mhara came to Galway City and got the facility of securing premises on a six month basis.  That agreement was drawn up but the Department are not <Col N="1529" /> inclined to keep to it.  In the meantime, as Deputy Lynch has said, we have opened up one of the finest fish freezing plants in this country.  I will not go into the pros and cons as to whether it is right or wrong, but the fact that it is there is one step.  The question of providing fish is another which I will deal with again.  Deputy Childers came there and promised great things.  We have had these promises, and we also have the old premises which belong to a firm which has asked for their return.</P>
    <P>It is a public disgrace to hold those premises when this firm wants to develop them and give employment, while the premises are only used for harbouring junk.  That is a disgrace, that we should be wasting money and at the same time preventing employment.  It is a disgrace to deprive those people of their right to develop their business and use their premises in a better way, seeing that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have gone to the expenditure of £65,000 on the new premises.  It is about time that the Board woke up and stopped holding up progress in that area.  I had a look at the premises the day before yesterday and could see weeds about four foot high.  Are they breeding weeds around the premises? It is the cause of very unfavourable comment.  I would suggest to the Board that they should at least cut the weeds and let the people see the factory.</P>
    <P>When I was a young lad a good while ago I recall the famous Claddagh fishing fleet lined up three deep, but at the present day we have not one solitary boat.  The Department of Fisheries were going to do the devil knows what when they came down there, but we see a a lot of these young Claddagh men now in the British merchant fleet or in England, and quite forgotten.</P>
    <P>The Minister has appealed to Deputies to help him in the recruiting of trainees for the fishing industry.  I can only say, as a member of Galway Vocational Education Committee, that he has got every help from the Committee and will get the same in the future, but when one hears the Minister appealing to the House for assistance to encourage young men to <Col N="1530" /> take up fishing I would say that there is something wrong with the Department's policy when he has to send out such an S.O.S.  There is something wrong when the youth are not inclined to take up that line, and the Minister should examine his conscience in that regard.</P>
    <P>All I would say is that what I can deduce from the Minister's statement is that there is a complete lack of policy from his Department in the development of the fishing industry. In proof of that I would say that the Minister has handed over to a Danish firm the running of the fish processing plant in Donegal.  It is not right to read a long-winded statement and at the end of it see no hope for the future.  I have heard statements made by Ministers, especially at the opening of this plant by the then Minister, Deputy Childers, that the fish were going to hand themselves up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If I deal with the contribution of the last Deputy first, let me say that the first I heard about the matter to which he refers, concerning a private firm in Galway requiring the repossession of their premises which they evidently have leased to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, is this very moment.  I understand that Deputy Coogan approached or handed a letter to the Secretary of my Department in the House only today. I cannot, naturally, comment on that matter without having it examined, and all I can say now is that it will be examined, but there has been no opportunity for me or my Department to check on the rights or wrongs of the story related by the Deputy in this House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, I share the view of the previous speaker in regard to seeing the plant at Galway in full production. <Col N="1531" /> In this business, as I said on more than one occasion, the fatal weakness is on the catching side.  Until the catching side of the industry is built up, we cannot hope to make the progress that is naturally desirable.  We are at the moment building for the future, irrespective of what has happened in the past.</P>
    <P>It is essential for us to attract young men into the industry and to attract trained skippers and trained fishermen to man the boats that will be produced in the future by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Indeed, the way that matter was administered, giving valuable boats to possibly inexperienced fishermen, was not a good way.  It is essential, in order to build up the catching side of the industry, that we get these trainees, and that we will have these skippers and fishermen experienced in their trade to man the new boats, that will be produced, to man the old boats and the new.</P>
    <P>While it is true that, on the question of policy, the Government have decided to construct these new fishery harbours with all the facilities of modern fishery harbours, it is equally true to say that by the time these harbour facilities are ready, we must have boats and fishermen to utilise them.  It is there that the vital weak link in the whole chain of business lies.  It is in that connection that I appeal to Deputies to encourage young people to take advantage of what, to my mind, are the very generous terms provided for trainees, under the new schemes.</P>
    <P>These young boys will be paid, as I have said, £4 per week while they are trainees and will ultimately qualify for boats under An Bord Iascaigh Mhara. That is the aim and just as we had to build up our training service in forestry, I consider it is essential in this business that we build up our own training service here, so that we will be turning out experienced and skilled young men to man the boats in order to increase the landings of our fish.</P>
    <P>I agree with whatever has been said here to the effect that much more must be done to rehabilitate this industry.  It is a competitive industry but it has great rewards.  Some of our present <Col N="1532" /> fishermen have benefited by their returns.  It can be, financially, a very rewarding life and give very profitable results.  At all events, it is quite apparent that as in every other field of development, the people must be skilled and trained for the business. The successful skipper is invariably the man who is not only prepared to work hard but who knows his line of country and knows his business.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason, in addition to building up these ports and providing at these ports every modern facility provided in fishing ports abroad, that we hope it will be the foundation of the new Irish fishing industry and the basis of its expansion.  We have been studying the most suitable type of craft for our waters.  While things have changed in other types of business, so also have they changed in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The day is gone, if we are to make national progress in this field, when we should think in terms of the way fishermen thought 20 or 50 years ago. The day is gone when we can expect the same methods to work and the same craft to work as worked years ago.  It has become more and more of a specialised business.  The waters around our coast are being exploited by people from other lands who are possibly better geared than our people are and who are certainly more skilled.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this industry can be rapidly expanded provided we have the harbours, proper craft and skilled men to man these craft, which, in my opinion, goes to the very root of the building up and expanding of our industry.</P>
    <P>I shall not go over the ground in relation to these three trawlers which have occupied the time of this House for so long.  Indeed, we have been listening to stories about these trawlers for a good number of years.  I dealt with that on another occasion.  I understand that Deputy T. Lynch devoted a considerable part of his speech to these three trawlers.</P>
    <P>I said before, and I repeat now, that a main contributing factor to the failure of these three trawlers was the fact that in this House they were made a political football, which was kicked <Col N="1533" /> around for years, with the result that it was ultimately impossible to get a crew to sail in some of them.  They were not in operation for the first couple of months since I came to this Department.  Whatever was the original decision about the purchase of these trawlers, the fact remains, in my view, that they did not get a fair chance to prove or to disprove themselves due to the fact that they became the subject of debate week in, week out and year in, year out, in this House and even up to the present day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the three never fished together.  There was always one out for repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I came to this Department, there was one tied up practically all the time for lack of crew because the impression was created in this House over many debates that it was unsafe to go out in any of them. No fisherman was prepared evidently to sign articles on at least one or two of them.  That was part of the torpedoing, as Deputy Lynch put it, of these trawlers that occurred in the many debates in this House.</P>
      <P>Neither will I comment this evening on the reasons for the fact that the Galway plant has not been in full production.  Everybody knows that a fish processing plant cannot operate without supplies.  Unfortunately, there was a change of Government and a change of policy, and boats that were to be allocated to Galway Bay were scattered everywhere around the coast. The result was that a sufficient number of boats were not fishing into Galway Bay to keep this plant in full production. I hope, as I have already said, that we will see this plant in full production and that the catches off the western coast &mdash; now that the emphasis is on Galway in my new fishery plan&mdash; will consistently increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Galway Bay trawlers will not supply the plant because of the prices offered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That complaint was never made to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No such complaint was made to me.  The fact of the matter is that sufficient fish are not being caught and the boats that were to go to Galway and Aran were diverted to other parts of the coast.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan suggested there was some lack of policy, or something queer, in leasing the factory in Donegal to Danish interests.  That, whether it is due to misunderstanding or whether it is deliberate misrepresentation; is indicative of some of the woolly thinking that goes on about these matters.  The factory in Donegal was owned by private interests.  It was like any other factory started by private interests in any part of the country. That factory failed.  It is not for me to speculate as to the reasons for its failure but it was a purely private concern.</P>
      <P>In that factory was some of the most modern machinery of any fish-processing plant in the whole of Western Europe.  When the factory went into liquidation and was being sold by the liquidator, I was anxious that not alone should the factory not close down but that the valuable machinery in it should not be bought for scrap and exported.  I authorised Bord Iascaigh Mhara to come into the market and endeavour to purchase that factory in the interests of the fishing industry as a whole.  That was done by the Board, but it was done on express instructions from me that they were not to operate the plant themselves.  I wanted to get private interests to take a lease of that factory and run it in the interests of the fishing industry as a whole.  That has been done.  If I had not done that and if the Government had not moved to hold that factory in the interests of the industry, I should like to know what would have been said here by some people, people like Deputy O'Donnell, who realises what a tremendous advantage that factory can be to the fishermen in County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plant has, I am glad to say, been leased to a firm with international experience and know-how.  They have been allowed to take in a couple of boats to supplement the landings of the local fishermen, and they on their part, <Col N="1535" /> have promised to make available to my Department the experience they gain in fishing around our coast.  They would be fully satisfied to leave their boats at home if they could be assured of a sufficient output from the local fishermen to keep the plant going.  I have no doubt that not alone the Donegal fishermen but the entire industry will benefit from the exploratory fishing they will have to carry out in waters not usually fished by our own fishermen. That is the type of development I welcome. Developments of this kind, which give our people the know-how of gear with which they are unfamiliar and which entail the exploration of deep-sea waters, will doubtless be of tremendous benefit to us in realising our aim of building up an expanding and successful national fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch complained about the writing off of losses incurred on boats and asked if the men who did not meet their commitments were allowed to keep their boats.  The answer is &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  There are always losses when boats are resumed, and that is the main reason for the write-off.  The depreciation, when the boat is resumed because a skipper is in arrears with his instalments, is very considerable.  These boats have to be given to other people and, in some cases, sold at a loss.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that some of these people have been so much in arrears with their hire purchase payments that the boats and gear had to be resumed. Going through the different cases, I find it difficult to generalise.  I have found that fishing out of the same port, you have one man making an excellent profit and another doing very badly. It is the same, I suppose, as in any other field of endeavour.  You get a good man and a bad man on the job, and it is the good man who invariably succeeds.  At all events, I am convinced it was bad policy to give these boats to people who had not the requisite training now considered essential to successful operation.  We hope, with the build-up of our training scheme and the provision of additional fishery services, to cure that fundamental weakness in the whole structure of the business.</P>
    <P>I have given the House the particulars <Col N="1536" /> about fish farms and the experience we have gained in that field. There is no doubt that fish farming can be successfully carried on here, and has been and is being successfully carried on here.  There are many parts of our coast eminently suitable for this work.  One of the problems in time will be the marketing of the end product. As Deputies know, the home market is very limited.  For that reason, I welcome the recent development in Kerry where outside interests have started a business.</P>
    <P>One of the main attractions of such a development is that such people, in addition to know-how, have established markets with established selling organisations across the world.  It has been proved that we can efficiently and successfully produce what we might call artificial fish, those produced on fish farms.  It is another matter to sell successfully the output of these farms and that is why I said in my opening statement that there might be a difficulty in marketing and that we must be careful of the extent to which this new business is being developed.  We must ensure that markets will be there for the fish farms that we have.</P>
    <P>As regards development of the major fishery harbours to which I have referred, I have said that I have been pressing those responsible to get on with the job as quickly as possible. The money is provided for the work. I should like Deputies to appreciate that in a number of these major jobs, borings have to be made and in some cases models have to be built.  When you deal with questions of tides, shifting sands and so on, this is necessary before the actual work commences.  I want to assure the House that everything possible is being done to expedite this work.</P>
    <P>One matter we came up against was the fact that the Board of Works was not geared for this work.  There was a grave shortage of people skilled in engineering and a number of them had to be recruited.  From the latest inquiries, I understand that substantial progress has been made towards building up the staff necessary for the essential preliminary work.  So far <Col N="1537" /> as the Department concerned is responsible for going ahead with the job, I have been assured, as the Minister in charge of Fisheries, that they will do everything in their power, immediately they have themselves geared for the work, to make rapid progress.</P>
    <P>Every aspect of the fishing industry is under examination by me and the Fisheries Division.  We know our aim and we are examining the position of the industry from the marketing side to the catching side and we are satisfied that long before these harbours are ready, we can and will have the fishing policy understood by all and we expect to have the help of all in developing the industry to the extent to which I am convinced it can be developed.</P>
    <P>I shall not waste time dealing with what happened under the old Sea Fisheries Association, predecessors of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  It is true that if mistakes were made here, many mistakes were made elsewhere also.  I am more inclined to set out to build anew, so as to get the country to take a new interest in the expansion of this industry.  We have the advantage that we can learn now not alone from the mistakes made here but from the mistakes made abroad.  We can learn from the new techniques that have been evolved abroad, particularly by countries engaged to a very great extent in fishing as part of their economy. Starting out as we are now doing from what I might call the ground floor, it may well be that it will prove profitable in the rapid expansion of the industry in the long run.  I shall expect the co-operation of Deputies, and I believe I shall get it, in expanding the Irish fishing industry to the extent to which every good Irishman would wish so that it will probably be one of our greatest industries, next to agriculture.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister two questions?  I am anxious to know if the Minister has any statement to make in connection with the boat-building industry.  He made no reference to it in his speech, although <Col N="1538" /> the Board have boat-building yards at Baltimore, Meevagh and Killybegs.  I should like to know what orders the boatyards have on hands; whether there is a shortage of work; whether they are working to full capacity; or what is the position of the boat-building industry generally.  Secondly, I should like to know if it is part of Government policy to provide grants to enable fishermen to purchase boats?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister comment on the figures referred to in his speech which showed that there was a reduction in the number of men engaged in inshore fishing in 1960, compared with 1959, while at the same time, there was an increase of 22 in the number of boats?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The boat building industry operated by the State is getting geared to build a different type of boat from those regularly provided by the Board in recent times.  Some of the boat-building yards have found that there was not the same demand for the type and size of boat they were formerly turning out.  We hope to have them geared to turn out what has now been recommended to me by the technical men as being the more suitable type that I referred to in my opening speech.  The ordinary schemes for providing what I call lobster boats and the smaller type of craft are still being carried on in these yards as hitherto.  My information is that the Board's boatyards are fully occupied but that they have considerable difficulty in getting and retaining staff. There are grants, of course, of 15 per cent. already available.  These are being continued but the whole question of grants and the question of financing the industry is under review by me at the moment.</P>

The Constitution states that a person who wishes to have himself nominated must be nominated by 20 members of the Oireachtas.  No man can get those nominations, unless he is sponsored by either the Government Party or the main Opposition Party. Likewise, the Constitution states that a person may be nominated by four county councils.  All county councils are dominated by the two main political Parties.  Two-thirds of the membership of every county council is constituted of members of the Government and the Opposition and these groups will not allow anyone to be nominated against their own nominees.</P>

Half the time, when I might be tempted to get up.  I cannot do so because I am not clear as to what has been said.  Half the time I get the first bit, but not the second bit. It is a shame that we should lack amenities in this House.  I was in the Senate Chamber in Northern Ireland recently.  It would fit into this Chamber four times.  There is amplification there and there is amplification in the Northern Commons.  There is Commons.  There is amplification in amplification in the House of <Col N="1542" /> all the churches.  A few moments ago, the Minister for Lands had to cock his ears in order to hear what was being said.  Suppose we were all sitting here chatting.  At Question Time, I do not hear half the things the Taoiseach says.  After he has made the first few remarks, everyone starts to talk.  It dies down again later.  The time has come when we should have proper amenities so that everybody will know what is being said.</P>

      <P>I want to raise one question in relation to the staff.  There are certain members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who had service with earlier Dála and that service has not been taken into account in relation to permanent establishment.  They were unestablished first.  When they became established, the earlier service was not taken fully into account.  There is a very special case to be made for such personnel.  The Minister may ask, quite fairly, why I did not deal with that matter when I was on that side of the House.  It is only since I went out of office that I ascertained this hardship was in existence.  It is not a matter with which the Minister can deal off the cuff.  I am not suggesting he can but I would ask him to look into it to see if anything can be done, because there is a special case in this instance apart from the general Civil Service position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Houses of the Oireachtas, including certain Allowances and Grants-in-Aid.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate covers allowances for certain Deputies and Senators.  The House will recollect that last year we passed the contributory scheme which applies to both present and future members of the Dáil and Seanad.  That, however, drew attention to the fact that there are some people of advanced age who gave long service to the Dáil and Seanad and who are now in poor circumstances. A plea for those people was made to me by members of all Parties in both Houses when we were putting that Bill through and afterwards and, as a result of my meeting with representatives of the two Houses who were taking an interest in this matter and who had gone into it in great detail, they made certain recommendations to me which I have accepted practically in full in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>The scheme will apply to those ex-Deputies and ex-Senators who have served in either House of the Oireachtas for at least ten years and whose membership ended before the 1st May, 1960.  That of course means membership ended before the contributory scheme came into operation.  They must also have reached 60 years of age.  The general idea is that if they have means exceeding £350 a year they are not considered.  If they have no means they are entitled to a maximum of £350, while, if they have some means, it will be a sum in between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> I wish to mention the names of the Members who worked on this scheme.  It is well Deputies should know I have taken recommendations from a Committee composed of Senator Michael Hayes, Senator Ted O'Sullivan and Deputy Thomas A. Kyne.  They have examined the applications they thought should be considered so far.  There may be others but applications should come from those people when they hear there is such a scheme in operation.</P>
    <P>I am advised legally this can be brought into operation for this year by a supplementary estimate provided there is the intention to make the matter right by legislation as soon as an opportunity offers.  There may be an opportunity in the Superannuation Bill that is coming along in the next session of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the present Members are covered by the contributory scheme.  As the number who retired before that will be a dwindling number, it is only to be expected that the amount to be provided will be less as the years go by.  I have been advised by the Committee that £2,000 will probably cover the Estimate for this year and I am asking the Dáil to vote that amount.  I should say my intention is not to accept anybody not recommended by the Committee, not to give more than is recommended by the Committee in any case, but to reserve the right to give less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very small matter which deserves the sympathy of the House.  Though it will be a diminishing sum every year it can be fairly described as once-for-all principle because the contributory pension arrangements made subsequently will cover all other cases.  The people concerned, in certain instances at any rate&mdash;I am not quite sure of the names&mdash;played a vital part in the building up of this Dáil.  I do not wish to mention any names in particular but the Dáil could never have functioned without the immense amount of work a certain Member put into it.  If it were not for his assiduous application to the business of the House and the fact that he <Col N="1545" /> gave the best years of his life to the service of the House I do not think this Dáil would have functioned properly. He does not belong to my Party but, at the same time, it is only right and proper that that tribute should be paid to him.  He is a very old man now, 89 years of age, as well as I can remember.  As regards those people who did give service of that sort in the early years, particularly on the establishment of this House when we were going through the formative period, it was only right we should see they are able at least to exist in their old age.</P>

When we were dealing with the contributory scheme, I pointed out to the Minister that there was the case of the person who might be over 60 years of age, having served this House for 7, 8 or 9 years, and who might fail to be re-elected.  Not only does he receive nothing but he loses all his contributions.  Would the Minister not include that kind of case in the proposal now before the House?  If such a person is defeated in an election he may be in great need.  Would the Minister consider such a case?</P>

      <P>As regards the question put by Deputy Corish, I certainly would not agree, and I am sure no Minister would agree, to expenditure on a machine like that unless it was going to create a very big economy.  Obviously, he would not spend, let us say, exactly as much as it would save in labour.  Also, of course, we must have regard to efficiency, perhaps getting a thing out quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The work is increasing, of course, in the various Departments, as the Deputy is aware, and there were about three or four bodies added on &mdash; An Bord Gráin, An Forus Talúntais, the Agricultural Institute, Bord Gaeltarra Éireann, Shannon Development Company and the Broadcasting Authority. These have all been added on in the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of all these statutory Boards, the Board concerned charges in its accounts and pays a fee to the Comptroller and Auditor General for so acting and, in fact, that is how the appropriations in Subhead C. arise on the Vote.  With the possible exception of the Agricultural Institute&mdash;I am not sure about that &mdash; but certainly in respect of Bord Gaeltarra Éireann and the other State companies, the Boards pay the Comptroller and Auditor General in exactly the same way as they would pay an outside auditor and the amount of such payment comes in as an appropriation under Subhead C.  Therefore, I am afraid I cannot accept the Minister's suggestion that that is the sole cause of the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Agricultural Institute might not be charged. For the amount of work that is involved in those two the additional staff would not be necessary.  Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition pointed out that the accounts of Gaeltarra Éireann showed a figure of £17,000 as audited and the Directors' Report, which auditors always verify also, showed a figure of only £14,000.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht had to admit that there was something wrong and that he would have to take it back and look for an explanation.  It is <Col N="1549" /> rather ironic on the following day, to look for more money on the Vote for the Comptroller and Auditor General. There must be some other explanation than that given by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The work would increase in the first year but the fees might not come in in the first year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a time lag in payment, I will accept that explanation but I want to put this again and again and I will keep on putting it every year from this side of the House and, when I get across to the other side of the House, we will see what other arrangements we can make.  The functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to the expenditure of public moneys are to verify expenditure and ensure that that expenditure is verified to be within the scope of the various Votes.  It is a purely administrative check of that sort, and a very proper and necessary one.  The auditor of a public company, however, is supposed to do very much more than that.  He is supposed to carry out the audit for the purpose of verification of accounts, admittedly on slightly different principles but in the same way as the Comptroller and Auditor General does in relation to public expenditure, but he has, in addition, the duty of seeing how administrative improvements can be made and he can point to the commercial experience of other similar concerns with which he is connected. There is advisory service given by an auditor who is accustomed to auditing other commercial concerns. Every time we put a State trading company into the hands of the Comptroller and Auditor General we get an accurate &mdash; I am not suggesting otherwise &mdash; an honest &mdash; I am not suggesting otherwise &mdash; and as helpful as possible audit but we do not get the broad leaven of commercial experience.  The companies concerned should not be deprived of that broad leaven of commercial experience merely for the purpose of, perhaps, being able to get the audit carried through slightly more cheaply by availing of the services contained in Vote No. 5.  It may be slightly cheaper but to deprive those companies <Col N="1550" /> of the commercial experience that would otherwise be available to them through their audit is penny wise and pound foolish.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the case which has just been made by Deputy Sweetman and point out that there is a further aspect of this matter, namely, that many of the bigger industries in this country are in fact State-sponsored bodies.  If the practising chartered accountants are to be deprived of this work, which is their proper field, an injustice will be done to the accountancy profession. I would ask the Minister if any review of this matter has been made in his Department during the year, if any representations have been received from any of the professional bodies concerned, and if so, to what effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>It appears to me that the Auditor General must have experienced auditors on his staff who are capable of giving very good advice, even to commercial companies.  There are a number of commercial companies indeed being audited by his office now and if he has certain auditors on that work, they have great experience, as much experience as any auditor in the city.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister please explain exactly how appropriation-in-aid M arises?  There seems to be an increase of approximately £10,000 estimated for this year.  Of that £10,000, a small amount is in respect of additional attendances but whether that means special attendances at customs posts, I am not quite sure.  The appropriation-in-aid is up by some £10,000 this year.</P>

      <P>A sum of £3,000 is in respect of special attendances &mdash; special attendances at customs posts at late hours?  That is No. one.  As to No. two, why do we anticipate an increase of very nearly £50,000 in fines and forfeitures? That is No. 4 of Subhead M. What exactly is the significance of more than doubling the receipts from the Social Insurance Fund?  It does seem rather unusual that the appropriations-in-aid are moving in the other direction from the main expenditure.  In the normal course, both go up and down in parallel lines but on this occasion it seems to me unusual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a question which has come up several times during the past couple of years in the House by way of Parliamentary Question: the tightening up of customs regulations effected at Dublin Airport. There have been many complaints of discourtesy and of over-rigorous examination of passengers by the customs authorities.  I would suggest to the Minister that an excess of zeal has been shown by some of the staff at Dublin Airport and perhaps at other points of entry into the country.  I think it is a fact that a concession is given to Irish citizens coming from England so that they are permitted to bring in up to £5 worth of personal apparel, provided they declare such goods to the customs authorities.  I could tell the Minister of cases where £2 or £3 worth of stuff was taken from passengers because they attempted to smuggle it &mdash;quite unnecessarily, for if they had been aware of their concessionary <Col N="1552" /> right, they would have declared it and had no trouble whatever.  I previously made a very simple suggestion to the Minister that a notice should be put up in all customs halls saying that if passengers declare personal apparel worth up to £5, they will be permitted to take these goods in.  I have known of small petty seizures of goods from the public which have caused anger, resentment and indeed considerable embarrassment to many people.  In two or three cases, or perhaps more, goods purchased in this country were in fact seized from passengers, the customs authorities alleging that the goods were bought abroad.  For many years, the reputation of our customs authorities for courtesy has been without parallel but unfortunately that tradition has been departed from.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter.  The Minister may recall that last Christmas I addressed a number of questions to him on permitting the entry of Christmas presents sent by Irish people in England to their friends and relations, children perhaps, in this country.  Apparently it proved absolutely impossible to devise a system whereby such gifts could be admitted into the country without any restrictions whatever.  I think it reprehensible that the Minister's officials should play the role of Scrooge at Christmas time.  We must face up to the fact that the parents of many Irish children work in Britain and they are morally and equitably entitled to send the traditional type of Christmas gift to their children and it is deplorable that any action by any State body should interfere with that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past few days, Deputies have received representations from the Income Tax Collectors' Association. The Minister must be aware that income tax collectors are seriously perturbed about developments in the administration of taxes &mdash; they feel their position may be jeopardised.  They are not established civil servants, although it is a fact that the State has no more loyal body of servants than income tax collectors.  A very strong case, I think, can be made for establishing them and giving them <Col N="1553" /> superannuation rights and I would ask the Minister to look into that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is altogether right that visitors coming in are entitled to bring £5 worth of goods free of duty.  I do not think that is granted in all cases.  I think there is a rule that a customs officer may allow £5 worth of goods to come in for children, or if they were clothes or something like that, but on the other hand, if a person were to bring in two bottles of brandy, I am quite sure he would have to pay, that they would not be allowed through.  In other words, it all depends on what the goods are.  If the goods are needed for a man's children or for his wife, they are allowed through, but it is not possible to put up a notice saying we will allow £5 worth through without duty.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman raised a question with regard to Subhead M.3.  That refers to money we receive from merchants and so on for the attendance of officials at their premises.  We made an estimate for 1961 of £37,000 and we actually got £45,000.  Therefore, I think we are justified in estimating £40,000 this year.  Under Subhead M.4&mdash;Fines and Forfeitures&mdash;we estimated £11,000 last year and actually got £25,000, so I think we are justified in estimating £15,000 this year.</P>

      <P>The Minister of the Department requiring this money asks the Minister for Finance for it, and if the Minister for Finance countersigns it, the money is then paid over to the Department, so the person who is asking for the money in the Department, whether he is head of the Garda Síochána or head of the Army, at least has to satisfy two Ministers that he needs it.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the Estimate which provides for the law services of the Government and it is the Estimate therefore, upon which it is proper to consider whether the Government have carried out their duties in an appropriate manner.  I want to make it perfectly clear that so far as I am concerned the failure in this regard is a failure that I consider should be laid at the door of the Government rather than at the door of any individual officer concerned.  It is the Taoiseach, and the Taoiseach alone, who has the right under the Constitution to appoint the Attorney General. Of course, to that extent the Minister here as the accounting Minister is speaking not as a member of the Government but for the Taoiseach himself. The Taoiseach when he was appointing the Attorney General had the duty of laying down the appropriate conditions under which whoever was going to be Attorney General should take office on the one hand, and on the other hand of making a choice of a person suitable to carry on the business of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say &ldquo;a person suitable to carry on the business of the Attorney General&rdquo; because no matter how competent a lawyer may be in certain branches of law, it does not follow at all that his <i>métier</i> under whose aspects is the particular type of law necessary for the due performance of the Department that is being considered under this Vote.  As everyone knows, we live in an age of specialisation and a good chancery lawyer may not be a good criminal lawyer.  A good common law lawyer might not be a good chancery lawyer, but the fact is, as we know, there are certain things in respect of which this Department are primarily concerned.  They are primarily concerned with the duty of ensuring that the Government operate within the Constitution on the one hand and, on <Col N="1560" /> the other hand, that the Government as the Executive bring to the Judiciary, and place before the Judiciary in proper form, the various necessary facts in respect of which our courts have to pronounce a judgment.</P>
    <P>If therefore, a person is selected by the Taoiseach, no matter what may be his qualifications in other branches, if he is not particularly accustomed to or experienced in those two branches of the law&mdash;and not everybody can be experienced in every aspect of law&mdash; if the Taoiseach chooses that person, someone who is not experienced in those aspects, then the blame must be laid at the door of the Taoiseach and at the door of no one else.</P>
    <P>In the particular cases to which I want to refer two matters arise.  In one case, which is being canvassed regularly in this House already, the question arises in respect of the conditions which the Taoiseach laid down when he was appointing the Attorney General.  I want to make it clear beyond question that I am not offering a view on either side as to whether it is right or proper for the Attorney General to carry on private practice.  I have my own views on that; other people in different Parties have different views but I am not challenging in any way&mdash;far from it&mdash; the right or the propriety of the Taoiseach to provide that the Attorney General when he was appointing him, would be entitled to carry on private practice.  But I do say and I say it without fear of contradiction, that the Taoiseach when he was making that appointment should have laid down that if the Attorney General was engaged in private practice, and if he was permitting him to engage in private practice&mdash;as he did&mdash;it must be private practice that could not in any way conflict with his duty as the chief law officer of the Government.</P>
    <P>In the recent insurance case&mdash;and again I am passing no comment whatever on the <i>bona fides</i> of either of the parties, the plaintiff or the insurance company in that case&mdash;it was perfectly clear to anyone who looked at it, and it should have been perfectly clear at a very early date, that a person acting on behalf of the insurance company, the defendant in that <Col N="1561" /> case, might have to defend at a later date a claim under the Insurance Act, that the company concerned was acting in breach of the provisions laid down in the Insurance Act, 1936.  It is perfectly clear, and should have been perfectly clear to anyone at a very early stage, and certainly as soon as the briefs were delivered, that in that case there was a definite conflict of interests between the chief law officer of the Government, on the one hand, and those concerned for the insurance company on the other because a breach of the Insurance Act, 1936, was involved and it might &mdash;not necessarily&mdash;be the duty of the chief Law Officer of the Government to prosecute.  There was more than a probability that the chief Law Officer of the Government would be called upon to offer an opinion as to whether the facts disclosed in that case did or did not justify action by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Insurance Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>No man can serve two masters.  The person who, in the ultimate result, would have to act as the chief adviser to the Department of Industry and Commerce should never have been permitted by the Taoiseach&mdash;and it is the Taoiseach I blame&mdash;to act in a case in which he would appear for the defendant when it was clear on the face of it that there had been a breach of the Act of 1936.</P>
    <P>As I said, I make no suggestion impugning the <i>bona fides</i> of the plaintiff or the defendant in that case.  I am just making it clear that the facts were such that the question was bound to come up for decision as to whether it was incumbent on the Executive, in the person of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, through the chief Law Officer to the Government, to take action.  In those circumstances it was highly improper for the Taoiseach not to have laid down conditions when he was making the appointment that would prevent any possibility of that happening.</P>
    <P>The second matter to which I want to refer is in respect of a recent trial. I want to make it clear beyond question that I am making no comment of any sort, kind or description in respect <Col N="1562" /> of the charges for which the Court of Criminal Appeal has directed that Dr. Singer should again be arraigned before a judge and jury in respect of some £2,500.  My comments have nothing whatever to do with those five charges that are <i>sub judice</i> and for that reason I do not wish to refer to them.</P>
    <P>The fact is, however, that, leaving those charges aside, the whole history of the Shanahan legal actions on behalf of the State has caused the very greatest public uneasiness.  The public are gravely concerned to know why it is that the legal formulae on foot of which a person should be arraigned in respect of sums covering £796,514 were so badly framed that the court was not allowed to express its verdict. To say that there is public uneasinesss in this matter is putting it in the mildest form.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows it is the duty of the Executive, as the guardian of the public interest, to bring matters, about which it considers there is a case, before the courts in proper legal form. I think it is accepted also that once they are brought in proper legal form before the courts it is for the courts, and the courts alone, to decide on the the facts whether the charges are justified.</P>
    <P>I certainly shall not offer any comment in this House as to whether the charges were justified.  I think it would be a very bad precedent if we were to try a case here in Dáil Éireann.  My comment is purely related to the fact, and unfortunately it is a fact, that the Executive so failed in their duty to bring the charges before the courts in the proper legal form that the courts have been unable to give an effective judgment in respect of them.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition asked on two occasions for the judgment on the Singer case to be placed in the Library.  It has not yet been placed there.  Again, I want to make it clear that I am mentioning that purely to show that I have to rely on newspaper reports because the Judgment is not yet in the Library.  I do not think any fault is attributable to the Taoiseach for the delay.  It is just in the ordinary, shall I say, nature of the methods of the courts administration.  I am not <Col N="1563" /> making any charge, so to speak, against the Taoiseach for having failed to put it there.  I think he is trying to put it there at the earliest opportunity but it has not got there and I have to refer to the newspapers.</P>
    <P>I understand just now from the Leader of the Opposition that he has received a letter this afternoon from the Taoiseach saying he is having the judgment copied and that it will be put in the Library to-morrow.  Unfortunately, I shall not have the opportunity of reading it before this Estimate is concluded.  The fact, from the newspaper accounts and from the accounts of those who were listening to the Court of Criminal Appeal giving their judgment, is that the Court of Criminal Appeal decided, in relation to charges covering £796,000, that the Department presided over by the nominee of the Taoiseach had failed to put the indictment in the proper form, had failed to put the charges, to use a commonplace word, in the ordinary manner of the appropriate legal formulae.  The fact that the indictments were incorrect and that because they were incorrect, the court was not able to come to a proper conclusion, to an effective conclusion, in respect of these charges covering over £750,000, surely lays on the Taoiseach, on the Government and on all concerned a very serious degree of blame, and one requiring a most serious explanation.</P>
    <P>As I say, this is the last of the series of botches that have been made in relation to this case.  It is not for me or for this House to say whether, if the indictments had been properly framed by and on behalf of the Government, there would have been a conviction or there would not.  That matter does not arise.  What does arise is the fact that the courts have not been given and can never be given an opportunity of judging this, perhaps the most serious matter in point of money that was ever brought before the courts since they were established here 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>The Government must be aware, as we are aware on these benches, of the very grave public uneasiness <Col N="1564" /> in relation to these matters, public uneasiness which has been growing because of the unnecessary cost that had been put upon the taxpayer in other cases such as the Electoral Bill, public uneasiness because it has become a commonplace for the Executive not to be beaten on the facts&mdash;anyone can understand that&mdash;but to be beaten because the appropriate facts have not been put in proper form before the court to enable the court fairly&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;fairly&rdquo; as meaning fairly in the proper judgment of the court&mdash; to come to its decision.</P>
    <P>The last one, as I say, is that judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal given on 23rd June, and it is a matter that is quite deplorable that the Executive should have failed to ensure that the court was free to come to its verdict on the facts properly presented, with an indictment made according to proper form, filed and put forward in the ordinary way that has been drawn up over the years to ensure that as between prosecution and defence, there is complete fairness and that every prisoner will get a fair trial, while at the same time the public interest represented by the Attorney General will put the facts appropriately before the court.  That the Government have failed to do, and because of that, because of the sum of over £750,000 involved, a very serious responsibility rests on the Taoiseach as the person who made the appointment and who laid down the conditions under which it was to be held.</P>

My recollection is that when the case was first rejected on appeal, there was practically equal division of high legal opinion on whether it was right or wrong.  I am not saying any more than that.  Secondly, in the case of the last Criminal Appeal Court, I do not know <Col N="1565" /> how he personally could be blamed in that particular case if long afterwards it was discovered that a person was on the jury who might have been prejudiced.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise a question which I endeavoured to raise earlier.  This Estimate covers bounties for triplets and centenarians.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us on that also?  These bounties to mothers of triplets and to centenarians are provided from public funds.  On each occasion on which a mother gives birth to triplets, she is the recipient of a letter of congratulation from the President, which is accompanied by a cheque.  On the occasion of a person reaching the age of 100 years, which happens to very few of us, a letter of good wishes is sent by the President and there is a cheque for £5 enclosed.</P>
      <P>I have endeavoured in the past to make an inquiry with regard to the giving of a few pounds on these occasions.  First, may I say that the family of the person lucky enough to reach the age of 100 years, when he receives a letter either from the past President or from President de Valera offering congratulations and also receives a cheque for £5, is inclined to express the opinion: &ldquo;There is the President putting his hand into his own pocket and giving us a present of a £5 note.&rdquo;  It is only right to make it clear for the public records that this cheque is not out of the President's pocket.  That is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important in that this is public money provided by this House.  Many years ago, when a person, reaching the age of 100 years, received £5, the £5 note was worth something.  The £5 note which was sent to such a person in 1932 is now equal to about 38/6 by present day values.  Whilst everything has increased, there is no question whatever of increasing the bounty given to a person who reaches 100 years of age or the mother of triplets. They do not seem to be given any increase in the bounty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first time this matter has been raised in this House.  I raise it for the purpose of putting it to the Minister for Finance who pays the Bill&mdash; it is not the President&mdash;that he should increase the bounty in relation to a person who celebrates his 100th birthday to at least £20.  I feel that this is worthy of consideration by the House. Little can be purchased for a £5 note <Col N="1567" /> nowadays.  The £5 note was quite an unusual bounty to receive 20 or 30 years ago.  If a bounty is to be given to the mother of triplets or a person who celebrates his 100th birthday, it ought to be a bounty which will be appreciated.  It should be of such amount that the person who receives it can buy something in the nature of a reasonably good gift.  I feel that the bounty of £5 is an unreasonable one.</P>
    <P>I raise the matter in the hope that the Minister will give consideration to increasing these bounties.  In every Estimate which has gone through the House, substantial increases have been given all round except in the cases I have mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is about time a voice was raised in this House to complain about the delay in the publication of some of the annual reports of Government Departments and various other recurring documents for which the Stationery Office are <Col N="1569" /> responsible.  The fact is that if these reports were issued by ordinary private companies they would have to be available within a matter of weeks in relation to the termination of a particular year.  This is not the fault of the members of the House.  It is utterly deplorable that these delays should take place.  It may be due to some extent to the fact that the Stationery Office is not getting reports in time from the Departments.  If that is so, it is about time that the Departments speeded up their end of the work.</P>
      <P>We know that long delays arise quite frequently subsequent to the sending of draft reports and that kind of thing to the Stationery Office and by them, to the printers.  Something will have to be done, if Parliamentary democracy is to mean anything and if our discussions are to mean anything, to speed up the publication of these annual reports.</P>
      <P>Another serious delay which is causing grave inconvenience to members of the House and to the public in general is the delay which elapses between the passing of Bills into Acts and the publication of these Acts. It is not good enough for some so-called estimater in the Stationery Office to estimate the public demand which is likely to arise in relation to a particular Act.  Acts should be available within a matter of weeks of their being passed by this House.  They should be available in both texts. Again, something might have to be done there in relation to the Translation Office.  The Stationery Office will have to do something about speeding up their machinery.</P>
      <P>Another matter which is causing serious inconvenience to the public and to professional and cultural interests in this city and country is the inadequacy of the stocks held by the Government Publications Office at the Arcade near the G.P.O.  It may sometimes take a person a week or a fortnight to get some document which is supposed to be available.  We still maintain the theory that ignorance of the law is inexcusable.  Yet any person who attends at the Government Publications Office for the purpose of ascertaining the law by purchasing a copy of it cannot get it in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> The Government Publications Office is supposed to have a stock of maps. It is not an infrequent occurence for people going to the Government Publications Office to procure an ordnance survey map to be told that it will take four days to get a copy from the Phoenix Park.  The President's car coming down empty, as it does on some occasions, could bring down enough maps to stock the office for a year.  Members of the public and tourists have been told in the Government Publications Office that it would take four days to produce the map; that they would have to go to the far end of the Phoenix Park to get a map.</P>
    <P>When complaints are made, there is the usual shrug of the Civil Service shoulder and the reply &ldquo;That is the best we can do.&rdquo;  That is not good enough.  The Government Publications Sales Office is quite a joke for people going to it.  It may be that the other booksellers are not disturbed by this, because many of them can get a book quicker than the Government Publications Sales Office.  But if we want to maintain a Sales Office at public expense in the centre of the city, it is about time some reasonably efficient service were provided.</P>
    <P>I would be happy about voting more money under this head if it meant we would have a speeding-up of the printing of Acts of the Oireachtas and of the recurring reports from Government Departments and semi-Government bodies, for which the Stationery Office is responsible, and if it meant that the Government Publications Sales Office would carry an adequate stock of goods or, if they had not got the required goods in stock, that they would, at least, make them available to members of the general public within 24 hours and not take four days to get from O'Connell Street to the Phoenix Park and back again.</P>

      <P>I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that numerous inquiries have been made to the Government Publications Sales Office concerning the complete volume of the Debate on the Treaty and the records of the First and Second Dáil.  I understand such volumes were out of print some time <Col N="1571" /> ago.  In view of the historic interest in the proceedings of the First and Second Dáil and particularly the interest the public display in having available an accurate record in the form of the complete verbatim report of the debate on the Treaty, I feel these volumes should be available for members of the public who require them.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that a certain number of copies would be available for the public. They are of great historical value and should not be allowed go out of print. While the demand may not be very heavy for them, certain people may require them for historical purposes. The Government Publications Sales Office should have supplies available for such people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's third point about the sending for supplies to the Phoenix Park is entirely unjustified. <Col N="1572" /> The Deputy made a specific complaint here some time ago on that point.  It was revealed to me, and afterwards to the Deputy, that he was promised a supply at the Phoenix Park at 11 o'clock the next morning from the day he made the inquiry.  They were available the next morning.  It was not the Stationery Office's fault if the Deputy did not collect them.</P>

If the Deputy has any sense of fair play, which, of course, we would not expect, and if he walks into the Sales Office and asks for 45 copies of a certain Act, he should know it is more than likely they will not have the 45 copies to hand out.  The order he gave was a very big and exceptional order. They were not able to fulfil it, but they told him they would have the remainder for him at 11 o'clock the next morning.</P>

I think the problem is one associated with the labour of translation.  In any case, I want to suggest to the Minister that he might consider a way out of the dilemma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act is printed and circulated to Deputies on green paper as the Bill <Col N="1573" /> passed by the Dáil and Seanad.  That green paper has the advantage of having on its face the marginal notes, which very often do not appear on the white Act in permanent form.  I am sure the courts would not be prepared to take judicial notice of the green paper, but it would be of great assistance to practitioners who had to plead the Statute Law in the period between the passage of the Act and the publication of the white version, of which the courts will take judicial notice.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would inquire into the feasibility of printing an additional 100 or 200 copies of the Bill as passed by Oireachtas Éireann so that it would be available to practitioners?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Valuation Office we have another classic example of inordinate delay and of a system which causes serious inconvenience.  There are times during the year when members of the legal profession and of the general public resort to the Valuation Office for the purpose of getting an urgent certificate of valuation.  They are given the rather casual excuse: &ldquo;You will not get that for some time because the valuation books are out.&rdquo;  That is not good enough in a public service.  It should be possible to keep duplicate records. It should be possible for any Government agency to furnish a certificate of valuation on demand and to furnish them at all times with greater speed than they are at present furnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> I appreciate that, if a special case is made, the officials of the Valuation Office most courteously make the certificate available in time, but it should not be necessary to have to make a special case for the production of a certificate or some record document. It should be possible in this modern age of photographic equipment and electrical duplication methods to provide valuation certificates within 24 hours.  I hope something will be done to speed up the issue of all certificates to avoid any inconvenience that might arise in future by offering the excuse that the delay is due to the valuation books being revised.  I cannot understand why duplicate records cannot be kept.</P>

      <P>One hesitates to criticise the very laudable activities of An Chomhairle Ealaíon but there has been not a little comment in the city and the country for some years past that such a large proportion of the money is allocated to subsidise foreign opera in this city.  There was a time when we had our own people who were capable of producing here most excellent grand opera.  I believe that one of the direct and natural results of contributing such a large amount of money to subsidise the bringing over of Italian and other foreigners to perform on our stages is that we are discouraging our own people from developing their singing talents.  If the Comhairle has any purpose to cultivate in our own people these gifts I do not think one cultivates them by subsidising to a large extent foreigners coming over here.  Personally, I want to enjoy grand opera in this city which has such a great tradition in grand opera, but I should much prefer, even though the artistes might not be as excellent or as perfect as some of the Italians who come here, to see our own people performing on the boards.  I am not, for one moment, saying that I think the Italians are better than our own people.  In some cases I cannot see why these foreigners were ever brought here unless it be <Col N="1577" /> because their names ended in &ldquo;i&rdquo; instead of beginning with &ldquo;O&rdquo;.  I believe that is a kind of snobbery which should not be encouraged.  While saying that I wish to make it quite clear to anybody who wishes to misinterpret&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What we are doing I think is encouraging a certain amount of snobbery, encouraging queues to form because we have Italians or others on our stages.  I want to see our own people encouraged and that can best be done by subsidising Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may intervene, I should say that Deputy Ryan is very far from the facts in the statement he has made, no matter how unprejudiced he is.  It is within the knowledge of anybody who knows anything about music, choral singing or opera that you cannot get artistes from a better school than the Italian school.  As one with some experience, I would say that we have not the amount of talent available that is available in Italy but I would go along with Deputy Ryan in saying that we should do more by providing more money for scholarships to send our own singers to places like Italy so that we may do what the Italians are able to do for their young singers and musicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very wrong if it went forth from any side of this House that anybody depreciates, underestimates or undervalues what is being done.  As one coming from the provinces I think that one of the finest cultural efforts coming from the Dublin Grand Opera Society in my time was the presentation of Italian Grand Opera.  I think they have maintained a very high standard and they have not been above giving a chance to any native singer who has reached the required <Col N="1578" /> standard.  As I say, I only wish money could be provided to ensure that scholarships would be given to those who have talent enough to justify educating them to reach that standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has said that this is an autonomous body, but I think all of us would encourage the idea of scholarships being provided to train Irish singers.  Perhaps Deputy Ryan has left the House under the impression that the only music festivals and operas that are produced here with the aid of the Arts Council are Italian or foreign in their constitution.  Many Irish people participate not only in the chorus but as principals.  I do not think the idea should go abroad that the Dublin and Wexford festivals are comprised of Italians.  That is untrue.</P>

      <P>I suppose on the recondite question of art we cannot expect the House to be confined strictly within limits.  I find myself in disagreement with my colleague, Deputy Ryan.  I think the work of the Dublin Grand Opera Society is deserving of the highest praise.  I think the Arts Council in supporting that society correctly interpret the wishes and desires of this House.  As Deputy Corish pointed out, a large proportion of the cast and of the orchestra brought on to the Dublin stage is constituted of Irish musicians and singers. It would be quite illusory to imagine that there is any country in the world to which foreign artistes are not invited from time to time to participate in grand opera.  I have never yet heard it suggested in New York that no one should sing but a Yankee.  I have never heard it suggested in London that no one should sing but a Cockney.  In all the great cities of the world one hears nationals of that country sing; one also hears nationals of every other country &mdash;Greeks, Italians, Germans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  The miracle is that I find myself in substantial agreement with him.  I think it would be a very excellent thing if An Chomhairle Ealaíon could see its way to provide more in the way of scholarships for young artistes in the sphere of art so that they might have access to the great schools of the world from which they would otherwise be excluded for want of means.  I suppose it is true to say that many of the greatest artistes in the world found their destiny as the result of the help they got to enable them to achieve the education necessary in order that they might fully manifest the gifts God gave them.  If there had not been charitable patrons to help them on their way they would never have reached the greatness that was ultimately theirs.  Unfortunately in the world in which we live the old system of patronage whereunder wealthy people helped is changing and it is into the gap that is left that I think An Chomhairle Ealaíon could step with advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned Count John McCormack as one international figure in the sphere of art.  I think of the late Madame Burke Sheridan who was once described by Puccini as the greatest &ldquo;Butterfly&rdquo; that ever sang.  I doubt if she could ever have realised the full potential of her glorious gift if she had not had friends who had confidence in her and who helped her to attend singing schools in Rome and <Col N="1580" /> Milan where the greatness of her gifts was realised and developed.  I think Deputy Healy is right in feeling that it may well be that unrevealed talent exists here today and would remain forever hidden for the want of the opportunity of having that talent trained.  It is not an easy thing to do providently and prudently, but the fact that it is not easy to do providently should not deter the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>They have been given their autonomy.  We have entrusted public money to them on the assumption that they will use it to the best advantage.  They are not subject to the same strict accounting that a Department of State must maintain. It would be inevitable that in a system of scholarships such as we are now considering there would be from time to time individuals sent forward who may not have the promise that was hoped for; but that should not deter us from making the effort in the knowledge that, if we salvage one great gift out of every ten, we will have spent our money well.  I think we could say that even if the other nine did not realise the full measure of our hopes, if we had done them no good we would certainly have done them no harm.  I commend the suggestion to An Chomhairle Ealaíon and I should like to join with others in paying my tribute to the Dublin Grand Opera Society for the work they have been doing, work which I hope they will continue with an ever-growing measure of success.</P>

      <P>I should not like it to be thought that the whole of the financial provision by the Comhairle to the development of music is limited to the Dublin Grand Opera Society.  As set out in their report last year, they give grants to numerous feiseanna, musical societies, bands, and other organisations around the country.  With regard to the Dublin Grand Opera Society, as was said here, there is no grand opera performed anywhere in the world without a subvention from public funds.  I am aware that the Dublin Grand Opera Society, notwithstanding the help they get from An Chomhairle Ealaíon, have <Col N="1581" /> difficulty in paying the costs of the seasons they run here.  I have personal knowledge of that, as I am sure other Deputies have.  It could not be carried on if there were not, in addition to these subventions and the receipts they receive, quite a number of people willing to contribute to the cost.</P>
      <P>I shall certainly bring to the attention of the Comhairle the suggestion regarding scholarships in this field.  I should point out, however, that the amount of money which could be spent&mdash;and I mean spent usefully&mdash; on the development of the Arts is almost without limit.  We have to give a limited appropriation to the Comhairle and ask them to make the best use they can of it.  As they pointed out in their report, they have numerous requests for support, from various organisations for different purposes, which they would have liked to meet but could not within the limit of what is provided.  All I can say is that this year, at least, they have £10,000 more to spend on these purposes than they had last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  For more than a decade now, the need for a variety of ancillary health services of a type which cannot at the moment be readily and conveniently operated by existing statutory bodies has been apparent.  In order to meet it successive Ministers for Health have from time to time arranged for the establishment under the Companies Acts of companies, in most cases limited by guarantee, to operate particular services of this kind.  The usual practice was for the Minister for Health to invite a number of individuals to incorporate a limited company one of the objects of which would be to provide the specified service.  In his invitation the Minister outlined the functions which the proposed company would fulfil and specified particular features of its constitution, including the requisite financial controls, which varied in degree for different companies. These requirements were ultimately incorporated in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company as formed.  The financial controls imposed by the Minister and the reservation to himself of certain powers were warranted by the fact that in general the companies in question are financed wholly or mainly from public moneys or from charges made for their services and are <Col N="1585" /> carrying out important health functions on his behalf and at his instance. The members of each such company and of its Board of Directors were nominated in due course by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The health bodies which have been established in this way and are now operating are the National Blood Transfusion Association, the National Mass-Radiography Association, the National Organisation for Rehabilitation, the Dublin Rheumatism Clinic Association and the Cancer Association of Ireland.  Another health body established under the Companies Acts is the Medical Research Council of Ireland.  Though the majority of its members are not appointed by the Minister, he provides virtually all its income.</P>
      <P>While it is within the letter of the law, the use of the Companies Acts in this way is in my opinion hardly consistent with the purpose which Parliament had in view when the statutes were enacted.  Company law was created to facilitate groups of individuals in forming themselves into corporate entities for industrial and commercial purposes.  The Acts were not intended to meet the case where a Minister of State wished to establish a corporate body to administer under his general supervision a service financed from moneys provided by him.  It is only right, however, to emphasise that the resort to the Companies Acts procedure has, in practice, resulted in the satisfactory establishment and operation of the special health services which I have enumerated.  Some of the special bodies operating these services have had teething troubles in their earlier stages. In the main, however, where these occurred, they were due to a failure to distinguish between the powers reserved by the Minister to himself and the powers of the members.  It is also right to say that in some cases the procedure led to considerable delay in the formal establishment of the services, and, in most cases, to some significant expense which in the future this Bill, if enacted, will obviate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further reason for submitting the proposal in the Bill to the Oireachtas is <Col N="1586" /> that in my view the procedure which has been availed of heretofore to establish these special or ancillary services is scarcely consistent with the responsibility which the Minister has towards the Oireachtas.  There was, of course, a large measure of justification for adopting it when the Department of Health was in the early stages of its development, when the establishment of ancillary services was a rarity, and when so much had to be done quickly that resort to extrastatutory procedures was warranted. On the other hand I am convinced that as our health services expand, and the need for ancillary health organisations, operating outside the statutory health authorities, becomes more manifest, some statutory procedure, other than <i>ad hoc</i> legislation for each particular case, should be laid down.  If this be not done, a Minister for Health could proceed to use the funds under his control to establish a succession of such bodies without the consent and perhaps even without the cognisance of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the enactment of statute after statute to establish a succession of services on a statutory basis, as the need for each arose, would constitute an inordinate demand on the time of the Oireachtas.  I think the difficulty can be resolved if the Minister is given general power to establish such bodies by order, with the proviso that he must submit all orders establishing such bodies to the scrutiny of the Oireachtas.  This in brief is what this Bill proposes to do.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill will give the Minister for Health power to make an order establishing a body to perform functions in, or in relation to, the provision of a health service or two or more health services.  &ldquo;Health service&rdquo; is defined in Section 2 as &ldquo;any service relating to the protection or improvement of the health of the people or the care and treatment of the sick and infirm.&rdquo;  A body so established will be a corporate entity with all the necessary powers to hold land, enter into contracts, employ officers and servants and so on.  The new procedure will be straightforward and inexpensive and it <Col N="1587" /> will have the overriding advantage that its members will be presented with a clear-cut constitution for their body and will know exactly where their powers and responsibilities will begin and end.</P>
    <P>Section 4, to which I would like the House to allow me to move an amendment if we take the Committee Stage this evening, deals with the membership and staffing of a corporate body established under the Bill.  The establishment order setting up the body will define the number of members and the terms and conditions of their appointment. It will also deal with the staffing of the body and may include provisions relating to the conditions of service and the tenure of office of members of the staff.  Two very useful provisions are included in this section.  Under one of them, the machinery of the Local Appointments Commissioners can be used in making appointments to the staff of a corporate body, and under the other, the staff of such a body can be brought within the superannuation code applicable to local officers and servants.  This latter provision will mean that there can be transfers of appropriate staff between such a body and a local authority without loss of any accrued superannuation rights.</P>
    <P>Under Section 5 the Minister will, in an establishment order, be empowered to define the functions of the corporate body, and the manner in which and the conditions under which these may be performed; and it is provided under Section 6 that the establishment order shall include all necessary provisions relating to the administration of the corporate body.</P>
    <P>Section 7 envisages circumstances which might make the dissolution of a corporate body set up under Section 3 desirable.  Such a circumstance might arise if the service for which the body was set up was no longer necessary or if the service had expanded to such an extent that it became appropriate for absorption into the local &ldquo;health authorities&rdquo; administration.  With a view to eventualities such as these, section 7 provides for a wide variety of possibilities in the disposal of the assets of any corporate body which <Col N="1588" /> may be dissolved.  The property, rights and liabilities could be transferred to the Minister, for instance, or to another corporate body established under the Act, or to a local authority, or they might be distributed among a number of local authorities.  Existing contracts could be continued and officers could be transferred to similar posts under appropriate bodies, thus ensuring, where necessary, that the administration of the particular service could be smoothly transferred.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that the Bill will automatically apply to any of the existing companies which I have mentioned. These will retain their present constitutions under the Companies Acts, but they will have power, under Section 8, to transform themselves into corporate bodies under the Act on passing a resolution to that effect.</P>
    <P>The requirement in Section 10 as to the laying of establishment orders before both Houses will ensure that the Oireachtas is fully informed of the establishment, under the provisions of the Bill, of every new body to perform health functions, and as to the provisions relating to the functions and general administration of that body. Under existing procedure there is no obligation on a Minister for Health to bring the formation of new bodies to the notice of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The need for special bodies to provide and to administer on a national or a regional basis particular health services which could not be provided or operated efficiently or economically within the framework of the local government code is now, as I have said, definitely established.  Some of the bodies which have already been set up in the guise of limited companies have been entrusted with the expenditure of considerable sums of public money, and, of necessity, continue to spend such moneys in their day-to-day administration.  The need for such bodies is likely to continue indefinitely as the health services develop, and it is as well to accept the fact that even now they are in effect an integral part of health administration.  Indeed the stage has been reached when there is no justification for continuing to avail <Col N="1589" /> of the Companies Acts for the purpose of giving them corporate existence, and when instead there should be appropriate statutory powers for doing this and establishing them with the cognisance and, at least, the acquiescence of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is in our opinion mainly a machinery Bill and, in the light of the obligation imposed upon the Minister for the time being to bring the establishment order provided for under Section 10 before the Houses of the Oireachtas for consideration, I think the machinery proposed is on the whole reasonable and desirable.  I should like to be fully reassured that I am correct in believing that the existing companies engaged in this kind of work are under no obligation to dissolve themselves, that those of them who desire to convert themselves into statutory bodies such as are provided for in this Bill have facilities to do so.</P>

      <P>We, too, are prepared to support the Bill but I should like very briefly and quickly to ask the Minister a few questions.  I think I am right in assuming from what the Minister has said and from the terms of the Bill that the Minister has power to establish these health bodies.  Will there be any consultation with local authorities as to whether they should be established?  I would not object if the Minister had the power.  I should like to know also whether the Minister can give us any idea what extra costs may be involved either by the State or by local authorities.  Again I would not object to the cost.  I would not object to any extra expense in this good cause, but if the Minister has any idea perhaps he would let us know.  I was also interested in the section which says that the Local Appointments Commission may be used for making appointments and that the Local Government Superannuation <Col N="1590" /> code may be applied to officials of these bodies as if they were local officers and servants.  Could the Minister not be more positive and say that the machinery would be used and that the officials would be so regarded?</P>

      <P>I was suspicious like Deputy Ryan because there is provision only for the introduction of an establishment order in the House, its <Col N="1591" /> approval by the House, and that is the end of it.  If the Minister, however, gives us an assurance, as he seems to have given, that we may ask questions and expect reasonable information, I shall be quite satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret having to throw a spanner in the works of this Bill but I personally am somewhat suspicious of it.  The system that worked before may have been, as the Minister says, somewhat cumbersome and may have caused delays in certain cases, but this Dáil should be very careful of what it does and in effect we are giving the Minister power to set up any sort of ancillary companies and, as I take it from the Minister's reply to Deputy Corish, they will not be under Parliament's control.  It may be argued that the present method of doing things is not satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been rather limited in the information he has given us. What sort of organisations does he intend to set up?  He mentioned the already existing organisations here very fairly I think.  We have the National Blood Transfusion Organisation, the National Mass Radiography Association, the National Rehabilitation Organisation, the Dublin Rheumatism Clinic and so forth and they in my opinion seem to have worked reasonably well.  I do not wish to offer any innuendo whatever against the Minister personally or against any subsequent Ministers, whoever they may be, but I have always had the feeling that we are gradually divesting ourselves of our own powers in this House.  Are we not in this Bill giving the Minister power to set up organisations, place his decision before the Dáil &mdash; I presume there will be a debate on the question generally &mdash; and then he is in complete control of those organisations?  In other words, further bureaucratic control.  I do not like that idea, but if the Minister considered it necessary he should have given the House absolutely definite cases of what organisations he has in view in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also suspicious of his reply to Deputy Corish.  If we are going to give the Minister for Health powers to set <Col N="1592" /> up organisations like these, is he going to be responsible to Dáil Eireann for them?  Will he accept full responsibility? If someone makes a representation to me that such and such an ancillary health body is being administered unsatisfactorily and if I come into Dáil Eireann and ask a question, am I going to get an answer or will I be told that this is a function of the body, that this body has been set up by the Minister and that the Minister has no further concern in it?  Every Deputy must take cognisance of that.</P>
    <P>During the last three or four years many bodies have been set up by this Dáil.  Many Deputies have come in subsequently and tried to get information relative to those bodies and are told that the Minister has no function in the matter.  The body has been established, it is a statutory body and it has therefore its own powers, its own say in matters.  Is that the case or not? I do not like Ministerial control or bureaucratic control, but at least if we come to accept that &mdash; and I have no doubt that it will be the opinion of the majority of Deputies in the House that this is a reasonable Bill and that it is going to go through &mdash; can we come back and assert our rights as Deputies and say: &ldquo;I do not consider that such and such a thing is properly lone&rdquo;?  If we do, will the Minister answer?  If he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to that question, I am satisfied.  Is he going to accept full responsibility for them?  If he is, I am satisfied.  If not, I request that I personally would be recorded as dissenting from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that because of the Taoiseach's appeal to the Tánaiste not to leave him, in view of the tottering fortunes of his Party, the Tánaiste has withdrawn his proposed retirement from public life.  Those of us here in this House who are not as experienced as he, have a great deal to learn from him.  The perfect example of what we can learn is how to dodge the issue and confuse a person deliberately by using the de Valera technique of not denying or confirming and using the escape route which the Minister used when Deputy Corish asked the very proper question: when these new bodies are established, will <Col N="1593" /> they be open to question in this House?  The Tánaiste simply replied: &ldquo;At least they will be more open to question than the bodies set up under the old system.&rdquo;  That did not indicate to my mind that there will be room to criticise them.  There will be no opportunity to criticise them except in so far as one might criticise the Minister's action in setting them up.</P>
      <P>I feel that under this Bill, we will establish bodies which are not the natural result of voluntary effort on the part of a number of citizens who wish to help their fellows.  There could be set up all kinds of cockeyed groups with bureaucrats which the Minister for the time being may think desirable and at the same time, there need be no way in which we could prevent a Minister such as the present occupant of the post from setting up rival organisations to the ones already in existence.  He might be able to wield a pen and set up another medical association as a rival to the existing one which upsets his sleeping and waking hours.</P>
      <P>I think that is undesirable.  After all, what is the laborious system which the Minister thinks is unsuitable in regard to the formation of companies and to the printing of articles of association, something that could be done for anything from £30 to £50?  What companies are not operating smoothly enough?  Certainly I think the organisations we have at the moment have some independence and are able to operate with some sense of freedom away from the Department.</P>
      <P>In future, we will have bodies conceived in the Department of Health, born out of the Department of Health, nourished by the Department of Health, and at all times tagged on to to the Department of Health, and these bodies will be afraid of the bureaucrats. I admit that the existing bodies are respectful to the Department and get every encouragement from the Department, but there is something different between the bodies we now have and any creation which may come out under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not feel that would be very desirable even if this legislation were <Col N="1594" /> in the hands of a responsible Minister. I for one do not trust the present occupant of the post with a powerful piece of legislation like this in his hands, and he cannot blame us very much for that.  His own colleagues give us reason to suspect what may happen when this Bill goes through.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we should protest most vehemently that this Bill was introduced at such a late hour at the end of a long session.  If there were need for it and if it is as desirable and essential as the Minister pretends it is, then it ought to have been introduced a few years ago, and not at the end of a most tiring session in which the abilities and interests of the Deputies are becoming exhausted from having, in the first instance, to deal with all kinds of unnecessary legislation necessitated by the Government's misconduct, and later on by consequential long debates on the Estimates.  We are being asked not merely for the Second Stage of this rather important Bill but, for the first time, to take an amendment which the Minister proposes to it as if it were of no consequence at all.  I do not think that is good enough.  We are setting up a new wing to the Department of Health which has a most unhappy history, and is certainly having a most unhappy present.  We will be building on a rather unhappy foundation.</P>
    <P>This Bill cannot be accepted without some rather strong criticism being offered in order that when the day comes, as it will inevitably come if this Bill goes through, and the Minister is dumb, some of us will be able to say: &ldquo;We told you so.&rdquo;  That will be very small comfort but at least it will be some comfort that we insisted on saying these things tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not able to make myself very clear. I thought I did.  I read my speech so that there would be no doubt as to what I was conveying to the House. Certainly in the terms of my speech, I did not say, as Deputy Esmonde thinks I said, that I was condemning these companies.  What I said was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right, however, to emphasise that the resort to the Companies <Col N="1595" /> Acts procedure has, in practice, resulted in the satisfactory establishment and operation of the special health services which I have enumerated.</P>
    <P>There is nothing there to support the gloss which Deputy Esmonde put on my words.</P>
    <P>Let us see what is the existing position.  For the expenditure of a certain sum of money, I, as Minister for Health, could get together a number of individuals, hand-pick them and form them into a company, limited by guarantee, and give them thousands of pounds of public moneys to establish themselves and carry on, and the Oireachtas need not know a thing about what I was doing.  That is the existing situation.  I do not say that any one of my predecessors any more than myself has taken advantage of the position in which the Minister for Health, with very large sums of money under his control, finds himself.</P>
    <P>In relation to the initiation of undertakings of this sort, here are certain bodies which have already been established: the Dublin Rheumatism Clinic, the National Blood Transfusion Association, the National Mass-Radiography Association, the National Organisation for Rehabilitation, the Medical Research Council, every one of them estimable bodies&mdash;I do not criticise them in any particular&mdash;is dependent upon the Minister for Health for its existence.</P>
    <P>I did not think that that was a desirable situation and the change which I am making in this Bill will be that the Minister has now the statutory power, and, therefore, I take it the constitutional obligation, to establish bodies of this sort by a process which is consistent with his constitutional responsibility to Dáil Éireann.  For that reason, the bodies will now be established under an establishment order which the Minister is bound to lay before the House.  For certain reasons the usual power of annulment is not given but it is open to any member of the Dáil at any time to put down a motion to say this establishment order should be annulled or amended in any one particular.  The mere fact that that <Col N="1596" /> establishment order is laid before Dáil Éireann means that the purpose or the operations of any one of these bodies can be discussed and debated here in public.</P>
    <P>At the present time if a question is put down on the Order Paper all I have got to say is that this is a limited liability company and I am not called upon to answer to the House for it.  That will not be the situation in the future because under Section 6, clause (d), the Minister can ask or require these bodies to furnish him with information and, in the circumstances, I should think that any Minister would find it extremely embarrassing to refuse to convey to Dáil Éireann the information which he is entitled to receive.  These bodies will not be bodies engaging in commercial transactions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be right to put it this way, that in respect of (a), (b), (c) and (d) the Minister for Health would be bound to answer a question in Dáil Éireann on any of these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that if I were Minister for Health I would feel myself bound to answer them.  I think that is as far as I can go.  My own desire would be that but there are certain difficulties.  Any body set up will be part of the ordinary administration of the health services.  The bodies will be an integral part of the health services, as, say, the National Blood Transfusion Service, the National Mass-Radiography Service, or the National Organisation for Rehabilitation is.  They become an integral part.  They cannot be administered by any of the existing Health Authorities.  It is not desirable they should be directly administered by the Minister for Health and his Department and my predecesors had to have resort to the Companies Act procedure to bring the bodies into existence at all.  As I said in my speech, that course of action was justified by the existing circumstances. But I visualise that as techniques develop, and the need for specialist organisations becomes more apparent, it will be desirable that we should <Col N="1597" /> have some statutory authority for setting up bodies of this kind.</P>
      <P>The question was asked what bodies would I contemplate.  At the moment there are no bodies in contemplation. These six seem to cover the field but I think it may be found as the years go on that other bodies will be necessary and it is also possible that some of these bodies may wish to become corporate bodies under the Act.  Some of them will have grown very big. Questions of superannuation, questions of transfer from one section of the health services to another, are almost bound to arise in future and this machinery will enable these transfers to be made in a legal way and will enable those who staff these services, if the companies decide to become corporate bodies under the Act, to be secure in their superannuation rights and in their tenure of office.  That is the whole purpose of this Bill.  Deputy Ryan and Deputy Esmonde were trying to see something sinister in it.  The one thing which this Bill does is to make the Minister for Health more responsible to the House for the establishment of these bodies than he has been heretofore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one question.  In Section 10, why has he not made the usual proviso that the order shall lie upon the Table of the House for 21 days and unless revoked by Dáil Éireann shall have effect, without prejudice to its operation during the 21 days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that we should be in this difficulty.  When the order is made, a corporate entity comes into existence and its existence would, I think, be very precarious if it were made subject to the non-annulment or the acquiescence of this House in the order.  It would create serious legal and practical difficulties in relation to properties that have to be acquired and so on.  I do not think there is any big disadvantage because a member of the House can at any time put down a motion to discuss the position of any of these corporate bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Deputy consider this?  I do not want to depart from procedure radically.  Would he consider that at the moment I can withdraw this Bill and the House will have less control over me as Minister for Health than it would if this Bill went through? The Minister does not give any notice to the Dáil.  These limited companies to which I have referred, and all of which are in operation, some of which, as I have said, were financed at the start with large sums of public money, continued to expend considerable revenues.  They were started without notice being given to the Dáil.  I do not have to make even an establishment order if this Bill goes through.  However, I would say that if I did not operate under the Bill the House would certainly have grave reason to criticise me.  The position is that as it stands I can do any one of the things to which the Deputy refers and he has no redress.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This short Bill will make only a minor change in the law on medical registration, a change recommended to me by the Medical Registration Council.</P>
      <P>At present, a medical practitioner is not entitled in this country to full registration until, after completing his academic studies, he has had a year's practical experience in an approved hospital.  This year is commonly known as the &ldquo;intern year&rdquo;.  The purpose of this intern year, introduced here by the Medical Practitioners Act of 1951, is to ensure that, in addition to academic knowledge, each medical practitioner will have a certain minimum amount of experience before he goes into general practice, or obtains a post as a fully-fledged practitioner in a hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a medical practitioner qualifying for the first time in this country, the condition presents no problem.  It is accepted as part of the necessary initial training.  In the case of a medical practitioner qualified in Britain who, for one reason or another, comes to live in Ireland and transfers from the British to the Irish Register, there is likewise no difficulty.  Similarly, a medical practitioner seeking registration here who has already obtained a qualifying diploma in one or other of the territories with which we have reciprocal arrangements for medical registration is exempted by our law from the condition to spend an intern <Col N="1602" /> year in an approved hospital if he can show, to the satisfaction of the Medical Registration Council, that after qualifying in his home country he has had comparable experience to that which he would get if he did his intern year here under the approved conditions.</P>
    <P>There remains, however, a further small class of medical practitioners who come here from countries with which reciprocal arrangements for medical registration do not exist.  Now, such a medical practitioner may be very well qualified, and may have had very extensive practical professional experience in his native land before coming here; yet before he can become registered and obtain the right to practice here, he must, having first obtained an Irish qualifying diploma, then undergo the intern year in the same way as a freshly-qualified young Irish medical graduate.  We have had, for instance, the case of a foreign doctor, excellently qualified and with close on twenty years' experience of medical practice, who, on coming here, had to undergo the intern year in the same way as an Irishman who had just passed his final medical examination.  I think it will be agreed that this situation is a defect in our system of medical registration.</P>
    <P>It is to correct this anomaly that the present Bill has been introduced. It will enable the Medical Registration Council to absolve from the requirement to do an intern year any foreign medical practitioner applying for inclusion in the Irish Register who, having taken an Irish qualifying diploma satisfies the council that his original qualification was sufficient for the efficient practice of medicine and that he has had experience in his own or another country comparable to what he would have got here in the course of the normal intern year.  The Bill does nothing to relieve such a practitioner of the need to get an Irish qualifying diploma before he is registered but I understand that concessions in relation to the period of study required for this may be given in such cases by some of the medical school in agreement with the Medical Regitration Council.</P>
    <P>I recommend the change to the House.</P>

      <P>I understand that this proposal has the approval of the medical profession in general.  Accordingly, we have no objection.  There appears to be on the face of the Bill, as circulated, a rather peculiar flaw. Section 1 of this Bill says:</P>

      <P>There is not any subsection (2) in Section 2 of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1961.  Section 2 of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1951, consists of one section which is subdivided into three paragraphs.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> Its main object is to increase from £10 million to £15 million the aggregate amount of grants which may be made by An Foras Tionscal up to 31st December, 1963, for the promotion of industries, whether located in the Undeveloped Areas or in the rest of the country.  Another object is to provide for the increasing of the number of members of the Board of An Foras Tionscal from three to five.  Its remaining provisions effect comparatively minor changes in the Undeveloped Areas Acts, 1952 and 1957 and in the Industrial Grants Act, 1959, arising out of the experience of An Foras Tionscal in the operation of these Acts.</P>
    <P>The present legislation relating to industrial grants will remain in force until 31st December, 1963.  In directing attention to this, I do not want to give the impression that the grants scheme will then cease to exist.  I do feel however that the time has come to undertake a comprehensive review of the present scheme.  The objects of such Review would be to assess the extent to which the existing system has been successful and to see whether any modifications of the system are desirable: in particular, I feel we will have to give careful consideration to the question of whether the present concept of the Undeveloped Areas has outlived its usefulness.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, I am faced with a growing agitation for the abolition of the border between the Undeveloped Areas and the rest of the country; I am being urged to adopt some alternative form of definition of the term &ldquo;Undeveloped Areas&rdquo; designed to enable other parts of the country to qualify for the more favourable grants at present applicable to projects sited in the Undeveloped Areas.  The reaching of decisions on these matters must, however, await the outcome of the review to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>To pave the way for the review, An Foras Tionscal are at present engaged in a detailed study of grant aided projects, designed to assess the measure of success achieved by the existing grants scheme.  Pending the outcome of the review and the enactment of <Col N="1606" /> any consequential amending legislation, it will be my general intention to continue to implement the policy laid down when the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952 was before this House, of confining the scheduling of areas outside the Undeveloped Areas proper to &ldquo;fringe areas&rdquo; which are contiguous to the Undeveloped Areas.</P>
    <P>The increase in the aggregate amount of grants which may be made by An Foras Tionscal to £15 million is necessitated by the fact that as at 31st March, 1961, grant commitments of the order of £8 million had been entered into as against the &ldquo;ceiling&rdquo; of £10 million provided in the existing legislation.  Projects for which grants were approved involve an estimated total capital investment of over £26,000,000 and are expected to give employment to close on 15,000 workers.  For details of particular grant payments made by An Foras Tionscal, I would refer Deputies to the report and accounts of that body for the year ended 31st March, 1961, which were recently presented to the House.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Industrial Grants Act, 1959, specifies that the maximum grant which may be given by An Foras Tionscal in respect of an industrial project proposed for establishment outside the undeveloped areas may not exceed £250,000 unless the Government, having regard to the amount of employment likely to be afforded by an undertaking, approve of the making of a grant in excess of that figure.  When the Industrial Grants Act of 1959 was before this House, it was stated that the Government would not be disposed to avail of this special provision unless in the case of a proposal offering prospects for the employment of 2,000 workers or more.  It is intended that this restriction shall continue pending the outcome of the review already referred to and the imolementation of any amending legislation which may result from such review.  Notwithstanding this, I concede that an exceptional case might arise which would warrant An Foras Tionscal in recommending to the Government the making of a grant in excess of £250,000 for a project which might not have a minimum <Col N="1607" /> employment content of 2,000 but would be of major importance to the general well being and economy of the State.  A type of project which might possibly warrant such an exceptional recommendation by An Foras Tionscal would be, for example, one involving an exceptionally large capital investment such as a chemical industry.</P>
    <P>The reason for increasing the Board of An Foras Tionscal from 3 to 5 is that since the passing of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, which limited the Board to 3 members, the responsibilities of the Board are being very considerably widened due to the extension of their activities to the whole of the country, instead of to the Undeveloped Areas, as previously, and due to the very substantial increase in the number and size of projects which have come forward as a result of the programme undertaken by the Industrial Development Authority for the attraction of external investment.</P>
    <P>The object in providing that An Foras may make grants towards the provision of plant (e.g. items such as cranes, roof tanks for the supply of water, electric transformers for general use as distinct from ones for use in a particular industrial process) is that legal advice recently received by Foras Tionscal raised doubts as to whether An Foras Tionscal were entitled to make grants for plant, as distinct from machinery and equipment, as they had been doing.</P>
    <P>The provision relating to restrictions on the sale of assets or shares in a grant aided concern does not introduce any new concept.  It has in fact been the practice of An Foras Tionscal to write into the agreements concluded with promoters a clause that they will not sell the assets or their shares in the concern, without the previous consent of An Foras Tionscal, for a stipulated period.  This provision is designed mainly to remove any doubts which may exist as to the legality of this practice of An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a further step towards the implementation of the industrial expansion programme outlined <Col N="1608" /> in the Government's &ldquo;Programme for Economic Expansion&rdquo;.  I confidently recommend it to the House and I should be glad if it could be given an early passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill simply carries on the policy that has been operated by this Government and the previous Government in promoting industrial enterprises in the undeveloped areas of the country and outside it.  I see the Minister now contemplates eliminating the differential that existed between the undeveloped areas and the rest of the country by bringing up the level of the grants available in the other areas of the country to the level at present available in the undeveloped areas and, I assume, widening the scope for which grants can be made in the rest of the country to the same dimensions as the scope at present available in the undeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>Whether these increases in grants in the other areas should not be accompanied by some corresponding increase in the grants available in the undeveloped areas is something I am not at all sure of.  Everybody was certainly enthusiastic for the idea that we should orientate some industry into the undeveloped areas.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister how far that has proved successful and how far the industries that have set themselves up in the undeveloped areas have surmounted the transport and other difficulties that were taken to exist.  I know there is a great deal of feeling and that the economist and technician is inclined to say: &ldquo;It is all boloney trying to bring industry to people.&rdquo;  But the same economic law should operate to bring people to industry.  That is, of course, what is happening in many parts of the world.  The relatively rural areas are becoming depopulated as the cities suck more and more population into them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Simply because that is happening by the force of uncontrolled economic laws does not seem to me a good reason for our determining to expedite that operation in our own community. The situation in Australia is becoming positively desperate, where you have a vast country with the bulk of <Col N="1609" /> its population now resident in four cities and the whole rest of the country becoming almost depopulated. It is pathetic to see North and South Dakota in the Mid-West of America losing their whole populations as they stream out of the these states into the adjoining industrial cities, leaving the places of their birth virtually derelict.  Nor am I at all convinced that the unrestricted operation of these economic laws is economically sound, quite apart from the social aspect of the question.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that 50 years' ago south of the Mason-Dixon Line in America industry was virtually unknown.  It was a rural economy based largely on cotton and tobacco.  Within the last 30 years, by a system of grants and inducements, the Carolinas, Georgia and other of the Southern States of America have drawn from New England a very considerable volume of the industry that used to be concentrated there.  It is true that the Southern States had climatic advantages to offer over and above the fiscal inducements they were in a position to extend to companies which sought a new location.  But, in fact, in many parts of the United States the practice of bringing industry to the people rather than the people to industry has worked.</P>
    <P>The Minister should think well before he surrenders completely to the thesis that you ought to concentrate all industries in Ireland in Dublin and Cork.  It is certainly true that, if you equate the fiscal inducements offered to industries, no matter where they are located in the country, the inevitable tendency will be to draw the bulk of industry into two or, at the most, three centres with corresponding migration of population from the rest of the country.  I think that is an undesirable development.</P>
    <P>There is another point in connection with this legislation which we should resolutely face.  The Government have announced that if Great Britain enters the Common Market, we propose to enter it, too, because they have reached the conclusion, somewhat late in the day, that the economic survival <Col N="1610" /> of this country is indissolubly bound up with our access to the British market. I think their reluctant conversion to the realisation of that economic fact causes a Deputy like Deputy Faulkner considerable distress.  He almost blushes every time it is mentioned.  He will grow accustomed to it.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that we are moving into the Common Market if, and when, Great Britain does.  What impact will that have on the industries we contemplate setting up under this amending Bill?  I say deliberately &ldquo;under this amending Bill&rdquo; because we have set up certain industries, the grants are paid and that is water over the fall.  There is no use chewing the rag about it.  But what are we going to to do hereafter?  Are we going to make somebody a grant of £250,000 or £500,000 to set up an industry which manifestly cannot survive, if and when the 10, 15 or 20-year period we get under the Protocol of the Common Market Agreement for the reduction of our tariffs system is exhausted?</P>
    <P>Have we any policy in regard to that or has it been examined yet?  I have reason to believe that certain of the industries we have set up here, or rather that were set up by foreign interests, even with financial help from An Foras Tionscal, have been largely moved to establish themselves here in order to get access to the British market in the favourable conditions obtaining under our trade agreements with Britain and that after Common Market conditions come to operate between us, and if our joint entry into the Common Market alters the terms of our agreement on the industrial side, these countries might lose interest in the facilities available here.</P>
    <P>Have these matters been considered? I have always taken the view that if we can get foreign, domestic or state capital to set up an industry here which can survive and provide good employment for our people in their own country, that is something worth doing, but I think we ought to consider very carefully the prudence, in the fluid situation in which we now find ourselves, of committing large sums of capital to new firms, unless we have <Col N="1611" /> some evidence from them that, in the new situation, they will continue to function, if and when this country and Britain are members of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>There is one last matter on which I think it necessary to comment.  If the Minister thinks it right to introduce a Bill which increases the capital available for free grants from £10 million to £15 million, does he not think he has some obligation to tell us how the companies which have got these grants to date have done?  I think he has, and I should like to have it made clear that grants under this legislation are not contingent on the subscription of foreign capital.  I think I am right in saying that every foreign firm that sets up in business here is eligible for these grants and that every Irish firm contemplating the establishment of an industrial project here is entitled to exactly the same grants as any foreign company could claim.  I do not think that is sufficiently emphasised.  I think it ought to be emphasised on the occasion of a Bill to increase the authority of An Foras Tionscal to distribute public money by no less than 50 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no objection by our Party to the main objects of this Bill, that is, to increase the membership of An Foras Tionscal and to increase the amount available for grants from £10 million to £15 million.  The Minister some time ago said, and he has repeated the statement in his Second Reading speech, that the time has come to undertake a comprehensive review of the present system of State aid for various industries established in this country.  I want to make my position clear so far as the whole project for State assistance to industry is concerned, because on a recent occasion the Minister for Finance, who is a colleague of mine in Wexford, seemed to misrepresent my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not the slightest objection to assisting the establishment of industry here.  On the contrary, I approve of the idea of State assistance <Col N="1612" /> for the establishment of industry. I do not object to special assistance being given to establish industries in the West but I suggest that the gap between the assistance given to industries in the West and that which may be given to industries in other parts of the country is too wide. The Minister has, indeed, by inference in his speech and in recent statements, given me the impression that he also believes that consideration should be given to the closing of that gap.  I hope I interpret him correctly. In the West, I suppose, there is and has been greater unemployment than in other parts of the country.  We are led to believe by Deputies on both sides of the House that emigration from the West is higher.  I applaud the efforts of this and of all Governments to assist the establishment of industry, the grants for which, I believe, are, and have been, generous since the scheme was established.</P>
    <P>On occasions, I have tried to impress on the Minister and other members of the Government the vital necessity, in my opinion, for the Government to have a financial interest in these industries for somewhat the same reason as Deputy Dillon mentioned.  It seems to me and to other people in the country that the reason for the establishment of foreign industries in various parts of the country, and particularly in the West, is the relative ease, the real ease, with which they can export their products to the British market. But if the situation is to change on our entry into the Common Market, on Britain deciding to do so, I wonder what will be the fate of those industries in the West?  I trust that many of them will remain and continue to make progress but I greatly fear that there will be a situation, not created by the Government or any Minister, which we should try to guard against, and a situation against which we might have taken some precautions at least in the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>It would be a regrettable thing, a disaster, if our entry into the Common Market meant that many of these people to whom we gave substantial <Col N="1613" /> sums of money to establish industries here were to pack their bags, so to speak, over-night and set up their factories in Europe, in Britain or some other part of the world.  I do not know what the Minister can do about that situation but, at least, that aspect of the matter should be considered.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the establishment of industry here we should, when determining the amount of the grant, have regard to the numbers who will be employed in the industry.  There should be a greater emphasis on the relationship between the amount of free money the Government are prepared to give to industrialists and the numbers to be employed.  I assume it is the main concern of the Government and the main concern of this House as a whole, first of all, to provide employment and, secondly, to produce goods for sale preferably on the export market.</P>
    <P>Our problem is to provide employment for our people.  We have a high rate of emigration and we have a high unemployment rate.  That is the reason I hold that we should insist, when granting moneys for the establishment of industry, on those moneys being related to the amount of employment that will be given.  I also think that An Foras Tionscal&mdash;primarily I admit this is a matter for the trade union movement-should concern themselves with the types and conditions of employment in these industries.  I do not wish to put that burden entirely on the Minister.  I would not put it on him at all except that I believe that An Foras Tionscal should in negotiating for assistance to industry bear these important factors in mind.  Let us be frank about it.  There have been allegations that industries have been established in the West with generous grants from the Government and they employ young girls of 15 and 16 years of age. These girls do not find it profitable to stay in such employment after 16 years of age.  The management then bring in a new batch of 15 or 16-year-olds and, indeed, sometimes some of the former employees who left are re-employed.</P>
    <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;The House will <Col N="1614" /> be aware that the Industrial Grants Act, 1959, specifies that the maximum grant which may be given by an Foras Tionscal in respect of an industrial project proposed for establishment outside the undeveloped areas may not exceed £250,000 unless the Government, having regard to the amount of employment likely to be afforded by an undertaking, approve of the making of a grant in excess of that figure.&rdquo;  I wonder if the Minister has any information as to what projects, if any, have been assisted under these particular terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister also states: &ldquo;When the Industrial Grants Act, 1959, was before this House it stated that the Government would not be disposed to avail of this special provision unless in the case of a proposal offering prospects for the employment of 2,000 workers, or more.&rdquo; That was a pretty rough condition.  Two thousand is quite a formidable number of workers.  Outside the very big firms, and there are not very many, I do not know of any that would employ 2,000 workers. Certainly one would not find any industry with an employment content like that in any of the provincial towns. One may, perhaps, find them in Dublin, Limerick, Galway and Drogheda, but I cannot visualise an industry being attracted to this country that would, even in the initial stages, take on 2,000 workers.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is intended that this restriction shall continue pending the outcome of the review already referred to and the implementation of any amending legislation which will result from such a review.&rdquo;  The Minister says that particular condition imposed under the 1959 Act still stands.  However, he goes on to say: &ldquo;Notwithstanding this, I can see that an exceptional case might arise which would warrant An Foras Tionscal recommending to the Government the making of a grant in excess of £250,000 for a project which might not have a minimum employment content of 2,000 but would be of major general importance to the economy or this State.&rdquo;  There is nothing very positive.  We are told, on the one hand, that the condition imposed in 1959 is to be continued until the review is completed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1615" /> On the other hand, the Minister says that in certain circumstances we can override that rule and give a grant of £250,000 for the establishment of an industry which would employ 2,000 people outside the undeveloped areas. I would urge the Minister to make this promised review as quickly as possible with a view to amending the Act, with a view towards reducing the gap that undoubtedly exists as between the assistance given for the establishment of industries west of the Shannon and the assistance that may be given for the establishment of industries outside that particular area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Corish. He is quite right in his approach to this matter.  I do not think it matters one iota whether an Irishman works in Mayo, Donegal, Cork or Dublin, so long as he works in Ireland.  We want to keep our own people together socially.  It may be more desirable to have our people spread thinly across the country, but we must face economic facts.  Where a town is centred at a railhead, on a canal, or a river, at a port, it is better equipped to meet the fierce competition of this modern age. While the Undeveloped Areas Act was socially desirable it has been economically disastrous.  I believe a proper examination was not given to the most advantageous siting of industries.  That is true, too, of the undeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>Consider the position of Galway City.  It is adjacent to a harbour, beside a railway.  There is a good deal of land close by, suitable for industrial development.  Recently, a grant was made available for the building of a factory some miles from Galway City and several miles from both the harbour and the railhead.  To my way of thinking that is the State subsidising economic inefficiency.  It is not the kind of economy on which public money should be wasted.  We have in Dublin a large labour force which is not being used.  The result is that our labour force, which has a tradition of industry behind it, is being forced to emigrate. The rate of emigration has been increasing steadily from Dublin over the last five to eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> Some years ago the figure for the surrender of Corporation houses was running about 300 to 400 per year. Last year the figure was 1,400.  I give this as an illustration of the fact that the labour force in Dublin is not being used.  In Ballyfermot there are some 14 or 15 acres earmarked for the last 12 years as an industrial site.  This site is close to a main line railway, right beside Inchicore, which has a tradition of industry.  It is beside the canal.  It is beside the largest parish in Ireland, a parish constituted of people who have gone out there from the back streets of Dublin, who were born and reared beside factories, who worked in factories long before there was a factory chimney outside Dublin. Those 14 or 15 acres have over the last 10 years been grazed by thinkers' horses, while we are subsidising heavy industry in the Galway mountains around the lakes of Kerry and throughout the length and breadth of the land.</P>
    <P>My remarks may be used by some as an indication of hostility on my part to my country cousins.  It is not so intended. I am endeavouring to say that while it may be socially desirable to distribute industry evenly throughout the country, when there are places like Drogheda, Wexford, Dublin, Cork, Mullingar and other large towns which have some industries, it might be better to establish industries around such places rather than try to establish heavy industries in single villages or small towns.  While it may be socially desirable, in the long run it would be unwise.  We are facing the keenest competition.  We have always had to face it but we shall not have the same protection in future.  In regard to the matter of reviews between now and 31st December, 1963, I take it the Minister is not tying himself to that date and that if the need for change occurs in the meantime as a result of such review, that change will be brought about.</P>
    <P>The main point to bear in mind is that if one can develop industries in the right place, in time the benefits of that industrial development will flow into the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> As far as the labour force is concerned, there is very little emigration from the industrial labour force from the West to Dublin.  Emigration is right out of the country altogether or it is confined to the professional or better-off classes.  Therefore, you will not be drawing away from the West to industries in Dublin people who otherwise might stay in the West.  If encouragement is given to the setting up of new industries in any large centre&mdash;I am not referring to Dublin only&mdash;it will result in keeping the labour force in Ireland and the benefits will flow to the undeveloped areas in the long run.  It is a long-term programme which will be of benefit to the economy as a whole.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon asked me to what extent the industries established in the West have been successful. The answer is that of roughly 61 industries now in production&mdash;there are 29 or so not yet in production but which will be after a short time&mdash;there have been only two failures, one in Portumna and one in Tralee.  As far as I know the rest are doing well. Most of them employed a minimum number initially and went on to increase their numbers as they increased their production.  In fact all of them have been quite successful; I certainly have heard no complaints that any of them are in any great difficulty.</P>
      <P>As regards the suggestion that the main attraction in the past had been ready access for industrial goods to the British market, I do not think it could be described as the main attraction. It certainly was an outstanding attraction to foreign industrialists but, as Deputy Dillon observed some days ago, another attraction was the availability here of an intelligent and adaptable labour force.  That is one of our outstanding merits and one of the attractions there are for people coming from the highly industrialised countries of Europe to set up industries here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the effect of the existence of Common Market conditions here if we joined or became associated <Col N="1618" /> with the Common Market, let me say that even still, with the intimation by the Government that in the event of Britain's joining the Common Market Ireland would propose to apply for membership, we are getting inquiries from industrialists from other countries.  Not only that but we have proposals actually under examination by Foras Tionscal from industrialists who do not seem to have any regard to the fact that the Common Market conditions will affect the carrying out of their proposals for the setting up of industries.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise what Deputy Dillon suggests has not been sufficiently emphasised so far.  I have used every occasion to say categorically that no facilities available under the Undeveloped Areas Act or the Industrial Grants Act are also not available to Irish interests.  In other words, these facilities are equally available to foreign or Irish interests or a combination of both.  I cannot say that too strongly and the fact is that in many cases there has been a very welcome combination of foreign and Irish investment in these new companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish and Deputy Dillon mentioned the proposed review.  I am sure Deputy Dillon appreciates there are many places throughout the country which have conditions akin to those in the undeveloped areas.  Parts of the country, for instance, Cavan and even the midlands, have a record of emigration we would not like to see continued.  If, by reason of the more attractive grants available to areas west of the Shannon, these other areas find difficulty in attracting people to set up industries, my intention would be, in any amended provisions we shall effect, to treat such areas as special development areas and to extend the discretion now given to the Minister on the recommendation of Foras Tionscal to schedule fringe areas contiguous to the underdeveloped areas to these other areas whose economic conditions are much akin to those within the undeveloped areas.  I do not think it would be justifiable to give the same consideration to more populous and <Col N="1619" /> more industrialised centres such as Dublin and Cork.  They have other attractions.  They have industrial tradition, population and are situated at highly developed ports.  These advantages would outweigh the disadvantage they might suffer in the amount of grants that would be available.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Corish, while on paper the difference between the maximum grant under both Acts might appear to be substantial, even on paper it is not substantial: 100 per cent. for buildings and 50 per cent. for plant and machinery in the undeveloped areas; two thirds for buildings and one third for plant and machinery outside the undeveloped areas.  In effect the difference is not so great.  The amount of grant is usually related to the type of industry to be established, the amount of employment to be given and also, which I think is an important factor, to the amount of capital to be invested by the promoters.  These grants are not given as freely as to suggest that promoters of industry do not have to show the colour of their own money.  Indeed they do, and in that respect I could reply to Deputy Corish by saying that, by reason of the amount of capital investment in these promotions, it is hardly likely they will abandon that capital investment and leave very lightly the factories they have built here.</P>
    <P>In regard to the minimum of 2,000 workers in connection with which the Government might, on the recommendation of Foras Tionscal authorise a grant in excess of £250,000, may I say to Deputy Corish that is not a statutory condition.  It was mentioned here during the passage of one of the Undeveloped Areas Acts as an indication of the type of industry the Government would be inclined to assist in the event of an application being made for establishment outside the undeveloped areas.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say offhand how many industries there are in Ireland which employ 2,000 people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose hardly more than two or three.  I mention that it was only a suggested minimum because at the time there was the prospect of a very substantial industry coming here.  It was only a prospect&mdash; the prospective promoters had travelled many parts of Europe&mdash;but we wanted to ensure there would be no limitation on the kind of assistance we would give which would put us at a disadvantage with other countries in Europe.  It was in those circumstances the power was to be used.  In fact where some proposals had been made to the Government for the use of this power no such grant has been given.</P>
      <P>There were many other points raised to which I should like to reply if I had more time.  However, may I say that the example taken by Deputy Ryan, namely, Galway, in regard to lack of industry, was a bad one.  As far as I understand, the number of industries to be established in Galway will about take up the potential employment available there.  It would be, perhaps, unwise to establish a major factory in Galway having regard to the number of projects already established and the number of proposals which are more than likely to come to fruition.  Incidentally the difficulty about employing girls in industry in Dublin is that there are not sufficient of them for many industries.  Therefore there are no economic reasons why girls should emigrate and seek employment elsewhere. I am sorry I have exceeded the time.  I should like to have had more time to reply.</P>
