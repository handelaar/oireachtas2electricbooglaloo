      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to circulate with the Official Report a statement showing the information available.  In order that the data for the different countries may be compared official exchange rates were used to express the national income per head of population in each country in U.S. dollars.  It was not possible to effect the conversion for Iceland, Spain and Turkey as there was more than one rate of exchange in use in these countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health when work will commence on the reconstruction and improvement of the County Home at Mountmellick; and what is the cause of the delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme for the reconstruction and improvement of the County Home, Mountmellick, is a major undertaking involving heavy capital expenditure. It provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the internal reconstruction and renovation of the existing old workhouse buildings, additional accommodation for patients including a new infirmary block, central heating and improved sanitary accommodation.  By reason of the nature and scope of the scheme, formulation of the local authority's planning proposals and their detailed examination in my Department have necessarily taken some time but I am glad to say that planning is now in its final stage and that the local authority should be in a position in the near future to invite tenders for the carrying out of the approved works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not correct that the planning in relation to this scheme was completed prior to 1956, that the work was sanctioned and a direction was given to the Laois Health Authority to proceed with the work in early 1957?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true to say that my predecessor, Deputy O'Higgins, did give a direction but he omitted to leave any money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The money was earmarked.  Is it not correct to say that the money for that and for some 30 other schemes was earmarked and provided prior to the Minister's coming into office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Earmarked but not provided.  The position then was, as <Col N="4" /> the Deputy knows, that the proceeds of the Hospitals Sweepstake had been mortgaged to the extent of almost £1 million in advance and I was not prepared to conduct that kind of financial carry on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling the House that if the work mentioned in this question and other works, too, had been carried out as directed, the money to pay for the work involved would not have been available?  Is that what the Minister is telling the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely saying that if that work had been carried on as directed many schemes in respect of which commitments had been entered into almost 20 years ago would have been put aside out of the way and I do not believe in that.</P>

    <P>As I indicated in my reply on 22nd February, 1961, to the same questions from the Deputy it would not be possible to give the information sought by him in respect of each of the years prior to 1947 without an undue expenditure of time and labour. Information on the lines requested is available in respect of the years from 1947 onwards and bulk figures are available in respect of the period from <Col N="5" /> 1932 to 1946.  As this information is in the form of tabular statements, with explanatory notes, I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>1.  The figures quoted do not include beds provided by private voluntary agencies without assistance from the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
    <P>2.  The year in which beds became available for use has been taken as the year in which they were provided.</P>
    <P>3.  In the case of certain institutions, the user of which was altered, either temporarily or permanently during the period from 1932 to 1960, the initial purpose for which the institution was provided, determined the category (tuberculosis or non-tuberculosis) under which the beds in question were placed.  For example the beds provided in the branch mental hospital at Castlerea, County Roscommon, are included in the nontuberculosis category only, even though the institution was used temporarily as a Sanatorium from <Col N="6" /> 1948 to 1955.  Similarly the beds at Ballyowen Sanatorium, which were provided in 1952 are included in the tuberculosis category only even though this institution is now used for mental patients.</P>
    <P>4. In considering the foregoing figures, regard must be had to the fact that they include&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) beds provided in new buildings expressly for the replacement of beds in existing inferior accommodation which was abandoned when the new beds became available.</P>
    <P>(b) beds provided by the major renovation of existing buildings. </P>
    <P>The gross number of beds in the new or reconstructed accommodation has been included in the tables.  To arrive at the net additional number of beds, it is necessary to deduct the number of sub-standard beds lost or abandoned.  The following table shows the adjustment necessary in respect of the period 1947 to 1960 and the net gain in beds over the period.</P>

    <P>5.  In so far as the overall tuberculosis beds position is concerned it should be appreciated that considerable changes occurred in the latter portion of the period 1947 to 1960 as the need for beds became less on account of the effectiveness of the measures taken to combat the disease, the coming into use of new institutions to replace temporary accommodation, etc. Some institutions where accommodation was sub-standard were closed.  Other institutions and parts of institutions were directed to other hospital uses, e.g., Ardkeen Chest Hospital, portion of which was diverted to county hospital purposes, Ballyowen Sanatorium is now in use for mentally ill patients, part of the Western Regional Sanatorium and part of St. Mary's Chest Hospital now cater for geriatric patients.</P>

      <P>The conditions restricting grazing during the final month of the letting and also requiring maintenance of fences and cutting of noxious weeds are standard provisions in Land Commission grazing letting agreements.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>34a. Before subsection (5) to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) Where a member of the Garda Síochána proposes to exercise any of the powers contained in any of the foregoing subsections the person in charge of the vehicle or the owner may require that any inspections, tests, or examinations shall be carried out by a member of the Garda Síochána who is a public service vehicle inspector and in the presence of a mechanic, engineer or other qualified persons nominated by such person or owner who shall be afforded an opportunity of observing such inspection, <Col N="29" /> tests and examinations.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy J.A.

      <P>I understood the Minister to say that the suggestion incorporated in the amendment that these tests should be carried out by public service vehicle inspectors would not be a practical proposition because there are not enough of them.  I accepted that as a valid reason for turning down the first part of the amendment, but I urged the Minister to accept the second part of the amendment, that is, that the right should be given to a person whose vehicle is affected or subject to a test to nominate a qualified person to attend on his or her behalf.</P>
      <P>Unless my memory is incorrect, the Minister indicated he felt that the lack of public service vehicle inspectors was not the only argument against the desirability of having tests conducted by them as there were other arguments as well.  I feel that if there are not sufficient fully qualified public service vehicle inspectors available for the job, obviously the Minister could not implement this.  I should be interested to hear what arguments he has to advance against the second suggestion in the amendment.</P>
      <P>I quite realise that if the Minister indicates he will accept the principle enshrined in the second part of the amendment, as against the request contained in the first part, it will be necessary to introduce some further amendment later because the amendment in its present form would not meet the case.  I should be glad to hear what reasons the Minister has to offer against its acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall read what I said on the last occasion on this subject, lest I should not be able to put it as well again.  As reported at Column 1815 of Volume 188 of the Official Report, I said on May 4th:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have been somewhat misunderstood.  While I used the two <Col N="30" /> very obvious arguments of the small number of P.S.V. inspectors throughout the country and the manner of their dispersal throughout the country&mdash;six in Dublin, three in Cork and the rest scattered throughout the land&mdash;I am sorry if the House took that to be the only argument that could be thought of against this amendment.  I gave these as the obvious ones, at the outset.  I indicated that by writing into this Bill mention of P.S.V. inspectors, we would, in fact, be tying ourselves to something which is not static, and need not necessarily remain.  In other words, there may not be P.S.V. inspectors as such in future.  To regard them as being in existence for all time or for the next 25 or 30 years would be rather straining the situation.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, let us consider the situation for a moment.  If, for instance, a Garda, no matter how unqualified from a mechanical point of view, observes a mechanically propelled vehicle&mdash;a car, truck, motorcycle or what you will&mdash;careering madly through any town, street or village, wobbling about, perhaps almost knocking down somebody, apparently incapable of being pulled up, surely it would be unreasonable at that stage to say that only a person who was qualified mechanically&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins then interjected that you would want a qualified medical man in such circumstances and I continued:</P>
    <P>That is a very interesting point. The Garda then pulls up the driver. He is not medically qualified, as one might expect he would be required to be if this line of argument were used, to determine on the spot and, if necessary, arrest the driver in the belief that he was under the influence of drink or drugs.  Apparently, objection is taken to his asking the driver to let him have a look over the machine, to find out by depressing the brake pedal and by twisting the steering wheel, whether or not it has any defect.  At that stage, even though it was in the middle of the night, on a country road, miles away from mechanics, garages or P.S.V. <Col N="31" /> inspector centres, what would be the position if this amendment were carried?</P>
    <P>Would the Garda be expected to stand by the machine until the following morning until somebody came along to find where he was lost?  Would it be expected that he should hare off through the country, leaving the motorist on the side of the road, expecting him to be there when he returned having rooted out of bed a qualified mechanic and a P.S.V. inspector from some place miles away, and all that in order to allow the defendant&mdash;as he would later turn out to be&mdash;an opportunity, as the Deputies have put it to the House, of getting fair treatment and justice?  Is that to be the position, despite the fact that by depressing the brake pedal, it would be quite obvious there was not a screed of brake on the machine and, by twisting the steering wheel, that it did not work until you had turned it twice around and that then it began to take up?  There is no Garda on the beat today who is so lacking in knowledge and intelligence that he would not know at this stage, in relation to those two points, that the machine should not be further used in the interest of public safety.</P>
    <P>I think that sets out very much more widely the arguments as to why this amendment should not be carried or should not be accepted by the House than merely the interpretation that we have not enough P.S.V. inspectors.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if there is anything I might add to that, it would be that the powers here are powers to deal with this unusual type of dangerous case that can arise occasionally and that that power is necessary to deal with such unusual and dangerous circumstances as might arise from any very dangerous defects and that it is quite obvious to anybody who cares to study the matter that in giving the power necessary to deal with these unusual and dangerous circumstances, we are not giving that power to be used day in and day out by every member of the Garda Síochána at <Col N="32" /> every crossroads throughout the entire country to the annoyance of the general public.</P>
    <P>That is the feature of the background against which we must look at this provision and looking at it in that way will convince us that putting this amendment into the Bill would in fact not attain the ends which we are endeavouring to attain by this measure generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported the amendment last week.  I say now that while I agree with the Minister that this amendment may not provide all the safeguards he wants, we believe that the section could not be described as being the ideal section, either.  Accordingly, after the discussion we had last Thursday and to-day's debate, the Minister may be able to provide against what we believe to be dangers inherent in this section.  The Minister says these powers will not be widely used.  How does he know?  He speaks as if he were the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána speaking on behalf of the entire Garda force.  His view as to when these powers will be used may be a reasonable one, but there is no guarantee that the Garda generally in the country will not operate this section to the very letter.</P>
      <P>The point about it is that Section 20 is one which gives wide powers to every member of the Garda to stop any motor car or lorry, to carry out a test and to tell the driver that certain things must be done or that he may not do certain things, unless he corrects any defects as ordered by the member of the Garda.  The Minister said there were not many Gardaí who do not know the ordinary things a driver would know about a mechanically propelled vehicle and instanced the case of a Garda who entered the cab of a lorry, put his foot on the brake pedal and said there was a defect of the braking system.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that a Garda might say the steering was defective.  Both the Minister and myself <Col N="33" /> know the Garda very well.  The vast majority of them do not know much about either motorcars or lorries and most of them do not pretend to know very much about them.  I do not agree that the majority of the Garda are car owners.  The most they would know about a car in the majority of cases is to drive in them.  The Minister also gave the example of the car that careered down the street&mdash;the vehicle that was obviously defective in some respect.  We do not need any Road Traffic Bill to deal with a situation like that.</P>
      <P>I accept that, as we have only 29 P.S.V. inspectors in the Garda Síochána, this amendment may not be suitable, but there surely is some other method whereby we could provide an adequate number of Gardaí who would be charged with this special task.  I think it was Deputy O'Donnell or the Minister who said last Thursday that he believed that every new member of the Garda Síochána now undergoes a period of training in garage work during his ordinary training period.  If the Minister could assure me on that point, or has any information on it, I should be a little happier about this section.  As it is, I have a decided objection to it because I believe that the Garda do not want this power and I believe that many of them are not competent to do what the Minister says they may do in Section 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I invited the Minister to give his reasons for rejecting the suggestion in the second part of the amendment.  I do not think he has done so.  As I said earlier, if there is a shortage of inspectors of public service vehicles and if the Minister tells us that the shortage is so great that he could not implement this amendment if it were carried, I would consider that a reasonable argument as to why we should not seek to have the Minister pin these inspections on public service vehicle inspectors.  But there are two things concerned in the amendment and in the subsection we are discussing.  The subsection provides for two kinds of cases.  First, there is the spot test or check on the road.  It was to that the Minister was referring when he pictured <Col N="34" /> a car careering down a road, obviously out of control.  In such circumstances I agree that the Garda there and then should be entitled to have a look at the car.  That is only one of the matters in the subsection.</P>
      <P>The second matter is that the Garda may require the vehicle to be submitted for further examination and test at a later date.  I see no difficulty, so far as the second requirement is concerned, in the Minister conceding that the owner of the car, who is required to submit it for further test or examination, should have the right to have present at that examination, a mechanic, engineer or other qualified person nominated by him.  I strongly urge the Minister to give at least that concession.  It seems all wrong that any member of the Garda should have authority to require a car owner to submit a car for test and that the owner of the car&mdash;as would be the position under the section as it stands, as I see it&mdash;could be completely excluded from seeing what type of test is being done, what kind of examination or operation is taking place, if inadvertently the Garda or whoever is supposed to test it on behalf of the Garda Síochána, does some damage to the car.  Surely the owner is entitled if, for instance, the brake linings are to be inspected, to ensure that the job is done properly and that the parts are properly replaced after the inspection.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello, in his amendment, suggests that someone on behalf of the owner should be allowed to be present at the test or examination and I suggest to the Minister that at least the person who is required to submit a car for an additional or further test, apart from the spot check on the road, should be granted these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support what Deputy O'Higgins has just said.  It is a valid point that no inspection should be carried out where such is provided for unless the owner at least has the right to have some person present on his behalf.  Many things can happen in diagnosing what is wrong with a motor vehicle.  A friend of mine noticed oil leaking from his car and called into a garage.  There he was told <Col N="35" /> that he had a crack in the sump and that it would cost about £20 to put right.  He was in a hurry and he said that he had a further 14 miles to go and he asked if he had the sump filled up would it be all right?  They told him it would.  He had it examined by his own garage next day and it was found that the outlet for draining the sump was loose and that was what caused the leakage.  It did not need £20 to fix.  Anybody's opinion as to what is wrong with a motor vehicle is fallible and, in the same way as the man charged with being drunk is entitled to have his own doctor as well as being examined by the police doctor, the car owner should have the right to a second opinion.  It would be a safeguard for the police apart from the owner to have the owner's representative present.</P>
      <P>Suppose a dispute arises and the owner swears that the defect did not exist until somebody &ldquo;got at&rdquo; the car during what purported to be a further examination, there could be hard swearing on both sides and I should imagine that there would be very great difficulty in ascertaining what happened. If there is a second opinion the examination is bound to be accepted as fair.  I think the Minister should give way on that point and agree to bring in an amendment on Report which will cover this point, giving the owner the right to have his own expert present when the examination is being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second point, there is no doubt that an owner has the right to take with him anybody he wishes in connection with this examination. Furthermore, it is likely in many cases that where a defect is alleged to exist and an instruction to have it repaired or remedied has been given and a date appointed for the examination subsequently, it will, in fact, be necessary to have that examination carried out in a garage so that the defect may be properly examined and the garage facilities may, in fact, be at the garage in which the owner of the vehicle has the defect examined and possibly discovers it does not need any repair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Seriously, what we seem to be doing here is trying to legislate on the basis that everybody, Gardaí and motorists, are going to be absolutely unreasonable in their approach on every possible occasion.  I maintain, and I am dealing with the matter on this basis, that we can assume reasonableness in the vast majority of cases on both sides and I think that is a better and more honest approach than to assume unreasonableness on all sides before we start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the real point is concerned, that a person who is required to submit his vehicle for inspection after being warned that a defect must be remedied should have the right to have a qualified mechanic or other qualified person present when the inspection takes place, there is no difficulty.  I hold that there is no doubt that he has that right.  To write into the Bill that such a right is there is, I think, uncalled for.  However, if the House insists, I have no objection.  I do not think we really need it, but, if the House thinks otherwise, I shall try <Col N="37" /> to have such a provision drafted and bring it here on Report Stage.</P>

    <P>(16) (a) A person who, in a case in which an instruction under subsection (8) of this section that a cycle is not to be driven in a public place until a defect is remedied has been given or in which he is aware that such an instruction has been given, so drives it or causes or permits it to be so driven before the defect is remedied shall be guilty of an offence.</P>

    <P>This amendment is in substitution for subsection (9).  The net effect will be to indicate clearly that where a defect is alleged to exist and an instruction is given by a member of the Garda Síochána on the basis that a defect exists, the disobeying of that instruction will not constitute a crime, if it is subsequently proved that no such defect existed.</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendment meets to a very large extent the point we intended to make on amendment No. 38a.  There is, however, one small point the Minister might consider to see if it is necessary to do anything further on the lines of his own amendment.  The amendment now before the House makes it quite clear that if no defect exists, a person cannot be convicted for disobeying the requirement of the Garda to remedy <Col N="41" /> such non-existent defect.  The owner is also covered if he continues to drive in defiance of an instruction.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (2) and subsection (1) of Section 20, which we have already discussed, very large powers are given to the Garda, quite apart from the finding of specific defects in a vehicle.  A Garda may, under subsection (2), require a person to drive a vehicle a certain distance and to carry out tests, and so forth.  If it is subsequently proved to the satisfaction of the court that the particular requirement in the circumstances was unreasonable, that also should be regarded as an adequate defence.  The Minister's amendment certainly covers the greater danger we foresaw.  I should like him between now and Report Stage to look at the other point in order to see whether or not it is necessary to extend it even further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, this amendment goes to the root of the discussion.  Amendment No. 38a is an all-embracing amendment which will be of use only where a member of the Garda is unreasonable.  The Minister says it is not necessary to legislate as though everyone is an unreasonable being.  That is quite right, but there is no reason why we should not put in a clause to protect humanity against an unreasonable <Col N="42" /> member of the Garda as is suggested in amendment No. 38a.  This defence is available where a member of the Garda uses the powers conferred upon him either aggressively or in a hostile manner.  To prevent the odd case, I think the Minister ought to accept amendment No. 38a.</P>
      <P>Under the section as it stands, a member of the Garda can direct a car to be driven five miles.  That might not cause any great inconvenience in the country where time is not of such great moment.  In the city, people are restricted to certain hours of work. They are also restricted in appointments. One lives under the dreadful fear of being late.  To be ordered by a Garda to drive a car five miles across busy streets might be a very serious inconvenience and might involve the person concerned in considerable expense from the point of view of his employment, the circumstances of his vocation, or even in his ordinary family circumstances.</P>
      <P>If such a person can indicate to a court that the order was unreasonable, that ought to be a fair defence in relation to the charge of obstructing a Garda in the execution of his duty. It would not absolve the individual concerned from the duty of making his vehicle available for inspection at some reasonable time and place subsequently. We ought to allow a person who is asked to do an unreasonable thing to have a good defence.  What the Minister says, while it may be his mature consideration and the mature consideration of his Departmental officials and the Attorney General, is not necessarily something that would be accepted by any member of the district court bench.  On that account I believe this escape clause should be put in, to be available only to persons who are asked to do an unreasonable thing.</P>

      <P>There is only one subsection about which I would be a bit nervous, that is, in regard to the limitations in subsection (4), where it appears that the opinion is necessarily a little vague to deal with a defect in a public service vehicle other than a major defect, which is already covered in subsection (3).  Precisely the same <Col N="43" /> type of cover is given in the new subsection (12), that a good defence is only that there was not such a defect. But where the matter of subsection (4) is so vague, that is where a Guard suspects some defect other than one which would cause it to be dangerous to be driven in a public place, it is possible that an unreasonable charge might be made.  I think it might be worth looking at again to see if it would be a good defence that there was an unreasonable charge as well as that there was no defect.  Just consider the vagueness of subsection (4).  I do not know what exactly is envisaged, or what type of defect there would be in a public service vehicle which, while it would not render it unfit to be driven in a public place, would still render it unfit for the carriage of passengers.  There might be a question of opinion in that.  It should be provided that it would be a good defence that the complaint was unreasonable.</P>

      <P>While I have a good deal of sympathy with the aspect raised by both Deputy Sheldon and Deputy Ryan, I should like again to point out that we are not trying to legislate for the individual circumstances of any particular person at any given time. It might be regarded as unduly difficult to ask a man to drive five miles across town in a rush hour but that is not the point at issue.  The point is whether or not what has been required of the person concerned is reasonably necessary, not so much whether in his own private capacity it might be a little more unreasonable for him than somebody else that he should be asked to go five miles or to do this, that or the other thing.  The real matter of importance is that the requirement as detected by the Garda under subsection (3) of Section 20 is reasonably necessary.</P>

      <P>Section 20, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> Before section 21, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The wages paid to and the conditions of employment of persons employed in the operation of mechanically-propelled vehicles used for the transport of persons, goods or livestock shall not be less favourable to them than the wages which would be payable and the conditions which would have to be observed under a contract which complied with the fair wages clause for the time being in force applicable to contracts with Government departments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is clear from the amendment that the intention is to apply the fair wages clause to all persons employed in the operation of mechanically propelled vehicles used to transport people, goods or livestock.  The fair wages clause at present operates in respect of Government contractors and the main point is to see that both contractors or sub-contractors working for the Government or local authorities will pay the equivalent of union wages or the customary wages in the trade. I would like, if I may, to read the fair wages clause in respect of Government contracts and sub-contracts.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P>The contractor shall pay rates of wages and observe hours of labour not less favourable than those commonly recognised by employers and trade societies (or in the absence of such recognised wages and hours, those which in practice prevail amongst good employers) in the trade in the district where the work is carried out.  Where there are no such wages and hours recognised or prevailing in the district those recognised or prevailing in the nearest district in which the general industrial circumstances are similar shall be adopted.  Further, the conditions of employment generally accepted in the district in the trade concerned shall be taken into account in considering how far the terms of the Fair Wages Clauses are being observed, and for this purpose also regard shall be had to the conditions of employment generally in <Col N="45" /> the contracting firm.  The contractor shall be prohibited from transferring or assigning directly or indirectly to any person or persons whatever any portion of his contract without the written permission of the Department. Sub-letting other than that which may be customary in the trade concerned shall be prohibited. The contractor shall be responsible for the observance of the Fair Wages Clauses by the sub-contractor.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that the fair wages clause will be extended to all those drivers employed in the transport of people, goods or livestock.  On a somewhat similar measure to this&mdash;it was not a Road Traffic Bill but the Road Transport Bill&mdash;the question of the fair wages clause was raised in respect of drivers of lorries and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, indicated that it would be a question more appropriately raised on a Road Traffic Bill.  That is the reason it appears on the Order Paper today.  In this Bill we are legislating for the proper control of traffic and we are trying to ensure that we will have the minimum number of accidents and we are going to do that by regulation.</P>
    <P>The Bill, when enacted, will insist that a mechanically propelled vehicle shall be in a certain condition.  It seems to me, therefore, that whilst we are going to make many regulations to ensure that lorries or cars will be in perfect condition, while some portions of the Bill do mention them, we do not seem to be so much concerned with the safety and welfare of the people who will be driving these mechanically propelled vehicles.</P>
    <P>There are many good reasons why the fair wages clause should be extended to all drivers.  There is the question of competition with the semi-State companies, C.I.E. for example, but it is also necessary that we should have drivers who are content in their work.  They cannot be content unless they are well paid.  It is a well-known fact that throughout the country some drivers are greatly exploited by their employers in the scandalously low <Col N="46" /> wages they are paid and in the very long hours they are required to work.</P>
    <P>There is another section of the Bill, which we can welcome, with amendments that we trust the Minister will accept.  It is in respect of the working hours of drivers.  The Minister may argue that the question of wages is not a matter for which we could legislate. Probably, he will suggest that it is a matter that the trade unions could very well negotiate.  As against that, there is a provision in the Bill, and one which we welcome, prescribing the maximum number of hours of continuous driving and also the rest period with an 11 hour period of driving. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to apply this fair wages clause.  It does not mean that the owner of a lorry down the country will be required to pay his driver the same wages as are paid in top class firms in the city of Dublin or Cork.  It merely asks that all drivers in their own districts will get what is recognised as the trade union wage or what is generally accepted by the trade and by the workers as a fair wage for the locality. That is one reason why I say it is appropriate to this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another reason.  I think it is a pretty good reason.  It is no secret that to a very large extent we copy British legislation.  We have done that in many respects and in connection with many Departments.  We have done it in some respects in this Bill.  The British Road Traffic Bill, 1959, Section 152, has a provision similar to that which is embodied in the amendment.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider the amendment as a worthwhile provision to ensure that not only will we have the best conditioned mechanically propelled vehicles on the road but will have drivers who are happy in their job in that they are paid reasonable wages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the very excellent case that Deputy Corish has made and the manner in which he has put the amendment to the House, it strikes me as completely inappropriate to a measure such as this.  The Deputy referred to following the pattern of <Col N="47" /> British legislation and to the fact that in the most recent British Act dealing with this subject there is a provision similar to that contained in the amendment. It is not a true analogy.  The Bill passed in Britain deals not only with traffic; it is also a Transport Bill. There is a distinction between what a Bill dealing with one of these heads might contain and what a Bill which would deal with both heads might contain.</P>
      <P>Again, it is true that in 1931, in the early discussions on the 1933 Act, this matter was debated and discussed in the House.  Nobody would agree more with me than the Labour members of this House, who are representative of trade unions, that there is a vast difference between the lot of the truck or vehicle driver and of his organised union today and that of the driver in the unorganised situation that probably obtained to a very large degree 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>I do not say this other than in strict honesty but I do feel that this provision is not appropriate to this measure, that, in fact, conditions, pay and such matters are matters which, traditionally, are handled by the organised unions, that they are best able to continue to handle these matters and will in fact continue to handle them. As I said when expressing my early beliefs and sustaining myself in those beliefs, such a provision would be inappropriate to this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I must agree with the Minister that the case put by Deputy Corish for the amendment was put in an excellent manner.  Knowing beforehand the case that he was about to put, I was amazed how convinced I became by the arguments.  I did not realise how excellent they were until I heard them put forward by Deputy Corish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister's reply.  He is correct in saying that the section in the British legislation was contained in a slightly different Bill. Nevertheless, it was a Road Traffic and Transport Bill.  I fail to see the point <Col N="48" /> the Minister was making unless it is that the provision in regard to wages relates to transport and that the cost of wages is included as a transport charge.</P>
    <P>While it is the function of trade unions to secure the correct wage for a job, surely the Minister is aware that in the rural areas there are a vast number of drivers and workers who are not organised trade unionists.  Normally, in that case, where they impact on industry, the matter is dealt with by a joint industrial council which sets out minimum rates, so that these unorganised workers cannot be used to jeopardise the standard in the industry concerned.  That is quite common in creameries, in agriculture and in various other cases.  Joint industrial councils can prescribe through the Labour Court minimum rates of pay.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not too much to ask the Minister, when dealing with human lives, to set up a standard minimum rate that must be paid so as to attract the right type of driver and to ensure that the man who is responsible for life on the public road in driving heavy vehicles or commercial vehicles will be a contented and satisfied driver? As Deputy Corish has pointed out, the question of periods of work and rest is dealt with in the Bill.  If that matter, which is normally, again, a trade union business, is covered in the Bill, it is not unreasonable to suggest that a minimum rate of wages should also be provided for.  As Deputy Corish also pointed out, it would not be a standard that would apply equally in Dublin and in some country village.  It is essential that the people who take charge of vehicles that can endanger human life should be of a type who are paid at least as good a wage as a fair employer in the locality would pay.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position, to examine the matter again and to see if something could be done.  I am sure he understands the spirit of the amendment. If the Minister does not accept the actual wording of the amendment, I am sure the trade union movement would be content with a provision <Col N="49" /> that would secure that the best type of employees would be engaged as commercial vehicle drivers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the easy way out would be for me to accede to Deputy Kyne's request that I should consider this further, with a view to seeing whether something could be done.  I would be less than honest if I said I proposed to consider it in the hope that something further could be done because I have considered the matter pretty severely, if you like to put it that way.  I cannot see, nor am I convinced, that you can, in fact, bring this matter in on legislation such as we are now discussing.</P>
      <P>I would say to the two Deputies who spoke in favour of the amendment that the reference to hours at a later stage of this Bill, the proposal to legislate as to the hours of driving which a driver may do is not to be confused with the matter proposed in this amendment. The question of the number of hours is purely a safety precaution which we hope to legislate for in that we want a man not to become over-fatigued and, therefore, a danger to himself and to others, whereas I draw the distinction quite clearly here.</P>
      <P>What is proposed in this amendment is the question of contenting the driver rather than the question of avoiding fatigue.  If we were to push that right along, we might say that anything which was liable to irritate the driver, even in his hours off, would be something in respect of which we would have to legislate.  That might be a very good thing, but I do not think it is feasible, and neither do I think that legislating for his contentment and well-being in a matter such as his wages is necessary or appropriate. It is unnecessary because I believe fully that this aspect of his well-being is, in fact, well taken care of and will continue even more widely to be taken care of as time goes on.  That is the particular trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it may be said that people driving large vehicles should be properly paid, I think that, generally speaking, the people in these large vehicles, who are hired labour, belong, <Col N="50" /> in fact, to some of our transport concerns or bigger industrial concerns, and I do not think there are any such as those in the country who have not got wage agreements with their respective unions.  I still feel this is a matter which the unions look after and will look after even better than could be done by trying to legislate for it here in the manner proposed.  I could take the easy way out and say I would look into the matter, but I should be less than honest if I said that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong this discussion because I think the Minister believes what he said but let me put a few points to him. He said that the British Road Traffic Bill was also a Road Transport Bill. I do not think that makes any difference. I do not say to him that, because the British put it in, we should put it in.  It is an example worth considering. I suppose it is a bad thing for any of us connected with the trade union movement to admit that, contrary to what the Minister says, there are many thousands of isolated drivers in isolated places who are not in trade unions.  There may be reason for that, both on the side of the trade unions and the people concerned, but there are many such people who are certainly being exploited.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that there is no use considering this because he has considered it thoroughly and that he would be less than honest if he told us now, for the purpose of finishing the discussion, that he would consider it.  Let me put this point to him.  It is not an ideal analogy.  I have not a great lot of respect for the Agricultural Wages Board which I think was set up to ensure that agricultural workers would get a minimum wage.  That was done because of the dangers of the exploitation of the rural workers.  The Government at the time&mdash;I think it was 1955 or 1956&mdash;produced the Agricultural Wages Board Act which determined that there would be a minimum wage.  Would the Minister not consider it from that point of view or would it need a separate Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept it if the Minister has considered all these aspects of the <Col N="51" /> matter.  I believe there is a case for safeguarding wages in respect of the employment of many of these people in isolated places in the country, but if the Minister insists that he does not see any use in considering the matter any further, I do not propose to furnish any other argument, beyond saying that we believe there should be something in this Road Traffic Bill to ensure that decent rates of wages will be paid to lorry drivers in isolated areas and that they will not be exploited.</P>

      <P>To insert after the word &ldquo;months&rdquo; in line 8, page 24, &ldquo;twenty-four months, or thirty-six months at the option of the applicant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to enable driving licences to be issued for a longer period than 12 months.  The present position is that a driving licence is issued for a period of 12 months and must be renewed every 12 months. There is a strong feeling amongst a number of people&mdash;I think the Minister is probably aware of it&mdash;that it would be better and would help administratively if driving licences could be issued for a longer period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter upon which there will obviously be different points of view.  It seems to me that from the administrative point of view, this proposal would have a very definite advantage.  At the moment every person who takes out a driving licence and who proposes to renew it the following <Col N="52" /> year must send in his application or call to the licensing authority and get his licence within 12 months.  If that is extended to enable licences to be issued over a period of 24 months or 36 months, as the case might be, it seems to me that it will reduce the pressure on the licensing authority, which as all of us know, certainly in Dublin, is frequently very great, both in connection with the issuing of licences and the taxation of vehicles.</P>
    <P>We suggest for consideration by the House that in Section 23, subsection (2), instead of carrying on the present position as obligatory, we should amend it so that, at the option of the applicant, the licence could be issued for two or three years, as the case might be.  If our amendment is accepted, the applicant who wants to get a licence for a two-year period would pay double the fee that is paid at present and if he got it for a three-year-period he would pay three times the fee for the one-year period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support that suggestion because I believe there is a lot of money lost by the present method of issuing driving licences.  I do not say the extension of the period to 24 months or 36 months would correct it entirely.  I would like to ask a fair question.  I am not aware whether the Minister drives a car but suppose he or any other Deputy takes out a licence on the first of May. That is due for renewal on the 1st May next year.  How many members of this House religiously renew their licence within the exact period of twelve months?  Sometimes it goes on not for days or weeks but months and unless one is challenged by a Garda the period extends to 12 months or even 18 months.  If a Garda does stop a motorist whose driving licence has expired up to date he is given a few days within which to renew it.  If the Minister adopts the suggestion that the renewal date be 24 months or 36 months, there would be added revenue for the Road Fund.  I do not know whether it would be substantial, whether it would be hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of <Col N="53" /> pounds, probably tens of thousands of pounds.</P>
      <P>If there is one reason why the Minister would not accept this amendment it is perhaps that the Exchequer or the Road Fund could lose money if a licence were taken out for a period of three years and the Minister for Local Government, at the behest of the Government or the Minister for Finance decided to increase the cost of the licence in that period.  I do not think a person could be required to pay the increase for the period for which the licence was still valid.  However, if this system were adopted I believe the Road Fund would benefit as a result.</P>

      <P>In regard to the two-year or three-year period for a licence, I can see the attraction from the administrative point of view, but I doubt if people are going to gamble, at the rate of £1 a year, on their still being driving at the end of a period of three years.  It is all right in the North where the licence is only 5/- a year.  I doubt if very many will avail of that facility.  A person can safeguard himself for 24 months ahead. On the day after he has taken out his driving licence he can take out another one for the succeeding twelve months.  It is possible to do this because subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act and any regulations thereunder, a driving licence shall be granted for a period of twelve months beginning on&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> (a) in case the licence is granted during a period during which a driving licence previously granted to the applicant remains unexpired&mdash;the day following the expiration of the driving licence previously granted...</P>
    <P>Therefore I can take a driving licence out to-day for twelve months and go in to-morrow and take out another one for the succeeding twelve months and keep myself covered for two years.  I doubt if anyone would avail himself of the facilities suggested in the amendment at the present licence rate.  Most people find it difficult enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unless a great many were likely to use the option I doubt if it would be worth while.  Different coloured forms, and so forth, would have to be used.  Deputy Corish says it is very easy to forget to renew a driving licence.  If you cannot remember at the end of twelve months, your chance of remembering at the end of thirty-six months would be even less.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would make very much difference.  In regard to issuing a warning, something should be done to ensure that the county council would issue a notice before the expiry of a licence. A warning I got on one occasion involved a licence which had expired three weeks previously.  I do not see why, when the poor motorist is being legislated for in detail, the local authorities should not be legislated for to compel them to issue a notice some weeks in advance of the expiry of a driving licence.  I doubt if the option suggested in this amendment will be used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to this matter on the Second Stage of the debate.  My main complaint was the inadequacy of the facilities available in Kildare Street for the issuing of <Col N="55" /> licences and I pointed out that if the Minister puts the onus on the local authority to issue these licences he should make sure adequate facilities are available.  I made it quite clear there was no criticism of the staff employed there but that the layout of the building was completely unsuitable. It is a very valuable property and I am sure the local authority could get a more suitable property and make a profit by selling the building in Kildare Street.</P>
      <P>I also asked the Minister to consider back-dating licences to the date of the expiry of the previous licence. I pointed out that the date of issue is stamped on the licence.  Therefore if a person were charged with not having a licence in force at a particular time and if he went along the next morning and bought a licence back-dated to the expiry of the old licence, the charge would still stand because the date of issue is stamped on the licence itself.</P>
      <P>I can see the point in Deputy O'Higgins's amendment.  There may be a saving in administrative costs but I am inclined to agree with Deputy Sheldon that very few people would avail of this opportunity if it were there.  Once most people pay out their £1, it is very seldom they will pay another £2 or £3.  To my mind, the type of person who might pay for a driving licence two or three years in advance is the type who would use the post to get his licence in any event. In the Kildare Street tax office, the working hours are bad and the layout is bad.  If you lose your tax book you have to go to the ground floor for a note, then up to the top floor to have it checked, and then to the central office to pay your 5/-.</P>

      <P>I cannot see that any substantial saving on administrative costs will be achieved by issuing licences to cover two or three years. unless the local authority is compelled to get a new tax office.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be better if <Col N="56" /> he would agree to backdate the licence to the date of the expiry of the old licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Lemass with regard to backdating, but there is one catch. Suppose a man allows his licence to expire because he has not got a car, and six months later he gets a car.  His licence would then be backdated for the six months in which he was not driving. I am sure a way out could be found, but I think it would be very complex. If some backdating arrangement were made, it would meet the suggestion made by Deputy Corish.  Where a man lets his own licence run, he will not gain financially, because it will be back-dated and he will be no further on than he was before.  It could happen that a man might be ill, perhaps, or might not drive his car for a few months, and the renewal of his licence might happen to coincide with that time when he would not be driving.  I do not see why he should be compelled to pay for a period when he was not driving.</P>
      <P>I am sure there is a way out, but I cannot think of it quickly.  It would probably be cumbersome and open to abuse.  Some method of catching people who allow their licence to run would be worthy of consideration if the Minister has any evidence to show that Deputy Corish's fears in regard to the general public and members of the House are really accurate.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's view on that point.  I appreciate what Deputy Sheldon has said, that people might be unable to take advantage of the facility if it were allowed to them, but I do not think that is an argument against allowing the facility to those who want it.  It seems to me that the number who would take advantage of it could not be ascertained if the concession were not made available.</P>
      <P>The other argument, and I think a sounder argument, made by Deputy Sheldon is one which I think could be surmounted by Ministerial regulation, and heaven knows there will be enough regulations under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  That question might arise if the fee payable for a licence were altered.  At present I do not see why he should not get advantage of it and why, from the point of view of reducing pressure administratively, it would not be a good idea and worth trying as an inducement, for what it is worth.  A person who pays £2 or £3 as the case may be, and takes out a licence for two or three years, will be allowed to do so in the confidence that he will have his licence at that rate for that period.</P>

I would have to have some further discussions before I could say, on the next stage of the Bill, just what my intentions really are.  I am not opposed to the idea of having at least within the framework of the Bill the power whereby that could be done, but in order to do it, or even consider it here, we would have to have agreement on the necessary amendment of the Finance Act.  Until we have had discussions on that aspect, and possibly a further look at the amendment, I would ask the House to leave it until Report Stage when I can report back.</P>

I made it to a person who filled in a form and summoned another official to take the form and the 1/- to another part of the building.  When that official returned with a receipt a quarter of an hour later, it had to be handed to the person to whom I had handed the shilling.  More writing had to be done and I was given the receipt.  Surely the time of those officials is worth more than 1/- for that quarter of an hour. Anything that can be done to cut down book-keeping and the number of receipts handled by local authority offices or any Central Government office, should be done.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to explain that this Bill contains provision for automatic disqualification <Col N="62" /> from driving in the case of 24 scheduled offences.  These offences are set out in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  Any Deputy who has endeavoured to follow these will agree with me that, as the Bill is framed at present, while I have no doubt it is technically perfect, it is virtually unreadable. It is extremely difficult to find out in relation to any of these particular offences affected by automatic disqualification, first, whether they do carry automatic disqualification and, secondly, what the disqualification is.</P>
      <P>The present position is that if you read a particular section and if an offence under that section carries automatic disqualification, you do not know that from the section.  When you read the section you do not know if a person convicted under it may be the subject of a disqualification order by the Court.  But when you read right through the Bill and come to the Second Schedule you find by virtue of the Second Schedule that if a person has been convicted under various sections of the Bill&mdash;24 in all&mdash;the Court then has to make a disqualification order.  Then you have to go back to the section to find out for what period he is disqualified, but you find it is not mentioned in the section at all.  You have to go back to Section 26 and by a process of elimination try to work out what the period of disqualification is in relation to the particular section under which the person was convicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment, and the other amendments which are consequential on it, we are suggesting a procedure which, we submit, would simplify the reading of the Bill and make it possible for everyone, lawyer and layman alike, to know exactly what is going on.  In effect, what we are suggesting is that you cut out all this rigmarole in Section 26 and cut entirely the Second Schedule to the Bill, but that in every section where it is provided in the Second Schedule that a disqualification shall be automatic you put in at the end of that section a short subsection saying that where a person is convicted of an offence under this section, a disqualification order <Col N="63" /> shall be made and shall be for a period of whatever the length may be.</P>
    <P>In making this suggestion we are not trying to alter in any way the periods which the Minister has fixed under the Act for disqualification.  In other words, I am not trying to interfere one way or the other with the disqualification periods the Minister is recommending. I ask him to make it possible for people to understand the Bill by accepting the alteration we propose in these amendments.  All it means is that to each of these 24 sections that carry automatic disqualification, the Minister will add a short subsection saying that conviction for an offence under this section shall carry disqualification from driving for x months or x years, as the case may be.  While all of these amendments seem to be very formidable, that, in fact, is all there is to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If illustrations were needed to show the necessity for these amendments, it was clearly shown by the amount of fright, concern and consternation displayed here when the effect of the amendment was indicated, where Deputies realised that the Second Schedule would affect so many different sections and where it was found that this simple amendment to Section 26 would have consequential amendments to 24 sections of the Bill. That is a clear indication of the necessity to redraft this Bill.  It is not, as Deputy M.J. O'Higgins pointed out, affecting in any way what the Minister suggested should be the periods of disqualification.  It is simply trying to make the Bill readable and workable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill stands, it will undoubtedly mislead the courts and advocates in court.  You may have cases of people being convicted of offences under this Bill, when enacted, and the consequential disqualification order will not follow.  I am grateful to the Minister for accepting the suggestion on the Second Stage that if the Second Schedule, appalling and all as it is, had to remain in the Act there should be the side notes which would indicate what the different sections referred to.  To some extent, he <Col N="64" /> has improved the Second Schedule by putting in these small side notes so that at a fairly quick glance you can see in the Second Schedule what the appropriate section is.  Even still, it is quite unworkable.</P>
    <P>This section, it was said to me, is a lawyer's delight because the layman could not understand it.  It certainly is not a lawyer's delight.  It is a lawyer's hell.  He will have to spend a considerable amount of time trying to work out the punishment his client may face.</P>
    <P>If this Bill goes through unamended and a client presents a solicitor with, say, three or four summonses under the Road Traffic Act the solicitor will have to look at at least three different sections of the Act before he can say to his client: &ldquo;You may face a penalty of this, that or the other period.&rdquo;  He will have to do that in relation to four different summonses. It will take at least 12 looks at the Act before he can give a person a clue as to the likely punishment.</P>
    <P>I can see the virtue of having in a table or in a schedule a list of all disqualification orders.  I should prefer to see that done by some proper arrangement after the passing of the Bill.  I believe that what we are trying to achieve, to put the contents of the Second Schedule into the Bill, would be better and would make the Bill more understandable.  If, for the purpose of demonstration, it was felt it would not be desirable to have a list of consequential disqualification orders, that could be put into some semi-official list.  However, to have a list in the Second Schedule and not to put the disqualification orders into the Act itself will create appalling chaos.</P>
    <P>Look at Section 54 which deals with driving a dangerously defective vehicle.  Subsection (4) provides:</P>
    <P>A person who is guilty of an offence under subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding <Col N="65" /> three months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to assume that that is the beginning and end of the penalty against any person who commits an offence under that section.  I do not think it unreasonable to say that that is the beginning and end of the punishment.  However, unless you are cute and alert and quick enough to remember the Second Schedule you may not look there where, in paragraph 7, an offence under Section 54, being a second or any subsequent offence, is an offence involving a consequential disqualification order.  If you happen to be a justice dealing with, say, 50 cases in a day and you are handing out your judgments you would need not one but six clerks to advise you and keep you aware of the different sections and the Second Schedule.</P>
    <P>I did not refer to Section 26 which is the section we are now seeking to amend.  Were it not for the fact that I am a member of this Legislature and have been considering this Bill in a sub-committee of Fine Gael for several months, I would not even be aware of Section 26 which does not necessarily refer to Section 54: it does to some extent.  There is a footnote on the left hand side of the page to the effect that the Second Schedule refers to Section 26.</P>
    <P>It might well be that Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, the Minister and myself, in explaining the amendments, may appear to be confusing rather than clearing the issue.  I make no apology for that.  It is a greater reason why our amendments ought to be accepted to bring the Second Schedule within the appropriate sections of the Bill so that if you find you are charged with an offence under, let us call it, section A, then, on reading that section, you will find in it all the punishments and all the penalties that may be imposed upon you, be they fines, imprisonment or disqualification orders.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why it has been thought necessary and desirable to put the disqualification orders in the Second Schedule.  That being so surely it is equally necessary <Col N="66" /> to have a Third Schedule to set out the offences in relation to which fines will be imposed and what fines may be imposed.  We should continue with the sequence and have a Fourth Schedule setting out what sections, if breached, will entail imprisonment.  Perhaps we could go further and explain what sections affect certificates or the withdrawal of certificates of fitness, and so on.</P>
    <P>If there is a need for Schedules, it applies to every penalty, be it a fine or imprisonment or disqualification.  We have endeavoured to be constructive in this matter.  Our submissions are not just carping and while we feel that several amendments might be made in relation to disqualification orders we deliberately refrained from putting down any such amendment at this stage because we felt so strongly about the necessity to redraft the Bill to make it readable and understandable at a quick glance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from Deputies Ryan and M.J. O'Higgins that these 25 amendments which we are now discussing propose no change in the Bill except to incorporate in it what is at present in the Second Schedule&mdash;that there are no suggested variations of the penalties.  During the earlier discussions on the Bill I said that because of the necessity to go backwards and forwards so often in the Bill to find out its implications, a layman would throw the Bill away and go to his solicitor to see what his rights were under it.  If these amendments now being debated are acceptable to the Minister, will it mean that when the Bill is issued again all these consequential disqualification orders will be listed in the Second Schedule instead of as additional subsections to each section?  If that is so, could we later come along and put down amendments and discuss what we thought about the particular penalties involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of situation that worries me about the consequential disqualification orders is the case where a lady going shopping in the city might park her car at a busy part of the street, perhaps within 30 feet of the corner, near traffic lights and that she would <Col N="67" /> leave it there over the stipulated time. I know of such a case recently where the lady concerned had tickets for three minor offences which, under this Bill, would mean consequential disqualification. Under the twenty-five amendments, it is proposed that the penalties prescribed in the Second Schedule should be incorporated under the different sections?  I think the Minister should seriously consider that.</P>

      <P>From Amendment No. 45 onwards, will we be permitted to discuss the actual offences committed, apart from the penalties and the manner in which the offences were committed?  Deputy M.J. O'Higgins says that at the end of the various sections such things as the period of disqualification should be set out.</P>

      <P>I do not wonder that Deputies feel confused because, candidly, I have been, and still am, confused, but I have tried to grasp what is intended in all the amendments from 42 and 43 onwards.  I can say that I am quite clear that the official amendment proposed to the Second Schedule as a result of discussion on an earlier stage of the Bill has brought about the improvement which was sought by the House.  I feel that such improvement now leaves the Bill with much more clarity than would be the case if amendments Nos. 42 and 43 and consequential amendments from there on were carried.  I would say that the answer to the proposals in amendments 42 and 43 is to be found in amendments 44 and 114 and, because of that, amendments 44 and 114 bring about an amended Second Schedule on the margin of which is found the information relating to offences enumerated in previous sections as carrying consequential disqualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I believe the Second Schedule will be very useful to any person who must have recourse to the terms of this measure when enacted. I do not think that the difficulties visualised by Deputy Ryan will arise thereafter.  There are consequential <Col N="68" /> disqualifications for driving offences resulting in death or for drunken driving.  All other cases of consequential disqualification can be lumped together under the six month period. What is proposed in amendments 42 and 43 is that, after each section under which an offence carrying consequential disqualification could arise, we would write in that so and so was the period of disqualification.</P>
    <P>I would point out that we do not write in after sections that the defendant may appeal to the courts against penalties and disqualifications.  There are a whole lot of factors which we do not write in because they might be contained in the earlier governing sections and in this connection there can be no case that I can understand made for the amendments now proposed.  If all these things were written in under the different sections, I do not think it would make the Bill any clearer to the legal fraternity than what is now proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate that lawyers will have any difficulty when confronted with a client who is in trouble under this measure.  I do not foresee any of the desperate confusion outlined by Deputy Ryan.  On the contrary, I feel that after we have dealt with the matter here and when it has become law, as I hope it will, if lawyers will read up the measure, possibly after one or two training gallops, as it were, through the courts in the early cases, I should imagine they would know it backwards.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish's question illustrates the difficulty we are in.  The Minister is making a mistake if he approaches this from the point of view of legislating for lawyers.  It is nearly impossible for lawyers to follow but it is all the more difficult for the layman and not everybody who goes to court in answer to a road traffic summons employs a solicitor.  The ordinary person should be able to read this Bill and understand it.  My complaint is that that will not be so under the Bill as drafted or even as amended by the amendments which the Minister proposes later in amendment No. 114 and, I think, No. 44.</P>
      <P>For example, if you read Section 92 of the Bill at the moment, it deals with the prevention of obstruction of traffic by fairs and markets.  In Section 92 you see that a person who contravenes a bye-law under this section shall be guilty of an offence.  There is nothing anywhere in the section to lead a person to believe that in any circumstances he will find himself, if he goes to court, faced with the district justice saying to him: &ldquo;I am sorry.  I do not want to suspend your licence but, under the Road Traffic Act, I am bound to disqualify you from driving for a period.&rdquo;  If you look at the Second Schedule you will see in paragraph 18 that &ldquo;an offence under Section 92 where the contravention involved the use of a mechanically propelled vehicle, being a third or any subsequent offence within any period of twelve months.&rdquo;  That means, in those circumstances, there is automatic disqualification, but it does not tell you what it is.</P>

      <P>No, we did not come to No. 114 yet.  I am talking of the position at the moment.  If you go back to Section 92, I challenge anyone&mdash;and I take it Deputies are reasonably intelligent&mdash;and I challenge the Minister himself if he is not reading his brief, to work out under five minutes what is disqualification for an offence under Section 92.</P>
      <P>I spent a considerable time on this Schedule and these amendments endeavouring to work out what the periods were and, under the Bill, as drafted, I came to the conclusion, rightly or wrongly, that under the section to which I am referring the disqualification will be three months.  I think the Minister is now introducing an amendment which will make it six rather than three months.  I may be wrong there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <P>That is certainly an improvement.  The Minister says that to do what we are suggesting would make it more difficult.  I do not think it would.  All it means is an extra subsection added to each of the sections where disqualifications are to be automatic. The Minister says he proposes to knock out a number of disqualifications.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>All we are asking then is to add a subsection to 11 sections instead of to 24.  I do not see that will make the Bill in any way cumbersome.  It will certainly make it readable and make it possible for anybody to understand, when he reads a section, that if there is a conviction under that section there will be disqualification for a particular period.</P>
      <P>The Minister said&mdash;I do not think he meant this as a serious argument &mdash;that you do not set out everything covered by every other section.  That is quite true but this is a matter of vital importance and one which, if left unamended, will be misleading. In a number of these sections penalties are referred to.  We are told that for an offence under the particular section you may be fined £50 or jailed for three months or six months.  Anyone reading that is entitled to assume that all the penalties are set out in the section but that will not be the case if the Minister insists on keeping the Bill in its present framework or even as modified by his own amendments. There are penalties in the Second Schedule about which neither the person concerned nor possibly his advisers will know anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is right in saying that if a person, whether a lawyer or a layman, is caught out once or twice he will begin to know what is in the Bill.  He will know better next time. That is fine when you come to the next time; it is not so easy for the first time.  The Minister's attitude is quite unnecessary.  The Bill would be just as effective and just as formidable were the Minister to deal with the matter in the way suggested.  There would be no danger of the Bill being <Col N="72" /> unreadable.  There would be no danger of people being left in ignorance as to what the penalties are and under what sections automatic disqualification will apply.  I press this very strongly on the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have more than once said that we cannot legislate to eliminate road accidents completely.  We cannot even assist in that direction unless the legislation gets the co-operation necessary from the people concerned.  There is an old saying <i>&ldquo;Ignorantia legis neminem excusat.&rdquo;</i>  It is equally true that knowledge of the law is the best and most effective way of getting the law observed.  A person who knows the law is culpable if he breaks it. Ignorance of the law may not be an excuse but it is much easier to offend if one is ignorant of the law.  I see no necessity for this elaborate set-up of Schedules when the whole matter could be done quite openly by the addition of a simple section.</P>

      <P>Section 48 deals with the driving of a mechanically propelled vehicle when unfit.  The first time I offend I may be fined £20; if I offend the second time, I may be fined £50 or imprisoned for three months.  The Minister proposes to amend the Second Schedule.  Under Section 48 a second, or third, offence within a period of three years involves disqualification. What does disqualification mean there? Is it a week, a month or a year?</P>

How we can discuss this matter without discussing amendments Nos. 44 and 114 at the same time is something I should like to have explained to me.  All the amendments relate to the Second Schedule.  If amendment No. 114 is accepted, the Second Schedule will disappear and be replaced by a new Second Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand Deputy O'Higgins's argument.  It might be easier to understand if, instead of <Col N="73" /> reading the Schedule, one went poking about through the other provisions. Surely some regulation should be made instructing the Garda to warn an offender that, if he offends again within a certain period, disqualification may follow?  I agree that ignorance of the law is no excuse.  Innocence can lead a great many people into trouble. Administratively, there should be no difficulty in warning people.</P>

Now it looks as if they will find themselves liable to disqualification for a period of not less than six months.

If you have regard to Section 48, about which Deputy Corish inquired, there would be no doubt at all about the position if you added a third subsection.  At the moment, it consists of two subsections, but if you added a third to read &ldquo;Where a person is convicted of an offence under this section, being a second or subsequent offence, the court shall make an order disqualifying such person from holding a driving licence for a period of not less than six months,&rdquo; there would be no doubt about it and no question of anybody <Col N="75" /> having to search around to find out the period of disqualification.</P>

The case was made by Deputy Ryan and, I thought, by Deputy O'Higgins, that we were going to have the legal people at sixes and sevens, not knowing what they were about and not being able to advise their clients because, they said, the Bill will be difficult to understand and difficult to read.  Now, in regard to consequential disqualification in the Second Schedule, Deputy O'Higgins gets up and says that it is not the legal people or the solicitors who will be in difficulties but the ordinary man in the street.</P>

I am going to ask this, and I am not asking it in any carping sense, but from my experience of trying to get a draft in language I can understand: is there any law drafted by these legal people which is readily understandable by the layman? I challenge the legal people to draft any law of any significance which will be readily understandable by laymen. It is just not possible and it is not their fault.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting for a moment it is not involved.  I am suggesting to the House that for the layman this or any other legal matter such as this is involved.  Scarcely any of our laws or statutes are not involved when it comes to their examination by the layman.  I do say that what we are proposing is as good as, or better than, what is proposed in the amendments and I do not give a lot for either of the two methods.  They are both involved and I cannot see how they can be made less involved nor can those whose duty it is to draft them. If they could have made them less involved, they would have done so because it was my wish that they should have done so.</P>
      <P>What we are suggesting is that amendments Nos. 44 and 114 will make for clarity as nearly as it is possible to get it in the framework of this Bill, so that the ordinary layman will have a fair idea of what it is all about. I certainly do not suggest that he will know everything about it&mdash;it will certainly take him some time to find out&mdash; but the most serious aspects are set out and these most serious aspects will come to be known to him because they are vital to his interests, and he will be all the more careful and watchful when he knows of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister thinks about my suggestion that some warning could be given to offenders coming within the Second Schedule but, from the drafting point of view, I know the way it is in the Schedule is the customary way to do it. I am now looking at amendment No. 114.  The phrase &ldquo;Section 26&rdquo; is rather coyly tucked away in the margin and yet it governs all that is in the Second Schedule.  I wonder would it look very bad or would it be creating a bad precedent if after every one of the paragraphs in the Schedule, instead of putting merely &ldquo;Section 26&rdquo; in the margin, you put &ldquo;Section 26 (3)&rdquo; or &ldquo;Section 26 (4)&rdquo; as the case might be, so that after item No. 1 <Col N="79" /> in the Second Schedule, you would have &ldquo;Section 26 (4)&rdquo; and so on, down to Items Nos. 2 and 3, and then after Item No. 4 in the Second Schedule, you would have &ldquo;Section 26 (3),&rdquo; so that the reference back to the penalty and the period of disqualification would be quite clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A difficulty arises here for an ordinary layman.  He buys this Bill and says: &ldquo;I have been charged with driving a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of drink or drugs.&rdquo;  He then goes to Section 49 to look up what the offence may be and finds that on summary conviction he will be liable to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or, at the discretion of the court, to both such imprisonment and a fine.</P>
      <P>There is no reference in the section to consequential disqualification.  If he is not legally advised but happens to discover the Second Schedule at the back of the Bill, he finds he is subject to consequential disqualification for an offence under Section 49.  He looks back to Section 26 and discovers that the period of disqualification can be for a year, whereas in other instances the period of disqualification may be for six months, if the offence comes under the heading of &ldquo;minor offences&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think what Deputy O'Higgins wants is that a man who commits an offence should be able to look up the Bill and find what he is in for. It would simplify matters.</P>
      <P>The position is much improved by the proposed amendment No. 114 but there is a certain argument for having these things included, as Deputy Sheldon says, as additional subsections. Perhaps the Minister might consider it and then each item could be discussed on its merits on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As a rule, Ministers, when they bring in a provision like this, are able to point to precedent as being on their side and Deputy Sheldon assumed that the precedent in this case was in favour of <Col N="80" /> the Minister.  In fact, the precedent is in favour of the argument I am making.</P>
      <P>Under Section 30 of the 1933 Road Traffic Act, which corresponds with Section 49 of the Bill, the section to which Deputy Lemass referred, there is there provided an automatic disqualification and it is set out plainly in Section 30 of the 1933 Act that if a person is convicted under that section, a disqualification order shall be made and there is set out in the last subsection of Section 30 what the period of disqualification shall be.</P>
      <P>All I am asking is that that precedent should be followed in this Bill and that in each of the eleven cases dealt with in the Minister's amendment No. 114, there should be a simple subsection at the end setting out what the period of disqualification will be and in relation to Section 49, all Deputy Lemass would have to do, if my amendment is accepted, would be to read an additional subsection&mdash;it would be subsection (6)&mdash;which would provide that if a person was convicted, a disqualification order would be made and that that would be for not less than one year for the first offence or three years for the second or subsequent offences, and everyone would know where he was.</P>

      <P>Will he take it with him and read it or will he wait until he has had an accident and then go scurrying to get one and sit down on the pavement and find out what he did wrong? The Deputy knows quite well that what is contained in this Bill is hedged around by phraseology, which is not my responsibility, although I take responsibility for it.  That phraseology is heading around quite a few simple straightforward offences which it is our wish in this House to legislate out of being, if we can.  When it is broken down to the actual offences, leaving out all the verbiage that grows around these things, of necessity when they are going into statutory instruments, we find that standing out fairly plain and stark are the offences and the relative importance of those offences very soon becomes quite evident to the public who are very much concerned with this matter of road safety.  We are trying to lay the framework within which we hope to have greater safety on our roads in future.</P>
      <P>Allowing all that and allowing also that when he gets into trouble in regard to this road traffic law, it is not to gallop off to seek a copy of the Act that will be the first thought of an ordinary layman but rather will it be a visit to his local solicitor to whom he will, no doubt, contribute in the course of the following few weeks, for which he will get good service and the advice of that solicitor, who is a specialist in matters of the law, and who will appear for him in court and fight his corner for him.</P>

      <P>I defy the Deputy and any of the legal fraternity inside or outside this House to produce a measure, covering all the aspects that are covered in the Bill, in such a manner that the layman can understand it.  That is not my fault.  I do not blame the legal fraternity for it but that is the actual position.  Is there any comprehensive measure going through this House which the ordinary layman can understand at first glance or even at tenth glance?  We are not doing it deliberately.  If it is difficult to understand, it is not because we want it so but because we cannot avoid it. In this case where the Deputy is so concerned about whether or not the ordinary people will understand, the official amendment sets out in a way, which is not too difficult, in my estimation, the manner in which consequential disqualifications arise, the sections to which they apply and the sections which apply to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is more clear as now set out in the Second Schedule than it would be if we were to go the way the Deputy suggested.  I do not suggest that the Deputy put it down in such a manner as to make it more confused. I accept that he has put down the amendment to make it more simple but he has not succeeded.  What I propose to the House is more readily <Col N="83" /> understandable by the general public who I am as anxious should understand it as the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister looks at his amendment, understands his own amendment and compares it with the Second Schedule as it was, he must know that the case he is making is nonsense.  All the Minister does in amendment No. 114 is to reduce in number the sections under which there will be automatic disqualification. He says he is making the whole position quite plain, simple and easy to understand by doing that and that there is no other way of making it more easily understood.</P>
      <P>Surely to heavens, the only way to make it absolutely clearly understood is to say in the section: &ldquo;If you are convicted under this section, you will be disqualified for x months or x years, as the case may be.&rdquo;  Could there be anything more simple than that?  I am talking now as a layman and not as a lawyer.  I am talking for the ordinary person who has no legal training.  Would it not be a simple matter to put in a subsection saying: &ldquo;If you are convicted under this section, you will be disqualified from driving for a given period.&rdquo;  Nothing could be more simple than that.</P>
      <P>The Minister's argument that this Bill is not one which is going to be understood by the layman and his attitude that that does not matter very much because the layman will go to a lawyer for advice is most amazing.  If the Minister sits in the back of any of the district courts in Dublin dealing with road traffic offences, he will find that a great number of people charged with offences do not go near a solicitor and many of them do not even go to court.  In relation to some of these offences, there is to be hidden in a Schedule to this Bill a period of automatic disqualification.</P>

      <P>Section 48 tells me that if I drive a mechanically propelled vehicle while unfit, I shall be guilty of an offence.  That is subsection (1). Subsection (2) tells me what the penalty is for the first offence.

It the Minister had drafted a Bill on the lines suggested by Deputy O'Higgins, I could well imagine Deputy O'Higgins insisting that in order that a man should find out whether he committed an offence or not, he would have to read the whole Bill, whereas if it were all collected in one Schedule, he would have no difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a suggestion about that.  There are only two ways under subsection (3) and the new subsection (4). Under paragraph 3, which is for drunken driving, it is a year in respect of the first offence and in respect of the other nine offences it is six months.  We must have regard to what this is about.  This is not the case of an innocent soul who gets into a car and finds himself subject to disqualification. It is for a man who previously had been driving while drunk or a man who had driven dangerously a mechanically propelled vehicle.  They are not just innocent little souls.  There are two possible exceptions about which I am not very happy, under Section 18 and Section 20, where there might be some reasonable excuse and where a man might think that this would not lead to disqualification.  In respect of most of the others, the ordinary layman would have a shrewd suspicion that if he went on driving a mechanically propelled vehicle without authority at some stage, he would get into trouble.</P>

If he has that kind of casual approach to the type of offence in the Schedule, he deserves what is coming to him.

      <P>From time to time and certainly after this matter has been disposed of in this House, there will issue a booklet, which, I think, will be phrased in such a way that an ordinary layman can understand it.  That will be the <i>Rules of the Road.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not have it composed in the manner in which we are obliged to have this composed. The <i>Rules of the Road</i> will be set out in ordinary understandable phraseology. In it will be outlined clearly the various offences and in the case of consequential disqualification, where this is going to take place and what offences are concerned.  The question of dangerous parking will be dealt <Col N="86" /> with and the second and subsequent offences of this nature will carry this consequential disqualification, in addition to the ordinary penalties outlined in the other Parts of the Bill.  It will also deal with the various other offences and with the help of the Press throughout the country, people will come to know what is contained in this measure even before it becomes law. They will read what is proposed, what has been agreed, and the various interested parties such as the Safety First Association, the A.A., the R.I.A.C. and their members will be given this type of information because it is of interest to them.</P>
      <P>In addition to the general publicity which is normal in matters such as this&mdash;and perhaps this measure is entitled to more than its normal share of publicity because it is a vital matter &mdash;the issue of the <i>Rules of the Road</i> dealing with the various offences and what may happen if a person commits any of these offences and what should be done in the various circumstances, will help to put across the necessary information.  They will soon come to know the penalties they are likely to incur if they are caught out.  As has been said by Deputy Sheldon, whether it is a second or subsequent offence which is regarded as of a fairly serious type carrying the penalty of disqualification, the offender is likely to be able to teach some of the lawyers what he knows about the law in that connection rather than have to find out all about it.  However, lest there should be any misunderstanding, Deputy O'Higgins is off the beam when he says I suggested that everybody who is up for a driving offence will go to the local solicitor and have himself properly represented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Who suggested that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy alleges I suggested it.  I was talking about the offences carrying consequential disqualification. The majority of people who are unfortunate enough to fall into that offence are very likely to be represented by some legal people.  If it is a minor infringement to which the Deputy has referred, in which case <Col N="87" /> sometimes people do not bother going to court or, on the other hand, if it is something serious and the person concerned is unable to afford representation, the practice in our courts is such that the district justice or the person on the bench feels it incumbent on him to look after the interests of the unrepresented person who is being prosecuted by the State.  That is a well-known and well-understood thing in the courts.  If some unfortunate person is not represented, it does not follow he is going to be lambasted because of his lack of legal representation through no fault of his own.</P>
      <P>I would not like it to be understood, as Deputy O'Higgins has represented here, that I believe everybody should go to a solicitor, where he sprains his thumb or stubs his toe, in order to have himself represented in court.  The vast majority of the people who will be before the court on these charges will, because of the seriousness of the charges, be represented by solicitor or counsel.  Therefore, the ordinary person does not have to sit down on the pavement and thumb through the Bill to find out what offence he has committed and the likely penalty.  Serious offences are involved here and in most of these cases legal opinion and advice will be sought for the protection of the person in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be unduly difficult about this.  The Minister's amendments have clarified the Bill to some extent.  I will go as far as this with him: the amendments make the Bill far more readable and understandable than it was before they were introduced.  I cannot understand why the Minister, who professes that he cannot think of a way of simplifying it further, should so vigorously resist a method of simplifying it when it is handed to him on a plate.  There is no argument about it: If the Minister accepts these amendments designed to put in an additional subsection in each of these cases, it will simplify the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not follow the Minister's argument about people being represented in court by solicitors or otherwise.  He seems to be saying it does not matter <Col N="88" /> a hoot whether the public can understand what is in the Bill or not, because, if they can afford it or if the offence is sufficiently serious, they will go to a solicitor, that the solicitor is qualified to read and understand the Bill and, secondly, if they are not sufficiently wealthy or if the offence is not of a grave nature, it is hardly worth their while reading the Bill anyway, because the odds are they will not be disqualified. In any event, if they do not go to a solicitor, the Minister tells us the district justice will look after them very well and see that their case is properly made.  That may be true, but it does not enhance the value of the legislation the Minister is asking us to pass and I do not appreciate it as an argument for enacting legislation in a cumbersome way when it can be done in a simple way.</P>
    <P>The simple way to do this is to say in relation to each section that if a person is convicted under this section, he will be declared disqualified for driving for a particular period, setting out the period.  That is simple, direct and easily understood.  It leaves no room for doubt in anybody's mind.  It cannot lead to any confusion.  The only objection to it I can see is that it makes this Bill larger by 11 subsections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are&mdash;this way and that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>He can either look at the arrangement of sections which is by way of an index in every Bill published by this House.  He can see that the question of driving a mechanically propelled vehicle when <Col N="89" /> unfit is dealt with by Section 48 and then he can go to Section 48.  However, there is a much quicker way of doing it.  He will be going into court on foot of a summons issued by the Garda and that summons will say to him that he is charged with an offence under Section 48 of the Road Traffic Act, 1960. His mind is directed immediately to Section 48.  Again that is a simple and direct way of doing things.  He goes to Section 48 as phrased by the Minister and he will then read it, as Deputy Lemass has pointed out very effectively, to find out what he is being charged with and what will happen to him if he is convicted of the offence with which he is charged?</P>
      <P>He reads Section 48 and sees that he can be charged with &ldquo;driving mechanically propelled vehicle when unfit.&rdquo;  He sees from subsection (2) of Section 48 that if it is his first offence, he is liable to a fine not exceeding £20 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding one month or to both such fine and such imprisonment, and if it is his second or subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding £50 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment. The one thing he will not find in Section 48 is that he is also liable to be disqualified from driving for a period.</P>
      <P>To carry the Minister's argument further: how will he find that out? He will have to thumb through this Bill until he comes to the Minister's amendment No. 114, which will form the Second Schedule to the Bill.  He will not find it even on the summons issued by the Garda, but he will find, when he looks at the Second Schedule, that, under paragraph 3, an offence under Section 48, being a second or subsequent offence within any period of three years, carries disqualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He then goes back to Section 48 to find out for how long he will be disqualified. He searches Section 48, and if he is methodical about it, he will search the sections around it as well.  He might go back to Section 40, and then on as far as Section 50, but he still will not find anything about it. It might then strike him to go to a <Col N="90" /> solicitor, or ask a district justice, or he might write a line to the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Local Government, and he will get a postcard back from the Minister which will tell him: &ldquo;Do not bother to look at the Second Schedule; do not bother to look at Section 48; have a look at Section 26.&rdquo;  Then when he looks at Section 26, after going to all that trouble, he will find for how long he may be disqualified&mdash;and the Minister says that is simple procedure.</P>

      <P>I cannot quite follow Deputy O'Higgins and I hope I have not missed the point stupidly.  It seems to me that if a person is in any doubt as to whether or not he is about to commit an offence, he is in a very difficult position.  We should make perfectly clear in our legislation what is and what is not an offence.  The argument now appears to be that you should know, before you commit an act, what risk you are taking: if I park my car dangerously, let me consult the Act, look up the section referring to parking of cars in a dangerous position, and see is it worth while.  I do not think that is the intelligent way and I do not think Deputy O'Higgins means that.  Suppose one has done that not once but a second time.  What difference does getting advance warning of how long one will be disqualified for make at that stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether or not you catch him unawares, it is the same offence.  He might not have known it was an offence in the first case, but he must know it is an offence in the second case because he will already have been convicted.  If he has already <Col N="91" /> been convicted of dangerous parking, he knows he must not do it again.  I do not see why we should waste our time, if he does it again, in giving him advance notice of what is coming to him.</P>

He will go around roaring his head off and announcing to everyone how unjustly he has been treated.  He will get very little sympathy, I hope, and the news will get around.  I do not feel that we should go to any further trouble to explain to people beforehand what the penalty for a second offence is.  I imagine the district justice, when convicting a person for the first time would also, as a matter of routine, explain: &ldquo;You have been convicted and I must warn you that a second conviction will result in consequential disqualification.&rdquo;  Even if he does not, and the person repeats the offence, I have no sympathy for him.  I do not think we should waste the time of the House any further worrying about how ignorant he may be as to what is the penalty about to be pronounced upon him.  It will be time enough for the district justice to tell him for how long the disqualification will be, and then he will know.</P>

      <P>I think we are all in agreement that the Minister's amendments are acceptable to everyone in the House.  I can go along with Deputy O'Higgins so far as saying that many a time a person has come to see me in the House and asked me what his rights are under a certain Bill.  I am familiar with this Bill, but there are other Bills with which I am not so familiar and I might advise that person wrongly.  For that reason, I think we should give some consideration to the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputy Lemass is not suggesting that, when this Bill becomes an Act, he would advise a person against dangerous parking because <Col N="92" /> it might result in disqualification. I cannot imagine that Deputy Lemass would do such a thing.  He would say: &ldquo;I must advise you against dangerous parking.&rdquo;  That is the beginning and the end of it.  The various offences are very clearly set out.  You cannot advise a person about the penalty only, and tell him what is coming to him.  If you do advise him wrongly, the judge will correct the mistake remarkably quickly.</P>

      <P>It should be.  Everything should be argued here.  The Deputy visualised a person looking for Section 48 and making very sensible use of this arrangement of the sections, the index.  I cannot see anything to stop him from going on down through the index and seeing: &ldquo;Second Schedule: Offences under this Act involving consequential disqualification orders.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister's attitude, to some extent, because his hands are tied to a very great extent, by the official draftsman.  Were it not for the description applied to him earlier by Deputy Corish when introducing him to Deputy Lemass, I could not understand the attitude of Deputy Sheldon.</P>
      <P>In drafting this legislation, surely it is more easily readable and understood to point out, on every subsection which provides for automatic disqualification, that that subsection means there will be automatic disqualification and to state the period?  No one is likely to go astray or be confused if that is done. I am not fencing with either Deputy Sheldon or Deputy Booth.  It may be all very amusing to have a dialectical discussion as to whether or not we should point out to a person who has committed an offence that he will be disqualified or whether we should simply sit back and let a person take what is coming to him and adopt the attitude: &ldquo;It does not matter whether he knows it; he will find out very quickly when he goes to court.&rdquo;  That may be very amusing and highly entertaining when spoken of in the manner in which Deputy Booth can entertain the House with such talk, but there are many circumstances when it just will not be very amusing, when people are honestly ignorant of the position being created by this Bill, whether we have sympathy with them or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I already pointed out to Deputy Sheldon who spoke on Deputy Booth's point, if we are legislating seriously with the idea of deterring road offences, surely the best and the most effective deterrent is to let a person know what is going to happen to him if he puts a foot wrong?  Take the example of dangerous parking.  Under this Bill dangerous parking is an offence, but the question of disqualification does not arise until there is a second subsequent offence.  If a person offends once, he will pay the penalties provided in the Act and imposed by the court, but he will not necessarily be disqualified from driving.  If that person knows that if he commits that offence a second time he will be disqualified from driving for a minimum <Col N="94" /> period without any discretion left to the court, I think that will be an effective deterrent.</P>
    <P>For the sake of adhering to this form of draftsmanship, which is without precedent as far as road traffic legislation in this country is concerned, why should we throw overboard a valuable deterrent, if we are serious about trying to legislate in such a way as to avoid or minimise road accidents, bad road manners and all the rest of it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I never intended to treat this in a light-hearted way.  We have got to get it into our heads, first, whether we are trying to deal with the deterrent effect or, second, whether we are trying to deal with the confusion in which a person may find himself when charged with a second offence.  I have no sympathy with a person who has been charged and is about to be convicted.  The offence has been committed.  If he is proved guilty, there is nothing we can do about it.  Therefore, the deterrent effect has quite clearly failed.  If anyone wishes seriously, as I hope many people will, to study this Bill, when it is enacted, to find out what he or she is up against as a driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle, one of the things which must hit him or her is that there is a Second Schedule setting out the offences involving consequential disqualification.  I admit that he or she may have lost heart before coming to the Second Schedule.  But, if they confine themselves to a study of the index or the arrangement of sections, they can see, fairly clearly in the Bill as originally drafted, but absolutely clearly under the proposed amendment, all the offences for which disqualification is the penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot feel it is anything other than confusing to have a number of subsections through the Bill.  I think it is very much clearer from the deterrent point of view that it should be set out all in the one page that any one of these second offences must entail disqualification.  That should have a far greater deterrent effect. Once the second offence has been committed, I do not see why we should go to any great trouble to <Col N="95" /> explain to the person charged with the offence what is coming to him. That is the point I had in mind.  As far as the deterrent is concerned, I think the Minister's proposed amendment would be a help.  I cannot see why we should worry about helping a person to understand in advance what the penalty will be.  By that time it is too late; you cannot help him or advise him any more.  You can only advise him on the defence; you cannot advise him about the penalty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I still believe it is a very good thing that all the offences for which one can be disqualified should be gathered into one place. However, I also think there is something in Deputy O'Higgins's argument from the point of view of deterring a person who has committed the offence once and is charged.  I was not aware that in a summons for a second offence you would not be warned that the Schedule came into it.  I would suggest a way out of it.  I agree with the Minister's method of drafting, but Deputy O'Higgins's case might be met by means of a note on the margin of the Bill.  The margin contains before each section a brief note as to the subject matter of the section.  It should be possible to put in the margin before the relevant section a note perhaps saying: &ldquo;See Second Schedule.&rdquo; That would be a clear warning to anyone reading the section to find out about the offence that they should also look at the Second Schedule.  That would not interfere with the drafting but it would bring in that further element of warning to which Deputy O'Higgins referred, and it probably would be useful.  If we can do anything in the Bill to prevent a person repeating an offence by warning him, we should do so.  I assume the courts will warn persons committing a first offence that the penalties for a second will be more severe but it might be no harm if before each of these sections there was a note on the margin referring to the Schedule.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider that suggestion?  It would be of some assistance if, on each <Col N="96" /> of these sections affected by the Schedule, there appeared in the margin the word &ldquo;Schedule&rdquo; or words to that effect.  Even if the Minister wanted to keep up his sleeve&mdash;or up Deputy Booth's sleeve&mdash;what the length of the disqualification would be, it would help, as Deputy Sheldon says, to draw attention to it in some such manner as that.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1) (a), line 48, to delete &ldquo;or of a crime&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment asks the Minister to provide for an automatic disqualification for a period of at least 12 months in the case of a person who uses a mechanically propelled vehicle for the commission of a crime.  It requires two amendments to bring that about.  I shall not press them but I would ask the Minister to give the matter consideration. If he accepts the amendment it will vary the Minister's proposed amendment No. 114.</P>

      <P>To my mind, the effect of the application of what is intended in Amendments Nos. 47 and 48 together would give rise to the situation wherein it could conceivably happen that a person who travelled by bus to the scene of a crime, if the holder of a driving licence, would be disqualified from driving for 12 months.  That is some of what would arise from this amendment.  I do not see the sense in it, although there may be an underlying sense that I do not grasp.</P>

      <P>The reading the Minister takes out of it may be a possibility but obviously it was not intended.  The amendment is intended to refer to the person who uses, in the sense of driving, a car or vehicle&mdash;it may be a lorry&mdash;either on his own or in conspiracy with someone else for the commission of a crime.  However I am not pressing that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 48a:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The operation of a consequential, ancillary or special disqualification order shall be suspended or postponed by reason of an appeal being brought against the order or where the order is related to a conviction against the conviction, unless the Court making the order is satisfied and declares that by continuing to drive the person in respect of whom the order was made would or might be a cause of danger to himself or to others.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is a point of principle involved in this amendment which is of some importance.  The amendment seems to reverse the position which the Minister provides under Section 30 (3).  That subsection provides that where a consequential disqualification order is made, the order shall remain, in so far as the disqualification goes, even when it is under appeal from one court to another.</P>
      <P>My amendment suggests that that should not be so unless the court is of opinion that by continuing to drive the person against whom the order was made will be a danger to himself or to others.  If a person is convicted and disqualified from driving and then appeals to the Circuit Court and the Circuit Court finds that he never should have been convicted and that no disqualification order should have been imposed, it seems to me to be all wrong that that person should in the meanwhile have suffered the consequences of having had the disqualification order imposed on him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, I referred to the matter of the C.I.E. mystery excursions and commented on suggestions that C.I.E. were considering abandoning them. I exhorted the Parliamentary Secretary to inform C.I.E. that the Department of Justice, through the Garda Síochána, would stand behind C.I.E. in the matter of protection, so that the ordinary people throughout the country can enjoy these mystery tours and that a small minority of blackguards will not be allowed in future to impose their will on the country and drive C.I.E. into abandoning these tours.</P>
      <P>Last week, I also spoke of juvenile delinquency and said that, in my opinion, the only way to stop it was through adequate punishment.  Something else that should be considered seriously is the fact that the Garda are the protectors of the people and that if and when Gardaí are brutally assaulted in the course of their duty, the people guilty of such assaults should be punished and not just reprimanded. Only too often such people come into the courts and apologise through their solicitors.  There must be more co-operation by the courts in dealing severely with such people when they are brought before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested during the debate on this Estimate last week that there was no truth in statements that there was dissatisfaction in the Garda Síochána.  Judging from what I have been told and from correspondence I have received, there is great dissatisfaction <Col N="100" /> in the force at the present time.  Much to the credit of the Garda, this dissatisfaction is being borne patiently.  Deputy Lemass spoke of the implementation of the findings of the Garda Arbitration Board and the recommendations for the consolidation of the rent allowance with pay. The Minister also referred to it in his opening speech.  My information is that the Garda got in the neighbourhood of £60 a year as a rent allowance and that if this were consolidated with the pay increase, it would be about £65.  That did not amount to much as a pay increase&mdash; something like 2/- a week.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to compare the rates of pay and allowances here with those in the Six Counties and in Britain.  The comparison is very interesting when we concentrate on the rent allowances.  Here the rent allowance alone amounts to about £60, that is, about 25/- a week.  In the Six Counties, the rent allowance is £2 a week.  Uniforms are provided free in the Six Counties and the boot allowance there is £7 16s. a year.  In London, the rent allowance is £3 2s. 6d. a week and in the provinces in Britain, it is £2 2s. 6d.  The Garda have a cycling allowance of £4 11s. a year and their boot allowance is £5 4s. a year.</P>
    <P>These are comparisons to which I would strongly draw the Minister's attention.  Instead of relying on arbitration boards, I would exhort the Minister, as a fair-minded man, to intervene personally and discuss these matters with representatives of the Garda.  Recently a great number of letters have been appearing in the <i>Garda Review</i>, complaining about the type of accommodation the members of the force have to put up with.  It is all very well to say that Garda stations have some very fine accommodation. There are some splendidly equipped stations in the country but there are twice as many which are not.</P>
    <P>Another bone of contention is the matter of promotions in the Garda. Many people are under the impression that the people who were in the force at the beginning&mdash;the men who <Col N="101" /> built it up&mdash;are being passed over in the matter of promotion.  It is very important that an officer, or a sergeant, or an ordinary Garda for that matter, who has spent all his life in giving faithful and efficient service and in the building up of a magnificent force, should be able to retire after receiving the promotion he deserves.</P>
    <P>Only recently promotion in the higher ranks was given to a man who was 41st on the list.  There have been other promotions in the same way.  This may be a new policy introduced by the Minister or his Department but I would remind them that a similar policy was introduced in the British police force nearly 40 years ago, after World War 1, and the fine officers, with long experience which made criminals known to them and also made known to them how to keep crime at bay were passed over.  I think it was Lord Byng who became Commissioner in Great Britain at that time and he began to promote men who has come through the 1914-18 War and had come into the police force the quick way.  The newspapers or the police force in Britain at the time named these men &ldquo;The Byng Boys&rdquo; after a famous London review.</P>
    <P>As far as the criminals were concerned they had a wonderful time.  The policy had to be changed: there was no substitute for the long experience of the tried officers.  It was good for the force as a whole that every man should know that if he had given years of devotion to his calling as a police officer, promotion would be there for him.  It is a source of great dissatisfaction that men now approaching the end of their time in the Garda are likely to have to come out without any chance of promotion.</P>
    <P>A great many vacancies should be filled within the county.  Promotions from sergeant to inspector should be given to senior sergeants with from 26 to 38 years' service.  There are many very fine senior sergeants in the force who should not be passed over.  This state of affairs does not apply in the Civil Service or any other service.  It is not fair to pick out a junior man and promote him to inspector.  That blocks <Col N="102" /> promotion for 20 or 30 years.  A junior who has joined the Garda and has only a few years' service has one great thing in his favour&mdash;he can afford to wait because he has youth.  The senior man must go out after a couple of years. If he is promoted it means there will be promotion for somebody else in a short time.  The Minister should consider that side of it.</P>
    <P>In October, 1960, according to my information only five senior men were promoted while 11 juniors were promoted sergeants.  I am told that of the many sergeants throughout the country 33 have passed the qualifying examination for inspectorship and 21 of them qualified fully in all subjects, including Irish, which might otherwise be brought up as an obstacle.  The Minister should inquire into this: juniors are being promoted over the heads of seniors.  Pay and allowances in the Garda must be overhauled in view of what is happening in Britain and other places.  We shall not continue to get the fine type of young man to go into the Garda that we are now getting. The Minister may say there are more of them offering than the Depot needs; that may be so to-day but, as things are going, in a short time it could happen when the Garda come to recruit, they will not get the best.</P>
    <P>After four years a Garda sergeant reaches a maximum of £14 a week. That is £10 to £15 less than the pay of his British or Northern Ireland counterpart who reaches a maximum of £24 15. after two years in the rank. That is a very serious difference, although I know we are not as rich as Britain.</P>
    <P>The Garda conducted an investigation into traffic trends in Dublin.  I believe that investigation was made at the behest of German experts who were brought here.  I want the Minister to inquire into the qualifications of these German experts and not take it for granted that they are experts just because they come from Germany. I mentioned this last year, and, although I have not the report with me, I can tell the Minister from memory that the populations of Great Britain. France and Federal Germany are practically the same.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> I have these figures from O.E.E.C. There were 5,000 people killed on the roads of Great Britain in 1959, 6,000 to 7,000 on the roads of France, and 13,000 on the roads of Federal Germany.  Yet we send to Germany for people to come over here to tell us what to do about our traffic problem.  I think the Germans ought to come here to ask us for help in stopping the slaughter on their own roads.  I ask the Minister to investigate the qualifications of this gentleman.</P>
    <P>On the Road Traffic Bill it was stated by several speakers, among them prominent members of my own Party, that 90 per cent. of the motorists on our roads are law-abiding.  I make a count every time I leave my home to come to Dublin.  I ask for the protection of St. Christopher, and many others, on the journey.  I make my count to see how many escapes I have from reckless drivers&mdash;out on the whiteline, on the wrong side of the road, cutting in; I never get less than from seven to 10.  If there is a race meeting, the figure goes up to twenty. We shall have to make these motorists pay attention and the only way we can do that is by prosecuting them.  The only way we can catch them is by having road patrols, moving about in cars which are not easily identifiable and which are not manned by uniformed police.  Some people may accuse the Department of Justice of permitting the Garda to have joy rides. I should like to see them having joy rides for the purpose of knocking some manners and some courtesy into the heads of the barbarians who are now using our roads.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister will tackle the problem of cyclists and pedestrians in Dublin.  Dublin pedestrians are determined they will not give way to anyone.  Their nerves must be very good.  I have asked people from other countries what they think of our traffic and they tell me it is appalling. that they have never seen anything like it anywhere.  Pedestrians and cyclists could not care less.  They must say more fervent prayers to St. Christopher than I do because they <Col N="104" /> always seem to escape the consequences of their folly.  There are some who say that the schools should teach children road safety.  The Garda have done an excellent job in lecturing in the schools.  It is up to the parents to give the children some kind of instruction and good example.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will accord to me his usual courtesy by answering the questions I have asked.  His example could be followed with advantage by some of his colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note from the Minister's opening statement that crime has decreased considerably in the city of Dublin.  I take this opportunity of thanking the Minister on behalf of the citizens and complimenting the Garda authorities who have done such an excellent job.  The position has improved considerably since the Minister took office in 1957. We then had to deal with the teddy boy menace.  While there are still some, the numbers are small as compared with four years ago.  This city should be one in which ordinary people can walk the streets without being interfered with by young blackguards using knives.  The severest punishment should be meted out to anybody found with a knife.  It is a shocking state of affairs that youngsters going to school or the cinema should be molested by young ruffians. Fortunately the situation has improved considerably in that respect.</P>
      <P>We all deplore the vandalism on the C.I.E. tours.  I hope that the culprits will be brought to justice.  Thousands of our citizens are anxious to avail of these tours and it is an intolerable situation that a few boys of the teddy boy type should deprive people of this pleasure.  I sincerely hope the tours will not stop and that law will prevail. If it does not, we shall have mob law. I appeal to the Minister to co-operate with C.I.E. to the fullest extent possible to bring those responsible to answer for their shocking behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the Minister has made a further advance in relation to housing for the Garda.  He has appointed a superintendent in charge.  I am very happy that a responsible officer should be put <Col N="105" /> in charge for the purpose of investigating the position and finding out what improvements can be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister visited a number of Garda barracks in the city and went to the trouble of trying to find out some things at first hand.  Nevertheless, a number of our barracks leave a lot to be desired in the matter of the comfort of the men.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the living quarters, especially of the single men who have to do night duty, are comfortable. They should not have to sleep in a room through which men on day duty have to pass because these men need an undisturbed sleep after they have been on night duty.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see the day rooms improved.  They seem to be the same today as they were 30 years ago.  They are very cold, forbidding places and while we do not want to see them absolutely up-to-date, at least they should be improved considerably. They should be more cheerful for the men who have to work in them and for the people who, reluctantly, are compelled to visit Garda barracks from time to time.</P>
    <P>I have also received complaints about the huts at Mountjoy Prison.  I was told only this evening that some of the huts around the prison in which both uniformed and plain clothes men have to stay are anything but comfortable.  That is particularly so on wet and windy nights and, indeed, some of the prisoners inside seem to be better off.  I am bringing this matter to the notice of the Minister in the hope that he will do something about it.  I suppose there is nothing I can say about the Commission on Itinerants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Just in case I should forget the point, I should say, and I do not mean any reflection on the Guards, that the reduction in crime is not entirely due to the alertness of the Guards. They do their duty, but, just to correct the Deputy, a very large number of people who would otherwise be very active here are over in England.  That is one of the reasons crime is down and I know what I am talking about.</P>
      <P>I mentioned once before that I was engaged in running dances in the past. One might ask: &ldquo;What has that got to do with the matter?&rdquo;  It has a lot to do with it because a person who runs dances is in touch with thousands of people every night of the year.  I met many people and I met all sorts of people.  I have had Ministers of State at my dances and pickpockets and streetwalkers and people of every sort. It so happens that I was in London during the summer and I encountered many people I knew because I had met them in Dublin.  I knew a number of them to have been beggars in Mountjoy and they were in London.  I spoke to them and they told me all their pals were over there.  I spoke to a man only a couple of days ago&mdash;he was with me in connection with a house and I shall mention no names&mdash;and I asked him about his two sons who had been in Mountjoy.  He said they were in jail in England.  Those are facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy McGilligan opened the debate, he wanted to know why a Parliamentary Secretary had been appointed and said that he believed that the offices of Defence and Justice should be combined.  I do not accept that at all because the mentality of the man in charge of Defence, organising wars and spilling blood, would be different <Col N="107" /> from that of the man in charge of Justice, looking after children's homes and so forth.</P>
    <P>In regard to the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary, I understand that the Minister will not be back in the House after the next general election. I do not know if that is true, but if it is true, it is only natural that someone should be appointed who knows the ropes.  That would justify the appointment.  It would be wrong to have a complete &ldquo;rookey&rdquo; coming into a Department because it would take a man coming into a Department for the first time months to know what is what and he would be at the complete mercy of the civil servants so that it does pay to have a person who is responsible and who will know the ropes from the beginning.</P>
    <P>While I am not here to pay compliments, I can say that I am satisfied with the Parliamentary Secretary who, I believe, is a most competent man and very anxious to go ahead.  That is what we want and again I intend no reflection on the Minister, who has spent all his life on the job, but it is true that a new brush sweeps clean, whether we like it or not.  There is a lot of work to be done in the matter of law reform and the Parliamentary Secretary will be a good man, assuming he is fortunate enough to continue in office.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not get up here solely to compliment people; I criticise people, too.  I speak according to what I believe.  Some people patronise one Party as against another, but I do not do that.  Deputy Lemass made a proposal that we should have mounted Guards here and he mentioned the success of the horse police in London. There are a lot of things we would like to have but there is the question of utility and the question of expense and I do not think there is any need for such police here.  In London there are 9,000,000 people, with huge crowds and processions, visiting Royalty and all that kind of thing, and you need something like the horse police to keep order.  There is very little of that here.  It would be expense <Col N="108" /> that we cannot afford.  We are told here that the aim is streamlining, efficiency, and so on.  Mounted police would be very expensive.  I do not know what the mounted police would be doing other than showing off in O'Connell St. as the Horse Guards do in London.  There is no work for them to do in this city.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Ban-Ghardaí have lived up to the reputation that was given to them in the sense of being of any great utility as a uniformed force.  They would be an important addition to the Garda Síochána as a plain clothes force.  As I see it, they are merely substituting for Gardaí on point duty.  I do not think they can do the job as well as the Gardaí do it.  When a Garda is controlling traffic, people who do not wait for his signal get a frown or a shout from him.  I could not imagine girls frowning or shouting.  I imagine that they would not be able to control traffic as well as male Gardaí.  Without having any objection to the employment of females, I am not at all in agreement with females taking the place of males.  The Ban-Ghardaí would be of real service as a plain clothes force.</P>
    <P>I was in a cinema queue last week. There was a troublesome person there. Her method was to make herself a nuisance.  She did not threaten but just got in the way.  People gave her money to get her out of the way.  I have noticed this person on other occasions doing the same thing.  A Garda approached but when she saw him coming she walked off and when the Garda went away she came back again. If the Ban-Ghardaí were in &ldquo;civvies&rdquo; they could arrest such a person quite simply.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous amount of pilfering from stores.  There is soliciting on the streets.  In such cases Ban-Ghardaí in &ldquo;civvies&rdquo; could be useful.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the Ban-Ghardaí should be disbanded, but I suggest that they should be a non-uniformed force, in which case they would be of tremendous service.  They are not doing the work that I thought they would be doing.  I did not envisage that they would be walking up and <Col N="109" /> down the town in uniform or doing point duty.  They would be much better employed on the work they were intended to do, that is, watching out for cases of soliciting and pilfering from stores and for professional beggars annoying people on the street.  That kind of work can be done only by non-uniformed police who can arrest offenders before they have a chance to get away.  I mention that matter because it is important.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that there is need for law reform.  I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister the practice of employing sheriffs to collect debts. A woman came to me three months ago and told me that she had got a loan of £10 and had to pay 39 per cent. interest. It is amazing that people can get power to charge such a high rate of interest.  Because she did not pay on the nail each week they piled £2 or £3 solicitor's costs on her and then handed the case to the sheriff.  Once the sheriff decides to handle a case he must get £3 3s.  This poor woman got a bill for £19.  She had had the £10 for only about a year.</P>
    <P>The same applies in the case of corporation tenants.  If the sheriff is notified to carry out an eviction he must get £3 3s. although the case may be settled.  The tenant must pay that £3 3s.  The whole question of the sheriff and his powers and functions must be considered in some future law reform.  I understand that where an order has been made against a person for debt and where there is a return of &ldquo;no goods&rdquo; the sheriff gets nothing.  I understand also that the sheriff may send anybody at all to the person's home to see what goods he has and on the information of that person the sheriff acts.</P>
    <P>These are small points that were brought home to me by a solicitor who asked me to suggest that the question of the sheriff and his powers ought to be re-examined.</P>
    <P>I shall now mention a matter that I have mentioned on other occasions.  It is the question of court costs.  I cannot understand why a person cannot obtain costs from the State.  A person is dragged into court and is found not <Col N="110" /> guilty.  He may have had to engage a solicitor or junior or senior counsel. He may have to pay out £40 or hundreds of pounds.  In the case of litigation between citizens the innocent party gets costs but where the State is involved the successful party gets no costs.  There is nothing as unfair as that and the time will come when something will be done about it.  It is another case where law reform is necessary.</P>

      <P>During the year I asked the Minister a question on the subject of slings and I do not think I got a satisfactory reply.  I asked him to ban catapults and slings.  His answer was: &ldquo;What is the use of doing that; they can be too easily made.&rdquo;  Catapults are on sale in huckster shops at 3d. each That creates a temptation.  If a boy had to make a sling, he might not bother.  If the sale of slings were banned, for every person who would make a sling 1,000 would not bother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a question at Dublin Corporation recently and elicited the information that 11,000 bulbs are smashed annually as a result of slings. In most cases, these bulbs are protected by a wire net but a small stone can get inside it.  It must be remembered that this refers only to the damage done to Corporation bulbs and not to windows.  I have to report that as many as 800 windows in the Seán MacDermott Street-Summerhill area were smashed with stones.  I am only talking about the damage done to Dublin Corporation property.  I am not referring to the damage done all over the city to citizens' property.  I hold that slings should be banned.  What does one get a sling for?  You do not get it for the purpose of stretching the rubber. You put something in it in order to fire it.  You must fire it.  You get no &ldquo;kick&rdquo; out of buying a sling and looking at it or throwing a piece of paper.  The &ldquo;kick&rdquo; consists of firing <Col N="111" /> the stone and hearing the crack of glass. Children love to hear glass cracking. This is a serious matter.  Slings should be banned.  They can do no good but can cause a great deal of harm.</P>
    <P>With regard to flick knives, I understand they are banned in Britain and many people are worried that they will make their appearance here in consequence. You cannot ban all knives. For example, boy scouts require knives but the flick knife is different.  It is the flick which gives the teddy boy the &ldquo;kick.&rdquo;  It turns him into a kind of Caesar.  That particular type of knife should be banned.  The flick knife enables a young fellow to show off when he brings the knife out.  That is the impression he wants to put over on his pals.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Courts Bill, I mentioned that I intended to refer to the wearing of wigs.  Last year, I objected to the terms &ldquo;lordship&rdquo; and &ldquo;worship&rdquo; as a form of address.  What I advocated is now becoming law.  As I am on the subject, I will just ask the Minister to consider banning the use of wigs as well as banning the terms of &ldquo;lordship&rdquo; and &ldquo;worship.&rdquo;  The wig makes an inexperienced person in court feel afraid.  Half of the people who go to court may be hardened individuals but the other half have probably never been in a court in their lives.  They are there because of some litigation.</P>
    <P>I happened to be in court in connection with the case of a girl who met with an accident.  In the Criminal Court, for example, there is usually a crowd of onlookers and one is not afraid but in the courts which deal with these insurance cases, there is no one there but the witness.  I saw this little girl shivering. I said I was going to the Dáil but she asked me to stay.  In court were the judge and all the counsel bewigged. They gave her the impression they were a lot of demons or that she was in some other world.  Wigs are likely to create a kind of over-lordship sort of feeling in the person cross-examining a witness and the witness is likely to be confused.  The witness I speak of was confused.  I know her case.  She made two or three mistakes and said she did not know what she was saying.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> There should be no wigs.  There is no need for that kind of thing.  This is a Republic.  I cannot conceive counsel in the United States wearing wigs. Wigs remind me of the pictures I saw of the Estates General in France.  All at one side were bewigged gentlemen with buckle shoes, while on the other side were the ordinary people.  Wigs should be done away with.  I can understand counsel wearing a gown. I cannot understand why they wear a wig.  To me, it seems to be a &ldquo;sissy-looking&rdquo; thing.</P>

      <P>I will not press the matter.  There is one other matter I should like the Minister to consider. I refer to the form of address in the courts.

      <P>I would refer the Minister to a statement in one of this evening's papers in regard to raiding of Congo veterans for guns.

      <P>While different Departments of State are of importance in the everyday life of the people, such as Industry and Commerce and Local Government, there is one Department which should be completely at one with the interests of the people, that is, the Department of Justice.  There are many weak links in the chain of justice in this country.  It is essential that we should speak our minds on this Estimate. In view of all the facts which must be known to the Minister, I would ask him to make sure that in dealing with the people as a whole, no special concessions will be given to any section. I have in mind a position in the county I come from.  It is of little use to speak of justice if we ignore moral values and if the servants of the State from the Minister down do not uphold moral standards and values.  It is known to the Department and the Minister that even in Cork city some people, a very small minority, thank goodness, have set themselves up as being immune from justice.  Where it is proved to all concerned, from the Minister down, that moral standards are being lowered to the detriment of the people not only in Cork and Dublin but elsewhere, they should ensure that the culprits will be made accountable for the conditions that are so prevalent.</P>
      <P>I would much prefer not to have to speak on this but there is little use in the Minister telling us the number of prosecutions during the year, the number of people fined for not having dog licences, the number of people fined for not having a rear light on a bicycle. When the law is broken in this way, these people should be fined, but it is tragic to note that while we speak of an increase in prosecutions under these headings, some people can flout the law and laugh at the moral standards that we as a nation must be prepared to uphold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is alarming that we have people going around in motor cars waylaying young girls.  Where is the law and where is the justice when this can be done?  I can give one instance that happened no later than last night. An accident occurred in which one person was killed and another seriously <Col N="115" /> injured and within one hundred yards of that scene, four ruffians stopped their car and tried to interfere with young women who were travelling along the road minding their own business.  Yet the Minister tells us that crime is on the decline. How can we be complacent when this rowdyism is so prevalent?  If we believe in Christian principles, we should practise them.  I laugh at people in this House who point out: &ldquo;If the law is broken, there is something wrong with the person who breaks it.&rdquo;  We are following England and America on that line.  There is pity for the person who breaks the law but there is no pity for the victim, for the girl going the road who is in danger of being waylaid.  I ask the Minister to advise those responsible for administering justice to ensure that the traditions we hold dear, as those before us have done, will be respected and that no mercy whatever will be shown to such offenders against our moral standards.</P>
    <P>There is another item which I have raised with the Minister's predecessors. It is in regard to children in court.  We have not reached the stage where we can say things are getting better in that respect.  I would not for a moment advocate the drastic treatment of children if they break the law, but we all know that parents are shielded from publicity.  We know also that in many instances not only do children break the law once, but two or three times.  We have heard the stories of parents in court: something or other happened and they could not supervise the conduct of the children; they promise the children will be good in future and the judge lets them off. If children break the law, I believe it is completely the fault of the parents in a high percentage of cases.</P>
    <P>The names of juveniles who break the law are not published, naturally, but I would suggest to the Minister that where a boy or girl breaks the law, or defies the law, on a second occasion, the names of the parents should be published.  We do not want to victimise anyone, but what of the victims in a case where damage is done?  We <Col N="116" /> are always prepared to help what may be termed the under-dog, but in a case where the under-dog destroys public property, or damages his neighbour's house, the under-dog, in this case, the juvenile, knows that his or her name will not be published and that his or her parents need not worry.  The delinquents stay out until 10 o'clock or 12 o'clock at night, or 1 o'clock in the morning, breaking the law, and their parents smugly know that their chances of being sent to a reformatory school are very slight.  We must have a change in that regard.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have these problems reconsidered.  Dublin is a very large city and it has, naturally, a high percentage of such cases, but the same applies to all the other cities.  As I said at the outset, unless this Department, which is so closely connected with the lives and the welfare of the people, and the Minister are prepared to give a lead, I am afraid there is no use in the Minister saying that things are getting better when we know in our hearts that things are certainly getting worse.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to the conditions of the Garda.  I agree with those Deputies who criticised the removal of the rent allowances.  I agree with Deputies who spoke about what they knew to be true and what I know to be true&mdash;the conditions under which some members of the Garda have to live in some of our country barracks. I am afraid that some of the cells are not much worse than many of the places in which these young men must live.  Is that fair to them?  After all, of all the servants of the State, they are one section upon which we must depend above all others to enforce law and order.  If we are anxious to get young men of high standards into the Garda, it is our duty, and the duty of the Minister, to see that their living conditions are such that they will not have, as they have at the moment, reason for complaint.  I do not know anything about their conditions in the city of Dublin or the city of Cork, but I do know the country areas.  It is very unfair that these young men must continue to exist&mdash;because existence is all it is&mdash;in some of these old barracks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> Many of our young Gardaí are not satisfied on the question of promotion, and there has been discontent for some time.  My experience has been that they are most reasonable men but many of them can point out different instances where they considered that denial of promotion was unfair.  We must be above board in this regard.  It is essential that fair play be given every member of the force.  There must be no question whatsoever of favouritism.</P>
    <P>We must not go back to the stage which I know obtained prior to 1948, when certain members of the Garda had, of necessity, to join some of the private cells or clubs of a certain political Party, because they realised their future welfare was at stake if they did not.  I do not want to see that happening again.  If that were to happen again, the country would suffer and at the present time the country is suffering enough, because men are leaving the force and emigrating because they found the conditions here anything but satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I know also from my own personal experience in different parts of County Cork, of cases where members of the Garda did their duty; where they were satisfied there was a breach of the law they brought the culprit before the court to ensure that justice would be done.  The tragic thing is that in many cases many members of the Garda have given up as a bad job the bringing of prosecutions before the courts, because time after time the decisions have been such that the Garda have been made a laughing-stock by people who should be behind bars, but who apparently got away with it on some pretext or some excuse presented by their legal defenders and accepted by the court.</P>

I say that with all <Col N="118" /> earnestness and sincerity.  We have not been blind to the fact that on different occasions where decisions have been given they were a disgrace to those who sat on the Bench.  The Minister should ensure that that does not continue. If it should continue it is a case of &ldquo;God help Ireland and God help the Department of Justice.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the Estimate for the Department of Justice has been evoking a growing interest in recent years.  That interest is not associated with concern about what is provided in this Vote for expenditure by the Department during the year.  It is attributable, almost entirely, to the alarming increase in crime in recent years.  The general public are very uneasy about the situation as they see it at the moment.  They look to the Department of Justice to provide them with the necessary protection for their persons and their property, and they look to the Department of Justice to make the necessary provision for the detection of crime and the punishment of criminals.  It is only on an Estimate such as this that they can get any assurance from the Minister that the policy of the Department is that they will bring culprits to justice, and pursue relentlessly those responsible for crimes against our citizens and against the property of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were edified to hear the Minister state that there was a decrease of 14 per cent. in indictable crimes in 1960, as against the 1959 figure.  He said also that there was an increase in the detection of crime from 50 per cent. to 60 per cent.  This is to the credit of the Department of Justice. No doubt it will bring cause for hope to the people.  The Minister outlined three causes for the improvement in the Department's efforts to meet this crime menace.  He mentioned the increase in the Garda force.  Years ago, because of the peaceful conditions which existed, there was a conviction among many people that we could do with fewer Gardaí.  The strength of the stations was reduced in some areas and barracks were closed in others. Time has proved it was wise that the <Col N="119" /> Department did not pursue that policy, because it would be necessary now to restore some of these stations.  It was very noticeable, too, that when a Garda station came to be closed, the whole parish were up in arms protesting about the loss of their barracks, even though they may not have always co-operated with the Garda to the extent one would expect.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned also that the success of the efforts to reduce crime was partly attributable to co-operation from the public.  If we are ever to make any impact on the crime menace and reduce it to a reasonable minimum, it will be necessary to get the co-operation of all the people. We know that in the past the Garda have had to live down a suspicion built up over the years.  There was an old saying in the countryside that one can never trust a policeman.  I believe that still exists.  When we were ruled by an outside Government, which had its police force here, there was a feeling of distrust and suspicion.  Unfortunately, many of the older generation still maintain that distrust and suspicion.</P>
    <P>We must realise that the Garda are an institution established here under a native Government.  They are there for the protection of the people.  They are our best friends and they deserve every co-operation the people can give them.  They have been very exemplary over the years and have set a fine example&mdash;an example that future Gardaí should at least try to live up to, if not to emulate.  It would be a pity if the Garda, in their efforts to put people's minds at ease and assure them they are doing their best, did not get the necessary co-operation from the public.</P>
    <P>For that reason, there is some substance in what other Deputies have stated here&mdash;that the Garda should be a fully contented force and that they should get every consideration.  They have got an increase in recent times and the rent allowance was incorporated in their basic pay.  It was a pity that in the application of that recent <Col N="120" /> increase, it was not made retrospective for at least one year, because those Gardaí who retired during 1959 feel a grievance in that respect.  I suppose nothing can be done about that now, except through their Representative Body, but at least our police force should be assured that their interests will be well safeguarded, financially and otherwise, by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us he was providing an extra 29 Garda cars during the coming year.  I admit Garda cars are necessary for the present activities of the force.  In the case of accidents on the road, and particularly of the hit-and-run driver, there is no way of tracking the offender down except with a car.  At the same time, we should not overdo mechanisation.  The presence of a Garda on foot in the streets of any town is always an assurance that the people may rely on him that nothing will go wrong.  The Garda car sometimes loses its value by advertising itself.  The criminal knows the Garda car is in the vicinity and carries out his operations in such a way as to elude the vigilance of those in the car.</P>
    <P>In addition, I respectfully suggest that the young men going into the Garda would benefit by regular exercise on foot or even with the ordinary pedal bicycle.  Let the older Gardaí, who have been in the force for years, have the ease the car provides.  They have the experience.  I have no doubt the young Garda driving the car will benefit by having the older Garda beside him, and that both will have a balanced approach to their duty.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that we should have mounted police.  I cannot see that mounted police would be of any use whatever here.  The only place they would be useful is in charging a mob, and we do not have such things very frequently here.  In any event, we have the Army with horses available.  With the smooth surface on the streets in Dublin it would be very difficult, if not impossible. to have mounted police make a charge. It was mentioned they would be very useful on ceremonial occasions.  For a small island like this, I think we have <Col N="121" /> far too many ceremonial occasions.  We always have the Army to fall back on for a mounted cavalcade, if the need should arise.</P>
    <P>With regard to the deterrents to crime, there is great belief that the greatest deterrent of all is the justice on the bench, that he should be more severe in the penalties he imposes&mdash; to use the common jargon, that he should be tougher in dealing with crime. There is a big volume of worthwhile opinion which advocates that the &ldquo;cat&rdquo; should be restored for crimes of a certain nature.  It would be the greatest deterrent of all for these young desperadoes, with guns and knives in their hands, who have no respect for person.  No matter how cruel, how inhuman or how brutal the &ldquo;cat&rdquo; may be in such cases, we have to consider that the attacks made by these people are brutal, inhuman and cruel and that they must be met with their own methods.  The very fact of having it here would, in itself, be a useful deterrent against these youthful criminals, the result of whose activities we see so frequently.  This new type of crime, this stabbing business, is the most reprehensible of all.  I do not know what the Department can do.  It certainly should be checked at the beginning. I believe it is an importation from abroad.  Those who use a knife or other weapon to stab another person should be made to feel the full penalty of the law.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about prisons.  I do not want to have prison a paradise for anybody.  The essentials of a prison are: cleanliness, good ventilation, useful occupations, good food and good reading material. Prison should be a place of correction. Occasionally it may be of benefit if lectures could be given on civic obligations and a person's duty to the State and other citizens.  Prisoners should be encouraged in every way to reform their lives.  I would not make the prisons so attractive that some prisoners would like to go back to them as they do in some cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very wise in his decision to allow prisoners with good conduct records parole on certain <Col N="122" /> occasions, such as a family bereavement or, perhaps, a festive occasion. That has worked well and it should be encouraged.  It is gratifying to hear that those who availed of the privilege honoured their bond.</P>
    <P>We saw recently in the public Press that the internees in the Six Counties have all been released.  I believe that is good and it is more or less on a par with the Minister's attitude with regard to prisoners in this country.  I agree that the internees in the North were in on a different type of charge; they were detained on suspicion.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to refer to the Border incidents.  We all deplore them.  They serve no purpose now. They are a reflection on ourselves because the whole circumstances have changed in the past three decades.  We see today in the world around us that society is moving into two great camps &mdash;the democratic States with the old Christian concept and the Communists. We cannot afford in this little island to have divisions.  We must assume the unfortunate people now in jail in Belfast are there because of our political troubles.  Unfortunately, they are impregnated with the fall-out from our political troubles and also because of the lip service given to Partition over the years.  I feel they were misled.  They were carried away in their youthful enthusiasm and I am sure they are now disillusioned.</P>
    <P>Some positive step should be taken by the Government, by members of the Government or by men in high places in co-operation with the Church dignitaries along the Border to ease this problem.  Some effort should be made to approach the leaders who have any influence at all with these misguided youths.  The Government would lose no prestige.  Nothing but good could emerge from some effort to make contact with those people so as to influence the lads now serving in Belfast Jail.  If that were done and any sort of understanding reached, I believe all of these boys would be released. We regret that they are there but we cannot in any way condone their actions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> A great deal was said about law reform.  I am not a lawyer and I do not want to go into that.  I believe we cannot advocate law reform here; the Chair would not allow it.  However, there is one aspect of that matter which I could criticise.  I refer to some obsolete regulations that still exist in this country in connection with land registration. It arises every day where there is transfer of a plot for a house or some transfer of land.  In the old days, when the Land Acts came to be operated in this country, the question of equity was left in abeyance.  Now we must go back two or three generations to clear the equities.  It takes a lot of exhaustive searching.  Solicitors are sometimes slow in assimilating the necessary facts and people are left without their money for years because of that.  There should be a limit.</P>
    <P>It may be assumed in most cases that the equities are only a matter of form.  Something should be done to help the officials in the Land Registry to expedite the clearance of titles.  I have been there very often.  I received the greatest courtesy, expedition and efficiency from these officials.  All along the line, from perhaps 60 or 80 or 100 years back, titles have to be examined and the position of the various people who had the property that was under transfer.  Searches must be made.  That involves undue delay.  It is impossible for the officials in the Land Registry to act with expedition.  The mapping Department is very congested.  No praise of mine could be adequate for the service, help and expedition the officials in the Examiners Section give in the course of their business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In keeping with every other Department we see increases here.  The only redeeming feature of the increases is the increase in detection. We are still behind all that is desired.  I do not wish to say that it is all the fault of the Garda; we should go a bit of the road ourselves in the provision of proper equipment for the quick tracking down of crime.  We should have more use in country districts of the two-way radio system.  The Minister is beginning to try it around Cork and some other places but I <Col N="124" /> should like to see it in other cities.  I feel that when Gardaí are on the spot as quickly as they possibly can by the use of this equipment it helps to stamp out a lot of this crime.  If we are in earnest, we should take steps to see that such equipment is provided throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of children in court.  We have a very peculiar position in our courts.  We allow the public to look on at young children, some of whom are quite innocent except that they have been dragged into court by some blackguard a few years their senior.  People may ask what the parents are doing.  You will find, in most cases of children in court, that the father is away in England or somewhere else and that the mother is finding it very difficult to control them.  One young blackguard in an area will contaminate the lot.  He will be the cause of dragging decent children into court. Where that is the case, the court should always be held <i>in camera.</i></P>
      <P>It is time we had a ban on airguns and knives, be they flick knives or any form of knife.  The Minister should take steps to ensure that children under 16 or possibly 18 years of age will not be permitted to have an airgun.  By the time a boy is 18 years of age he will not be interested in them.  Airguns have caused a lot of damage to windows and to lights and the young blackguard is never seen.  If we had plain clothes men on the look-out I think we would get somewhere so far as stopping this form of crime is concerned.</P>
      <P>So much for the use or abuse of airguns and flick knives.  I want to refer now to our teddy boys, our young hooligans.  There is hardly a night in country districts when you do not hear as much hooliganism as in the city.  One can hear them rolling home in the middle of the night from dances. It is time the Garda were given a free hand to deal with such conduct.  If our plain clothes men were given, as they say in our area, a few ash plants and the Minister said &ldquo;Go ahead&rdquo; they would put an end to a lot of hooliganism within a week.  That is the only way to handle these gentlemen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> It is about time our plain-clothes men directed their attention to the number of hooligans who use profane language as easily in our streets as they would smoke a cigarette.  If any Deputy walks from here to O'Connell Street at any hour of the day or night he will hear it.  These hooligans think nothing of using it aloud in public. Of course if a Garda in uniform is passing he will not hear it.  I am putting this before the Minister in the hope that he will adopt the method I suggest of dealing with those gentlemen.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has been causing grave concern to parents is the facility with which young boys and girls can walk up the gangway of a boat at either the North Wall or Dún Laoghaire and set sail for England. We hear stories of children missing every day of the week.  Last year when I raised this question the Minister's reply was that they could just as easily cross the Border into the Six Counties. At least, let us not make it too easy for them.  Let us try to put a stop to it at some stage.  It is the cause of great worry and hardship to parents to find that a child has disappeared overnight and probably is not found for months somewhere in Britain. There should be greater attention paid at our ports to stop this kind of thing. At one time it was necessary for people to have passports or permits.  Now these are not necessary.</P>
    <P>Another matter causing grave concern throughout the country is the question of the removal of remains of people killed or drowned from the scene of the occurrence.  There has been very unfavourable comment throughout the country because the remains of such people will not be accepted by the local boards of health who say it is the responsibility of the Garda.  There is no locality outside of Dublin where the Garda are properly equipped to deal with such matters and consequently remains have been left lying for hours because the Department of Health quibble about responsibility in the matter.  It is time we definitely placed responsibility on the proper shoulders.  We are supposed to be Christians so let us act as Christians should.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> Hardship is being caused in the matter of the calling of juries.  One remedy for this would be to have jury panels enlarged.  It is most unfair in country areas to have a man coming to court day after day, not knowing whether he will be called this week or the next. Fathers of families are particularly worried and sometimes are put to grave losses.  Recently we received a circular from the Women's Association of Social Workers requesting the extension of the right to serve on juries to women. I would not say we should force women into jury panels but if they volunteer for such work I think they should be accepted.  I do not know what is the position in this respect but there are cases in which women jurors could play a very important part.</P>
    <P>In the matter of recruitment to the Garda, I would urge the Minister to pay greater attention to the matter of sport, particularly boxing, in the force. There was great respect for the Garda when they were winning world championships. In those days they brought great honour to the country in the same way as the Army jumping team do at the moment.  I hope the Minister will give attention to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>On the question of films for children, we hear daily reports of children under 16 not being allowed into cinemas at night.  The odd thing about it is that the same film has been shown at a matinée earlier that day. Is it only at night that the film affects their minds?  Parents do not seem to know what a bad film is.  On Sundays during the winter, when they want to get the children out of the house from under their feet, they pack them off to the picture house.  How are parents to know what is or what is not a suitable film?  Advertisements saying: &ldquo;Children under 16 not allowed&rdquo;, are only an inducement to children to go and see them.  The question of suitability of films for children should be stressed to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>Another matter worrying our local authorities is the provision of suitable courthouse accommodation.  It is about time that responsibility in this matter also were placed on the proper shoulders&mdash;those of the Department of Justice who, after all, get most out of <Col N="127" /> the administration of the law.  Some of this money should be ploughed back by way of grants to help local authorities meet the demands for more courthouses.</P>
    <P>We are soon to have a new Traffic Act and now, before it becomes law, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the necessity for more of the sticker-type warning for breaches of the law relating to traffic.  It is quite common in Dublin and we should like to see that practice extended to the country.  There is hardly a Deputy who does not break the traffic laws occasionally; I myself was pulled only a few days ago and I got my warning.  Such warnings, given at the proper times, would serve to engender proper respect for the law.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputies who drew the Minister's attention to the great need throughout the country for the renovation of Garda stations.  Some stations are not fit for prisoners.  In my own town, there is a station which is a great discredit to the Department.  It is about time the Minister did something about it.  Recently the Minister said he had no complaints in this respect. How could he when the members of the Garda are afraid that, if they did complain, they might be shifted out of the town?  In conclusion, I should like to compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has handled his Department in the past few years.  He has been most approachable and any member of the House who had occasion to go to him looking for justice was given justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The group of Estimates for which the Minister is responsible totals approximately £6¾ million but that sum does not bear any relation to the importance of the Minister's Department. It embraces the two arms of the law, the law officers who bring cases before the courts with the assistance of the Garda and the courts who enforce the law.  While there might be minor criticism of the administration of justice, on the whole we are well served by our system which is well-founded. The people generally know that justice is to be found in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> It is in regard to bringing culprits before the courts that there is some disquiet. As others have said, that is not the fault of the Garda whether uniformed, in plain clothes or members of the detective branch but it is due to the fact that nowadays crime is of an organised type.  We seem to have had people coming in from abroad&mdash;and I might mention being successfully met on occasion in this country.  In the ordinary way we have not the amount of co-operation which the public generally should give to those charged with the detection of offences and helping to bring offenders before the courts. One is tempted to ask: have we sufficient Gardaí at present to deal with the problem?</P>
    <P>Looking at the Estimates before me I find that the Garda strength in all sections between 1960-61 and 1961-62 provides for an increase of approximately only 20.  No doubt with modern advances, the use of mobile facilities such as the squad car may help to minimise the need for Gardaí but that is something that would apply in the cities more than in rural areas. My colleague, Deputy Manley, referred to this matter and said that it was regrettable that we had some rural stations shut down.  If we have a Garda or two left in an area it assures the people there of somebody to whom they may look for protection in case of even petty crime in the area.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to technical developments of the present day and in that connection advances in respect of two-way communications are very helpful.  No doubt in cities like Dublin and Cork&mdash;we are to have it also in Limerick&mdash;such systems may bring assistance more readily to people who find somebody on their property or discover some petty pilfering or something of that kind.  It will help to bring offenders to justice more quickly.</P>
    <P>We should, nevertheless, consider seriously whether we should not bring up the strength of the force to deal with present day problems.  It has been said that what we want is a contented force.  Naturally we were glad that the Garda recently got an award but there is one thing in that <Col N="129" /> connection about which younger Gardaí&mdash;who are the important members nowadays&mdash;have a justifiable sense of grievance.  It is the fact that something like £1 a week of their pay is deducted in respect of quarters.  We should try to arrive at a fair decision as to what is a reasonable amount to charge these young men on their initial pay for the quarters provided. Where a number of men occupy the same room there should be a recognition of that; they should have no grievance in regard to the charge.</P>
    <P>In rural areas where the local sergeant and Garda occupy what one might call a rural station, in a great many cases these are rented premises and the rents follow the pattern applicable in the area of the station, about £50 or £60.  In those circumstances, to ask the officer occupying the premises to pay £1 a week would be manifestly unfair because then the State has the building for nothing.  It has an office in which the local transactions of the Department of Justice are dealt with at little or no cost.  In many cases in rural areas these premises do not provide the type of accommodation one would expect for £52 a year.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the reduction in crime at present.  That is very welcome and so far as the Garda and the Department are responsible it is very praiseworthy.  We would probably make further advances if our people gave that co-operation to the Garda to which they are entitled as our friends and protectors.  I fear the spirit still prevails in the country whereby anything connected with bringing people before the courts is regarded as it was in the past, when the courts here were the seats of administration of foreign justice and were resented as such.  Evidently we have not grown away from that and there is great need for a reawakening of a public sense of responsibility in these matters.  Many public statements have been made by the Church at various times, by Ministers and by Deputies, and the Press have played their part but something seems to be lacking.  I prefer to think that is due to the problem of juvenile delinquency <Col N="130" /> at present but the juveniles of to-day are the men and women of to-morrow.</P>
    <P>Nobody can deny that in this country as in other countries there is this problem, but it is not proportionately greater here as compared with other countries.  It is mainly a problem of environment and the rapidity with which young people today grow up. A greater interest should be taken, I think, in the various social groups in inculcating in these young people a proper sense of their obligations to society in general and to themselves in particular. If the Department of Justice has any funds at its disposal, it could further the works of these groups and in that way make a worthwhile contribution to helping these young people towards forming proper ideas and acquiring a better sense of responsibility towards the part they must play in the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I come now to censorship.  So far as film censorship is concerned, I do not suppose we will arrive at a more satisfactory solution than has been arrived at in other countries.  It should be made incumbent on exhibitors of films to certify films in the same way as they are certified across the water.  Certain films must be certified as suitable for adults only.  Of course, sometimes such certification acts as a stimulus because people begin to think that there is something in the film which they ought to see.  There are films which are definitely injurious to young people and young people should be prohibited from seeing such films, unless accompanied by an adult.  That system works satisfactorily in England.  Some young people might, of course, find an adult, but we would at least be making an effort to cope with the situation.</P>
    <P>Over the years, film censorship has proved eminently satisfactory.  I have noticed that young audiences invariably applaud the victory of virtue over vice and the triumph of the man of honour over the gangster.  That is a very healthy reaction.  But there are children who are, perhaps, mentally unstable and they resort to crimes of violence as a result of what they see in gangster films.  We should use every safeguard <Col N="131" /> to prevent regrettable happenings.  It is distressing to find from one's reading of the papers that certain crimes are becoming more prevalent.  Stringent steps should be taken to prevent the sale of knives.  Indeed, I do not think even boy scouts should be armed with knives.</P>
    <P>With regard to censorship of publications, anyone who reads <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> must be gratified by the activity of the Board.  They give a good account of themselves in banning undesirable publications.  We have in the country very praiseworthy publications of a high standard.  The Press sets a good headline.  When undesirable publications imported into this country are banned&mdash;sometimes I wonder why those who publish them should think them suitable for export here&mdash;I do not think the ban lasts long enough.  Three months or six months is not sufficient. The penalty should be much more severe.  They should be banned for all time.</P>
    <P>The work of the Adoption Board has expanded.  They are doing excellent work.  A constituent of mine brought one matter to my attention recently in relation to the long and the short certificate.  In the ordinary way, the short certificate is acceptable but in the Department of Social Welfare, for some reason, the longer form is required.  Surely, if the short certificate is suitable, it ought to be appropriate also in regard to the Department of Social Welfare.  Perhaps the Minister would look into the matter to find if there is any good reason why the parents of adopted children should have to go to the trouble of getting the longer form of certificate when applying for children's allowances.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of courts and litigation and the suggestion was made that there should be help for people who are not able themselves to seek justice in the courts.  I agree that perhaps in cases where the State charges a person with an offence which, on conviction, will deprive him of his liberty, or even involves a fine which might be considered severe, it might be unfair to expect a person to stand <Col N="132" /> defenceless in the court without legal assistance.  I know that in certain cases the State does give legal aid.  In the ordinary way, if people feel they can break the law and then invoke the law to get them out of trouble, I could not see any great sense in that.  There is however, something to be said for attempting to lighten the costs in regard to litigation generally.  I know that in certain cases people have the right of appeal to the Minister and that the Minister has always dealt with these cases sympathetically and I am sure that in these cases justice was done and seemed to be done.</P>
    <P>In regard to prisons, I notice that in the Estimate there is a substantial increase for buildings.  I have not got the Board of Works details before me to see what is being provided but I suppose it is some new building.  I should like to know what exactly is involved.  I have had occasion to visit Portlaoise Prison and Limerick Prison and I must say that the standard of the staffs is commendable.  There is nothing but courtesy and consideration for the people committed to their care.  I was impressed by the standard of treatment given to these prisoners. There is a very humane approach these days to the rehabilitation of prisoners and to seeing that particularly the younger ones do not become habitual criminals.  I should like to add my voice to the voices of those who mentioned that that approach should not only be maintained but strengthened.  Anything in the nature of lectures or other activities which might improve the position should be adopted.</P>
    <P>In regard to detention homes for girls, again I have not any knowledge about those in Dublin but I know of their efforts and their good work.  I am very conversant with the work of the Good Shepherd nuns in Limerick city and I should like to plead with the Minister to increase the capitation grant.  Twenty-five shillings a week for the care and maintenance of these girls is inadequate and I would ask the Minister sympathetically to consider increasing the grant because of the admirable work done by these people in attempting to get youth back again on to the right path before <Col N="133" /> they have been tainted by prison experience. If we can keep our young people in such an environment when they are inclined to go off the rails, and if we can get them to adopt the good advice which they get, there is a reasonable chance that these young people who have to be committed for a time will not get into trouble again. The nation owes a debt of gratitude to the people who are running these homes.</P>
    <P>The Ban-Gardaí were mentioned here tonight and doubts were expressed as to whether they justified their existence. To my mind, they have a very useful function and a very useful part to play in Dublin and Cork and in Limerick, to which they are to be extended shortly.  They are particularly suited to deal with certain offences, particularly where women are concerned and where they have to be searched.  I hope nothing will deter the Minister from providing a sufficient number of them to meet this need.</P>
    <P>I should like also to refer to the question of uniforms for the Guards. There has been an advance in that respect and I am sure it has been very much appreciated, but I wonder could we go a little further and ensure that the uniform is the most comfortable that can be provided.  This perhaps is a matter of administration and does not call for the Minister to deal with it, but it would help greatly if the Garda force in regard to conditions of pay, housing and clothing, could feel contented and could feel that the State, which imposes on them the obligation of protecting the citizens, preventing crime or detecting it when it has been committed, was looking after their interests.  I do not think we could ever afford to equate our standards of pay with those in an industrial nation like that across the water where there is a much larger population.  We should give them that which is in keeping with their responsibilities for the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say again that the work of the Department is very important but the efforts which are being made at the present <Col N="134" /> time do not seem to be bearing the fruit which they should and they will not bear fruit without a measure of co-operation from the people generally. In that respect, whatever we can do in regard to lessening juvenile delinquency or crime we should do.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the sale of &ldquo;pep&rdquo; pills and so on.  I do not know how widespread the problem is or whether it is a problem but anything that will remove youth from these influences should be availed of. Another thing which seems to have crept in is the question of juvenile gambling which seems to be leading to the petty larceny of small sums of money for small-time gambling.  Our best hope in that respect is the type of social services to which I referred earlier.  We ought to make available whatever funds the resources of the State will allow to these social bodies in their attempts to channel youth into more healthy occupations.  It is in that way that we can hope that the rising generation will see the fulfilment of the wishes of the Minister and his Department that every citizen will appreciate the rights of others and that nobody will attempt to use his position or his power to commit crime.  There should be public condemnation of crime and public co-operation with the Department of Justice in its suppression.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to refer to the size of the Estimate, in round figures about £6,000,000, which at first seems an impressive figure but when related to a population of three million is a very reasonable insurance against crime. As the Minister's report indicates, we do not suffer much from major crime. A major crime, such as murder, occurs very infrequently in this country.  Generally speaking, the type of crime with which the law has to deal are minor crimes, mostly by juveniles, and petty crimes arising generally from excessive drinking, brawling or personal differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revolution which has taken place quietly over the past 25 or 30 years in the Garda has gone largely unnoticed.  It is only right that we should appreciate the manifold duties <Col N="135" /> which now fall on a Garda officer compared with what the earlier members of the force had to do in their time.  It is no exaggeration to say that as well as being an officer of the law, a Guard of today is very much a civil servant.  He has to carry out a great deal of paper work and is responsible for the collection of statistics for various Departments, apart from the Department of Justice.  By and large, his duties are wider and more responsible than those which fell to be discharged by the earlier members of the force.</P>
    <P>For that reason, it is necessary to recruit young men of the requisite standard of education and intelligence. It is true to say that that is the type of young man who is coming into the Garda Síochána today but we who vote the funds to carry on the Department of Justice should also have regard to the fact that the outlook of the young man of today is far different and far wider in scope from the outlook of the earlier members of the force.  A young recruit to the force today wants to feel that there is a career before him in that force comparable with that, say, in the Army or in many civilian occupations. It is only right to make the entrant to the Garda Síochána feel that he has the same status as persons going into various types of civilian employment or into the Army or the Air Force.</P>
    <P>Some of the difficulties with which the Garda Síochána have to contend, at least in Limerick, are the sort of disturbances that arise from tinkers, of whom unfortunately, we seem to have more than our share in Limerick city.  Another type of nuisance which, I am sorry to say, is becoming worse, if anything, is begging.  I should like to ask the Minister's help in dealing with the problem in Limerick.  These beggars, mainly young people, congregate outside hotels, the post office and other places in Limerick, creating a very bad impression, particularly on tourists coming into the city.  They seem to know the rendezvous of tourists because where there are tourists, you inevitably find beggars.  Many of them <Col N="136" /> are quite young children who certainly could be stopped quickly.  It is no good sending a Guard in uniform to stop this nuisance, because he can be seen a long way off.</P>
    <P>The only way to cope with the problem is by the introduction of a small number of plain clothes Guards.  Probably two or three would be sufficient in a city the size of Limerick.  The problem has reached serious proportions in Limerick and the Minister may have seen references in the Press to it.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to ask for his co-operation in putting it down because it is a continuing and very ugly type of nuisance.</P>
    <P>I should like once again to draw the Minister's attention to the need for new Garda barracks in Limerick.  I understand that steps have been taken to acquire a site but to date nothing concrete has been done in the matter.  As the Minister will know, the main Garda barracks in Limerick is in the busiest street.  It constitutes a major obstruction to the flow of traffic in William Street.  I hope the Minister will be successful in his efforts to get a site and that the existing barracks, a very substantial premises, may become available for commercial or other use.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have referred to the question of legal aid.  Candidly, I do not understand what amount of legal aid is available to persons who cannot afford to be represented professionally in court.  I could not find any heading in the Minister's Estimates, apart from a figure relating to legal and technical aid of £250.  Perhaps the Minister, when replying, would elucidate that matter for my benefit and that of other Deputies.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have referred to the question of prisons.  Generally speaking, the conduct of our prisons can bear comparison with the conduct of prisons anywhere.  A country such as ours should not be content to follow the legislation of other countries in the matter of humane treatment of prisoners but should lead in that regard.  The Minister should not hesitate to introduce any innovation or improvement that will help to put prisoners back on the right road.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> I should like to compliment the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary &mdash;I do not know which is responsible &mdash;for the introduction of the new white jackets on the Garda here on traffic duty in Dublin and the white batons. I do not know what other Deputies think of the innovation but I think it is a very good one.  I hope the Minister will persist in his experiment.  As a motorist, I think the Gardaí in this white jacket are much clearer and are a great help to motorists and pedestrians when they have to cross a street.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister's co-operation in getting sanction for the new traffic bye-laws in Limerick city.  It is a matter of grave urgency that they be put into effect in Limerick.  Like most other urban centres, the traffic problem in Limerick city has become very acute in recent years.  It is absolutely necessary that these new traffic bye-laws should be put into operation as quickly as possible.  The general question of traffic that has become such a problem all over the country is one which requires the active attention of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy referred to the fact that we no longer have the Garda boxing team.  I should like to support the Deputy who spoke.  I do not know whether the Minister could use any influence to have the Garda take up boxing again.  Both inside and outside the country, they were a credit many years ago.  It would be a very encouraging development if we could have them back again practising the noble art of self-defence.  They have distinguished themselves in other spheres of athletics such as rowing.  It would be a very good thing if the Garda were to take up boxing again throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I should also like to support the Deputy who referred to the absolute necessity for the co-operation of the public in preserving law and order. When we come to think of it, the Garda is a very small force, indeed, in comparison with the total population of even this small country.  There is no hope whatever of protecting people's rights, their persons and their property, <Col N="138" /> if the co-operation of the public is not forthcoming.  In recent years, we had some striking examples, particularly in the city of Dublin, of non-cooperation by the public.  I hope that will not be the case generally elsewhere in the country.  Two or three men cannot possibly be expected to control a crowd of 50 or 60 or, perhaps, 100 hooligans when a row of serious proportions starts.  In fact, that is what happened in Dublin and I could say also elsewhere in recent years.</P>
    <P>On the question of juvenile deliquents which has been referred to by every Deputy, I sometimes wonder if the Garda in their efforts to control these young hooligans&mdash;I think that is the proper name for them and not &ldquo;angry young men&rdquo; or any of these other fancy terms by which they have been called from time to time&mdash;are getting the full support of the courts. It is very distressing to read after an outbreak of blackguardism has taken place, in which public property has been seriously damaged, that only a nominal fine has been imposed by the justice.  I think that next to the co-operation of the public, the Garda are entitled to the full support of the judiciary in putting down this type of crime.  It may not be a serious type of crime but it is a growing type of crime.</P>
    <P>In the world in which we live today, young men now apparently think that the right thing to do is to be tough and in some cases completely disregard the rights of people.  That is growing in our country and is largely influenced by young men who have gone out of the country and who have come back with some of these advanced ideas as to what the rights of the people are.  It is no use turning the other cheek.  This will have to be put down strongly and without any question of sympathy towards these young hooligans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Justice is a very important part of our Governmental make-up, it being the Department responsible at all times for the establishment of order and the preservation of order.  In that I want to agree with Deputy Russell and those other Deputies who have asked <Col N="139" /> for greater co-operation from the public with the police when the occasion calls for it.  I do not think that at this stage of our history the excuse can be offered that lack of co-operation by the public can be attributed to what might be called the political hangover from the days that were.  It is time we grew out of that and that people were not alone prepared to learn of their civic responsibility but practise it as occasion demands.</P>
      <P>I remember a case in Dublin where the police had to take drastic action with crowds that were, to say the least of it, tending to become disorderly and in fact did become disorderly.  A question was asked in this House which implied that the Guards had misbehaved themselves in some way and I was quite pleased at the time to see the present Minister for Justice took a firm stand in his reply and, in fact, commended the Garda for their activities on that occasion.</P>
      <P>I should like also to be associated in commending the authorities for the recent pay increases to the Garda.  In fact, the only thing that is wrong&mdash;I suppose it was the best that could be done, having regard to all the circumstances&mdash;is that these increases were not greater, because, as somebody said, the Garda authorities have had loaded on them considerably more work than I think was ever intended and certainly more work than the Garda ever bargained for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the general application of the law and when they are acting as people keeping down crime, both from experience and from what people tell me and from my own knowledge I find that the Garda generally behave with great moderation.  They are extremely courteous. That, of course, is not something that is to be applied solely to the new members of the Garda, although I notice that the Commissioner stresses courtesy to the public at every coming-out parade.  I think the older men, the men who bore the brunt of the work in relation to the establishment and preservation of order here, were also courteous. They also did their business in <Col N="140" /> a tremendously fine way.  I think it is due to them that some tribute should be paid to them.  The majority of them are now retiring from the force.  It should be remembered even on the dim records of this House, which are not readily available to the public, that a tribute was paid to those men who are now retiring or who have gone in the recent past.  In those circumstances, the younger men have a great example to live up to if they are to preserve the standard laid down for them then.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Minister has no notion, so far at any rate, of revising the licensing laws as they exist.  I know, of course, that on an Estimate such as this, it is not really possible to discuss legislation to the same extent as otherwise, but I do think that it would be a good thing to think over the necessity for area exemptions in the interests of tourism and also for a revision of the opening and closing hours on Sunday.</P>
    <P>The building and renovation of Garda stations are not being proceeded with as speedily as they might.  I still hold the view which I expressed here before, that the policeman who moves slowly, either walking or on a bicycle, has much better powers of detection than the people who are now described as mobile or, as popularly known, in the squad car.  It is true the squad car is useful when help is needed but help would be brought sooner and more effectively on the scene if the Guards were more distributed and were able to detect what is going on around them in a more leisurely fashion.</P>
    <P>On the question of juvenile delinquency, all of the blame cannot be attributed to either light sentences in the courts or to the fact that the Guards on occasion might allow certain things to pass, as it were, unnoticed. There would be far fewer juvenile delinquents if there were fewer adult delinquents and all this wave of what has been described by Deputy Russell as hooliganism is really due, to a very great extent, either to the easing or the utter abandonment of parental control.  There is a tendency, <Col N="141" /> not alone in this country but, I suppose all over the world, to give to youth a certain alleged independence at an age earlier than is good for them and certainly at an earlier age than was ever anticipated in the ordinary scope of family life.  There is the old adage: &ldquo;Spare the rod and spoil the child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may be that parents, for some reason not readily ascertainable or not readily understandable, are not able to exercise the same amount of control over their children as they used to exercise.  Some people are inclined to blame the pictures and television. Deputy Russell even went as far as to say that these advanced ideas for youth were imported from other countries.  That is a view to which I would not subscribe at all.  In the sphere of law-breaking and blackguardiasm generally, we in this country do not need to import anything.  We are human beings like people everywhere else; if we do not exercise parental control, things are likely to run amuck and these advanced ideas will operate within a family, with the result that the parents' words of advice or castigation are no longer effective.</P>
    <P>Parents' organisations and, of course, the parents themselves within the individual families have a very grave obligation in this matter of juvenile delinquency.  It is a very fancy name but how do juveniles become delinquents? Certainly there must be a stage at which they become delinquents. I cannot speak for the cities but I can speak for the rural areas. There is not the same degree of co-operation as there was between the parents and the teachers.  There was a time and it is within my memory&mdash; and I hope that is not to be regarded as too long ago&mdash;when parents and teachers co-operated almost 100 per cent., in rural areas at any rate.  When a child got punishment from a teacher, the parent would, first of all, try to understand what the reason for it might be and might speak to the teacher concerned.  The whole matter would be discussed amicably and there was complete co-operation between <Col N="142" /> the teacher and the parent to the ultimate betterment of the child.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, it has become extremely fashionable for people often without reason&mdash;in isolated cases, certainly with good reason&mdash;to take actions against teachers for the assaulting of children.  In very many cases, the insurance company covering the business settles for a small sum rather than have the expensive process of going into court and gets it made a rule of court.  That then comes to be regarded as an award and all of the items in the statement of claim are accepted by the public as proved. This inspires people who otherwise might never take any action to initiate these spurious actions, as indeed many of them are.  In the interests of peace, on the other hand, and the saving of expense, on the other, small awards are made.  That is made a rule of court and gets headlines.  One would imagine from such settlements that, up and down the country, teachers&mdash; particularly primary teachers, because these are the only people who appear to come under the lash&mdash;are maniacs for punishment.  That is not true.  It is only in isolated cases that it arises and it will be found that, whether the reason be good or bad, there is a reason for the teacher acting in that manner.  It might be the wrong reason but it also might be from a good motive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Chair but it is something that should be said.  I might miss the Estimate for Education and might not get an opportunity of saying this.  I do think all of that leads to juvenile delinquency. It causes a rot in the whole course of discipline.  Therefore, the Minister may well be able to cooperate with the Department of Education, and with such parents' organisations as he can, in an effort to destroy the rot at the top, so that the children will not get it into their heads at a very early age that they can join forces with their parents against <Col N="143" /> someone who is actually <i>in loco parentis</i> for the greater part of the day. That is perfectly reasonable and within the compass of the Minister.</P>
      <P>There is very little to be said about the Department otherwise.  Certain things need to be tightened up but, with the resources at our disposal, a very good job indeed is being done.  I should like to conclude by again paying tribute to the Garda, not for their great ability to detect crimes, which is ever present, but for their great tolerance and moderation in pursuing the necessary inquiries. Other speakers have paid great tributes to the Ban-Gharda.  I am sure they are extremely useful but, so far, I have been fortunate enough not to have had any dealings with them, administrative or otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on this Estimate last year, I prefaced my remarks by referring to the unsound practice of selecting the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána from outside the ranks of the Force.  I indicated then that so long as I am a member of this House, and so long as I feel there is need to express disapproval of that practice, I shall continue to express it. I indicated then, as I indicate now, that my remarks are no personal criticism of the present holder of the office or of any of his predecessors who may have been selected from outside the force.</P>
      <P>My criticism of that practice is based upon the view that we have, within the ranks of the Garda, many mature and experienced officers who are well fitted for the post of Commissioner. I believe, in selecting a Commissioner from outside the force, that one does untold damage to the spirit of the force itself, that one creates a spirit of bad feeling between the Commissioner and the regular members, and that one stops certain chances of promotion within the force itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite apparent that in any force, be it an army, Garda, or any other disciplined force, if you select the head from outside the body itself, you stop the succession of promotion within the force, whereas if you select from within such a disciplined body a man of <Col N="144" /> character, experience and ability, and promote him, you thereby create a flow or succession of promotion through the whole force.  I appreciate that it is perhaps only once in a generation that you may appoint a Commissioner of the Garda.  I sincerely hope the present Commissioner has many healthy and active years ahead of him.  As I say, in making these remarks, I intend no criticism of him.  They are a criticism of the principle of selecting a man from outside the force as head of the force.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to find some illustration of this practice outside the country, and the only case I have been able to find is that which obtains in Great Britain.  As I pointed out last year, there is an entirely different set of circumstances in Great Britain.  The British police force is not a unified force such as ours is.  It is a combination of local authority forces and, in such circumstances, it may well be not unwise to select as Commissioner a man who might be better by reason of not having any prior parochial loyalties.</P>
    <P>In Britain also there is the opinion that the head of a Department, of a force, or a Minister of State is better by reason of not having any previous experience in the post and is therefore, able to exercise independent judgment and give decisions without the loyalties and affections which he might have, had he been a member of a force or a disciplined body.  I believe our own history indicates that the Garda is a well disciplined body, and that it has been controlled for many years, fortunately, by men of mature judgment and wide experience, but I believe it is a reflection on the force itself to go outside it to select a person for the office of Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The reason it is necessary to utter these remarks on this Estimate annually is that, in the normal course, when a vacancy arises in that office, the Government of the day make the appointment without referring the matter to the Oireachtas.  The power of appointing the Commissioner lies in the Government of the day.  We know, of course, that the Government of the <Col N="145" /> day are advised by those in the Department of Justice and elsewhere who are in a position to advise them.  It is in order to ensure that these advisers are made aware of the wide concern that exists, both within and without the Garda, that it is vitally necessary to refer to this matter annually, in the hope that when a future appointment has to be made, it will be made from within the Garda force.</P>
    <P>We know there have been a number of resignations from the Garda in recent years, particularly of young men.  There is a certain feeling that the opportunities of promotion are limited.  We know for a physical fact that that is true.  In the early days, members were recruited from a wide field and many of them were men of limited education.  The highest education most of them had was primary school standard.  That is no reflection on them; it is a mere recital of fact. Now, the ordinary &ldquo;flat-foot&rdquo; who patrols his beat may well be a better patrolman by reason of not having any higher education, but in this day and age when there are far more applications for the force than it can absorb, it is the better-educated, more highly qualified and more able man, who succeeds in becoming a member of the Garda.  In many cases, it is the honours Leaving Certificate or Intermediate Certificate students who are recruited and, perhaps, for that reason the Garda force is better.</P>
    <P>Men who have achieved that degree of education, men who have spent many years in acquiring that education, and whose parents have spent money on giving them that education, become frustrated and worried about their future in little or no time.  They find themselves marking time in a force in which their chances of promotion are only one in five or six. That is one of the reasons for the number of resignations from the force in recent years, and I do not think an improvement in pay or conditions will necessarily remedy that position.</P>
    <P>I believe, we have to go further.  I believe the office of Commissioner will, in the long run, affect only one person in each of the various grades <Col N="146" /> in the Garda: the grades of Deputy Commissioner, chief superintendent, superintendent, inspector, sergeant down to Garda.  By choosing the Commissioner from within the force itself, you will help to improve the morale of the whole force.  On that account. I would hope that on no occasion in the future will we seek to choose the Commissioner from outside the force.</P>
    <P>Another argument advanced in favour of selecting the Commissioner from outside the force is that it might be dangerous to select as head of the force a man who has been a policeman all his life&mdash;that we might face a <i>coup d'état</i> by the police force.  I believe that, if anything, we are too conservative here.  It was alleged at one time there was a danger of such a <i>coup d'état.</i>  We all know only too well there was no fear of that.</P>

That is well known to the interjector now and it was well known to his Party at the time, who, for their own reasons, went outside to select a man who, on their own admission and experience today, was a shocking <Col N="147" /> appointment.  They know that only too well.  The one blot upon the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Sir, I am not repeating anything.  I am reciting the history of the force because it was alleged that at one time there was a danger of a <i>coup d'état.</i>  I am emphasising that the cure for an ill which did not exist was far worse than the alleged possibility of an insurrection on the part of an unarmed force.  If General De Gaulle was able to cope with an armed rebellion in Algeria, the Government of the day with its Army behind them were able to cope with an imaginary lack of responsibility on the part of an unarmed police force.  The Deputy knows that only too well.  We are now in the second half of the Twentieth Century.  It is time we respected our Garda as they deserve to be respected.  We should no longer reflect upon them by making any further appointments to the important office of Commissioner from outside the force.</P>
      <P>In the Book of Estimates, we note an increased provision of £7,199 for headquarters' staff.  Since we discussed this Estimate last year, an appointment was made in that Department which, in the last year alone, cost just £5,000. Deputy McGilligan has already referred to it.  One of our leading and more responsible newspapers has seen fit to take to task Deputy McGilligan and myself for criticising that appointment. I am not going to address my remarks now in answer to the leading article in that newspaper but in relation to the appointment itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that my criticism of the appointment is not a criticism of the individual.  I am sorry for the individual himself.  I believe he is a young man of ability who can contribute much to the political and economic development of the country. I am sorry for him that he should have been launched into the governmental sphere through an appointment <Col N="148" /> that is as unnecessary as it is undesirable. All criticism from the Fine Gael benches is focussed upon this office because it is unnecessary and unduly costly, even if it were desirable.</P>
    <P>In addition to his allowance, or salary as it is now to be called because of the Bill introduced by the Government last year, of £1,000 which he earns as a member of this House, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice receives an additional £1,200 a year.  Therefore, his position costs the taxpayers £2,200. Deputy McGilligan quoted Professor Parkinson to illustrate the operation of Parkinson's Law in relation to this unnecessary and undesirable appointment. He pointed out that the creation of this post has apparently created extra work.  He referred to the boasts of extra work on the part of the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government Party in general.  I do not intend to follow that line; there is no need for me to repeat it.</P>
    <P>However, I would repeat that the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice has necessitated the appointment of a private secretary to that individual who last year earned a salary of £1,017.  He had to have somebody else to help him with the unnecessary work.  He had a shorthand typist who earned last year £517.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice had to be allocated a motor car for his use as if it were his private property, and also two chauffeurs who are established members of the Garda.  According to figures obtained from the Minister during the course of the last year, this cost £2,200.  We find that the post, over and above any allowance made to Deputy Haughey as a member of this House, according to the figures we know, cost last year £4,930. In the next year with the ordinary increments to the private secretary, the confidential shorthand typist and the two members of the Garda, the cost will be over £5,000.</P>
    <P>In the whole history of this State, when the very foundations of the State were in danger of being undermined, when our Garda force was <Col N="149" /> much larger than it is today, when there was much greater need for members of the Government to be active in the Department of Justice, there was never need for a post of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice.  Indeed, since the days of the previous Government, one of the responsibilities of that Department has been jettisoned, that is, the responsibility upon the Minister in relation to gun licences.  I believe if we were to go through the Estimates over the years, we would find that many one-time responsibilities of that Department have since been offloaded on to other Departments, but for reasons best known to the Government, in 1960, an appointment of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice was made.</P>
    <P>We have no hesitation in saying that that appointment was unnecessary and undesirable.  We left it to the Government to justify it, if they could.  How do they justify it?  The matter was raised by me within one month of the making of the appointment when I asked the Taoiseach if he would say what duties had been assigned to the Parliamentary Secretary. Unfortunately, I was taken by surprise tonight and I have not got the actual reply before me, but I remember its substance.  We were told that his duties were in relation to establishment matters in the Garda, matters which I say would not occupy at the outside more than three hours per week.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows well, or ought to know, that under the Garda Síochána Act the day-to-day functions and duties and affairs of the Garda are vested in the Commissioner. If the Minister and his Department are interfering in that matter, it is about time they stopped doing it and, if they are, it is contrary to the powers conferred upon the Commissioner and the Minister for Justice by this House.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is interfering in the affairs of the Garda, then he is doing it contrary to an Act of the Oireachtas and it is about time it stopped.  The Minister may say there are certain establishment matters in relation to barracks <Col N="150" /> and other matters that have to be attended to.  We know well they have been attended to by the Department of Justice over the years.  They certainly have not lacked attention because there was not a Parliamentary Secretary to look after them.</P>
    <P>We were told also that the duties of the Parliamentary Secretary related to establishment matters concerning the courts of justice.  Again, we know that the courts of Justice must work independently of the Executive or of the Oireachtas.  In fact, the ordinary day-to-day arrangements of the courts of justice are primarily the concern of the judiciary and of the principal officers in the different court offices.</P>
    <P>There is attached to the headquarters of the Department of Justice for some years an organisation and methods officer who investigates the workings of various court offices and such things.  The establishment officer of the Department of Justice is also concerned with those matters but they are mainly functions which are proper to the administrative side of the Civil Service.  They certainly are not political matters in which it is necessary for either a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary to interfere.</P>
    <P>Lest that was not a sufficient decoy to pretend that there was a necessity for the Parliamentary Secretary, we were told also he is concerned with establishment matters in, of all great institutions, the Public Records Office and the office of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests. Both of these offices are almost insignificant from the headquarters point of view.  The amount of work a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister could possibly bring himself to do in relation to them, even if it were a busy year for work in relation to these insignificant offices, would be one hour a week.</P>
    <P>Therefore, on the answer of the Taoiseach himself, the total amount of man hours the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister could possibly occupy himself with in any one week would not be more than five hours&mdash; and that would be exceedingly generous&mdash;and <Col N="151" /> the Taoiseach and the Minister and his Department know that well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must take the Minister and his colleagues an awful long time to come to a routine decision. These are purely routine matters.  If the Minister has not time to do it, I should like to know what he is spending his time on.  He is occupied far less frequently in this House than the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Education, in fact than almost any Minister you can pick from the Front Bench. I challenge the Minister or any member of the Government Party to look over the debates of this House for the past year.  It will be found that the Minister for Justice had far fewer Parliamentary functions to perform than most of his colleagues on the Front Bench.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána is particularly a matter for the Commissioner.  The courts operate on their own.  The other little petty offices, sub-offices, side-offices, side-shows, could not possibly occupy the Minister for more than a couple of hours a week.</P>

      <P>We are now asked to consider that the Parliamentary Secretary was concerned with the problem of itinerants.  We were given to understand he would live with the tinkers until the problem had been solved. Within a couple of months of that, the hands were washed and a commission was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

In relation to the Minister's interjection, I would say that sometimes records repeat the truth and sometimes the truth and the repetition of the truth become insufferable to those <Col N="152" /> who do not want to hear it.  We had a commission on tinkers.  It is still sitting. I asked in this House a perfectly civil and appropriate question.  Last year, at the expense of the taxpapyer, a special census was held of the tinkers.  I asked what was the result of it.  You would think it had been paid for out of the Secret Service Vote &mdash;I could not be given it; it was a matter for the commission.  The secrecy of it all!  The people of Ireland could not be told the number of itinerants in the country until this wonderful commission had sat, had deliberated and had reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Or until the number was found out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was ever such nonsense repeated in this House?  I do not know what the Minister means by that.  You would think it was a nation-wide census of the population.  It does not take any more than six months to enumerate the 2,750,000 of other people in the country.</P>
      <P>On the Estimate for the Department of Justice for years back, you will find Deputies complaining about the inactivity of the Department in relation to the itinerants problem.  I believe that commission was appointed so as to silence the justifiable criticism that arose from all quarters concerning the itinerants problem and the inactivity of the Department of Justice and of local authorities in relation to the problem. Those of us who are vehement and forthright in our criticism of the manner in which itinerants behave are sometimes compared with an Eichmann or a Hitler, the insinuation being that we would like to put them all into concentration camps.  That is the type of cheap argument which gets us nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in liberty of the individual. I believe that the liberty of the individual is the liberty of any individual to do what he likes so long as he does not restrict the liberty of other people to enjoy the happiness to which they are entitled.  We know for a fact that itinerants do not respect the rights of other people.  They do not respect the rights of private property or of people <Col N="153" /> to peace in their own homes.  We know it to be a constant occurrence for itinerants to call at the homes of people in the country and in the cities looking for charity.  If it is not given to them to the extent to which they want it they threaten the people and the threats are frequently succeeded by actual interference with private property and by actual violence.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the ordinary difficulties of the Garda in facing this problem. They have not the co-operation which they ought to have got from local authorities but still they have not done their share.  I asked a number of questions over the past year about the number of pounds in Dublin city into which wandering horses, which in the main belong to itinerants, could be put. There was a sneer from that great officer of the Government, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice, when I asked a question last October as to when a pound would be provided on the south side of Dublin. I was told that one had been provided. Unfortunately, the general public were not aware of this.  When I looked into the matter, I discovered there is a small pound in Churchtown which is supposed to cater for all the wandering animals, horses, and so on, belonging to itinerants on the south side of Dublin and, indeed, for a portion of the north side.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows for a fact, or he ought to know if his Garda officers have reported complaints to him, that most of the itinerants' encampments in Dublin are to be found on Corporation estates, in places which have been reserved for what Acts of the Oireachtas call the housing of the working classes.</P>
    <P>The people of Mount Merrion, too, were pestered for a long time but the tinkers have now gone out to my area&mdash;to Drimnagh, Crumlin, Inchicore. In these areas there are many decent people trying to keep houses and gardens tidy and neat.  There are people who, after long hours of work, have to cycle home at night.  They find their gardens ruined by wandering horses; many of them are put in danger of their lives, cycling on dark <Col N="154" /> roads obstructed by wandering horses. They are even molested on their own doorsteps by these tinkers.  Any vacant plots in the area are ruined by filthy refuse.</P>
    <P>I got in touch with the local superintendent of the Garda only to be told that it was the responsibility of the local authority.  I got in touch with the local authority, who referred me to the superintendent of the Garda. The buck is being passed even more quickly than ever, since this commission was established.  The excuse is now being given that it is a very difficult problem, that it cannot be solved overnight.  That is purely a Pontius Pilate attitude and the Minister knows that very well.  A situation should not be tolerated in which anyone, be he an itinerant or a private individual, is permitted to interfere with the liberty and the lawful rights of other people.</P>
    <P>I am told that in Cork itinerant encampments are not permitted inside the confines of the city.  Prosecutions are brought in respect of each day an encampment is found inside the city boundary, but here in Dublin you cannot get anyone to accept responsibility. You cannot get any authority to take prosecutions and the result is that it is permissible for anyone to occupy a plot of land and to stay there for a fairly lengthy period until the local residents become so infuriated that they take the law into their own hands.  It is only when people set about physically removing the tinkers that the Garda step in to stop a breach of the peace.  Sooner or later there will be some serious violence done and the blame for it will lie on the Minister, the local authorities and the Garda.</P>
    <P>It so happens that within a few months of his appointment to solve this problem of the tinkers, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice was relieved of this onerous duty.  An excuse then had to be found to continue an appointment which the Taoiseach said at the time was only a temporary arrangement. I ask members of the Government Party to look back on the Taoiseach's reply to me in May of 1960.  He said <Col N="155" /> the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary to this Department was only a temporary arrangement while urgent law reform work was being done.  He said there would be no necessity to make it a permanent appointment.  A year later I asked him when the appointment would be terminated.  We accepted at the time that it was to be only a temporary arrangement and I now charge the Taoiseach with saying that it would be temporary when he knew that it would not be.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach had never any intention of dismissing the Parliamentary Secretary as soon as the temporary work the Department had to do was terminated.  I strongly deplore that the head of an Irish Government should have tried to get out of an embarrassing situation by pretending it was purely a temporary appointment.  He hoped then that we would let the matter drop.  Well, we have not let the matter drop.  Our criticism now is as it was then&mdash;that there was never a need for the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice and nothing the Government or Government spokesmen have said in the meantime has convinced people who know anything about it that there was a necessity at any time for such an appointment.</P>
    <P>The matters mentioned as justifying the appointment would take only a few hours a week.  The Parliamentary Secretary went to a Fianna Fáil meeting and delivered a learned address about the need for law reform, but one of the significant things about it is that it could take the Department two years to prepare a White Paper to justify this urgent need for law reform to such an extent that it required a Parliamentary Secretary as a permanent assistant to the Minister for Justice.  Not so very long ago, it was said we should not carp and criticise because the Minister for Justice needed a lawyer to help him with the law reform Bills because the Minister in the last Government had the assistance of many lawyers, including the <Col N="156" /> Taoiseach and the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I have as much respect as anybody for the Minister, both as an individual and because of the service he has rendered the State, but if it be that the peculiar needs of the Department of Justice are such that a layman like the Minister is unable to cope with them, the Taoiseach has power to re-arrange his Cabinet so as to provide for the appointment of a lawyer to the office of Minister for Justice.  It is not for me to suggest how he should reorganise his Government but it is open to him to do so.  That would have been the proper course for him to have taken.</P>
    <P>It is not without significance&mdash;and I do not intend any disrespect&mdash;that a non-practising barrister such as the Parliamentary Secretary is eligible for jury service.  The reason is that a non-practising barrister is presumed not to know the law.  I repeat I am not saying that as a criticism of the Parliamentary Secretary's ability, but it is significant that the law presumes that such a person as the Parliamentary Secretary does not know the law.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that the law reform measures introduced here in recent months were on the stocks from the days of the last Government.  The former Attorney General, Deputy McGilligan, has clearly indicated that, as have several members of the previous Government.  Some of the Bills which have since become Acts had, in fact, been in their formative stages in the Department of Justice for years past.  They were not even inaugurated and set on foot during the last Costello Government but as far back as 1948 and 1949.  Should anybody care to look at the statute book, he will find that the major law reforms were carried out in the days of the John A. Costello Governments because the irrefutable facts are that the law reform now being put through the Oireachtas was in its embryo stage years ago because of the interest the then Taoiseach and the then Attorney General took in the matter.</P>

      <P>At Question Time today, the Minister for Health was asked by Deputy O.J. Flanagan when work will commence on the reconstruction and improvement of the county home at Mountmellick and what is the cause of the delay.  The Minister read out, as his reply, from a document which I assume was prepared for him.  He said in his reply:</P>
      <P>The scheme for the reconstruction and improvement of the county home in Mountmellick is a major undertaking involving heavy capital expenditure.  It provides <i>inter alia</i> for the internal reconstruction and renovation of the existing old workhouse buildings, additional accommodation for patients including a new infirmary block, central heating and improved sanitary accommodation.</P>
      <P>His reply goes on:</P>
      <P>By reason of the nature and scope of the scheme, formulation of the local authority's planning proposals and their detailed examination in my Department have necessarily taken some time but I am glad to say that planning is now in its final stage and that the local authority should be in a position in the near future to invite tenders for the carrying out of the approved works.</P>
      <P>I describe that reply as nothing but utter rubbish.  Further, I want to say that the Minister had the most astounding audacity to come to the House to read out such rubbish.</P>
      <P>He says that this is a major undertaking involving heavy capital expenditure. I accept that it is.  I want the House to ask itself this question: How much more will this work cost when it is done eventually than it would have cost had it been done when I ordered it to be done in 1957? The increase in cost which is necessarily involved is the result of the decision which I shall refer to in a few minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> The Minister's reply goes on to say that &ldquo;by reason of the nature and scope of the scheme, formulation of the local authority's planning proposals and their detailed examination in my Department have necessarily taken some time.&rdquo;  I am sure they did, but I was there as Minister for Health to watch the time that was consumed and I assert here that the planning by the local authority was completed and approved by the Department in 1956. My then advisers, whose advice is still available to the Minister, advised me that I could authorise the local authority&mdash;as I did&mdash;in 1956 to proceed, as a matter of urgency, with this work.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on in his reply to say:</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that planning is now in its final stage and that the local authority should be in a position in the near future to invite tenders for the carrying-out of the approved works.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what happened to the instruction I gave as Minister for Health to the Laois health authority some five years ago to proceed with the construction of the county home in Mountmellick.  What dead hand lay upon that work?  Why was my instruction countermanded and on what basis does the Minister now, five years later, come into the House which he assumes knows nothing about it, to say blandly that the local authority should be in a position in the near future to proceed with that work?  I should like to assert that the reconstruction of Mountmellick County Home should have been completed certainly by 1958 and it would have been completed, had not the Government changed in 1957 and the present Government come into office.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the work should not proceed.  The money was there, earmarked and carefully put aside for this and other proposals.  The Minister chided me at Question Time today that in order to finance this and other schemes, I had mortgaged the Hospitals Trust Fund.  If the Minister chooses to use those terms to describe the policy I initiated, I am quite <Col N="159" /> willing to accept them.  I assert to the House that after careful consideration, after availing of the advice which was available to me in 1956, I drew up a new hospital programme consisting of certain matters which I regarded as having urgency throughout the country. I decided that the programme would be financed on the basis that the Hospitals Trust Fund would continue and that in the three, four, or five years that programme would need for completion, the income into the fund would continue at not less than something around £1½ million a year.</P>
    <P>I cannot be exact about the figures as I am talking merely from recollection. The programme I drew was drawn up on the basis of that faith and I should like to know from the Minister whether the faith I expressed in 1956 was ill-founded? Is it correct to say that nothing has happened since to make my estimate and that of my advisers appear in the slightest degree inaccurate. Certainly the income of the Hospitals Trust Fund over the years since has in fact exceeded the estimate upon which this programme was based. The result has been that into the Hospitals Trust Fund each year since the Minister assumed office has gone at least £2 million.  It has not been spent as it should have been on building hospitals for poor, old people, providing the people of Mountmellick with the necessary sanitary services and new infirmary blocks which they urgently needed five years ago.  It has not been put to projects of that kind; instead, it has been invested in stocks and shares by the Minister for Health and it has in itself been earning income.</P>
    <P>That may be prudent finance; it may be the kind of conservative approach the Minister believes in; but I have little doubt that the people outside the House will agree that it has been very bad from the point of view of the country.  All the hospital programme that was available&mdash;it was on the Minister's desk when he succeeded me&mdash;has been scrapped from beginning to end.  No worthwhile project has continued or gone into operation and most of our county homes that were in <Col N="160" /> an appalling condition when I visited them&mdash;as I did in many cases as Minister&mdash;remain in the same condition. Poor, old people in the county home in Mountmellick have continued to suffer under conditions which are primitive in the extreme.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the ledger, because of the kind of mentality displayed by the Minister in the decision he took, we know what has happened in the building trade and other trades in the last four or five years.  It is because of that mentality that some 30,000 to 40,000 of our people have emigrated each year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is anxious to get away from Mountmellick. I shall bring him back to Mountmellick.  It is because of the policy enshrined in the Minister's decision in relation to Mountmellick that emigration has climbed to the heights it has over the last four or five years. Even in Mountmellick&mdash;the Minister is anxious I should get back to it&mdash; over the last four or five years 500 working people have emigrated.</P>
      <P>I do not want it to be suggested that I was anxious to reconstruct the county home in Mountmellick merely to provide employment.  I should be glad though, if in doing some socially necessary work, employment would be created.  I have little doubt that, if this scheme had proceeded as I had given directions that it should proceed, emigration from that small town would not have been so high as it has proved to be in the last four or five years.</P>
      <P>It is possible that on occasions a Minister may read a reply to a question that he would not read, perhaps, had he studied the matter.  Whoever gave that paper to the Minister for Health just had not read the file.  That is bad enough, but for the Minister to seek to present it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully agree and any such reference is unreservedly withdrawn.  I may attack only the Minister here.  I am quite content to do so.  The Minister gave this reply to the House.  I must assume, under the rules of the House, that the Minister read the file.  Assuming that, I can only describe the Minister's reply here as dissimilar from what the reply would have been had there been a proper reading of the file in relation to Mountmellick County Home.  For the Minister to come in here and expressly state that the local authority's planning proposals and their detailed examination in his Department had taken some time is not in accordance with fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well appreciate that any Minister for Health, or any other Minister for that matter, who desires to delay a local authority project, might easily do so through the recognised channels, by indulging in the recognised gimmicks, but, in relation to this particular project, everything had been cleared.  The detail had been gone through.  The green light had been given to the local authority before the Minister took office.  If the case were that the building scheme, which I sanctioned, had been scrapped because it <Col N="162" /> was found inadequate or unsuitable, I could understand then a contrary decision.  But if that were the position, I should expect the Minister to state publicly it was the position in reply to a question here.  There has been no such suggestion.  It is apparently the same scheme, the scheme which was examined in detail when I was Minister for Health, the scheme which I sanctioned.  The local authority were told that the money was available to enable the scheme to be carried out. That is the scheme my successor stopped when he became Minister for Health and I cannot understand why he did not come in here and admit that the scheme was there, saying that he decided to postpone it, to change it, or to alter it.  Had he done that, I should have said he was entitled to his view. I cannot understand his coming in here, talking about delays in planning, and all the rest of it; these are reasons which, like the flowers in Spring, have nothing to do with the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what prompted Deputy O'Higgins to raise this matter on the Adjournment because it is one which does not do him very much credit.  The Deputy has referred to the fact that he directed that the Mountmellick scheme should proceed.  When? Sketch plans for that proposal had been received in the Department in August, 1956.  Nothing was done about them, though the Department was then under the control of Deputy O'Higgins as Minister for Health. The sketch plans were not even looked at.  Why?  Because a directive had issued from his colleague, the Minister for Finance, that no more expenditure was to be incurred from the Local Loans Fund, through which the reconstruction of the county home would have to be financed.  In fact, the directive was that no more than £700,000 would be available from the Local Loans Fund for any health project in the years 1956, 1957 and 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that in February, 1957, the Deputy, as Minister for Health, issued to his officials a direction that the Mountmellick scheme was to be proceeded with.  When did <Col N="163" /> he do that?  Why did he do it?  He did it when the general election of 1957 was in course.  Having regard to the statements which he has made here this evening, I feel now that he did it merely as an election stunt.  It was one of 34 schemes that had been included in a programme, a programme which had been put to one side, shelved in fact.</P>
    <P>The only scheme of the whole 34 about which Deputy O'Higgins, then in the last stages of his term of office as Minister for Health, was concerned was the Mountmellick scheme.  We have heard a great deal about the fact that he was anxious to provide employment, anxious about the aged poor, very anxious that they should be succoured in their infirmity, but were there old people only in the constituency of Laois-Offaly?  Were there no other county homes in equally urgent need of reconstruction as well as Mountmellick?</P>

      <P>Let us see what the situation was.  I have told how the Hospitals Trust Fund was mortgaged up to the hilt, so mortgaged that in fact almost before the race was run the proceeds of the Grand National, 1957, had already been hypothecated.  When they were paid out in April, 1957, there was not a penny left in the fund. What was the consequence of that? Any person who takes a bus ride to Dún Laoghaire from Dublin will see a standing memorial to the financial policy of my predecessor; he will see in part of the rusting superstructure of St. Vincent's Hospital a monument to my predecessor's policy, in the rusting <Col N="164" /> re-inforcement for a building which was begun by him but which, because he left no funds, has not been built; but for which I have been able to find money, so that the hospital is now going ahead.</P>

      <P>Allow me to come back to Mountmellick.  The point is this: as I said, sketch plans were received in the Department in August 1956.  Nothing was done about those sketch plans for the very good reason that an estoppel had been put on all hospital construction by the Minister for Finance.  That is well known.  The parlous condition of the Government finances at that time is public knowledge. In due course when money became available in the Local Loans Fund in January, 1959, I directed that one of the first projects that should proceed was the reconstruction of the Mountmellick County Home.  I directed that in January, 1959.  We received working drawings for engineering and other services in 1960, but <Col N="168" /> it was only in February of this year that the structural drawings came in. We are hoping that the home will go to tender some time in August or September of this year.  It has only been possible to proceed with the reconstruction of the home because of the fact that the finances of the State have now been put in order and the Minister for Finance is prepared to sanction loans from the Local Loans Fund for the construction of this and other projects which, as I have said, are now going ahead, with this very important condition that those who are responsible for initiating the building of these projects will have the certainty that the money will be there to finance them until they are completed.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 10th May, 1960.</P>

      <P>I am aware of only four occasions during the past ten years on which helicopters were in action to assist in rescue work in Irish territorial areas.  The helicopters were all based in Derry.  On 2nd March, 1956, ten men who had already safely disembarked from a British motor vessel which had run aground on Roaninish Island, following failure of her engine, were taken from the island to Portnoo by two helicopters.  On 22nd October, 1960, a helicopters assisted in removing the crew from a Greek cargo ship, which had run aground on a reef north of Innishtrahull lighthouse, to a British frigate.  According to reports, 44 men were removed by the ship's lifeboats and the Portrush lifeboat and 15 by helicopter.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Department of Health that on two occasions, one in 1956 and one in 1958, a patient was removed from Tory Island to Derry by helicopter.  Both of these cases were arranged privately and I have no knowledge of the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not appear to be aware that a greatly expanded service of forecasts for shipping <Col N="24" /> and fishermen was introduced on 1st January, 1961 and is broadcast three times daily from Radio Éireann instead of the previous once daily service.  The broadcasts include statements of the meteorological situation and detailed forecasts for Irish coastal waters up to 30 nautical miles offshore and for the open waters of the Irish sea.  The forecasts relate to the following 24 hours and, in addition, a further outlook is given.  Gale warnings for the Irish coastal waters and for the Irish Sea are also issued as necessary by the Meteorological Service and are broadcast by Radio Éireann as soon as possible after issue.  Warnings which are still valid are repeated before each reading of a weather forecast.</P>
      <P>The expanded service of broadcasts is specially designed to meet representations which had been made by the interests concerned and I have no information which would indicate that the new service does not adequately provide the weather information required for fishing and coastal vessels in the waters around the Irish coasts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power what consideration has been given to the possibility of extending the limits within which Irish coasting (home trade) masters' and mates' certificates are valid for use, so as to enable Irish coastal shipping to compete more favourably with Dutch and other coasters that can trade on certain conditions to the Mediterranean and to West Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish vessels plying outside normal home trade limits, i.e. between the Elbe in the North and Brest in the South are required by law to carry a Master and at least one mate duly certificated for foreign voyages, together with duly certificated engineers where appropriate.  I am, however, empowered by statute to grant exemption from compliance with any of these requirements, but only where I am satisfied that the alternative arrangements proposed are as effective as, or more effective than, <Col N="25" /> actual compliance.  In pursuance of this power I have already granted certain general exemptions which, in effect, permit Irish home trade vessels, subject to certain conditions, to ply within wider home trade limits than Brest and the Elbe.  In addition, I am prepared to consider individual applications for exemption from full requirements for foreign-going voyages outside these limits as extended but the over-riding consideration in dealing with all such applications must remain the safety of the vessel and her crew. I am advised that a general extension of the validity of home trade certificates, as suggested by the Deputy, could not be justified on safety grounds.</P>
      <P>Any exact comparison in these matters between ourselves and other countries who have different legal systems in regard to manning, certificates of competency and related matters is very difficult, if not impossible, but I have no reason to believe that vessels of such countries are, in general, subjected to less stringent safety provisions than are our own.</P>
